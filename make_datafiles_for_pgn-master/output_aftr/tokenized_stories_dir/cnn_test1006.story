-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Too weak to stand or walk , William M. LaFever sat in a shallow river bed in the south Utah desert , awaiting rescue that came more than a month after his family last heard from him .

`` We came around the corner and we were pretty amazed to see him alive and sitting up , '' Shane Oldfield , a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter pilot assisting the Garfield County Sheriff 's Office , told CNN Friday .

LaFever was hospitalized Friday in St. George , Utah , in stable condition . Family members told a deputy that he has autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder , said Becki Bronson , a spokeswoman for the sheriff 's office .

`` He did n't want me to come out there , '' said LaFever 's father , John LaFever . `` He wanted me to send him some money to get him to Page . ''

The elder LaFever said he was n't sure how William would make it all the way to Page , but his son mentioned following the river .

Within a week of his call home , William got a ride to where Highway 12 crosses the river , and set out on his journey .

The younger LaFever apparently did not know the extent of the rigors he would face when he planned to walk nearly 50 miles in the Escalante Desert to Lake Powell and then obtain a boat ride , officials said .

Garfield County Deputy Ray Gardner accompanied Oldfield on the flight and told him he had learned in recent training that people with autism often are drawn to water .

`` I think he probably hiked as far as he could until he was physically exhausted and he went into survival mode , '' the pilot said .

All he had were his pants , shoes , underwear , shirt and a lighter .

He used the lighter to set a small fire at night , officials said , and then would roll into the river to stay cool and drink water .

LaFever weakly waved when Gardner and Oldfield spotted him from the air .

Gardner , praised by LaFever 's family for his work on the case , did not immediately return a message left Friday by CNN .

William LaFever was in an area popular with hikers , but was about 30 miles beyond where most venture , Oldfield said .

`` He made the mistake ` I know what I am doing and I will be OK , ' '' Bronson told CNN . `` There are many who have done that and paid the price . ''

John LaFever said his son `` has done a lot of camping but he has always been close enough to where he could walk to people and get a grocery store . It has never been at this capacity . ''

William LaFever , who is on disability , will be hospitalized indefinitely as he regains his strength .

`` I am just overwhelmed , '' said his father . `` I was really hoping he was alive . The chances of him being found alive were one in a million , maybe . ''
