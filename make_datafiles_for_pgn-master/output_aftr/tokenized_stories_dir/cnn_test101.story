-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sergio Aguero earned Manchester City a long-awaited title in the final seconds of last season , and his manager hopes that Sunday 's stunning effort against Liverpool means the 2012-13 Premier League crown is still a possibility .

Aguero netted his ninth league goal this season with a superb piece of skill , beating Pepe Reina to a throughball and then chipping a delightful shot over the goalkeeper from out wide on the right .

`` Two games and the championship is reopened . I do n't think this is finished but probably now we have to win all the games but if not then 11 or 12 games .

`` Last year we recovered eight points in six games so I do n't know why it ca n't happen this year . We have 15 games and United have to play in FA Cup and the Champions League so the season is long -- three months -- and we are confident . ''

Dzeko was also involved in Liverpool 's equalizer , as new signing Daniel Sturridge scored his fourth goal in six games despite an apparent foul by teammate Daniel Agger on the City striker .

`` The referee said to play on -- he said not to kick the ball out , '' Sturridge revealed .

Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard put his side head with a stunning volley in the 73rd minute , but Aguero -- whose injury-time goal against Queens Park Rangers in May ended City 's 44-year wait for a league title -- embarrassed Reina soon after to leave the visitors in seventh place .

However , it was marred by an ankle injury to striker Jermain Defoe , who will miss England 's prestige midweek friendly against Brazil .

Ninth-placed West Brom had Goran Popov sent off for spitting just after halftime .

`` The game changed with the sending-off . I 'm absolutely disgusted with Goran 's behavior , '' said his manager Steve Clarke .
