-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just moments after Mitt Romney triumphantly introduced Congressman Paul Ryan to American voters on the deck of the battleship USS Wisconsin , I happened to witness a heart-wrenching event on the tarmac of an airport hundreds of miles away : The casket of a fallen service member was returning home to his family in Florida .

The selection of Ryan as Romney 's running mate has heated the spotlight on the economy , on the huge and growing national debt , and on the large number of Americans who , years after the start of recession , remain unemployed . Sensing Obama 's vulnerability , Romney and Ryan would like to keep the focus there . But international conflicts have a way of intruding on the best agendas of American statesmen and political strategists .

President George W. Bush did not expect 9/11 -LRB- crazy conspiracy theories aside -RRB- , just as Obama had no idea that the Arab uprisings would transform a key region of the world and test his skill in a series of conflicts , some of which confronted America 's values against its alliances .

We do know that whoever sits in the Oval Office will face tough decisions on Iran and Syria , two problematic countries that are likely to demand attention at or near the top of the foreign policy rundown . And , we know that when the next presidential term starts , as many as 68,000 U.S. service members may remain in Afghanistan .

Ryan , who has no foreign policy experience and has spoken little of it , outlined the dilemma facing the U.S. when he spoke about the Arab uprisings . `` We are seeing long-repressed populations giving voice to a fundamental desire for liberty , '' he said approvingly , but then he worried about the possibility that the end of one dictatorship would open the way for another .

Regarding Afghanistan , the war in which Americans are serving and dying , Romney and Obama have , incredibly , largely avoided the topic . Despite vague criticisms , Romney is on record supporting Obama 's plan to remove American forces .

Romney once , a little bafflingly , declared that Russia is America 's main foe . In reality , whoever wins the election will need Russia 's cooperation on the global stage to counter vital and urgent problems .

On Iran , arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for America , both Romney and Obama have stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons . Both have said `` all options '' remain on the table to prevent that from happening , including a military strike .

And despite criticism of Obama 's approach to Israel , Romney agrees with Obama that Israel is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of U.S. foreign policy .

Romney and Ryan may ultimately speak more forcefully in public settings about the Middle East -- and that is easier to do when you do n't yet hold power -- but the fact is that Obama has earned high praise from many Israeli hawks . And if you look closely at Romney 's proposals for Iran , what he calls for is more economic sanctions .

When Romney took his recent overseas trip , his objective was to highlight differences with Obama . He drew criticism when he called Jerusalem Israel 's capital , but that 's exactly what Obama said when he was running for office . Obama went even further , saying `` Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided . ''

The two campaigns have differences in some areas , particularly regarding the future Pentagon budget , which Obama would cut by $ 500 billion in 10 years . Romney would spend more to expand the Navy , part of a strategy that looks at China as an upcoming rival . That China `` pivot , '' by the way , is shared with the Obama administration .

But overall , America 's foreign policy choices , based on national interest , national values , strategic considerations and popular opinion , will not significantly change regardless of whether Obama or Romney wins the presidential election .
