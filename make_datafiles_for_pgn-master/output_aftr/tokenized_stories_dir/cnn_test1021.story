Menlo Park , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Monday , Reed Hastings , CEO of Netflix , posted on Netflix 's blog that the popular online movie rental service would not be breaking off its DVD-by-mail business from its online streaming business . This was Netflix 's third major announcement relating to changes in pricing and service offering in four months .

Like BlackBerry and Bank of America , both of which have recently borne the wrath of disappointed customers , Netflix has been subject to tremendous criticism over the past few months . -LRB- Full disclosure : I consulted for Netflix for about two years between 2003 and 2005 . -RRB-

The announcement was seen as an attempt to raise the price by 60 % without offering additional value , and customer response was fast and negative . Since then , Netflix has been attacked from all sides for poor communication , poor product strategy and poor pricing decisions . Indeed , its communication has been poor : first with the July announcement , because it was misleading , and then with the September and October announcements , because they focused on responding to the wrong problem , thinking customers were angry because they did n't know which of the two new options to choose . In fact , customers were angry because they were being forced to choose or to pay more .

Hastings knows that he needs to transition his subscribers from old media -LRB- DVDs -RRB- to new -LRB- streaming -RRB- and has been methodically preparing for this transition for several years . The problem came in the timing and the messaging of the transition , not in the transition itself .

In subscription-based businesses , it is nearly impossible to raise the price for a service without dramatically improving the offering . Since the initial July announcement , Netflix has inked favorable streaming deals with several major studios , including Dreamworks , Epix -LRB- Lionsgate , MGM and Paramount -RRB- , Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel -- a fact Hastings referred to in his most recent blog post . Had Netflix been able to time the price increase with the announcement of significant new streaming content , consumers might have accepted the change .

Despite my personal annoyance at the price hike and the inconsistent messages , I continue to respect Netflix and its brave CEO for their -LRB- multiple -RRB- public apologies , their speed in developing a new service -LRB- Qwikster -RRB- and their speed in canceling Qwikster when they saw the negative response . Hastings `` failed fast '' and then adjusted and adjusted again , which can be painful . His willingness to move forward , even in the face of public criticism , is all too rare among public company CEOs .
