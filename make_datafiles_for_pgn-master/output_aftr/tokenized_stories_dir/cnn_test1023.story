PORT ALLEN , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sixteen-year-old Tanya Simon is trying to keep spirits up inside the hall that has become home to families fleeing Hurricane Gustav .

Tanya Simon , 16 , said she sometimes feels scared in the Port Allen , Louisiana , shelter .

`` You 're not at home in a place like this . You look around , and you do n't know the background of the people looking at you , '' she said , adding that she felt a little scared .

The community center smells , and there are n't enough cots for the 80 or so people seeking shelter there in Port Allen , Louisiana , just across the Mississippi from Baton Rouge .

Tanya Simon is one of 18 members of her extended family who piled into a truck borrowed from a friend to get out before the storm hit .

Her cousin Detrice Simon , 15 , sits on a Superman sleeping bag , wrapped in a Spider-Man blanket , occasionally reaching out to grab and quiet one of her three nephews .

`` We thought everybody was going to die , '' he recalled .

Now , American Red Cross staff members and volunteers are making sure the evacuees are getting three meals a day and snacks too , but it seems to be only temporary comfort .

`` We 're so far from home ; we have no money ; we have no food . The money is running out . I 'm not even sure if we have any left , '' said Deandra Simon , Detrice 's sister .

Just getting out of New Orleans took a big bite out of their resources when they stopped at a gas station , the 22-year-old motel housekeeper said .

`` Watching how expensive it got , the more we filled up the tank , I got ta tell you , that scared me . ''

Cappuchi has mostly dealt with people crying and having panic attacks .

`` We have learned a lot from Katrina , but in these shelters , we are going to have chaos . There 's always chaos . ''

Outside , Douglas Patterson , 54 , and his friend James McDaniel , 42 , played dominoes with two National Guardsmen as the winds began howling .

Watching the game , Chester Reeder also kept one eye on his children as they played hide-and-seek behind two steel water tanks in the old one-room gymnasium .

They had spent 11 hours on the road , forced to detour through Mississippi to get to Baton Rouge .

Just the cost of gas was bad enough on a welder 's budget , but Reeder plans to stay in New Orleans no matter how many storms hit .

But he wonders whether his city has the strength to keep standing .

`` That man keeps giving us warnings in the form of hurricanes . ''
