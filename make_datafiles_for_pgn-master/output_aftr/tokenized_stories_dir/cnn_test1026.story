He added : `` I think we should do everything in our power to stay in the EU , and that means inevitably some kind of compromise . ''

Diageo posted a 5 % rise in sales growth for the second half of last year , despite a decline in European sales . Southern Europe was particularly hard hit , suffering a 19 % fall in sales as the financial crisis continued to bite .

`` Europe continues to become a smaller piece of the overall pie , '' said Walsh , who is focusing on faster growth markets , such as Latin America , Africa and Asia .

`` We have to do a far better job in educating our population on the imperative of staying in Europe , '' said Walsh . `` I do n't believe that task should just be left to the politicians , business too have to stand up . ''

Diageo wo n't be putting any pro-Europe stickers on their bottles ; Walsh believes the educating should start within the business itself .

`` We need to engage first and foremost with our employees , '' Walsh said . He added the company should `` explain to them that many of these brands enjoy their place in the global marketplace because of free trade agreements that are configured via Europe . ''
