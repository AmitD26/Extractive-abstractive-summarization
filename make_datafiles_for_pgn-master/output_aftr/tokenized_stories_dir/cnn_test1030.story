-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the moment she steps onto the stage , lighting up the concert hall with her radiant smile and striking flowing dress , to the very last notes of her energy-filled show , which finds everyone at their feet , it 's easy to see why Fatoumata Diawara feels right at home while performing .

Indeed , under the stage lights of Yoshi 's in San Francisco , Diawara 's Malian influence and personal charisma shine through .

Guitar on hand , she sings effortlessly in a warm , wavering voice but she can as easily break into powerful vocal solos and high-pitched ululations ; as the evening progresses , she takes the audience into a journey of rhythms and emotions . With boundless energy , she strides across the stage , her braided hair swirling around frenziedly as she dances with abandon .

First passion

At the age of nine , Diawara was sent to live with her actress aunt to the Malian capital Bamako . One day , while she was on the set of one of her aunt 's films , the director asked the young Diawara to play a small role .

The part was only a few lines , but the exposure would lead to much larger roles . In 2001 , she starred as the title character in `` Sia , Le Reve Du Python , '' a highly successful film that boosted Diawara 's reputation in Mali -- to this day many people in the West African country refer to her as Sia -- and also attracted interest from abroad .

Shortly after the release of the film , Jean-Louis Courcoult , director of famous French theater company Royal de Luxe , traveled to Mali to offer Diawara a part in a new production .

Going against tradition , Diawara took the bold decision to flee Mali and pursue her dream . After making all the necessary preparations in secrecy , she managed to slip out of her aunt 's house and catch a flight to Europe .

New life , new career

Once in France , Diawara became a member of Royal de Luxe , traveling around the world for more than six years . Her new career also afforded her many other opportunities , including invitations to record songs with Malian musicians in Paris .

`` I said , ` OK my voice can be a good way to express who I am ; what is my story ; where I come from , ' '' says Diawara , who released her first album , `` Fatou , '' in 2011 . In the critically-acclaimed album , she explores familiar subjects , including women 's issues and arranged marriages .

`` They wanted to give me to a man/but I refused as I did n't love him/I want to choose a man for myself/who I love , '' Diawara can be heard singing in `` Bissa , '' echoing her personal experience .

Giving back

Once she left Mali , Diawara never looked back . That was until last year , when a crisis threatened to destroy the country 's rich music heritage .
