NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I like it when I 'm right , especially about naked men . Especially about naked cowboys .

When I wrote in April that the lawsuit filed by Robert Burck `` may be the end of the era of the `` naked '' cowboy and predicted he would be able to afford some `` very nice duds , '' my fellow lawyers laughed at me .

On the first page of his decision , the judge pasted photos of the litigating parties side by side and wrote , `` This is the case of The Naked Cowboy versus The Blue M&M . ''

And what a case it is . Burck sued Mars in April for $ 6 million in federal court in New York . The central allegation : trademark infringement under the Lanham Act , arising from a video billboard for M&M s.

Most people , and maybe Mars , thought the Cowboy was just a kooky street entertainer dressed in his underwear . However , I 've spoken to Mr. Cowboy , I mean , Mr. Burke , and he did n't seem kooky to me at all . In fact , he seemed kinda smart .

Even Judge Chin recognized that The Naked Cowboy is no ordinary street entertainer . Although he performs in New York City 's Times Square in little more than underwear and a smile , he has registered trademarks to `` The Naked Cowboy '' name and likeness .

And he does n't just sing in Times Square . He has a Web site http://www.nakedcowboy.com/ with his modeling photos and has a link to nakedcowboy.tv . You can download his music on iTunes . You can buy his tighty whities from his online store for $ 15 . He even has a podcast .

Although imitation is supposed to be the sincerest form of flattery , Judge Chin did n't agree with M&M 's parody argument . Rather , Judge Chin thought it was a question for a jury to decide and wrote that the complaint `` plausibly argues that consumers would believe that the M&M Cowboy characters were promoting a product rather than merely parodying The Naked Cowboy , and that viewers would believe that The Naked Cowboy had endorsed M&M s. ''

That Judge Chin makes me laugh . Round One to the Cowboy . Larry , maybe you should start walking around the office in your tighty whities .
