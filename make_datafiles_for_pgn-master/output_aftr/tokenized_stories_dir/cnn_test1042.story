-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the day that Gareth Bale commanded headlines by joining Real Madrid in a big-money move , Lionel Messi made news by scoring a hat-trick for Barcelona in a 3-2 win against Valencia .

Messi 's treble was his 23rd in the league for Barcelona and handed the away side a 3-0 advantage within 41 minutes at the Mestalla .

Barcelona then had to hang on at times after Helder Postiga netted a brace just before halftime . The home side also had a pair of penalty appeals waved away by the referee .

`` We could have ended with a 3-3 , 2-3 or 2-5 , '' Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino told the club website . `` Regardless of what could have happened I would leave here very pleased with how the team played . We found what we were looking for . ''

Cesc Fabregas set up Messi 's first two goals after good work from holding midfielder Sergio Busquets , and summer signing Neymar linked up with the Argentine on the third .

Several hours before Bale 's deal was announced , Madrid defeated Athletic Bilbao 3-1 .

Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal -- Messi has five -- with a header from Angel di Maria 's perfect cross .

But it was 21-year-old Spanish international Isco and Bale 's former teammate at Tottenham , Luka Modric , who earned praise from Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti .

`` He was fantastic , '' Ancelotti told Madrid 's website , referring to Modric .

Only one team in the Bundesliga remains unbeaten through four games -- and it 's Borussia Dortmund .

Mkhitaryan scored his first two goals for Dortmund after his $ 35 million transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk .

`` We have to play better football , there 's no question , '' Klopp was quoted as saying by AP . `` I 've seen a few weaknesses in our build-up play and ideally we need to defend better . Still , with 12 points after four games , this is complaining at a high level . ''

Defending champion Bayern Munich trails Dortmund by two points .
