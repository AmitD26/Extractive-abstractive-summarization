-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Annie Leibovitz on Monday defended her provocative photograph for Vanity Fair magazine of teen heartthrob Miley Cyrus -- aka Hannah Montana -- who has expressed embarrassment about the pose .

`` My goal in my music and my acting is always to make people happy , '' Cyrus said in a written statement . `` For Vanity Fair , I was so honored and thrilled to work with Annie .

`` I appreciate all the support of my fans and hope they understand that along the way I am going to make mistakes and I am not perfect .

Vanity Fair spokeswoman Beth Kseniak also defended the pictures , which are posted on the magazine 's Web site and are being published in the June issue .

But the publicist for Cyrus said her parents departed at the end of the day , prior to the pictures being taken and did not see any digital pictures .

Cyrus stars as an ordinary teenager with a double life as a rock star on the Disney Channel 's `` Hannah Montana . '' The channel says `` Hannah Montana '' is the top-rated cable television show for children ages 6 to 14 , reaching more than 164 million viewers around the world .

The magazine refers to the `` topless but demure portrait '' as Leibovitz 's idea and quotes Cyrus as saying , `` It was n't in a skanky way . ... And you ca n't say no to Annie . She 's so cute . She gets this puppy dog look and you 're like , ` O.K. ' ''

A Disney Channel spokesman , Patti McTeague , said in a statement released Sunday that the photos were meant to sell magazines .

`` Unfortunately , as the article suggests , a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines , '' she said .

The incident underscores the polarities that exist in society about how to view sexuality among girls -- repress it or exploit it , said Gigi Durham , author of `` The Lolita Effect . ''

`` I have certain qualms about exploiting girls ' sexuality in this way , '' she said . `` She 's young and ought to be able to explore her sexual self without a commercial emphasis being put on it . ''

That is not to say that nudity or sex is bad , she said . Even teens ought to be able to express themselves sexually , she added . But , `` within the commercial context , it becomes sexuality for profit , which is an entirely different issue . ''

Cyrus completed a 70-date tour this year that sold out venues nationwide , starred in a movie that ranked number one in February and saw two albums rocket toward the top of the charts .
