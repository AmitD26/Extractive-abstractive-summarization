-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A white Mississippi man has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2011 murder of an African-American man , with the judge calling it an inexcusable , `` despicable '' crime .

`` I wish I could take it all back , '' he said , adding , `` I was young and dumb , ignorant and full of hatred . I chose to go down the wrong path . ''

Dedmon is also expected to plead guilty to still-undisclosed federal charges Thursday , three sources with knowledge of the case told CNN -- the first indication that a federal case was pending in Anderson 's death . Officials would disclose no details , but Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith said he expected other charges -- and other arrests .

Smith has said the evidence indicated the suspects , who ranged in age from 17 to 19 , `` went out with the intention to harm and , in this case , kill a black man . '' According to investigators , they drove 16 miles in two vehicles from Rankin County to Jackson , where after exiting the highway , they found Anderson alone in a parking lot about 4 a.m. on June 26 .

The white men allegedly beat Anderson repeatedly , yelling racial epithets . After the beating , Dedmon drove his Ford F-250 truck over him , leaving him to die , according to what some of the teens cooperating with police have told authorities .

Anderson 's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb .

Murder suspect carried ` backpack of hatred '

On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN , the group pulls into the parking lot and stops where Anderson is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible .

The young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson . Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson 's beating took place , as the white youths yelled racial epithets , including `` white power . ''

Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground , although this is not visible on the tape . After the beating , some of the white youths left , and others got into the green Ford truck .

At this moment , Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walked toward the truck .

Shortly afterward , Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing , according to statements some of the teens made to detectives . `` I ran that nigger over , '' he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the youths in the other car .

`` He was not remorseful , '' Smith said . `` He was laughing , laughing about the killing . ''

But during a bail hearing last year , Dedmon 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the `` racial allegations . ''

Anderson 's family had asked state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty against Dedmon or any other youths who might be charged in the case , saying they oppose capital punishment in part because of their religious faith . The family also filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white youths who were present at the beating of Anderson . The Southern Poverty Law Center , a nationally recognized organization in Montgomery , Alabama , that opposes racism and intolerance , joined in the lawsuit to help the case , joining forces with the family 's attorney , Winston J. Thompson III .

`` James Anderson lost his life for no other reason than the color of his skin , '' said Morris Dees , chief trial counsel for the law center . `` Those responsible must be held accountable for their callous and deadly actions . We are filing this lawsuit today to ensure his family gets a measure of justice . ''

Anderson , a line worker at a Nissan plant , sang in his church choir , Thompson said . He is survived by his partner of 17 years .

`` He was just a pillar of the community , '' Thompson said . `` He paid his taxes on time ; he went to work , came home -- he was just an average , ordinary citizen , good guy , wonderful gardener . ''
