In his place comes the 32-year-old Massa , surplus to requirements at Ferrari after the signing of Kimi Raikkonen , but with a wealth of Grand Prix experience .

He will partner Finland 's Valtteri Bottas as Williams looks to revive its flagging fortunes .

Massa , runner up to Lewis Hamilton in the 2008 title race , has 11 wins and 36 podium finishes in his F1 career , but has had to play second fiddle to Fernando Alonso at Ferrari in recent seasons .

Bottas impressed Williams with his performance to put their car third on the grid after qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal this season , but he was unable to capitalize in the race .

Maldonado , who gave Williams a surprise victory in last season 's Spanish Grand Prix , has been unable to build on that promise and it is unclear if he will secure a seat with another team in 2014 .

`` We wish him well for the future , '' said Williams , who has signed Massa and Bottas to multi-year contracts .

His team last won the constructors ' title -- the last of nine -- back in 1997 , with Jacques Villeneuve claiming the drivers ' crown .

Meanwhile , Raikkonen will miss the final two races of this season due to a long-term back problem that requires surgery .

His Lotus team may promote third driver Davide Valsecchi , according to the F1 website , or give reserve Jerome d'Ambrosio a runout in the GPs in Austin and Sao Paulo .
