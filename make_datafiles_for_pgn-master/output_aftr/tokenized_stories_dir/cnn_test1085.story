Because of the security forces ' stance , it was n't immediately clear when the emergency rules -- which include curfews intended to limit public gatherings after deadly clashes in August -- would truly be canceled .

The emergency was ordered in August , during a period of intense unrest after the July coup that ousted President Mohamed Morsy . Clashes flared in August when security forces broke up huge Cairo sit-ins led by Morsy supporters ; hundreds died , and thousands were injured .

The administrative court announced Tuesday that the state of emergency would be lifted in the afternoon , two days earlier than expected , the state-run Middle East News Agency reported .

But Tuesday night , the military said on Facebook that the nighttime curfews would continue until the court officially notified it of its order .

The military ousted Morsy on July 3 and installed an interim government , saying Morsy was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values . Morsy supporters , including the Muslim Brotherhood , have said the coup was an illegal power grab by the military and elements of the regime of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak .

Morsy is awaiting trial on allegations that he ordered supporters to attack protesters in December , while he still was in power .

Morsy became the country 's first democratically elected president in June 2012 , more than a year after protests prompted Mubarak , who ruled Egypt for three decades with the military 's support , to step down .
