Giglio , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The nautical blue paint spelling out `` Costa Concordia '' has almost all bubbled and chipped off the bow of the once luxurious cruise liner after 20 months under salt water off the Italian island of Giglio .

The seabed is still littered with sun deck chairs that floated from the ship 's balconies and upper deck when it finally came to a rest in January 2012 . Fish swim around the sunbed legs and seaweed has grown through some of the mesh seating . The beds are spread out in a surreal scene that looks like a set from an underwater science fiction film . Shoes , mattresses , dinner plates and thousands of pieces of cutlery shimmer in the divers ' lights on a bed of sea grass .

INTERACTIVE : How the 952-foot wreck will be raised

Divers have not been deep inside the massive ship for nearly a year . The salvage divers only work on the outside of the ship and do not have authority to enter the vessel , with the exception of a work area they have created with a false floor on the upper port side deck , unless accompanied by Coast Guard divers .

Not only is the Concordia still chock full of passengers ' possessions the Costa Cruises company hopes to return , but the ship is still considered a crime scene . Thirty-two people died in the accident and the ship 's erstwhile captain , Francesco Schettino , is facing charges of multiple manslaughter and causing the shipwreck after piloting the 290-meter ship into the rocks on Giglio last year .

In the weeks after the accident , the divers called the inside of the ship a `` toxic stew '' of spilled oil , rotting food and floating tableware . There were five massive restaurants on the ship -- each one in operation when the ship crashed at 9:42 p.m. on January 13 , 2013 , spilling tables of buffet food into the water . More than a dozen kitchens and freezers had enough food to feed the 4,200 passengers and crew for a week , plus extra supplies that all cruise ships carry in case of emergencies and delays . Many of the freezers burst and their contents were gobbled up by sea life and the colony of sea gulls that has multiplied on the island since the disaster .

Fishermen off Giglio say that the fish have changed , too . They are much larger and harder to catch after gorging on the ship 's offerings . The freezers that have not burst under the water pressure are still locked with their rotting thawed contents sealed inside . Fridges too , filled with milk , cheese , eggs and vegetables , have been closed tight since the disaster . One has to only imagine leaving a home freezer -- a fraction of the size of the industrial freezers used by cruise ships -- unplugged for 20 months to get an idea of the type of rancid mess trapped inside .

Senior cabin service director Manrico Giampedroni , one of the last survivors to be pulled out of the wreckage alive , became trapped half submerged in the ship 's dining room when his leg got caught among fallen furniture . He survived for 36 hours on floating food and stayed awake by drinking caffeinated beverages until rescuers found him . If he had fallen asleep , he would have drowned . Incidentally , Giampedroni was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a plea bargain for his role in the deaths for not being at his duty station to help evacuate the ship .

In addition to the general rule of thumb that you do n't blow up ships where there are still unrecovered victims , one of the main reasons the Concordia is being refloated rather than blown up or dismantled on site is because of the toxins and personal effects still trapped in the ship 's 1,500 staterooms . The ship 's engines are still thick with lubricants and the kitchens are still filled with cooking oils and non-soluble materials that would pollute the sea .

Nick Sloane , the head of the salvage operation for Titan Micoperi , the joint American-Italian venture to rescue the Concordia , , says that if explosives were used , the ship 's smaller contents would become dangerous projectiles . `` Mattresses and passports would scatter the sea , '' he says . But the real danger would be flying cutlery , cooking knives , bottles and broken glass .

If the `` parbuckling '' goes well and the giant 114,000-ton vessel is tipped upright sometime in the next week , much more than the 65 percent of the ship that is under water now will be submerged . The platforms that will provide a base on which the Concordia will rest are some 30 meters below the sea level , meaning many of the staterooms that were dry until now will sink underwater . Some of the toxic water will be displaced and pushed out of the upper cabins . Some freezers that are still sealed could burst under new water pressure . And almost every window on the ship 's outer cabins is expected to break as the ship 's frame twists .

There will never be the scale of environmental disaster that was already averted by removing the ship 's 2,400 tons of fuel shortly after the ship crashed , but there are still major risks involved with salvaging the Concordia . If the parbuckling fails and the ship breaks apart as it is rotated , the rotten contents -- moldy mattresses , passports , toxic stew and all -- will spill into the once-pristine sea . And even if it succeeds , this part of the Mediterranean will never be quite the same again .
