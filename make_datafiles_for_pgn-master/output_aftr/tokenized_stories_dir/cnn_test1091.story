WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The attempt by the U.S. Navy to use an anti-missile missile to shoot down a potentially hazardous satellite will cost between $ 40 million and $ 60 million , Pentagon officials told CNN on Friday .

The missile alone costs almost $ 10 million , Lt. Gen. Carter Ham said at a Pentagon briefing . He declined to give an overall cost estimate .

The missile will carry no warhead ; the objective is to break the satellite apart through the force of impact alone , defense officials said . Learn more about the mission ''

One Pentagon official -- who spoke on condition of anonymity because the planning for the operation remains classified -- told CNN that since early January , a Navy team , including 200 industry experts and scientists , has been working furiously to modify its sea-based Aegis missile defense system so it can shoot down a satellite in low orbit .

No attempt will be made to shoot down the satellite until after the U.S. space shuttle lands next Wednesday .

`` They want the period of a day or two to assess the effect of the first missile ... to probably get an orbit or two , to get an understanding of what effect the first intercept had on the satellite before launching another interceptor , '' Ham said .

The Aegis cruiser USS Lake Erie was chosen for the mission . It 's fully equipped with sea-based missile defense systems , has long been the Navy 's primary ship for the sea-based missile defense program and has the technology needed for the operation , officials said .

It will be accompanied by two destroyers -- the USS Decatur and the USS Russell -- at an undisclosed location in the Pacific Ocean north of the equator . The Decatur will feed trajectory information to the Erie , and the Russell will back up the Decatur .

Defense officials say the ships ' radars and software were modified to track targets much faster than the ballistic missiles they were designed to track .

The Navy will use its $ 9.5 million Standard Missile 3 in the shoot-down . The combined speed of the missile and satellite at impact is expected to be about 22,000 miles per hour .

The government started thinking about how to approach the satellite problem in December . And on January 4 , President Bush and various senior officials agreed to begin planning for the shoot-down .

On Tuesday , the president approved the plan . E-mail to a friend
