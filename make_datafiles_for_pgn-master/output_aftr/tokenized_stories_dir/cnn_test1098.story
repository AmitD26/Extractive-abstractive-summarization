-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- So Yeon Ryu was seven years old when she gave her first violin recital . She was in love with music , but at age 12 she had to make a tough decision .

`` I started playing golf in elementary school . One day my golf coach took the team to a golf course and I fell in love with it . I loved walking the course and being out in nature , '' recalls Ryu , now 22 .

She started to notice several professional golfers , like fellow South Korean Grace Park . `` She was fashionable , powerful and beautiful , '' Ryu says .

The moment of truth

`` It was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make . I always wanted to become violinist , '' Ryu acknowledges .

By that time , she already had a role model : a girl who played on the elite U.S.-based LPGA Tour , and who , at age 20 , became the first South Korean to claim a major title : Se Ri Pak .

`` But , this is not only her influence , we must be thankful to Grace Park , and Mi-Hyun Kim and other first generation Korean players on the LPGA . ''

As a junior golfer , she had some trouble with her swing but her shots were good enough . `` My swing tempo was consistently well and I think I got my good tempo from music , '' she says .

In 2006 , at age 16 , Ryu represented South Korea in the Asian Games in Qatar and won gold in the individual and team events .

She won her first tournament as a KLPGA member , triumphing by four strokes at the Sports Seoul Open in April 2008 .

After a shaky opening round that put her six strokes off the pace , Ryu shot 69 on Friday and Saturday to share the lead going into the final day .

The tournament ended in a showdown between Ryu and her rival Hee Kyung Seo -- who had beaten her to the KLPGA player of the year award two years earlier .

This time it was Ryu who prevailed . She forced a playoff with a birdie on the last regulation green before , after three extra holes , becoming just the fifth South Korean to win the major .

Ryu emulated her hero Pak -- who 13 years earlier became the first Korean to win it -- and , along with the winner 's check of $ 585,000 , it prompted her to make the next big step in her career .

`` I transferred from the KLPGA to the LPGA and people started to recognize me , '' she says . `` I moved to the U.S. and I am now based in California . That was a pretty big change , relocating to another country . ''

A keen student

That work ethic goes some way to explaining the success of Korean women golfers and Ryu is now hoping that she can inspire new generations of young players like Pak and Kim did for her .

`` I 'd love to be someone 's role model . I want to share my experience and heart , '' says the golfer , who finished second behind compatriot and close friend Inbee Park at this season 's opening major , the Kraft-Nabisco Championship in April , .

`` I would like to donate to poor people or junior golfers . I really want to support young golfers , not as an instructor but as a manager . ''

The best decision

Ryu 's determination at age 12 has led her to become one of the best players in women 's golf ; she currently sits fifth in the Rolex world rankings , just behind Choi , while Park is No. 1 after also winning this month 's LPGA Championship .

Last weekend the two friends battled for victory at the NW Arkansas Championship event , with Park beating Ryu in a playoff to claim her fifth win this season .

`` Inbee and I practice together a lot so when we are standing at the 18th hole , it feels like just a practice round , '' Ryu told reporters . `` I was n't really nervous . Two players can not be champion , so she deserved it . ''

Ryu was named 2012 's LPGA Rookie of the Year , having won the 11th title of her pro career by a massive seven shots at the Jamie Farr Toldeo Classic .
