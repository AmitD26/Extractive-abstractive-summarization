Stepfather Ian Rigby said Drummer Lee Rigby was a `` precious gift '' who had always wanted to serve in the army and was a devoted family man .

Her husband had been due to travel home to see her and their 2-year-old son this weekend , she said .

Soldier was a machine gunner , Royal Palaces drummer , father

A note signed by two army cadets , reads : `` I understand the great lengths you would have gone to to protect our British people . It 's a huge disappointment to hear the way people have treated you in your own country . ''

One bouquet , propped in a pair of black army boots , had a message that read : `` RIP Brave Soldier . Dream sweet dreams . Remembered always and never forgotten . Our thoughts with you and your family . ''

One elderly man , using a cane , had tears in his eyes as he walked , shaking his head , up and down the flowers for half an hour . He removed his hat , looked to the heavens and made the sign of the cross .

Another woman , loudly sobbing , asked police officers standing by the growing array of tributes : `` Why did this happen , why did this happen here ? My children go to the school just there . ''

A man sharply dressed in a suit and tie brought his toddler son to drop off flowers , each placing their blooms next to the army boots . The father reached down to hug his son , tears filling his eyes .

One note referred to both a quote by the late Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi and comments made by one of the attackers , saying : `` An eye for an eye makes the world go blind . ''

Outpouring of support for charity for vets

Since the brutal slaying , the outpouring of support for a charity that supports Britain 's wounded military veterans , Help for Heroes , has been so great that its website has crashed .

`` This sudden surge of interest in the work we 're doing to help the wounded and their families has taken us completely by surprise , '' the charity said , noting that some were buying hoodies and T-shirts like the one Rigby had on .

`` We just want to help , and all funds we receive will be used to provide direct , practical support to those affected by their service to our country . ''

3 men arrested in connection to slaying

There 's been no indication that Rigby knew the men who attacked him with meat cleavers Wednesday afternoon .

One of the two , who approached a man filming the gory scene in the Woolwich neighborhood , suggested that Rigby had been targeted only `` because Muslims are dying daily '' at the hands of British troops like him . Britain 's armed forces have served in Iraq and Afghanistan . All its combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .

`` We must fight them as they fight us . An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , '' he said in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN .

Friends , acquaintances and British media have identified that man as 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo , a British national of Nigerian descent .

Adebolajo and the 22-year-old suspect also tied directly to the attack are now hospitalized under guard after a confrontation with police in which they were shot . A 29-year-old man arrested Thursday is being on suspicion of conspiracy to murder .

Two women arrested Thursday , ages 29 and 31 , have been released without being charged , police said Friday .

British Muslim radical leader Anjem Choudary told CNN on Thursday that he knew Adebolajo , noting the suspect attended demonstrations and a few lectures organized by Choudary 's group Al-Muhajiroun .

In fact , an ITN video from April 2007 shows Adebolajo standing behind Choudary at a rally protesting the arrest of men who allegedly made inflammatory speeches inside a mosque .

Syrian cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed , who founded Al-Muhajiroun in the late 1990s , told CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank by phone from Tripoli , Lebanon , he also had been acquainted with Adebolajo .

Bakri Mohammed used to live in the United Kingdom but was barred from returning after the 2005 terror attacks .

Bakri Mohammed said Adebolajo , who he knew by his Muslim name `` Mujahid , '' attended several talks he gave in London from 2003 to 2004 and was at his side at a number of Al-Muhajiroun protests against the war in Iraq around that time .

One talk Adebolajo attended was at a Woolwich community center , he said , noting the group met in such locations because they were not welcomed in mosques . The very large majority of British Muslims reject Bakri Mohammed 's views .

The radical cleric said that although they did not have many interactions , Adebolajo stood out because he was a new convert to the religion .

Volley of shots

One of the attackers rushes at the police vehicle brandishing knives while the other aims a gun . Both are brought down by a volley of shots .

An additional 1,200 police are now on London 's streets to reassure the public , police said Thursday . Extra security is in place for military personnel and sites .

Violent reactions ?

The Woolwich bloodshed spurred concerns not only about violence by Islamic extremists , but also about attacks targeting Muslims by people angered by Rigby 's killing .

Members of the far-right English Defence League clashed with police late Wednesday , with a tweet from its official account touting that `` it 's fair to say that finally the country is waking up ! :--RRB- NO SURRENDER ! ''

Political and social commentator Mohammed Ansar appealed for `` a sense of calm -LRB- and -RRB- perspective '' after what he called `` a really , really heinous act of , I would say , criminality , ... not terrorism . ''

`` We -LRB- urge -RRB- our fellow citizens not to be taken in the mindless rantings of the -LRB- few -RRB- extra extremists in our midst , '' they said . `` We , the British people , are not so easily fooled ; nor are we so easily divided . ''
