-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian officials said Sunday that the Middle Eastern nation will create a court focusing on `` media crimes , '' according to state-run media reports , a move that has fueled fears Tehran is further intensifying its crackdown on journalists .

`` For certain reasons , such as great developments in mass media , the Tehran prosecutor felt the need to create a more independent court to deal with media affairs , '' Zagholi said .

`` The fear is that the media ... will be watched more intensely than in the past , '' said Memarian . `` They will have more money , more judges and more people to focus on the media and target journalists . ''

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists , 34 journalists were detained at the end of last year in Iran -- tying it with China for the most imprisoned journalists of any country . They include Mohammad Davari , editor of the news website Saham News , who landed behind bars after reporting on detainees who were raped and tortured in Kahrizak Detention Center .

Memarian said that , in the present system , journalists can not publicize any information -- especially if it could be construed as critical -- unless it is from a government source or ran on a state-sponsored media outlet first . He himself was editor of a publication in Iran from 2003 through 2005 , the same year that he won Human Rights Watch 's Human Rights Defender Award .

`` You can not criticize government policies ... If somebody says something inappropriate , you can not report that , '' said Memarian , whose work has appeared on the website Huffington Post , in the Los Angeles Times and elsewhere . `` The government has an official narrative -LRB- and -RRB- no one can challenge that . ''

Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi , Tehran 's chief prosecutor , said `` cultural and media crimes '' will be addressed exclusively in the new court `` so that they can be dealt with by specialists , '' according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency .

`` The intention is not to replace the country 's cultural organizations with this court , '' Dolatabadi said .

`` It is now much easier for people to connect with each other and , therefore , certain new crimes are being committed that can not be overlooked , '' he added , according to a translation of his remarks from Khabar .

But while publicly praising the Egyptian revolution , the Iranian government has rounded up activists after Iran 's two leading opposition figures called for a rally Monday in support of the uprising in Egypt .

On Saturday , Iranian authorities had blocked key internet searches in an apparent effort to obstruct access to sites touting the rally , according to an opposition website and two Tehran residents .

Iranian authorities on Wednesday warned against any attempt by the opposition movement to hold a rally . Revolutionary Guard Cmdr. Hossein Hamedani told the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency , `` We definitely see them as enemies of the revolution and spies , and we will confront them with force . ''

The White House says such threats to stifle dissent and mass communication suggest that Iran 's government is not willing to let its people voice their views and embrace freedom .

He said independent journalists still exist within Iran , even after a massive crackdown following popular unrest after the 2009 elections . Their accounts may become important if , as he predicts , opposition forces find renewed strength and voice their views publicly in the coming days .
