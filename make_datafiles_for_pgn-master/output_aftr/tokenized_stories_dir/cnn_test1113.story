London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violent extremist attacks , of the kind that claimed the life of Drummer Lee Rigby in May 2013 , do not come out of thin air . Rather they are often the end product of a radicalization process in which extremist recruiters target impressionable young people with poisonous , pernicious and , more worryingly , appealing hate narratives .

Central to understanding why some young British Muslims are susceptible to Islamist - inspired hate narratives in the first place is the issue of identity . Growing up in Britain during the 1980s and 90s , as the authors of this piece did , was fraught with challenges for many from ethnic minority backgrounds . One would experience an acute sense of dual-marginalisation from a very early age , and this feeling would be exacerbated by daily experiences .

In this troubling and delicate context a number of Islamist organizations emerged and began to offer a radical alternative . Taking advantage of the identity crisis that many young Muslims were suffering from , they presented Islam as a revolutionary political doctrine and being Muslim as a political , as well as religious , identity . They also focused their efforts away from the mosques , preferring to target educational institutions , as well as other ungoverned spaces such as the internet . This was because the strand of theo-politics they sought to promote was alien to the traditional religious establishments in the UK .

This new identity also recalibrated one 's sense of loyalty . Since one was now a Muslim only , with other nationalist identities being rejected , one 's loyalty lay with fellow Muslims . This exclusive loyalty was also accompanied by a sense of mission and purpose .

Conflict zones around the world that involved Muslims were re-construed as front lines of a global war between Islam and Western capitalism . There was no sitting on the fence in this battle . Muslim men in particular were encouraged to see themselves as warriors who had a duty to protect the lives and dignity of Muslims around the world , who were suffering as a direct result of western aggression and policies .

It is this narrative , which has taken root in the UK for reasons outlined above , that inspired the killers of Lee Rigby to do what they did . In fact , Michael Adebolago articulated it very effectively during the trial , which he used as an opportunity to spout standard extremist propaganda . He described himself as a soldier , as did the ringleader of 7/7 , Muhammad Siddique Khan , and highlighted the actions of British troops in Afghanistan .

The fact that the killers of Lee Rigby were converts to Islam , who had adopted the narrative from charismatic street preachers , illustrates that vulnerable people from a variety of different backgrounds can be seduced by the global Islamist narrative . A sense of victimhood and alienation needs to be present , as well as a strong anti-establishment sentiment . It , therefore , comes as no surprise that those with previous gang connections who exist at the margins of society are often targets of recruiters .

Perpetual political instability in the Middle East , North Africa and South Asia also continues to provide recruiters with material to exploit and construe through a dogmatic political prism . In the meantime , the outreach potential of social media allows recruiters to target a much wider audience than ever before .

Without an effective response that is cognisant of the psychology of the average recruit , and approach taken by the average recruiter , the efforts of extremists will continue unabated . This response needs to brave and prepared to venture into ungoverned spaces , such as the internet . We need to take the fight to extremists by challenging and deconstructing narratives of hate and division as well as offering new models which can be used to recalibrate political thought .
