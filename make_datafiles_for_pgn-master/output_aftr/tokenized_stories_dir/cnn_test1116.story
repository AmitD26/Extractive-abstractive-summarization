`` You personally turned Brooklyn into the hottest spot creatively and politically and you move out , '' Errol Louis , a Brooklyn resident and political anchor at CNN affiliate NY1 News , said Thursday . `` What did you think was going to happen ? You got rich selling this place . This is your brand and people who have a little money want to sort of take you up on it , and somehow that 's a problem . ''

The famed director 's lengthy tirade on the Dickensian ills of gentrification during an African-American History Month lecture Tuesday has drawn mixed reactions from various sectors of a rapidly changing city .

`` You ca n't just come in the neighborhood like you 're Columbus and kill off the Native Americans , '' Lee told his audience after a Brooklyn resident raised the subject of the `` other side '' of gentrification .

Lee bought a five-story townhouse in Fort Greene -- where the director grew up -- for $ 650,000 in 1990 , according to published reports . Lee sold the place in 1999 to a banker married to an attorney for about $ 1 million and moved to his Upper East Side mansion .

`` He 's like a one-man marketing organization and he 's brilliant at it , '' Louis , who has lived in Brooklyn for three decades , told CNN .

On Wednesday , Lee told `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' that he 's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly African-American .

`` My problem is that when you move into a neighborhood , have some respect for the history , for the culture , '' Lee said .

For example , many renovated sections of now trendy Williamsburg , Brooklyn , were vacant industrial spaces . Abandoned buildings in Harlem have been turned into attractive apartment houses .

D.K. Smith , the Brooklyn homeowner and tech start-up director who asked the question that triggered Lee 's tirade , on Thursday said that he looks forward to possibly partnering with the filmmaker to keep the gentrification debate going .

`` People are concerned about the issue of affordable housing , '' he said . `` Where are people going to go ? Spike made the point , ` I do n't want to live in a city where every house is a $ 1 million or $ 3 million . ' First of all , it 's not going to be much of a city . We 're going to lose the part of the city that makes it vibrant . ''
