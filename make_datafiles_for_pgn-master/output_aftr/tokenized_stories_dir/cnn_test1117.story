-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A revolution squeezed into its margins -- but that 's where it started .

It is February 11 , 2014 . Three years ago today , I walked to Tahrir Square to celebrate the fall of a dictator . In that square , we felt everything was possible , after Mubarak 's 30-year rule . It 's that feeling a recent film , `` The Square '' tried to capture . I resisted watching this Oscar-nominated film for weeks . I was in Egypt for many of the events it portrayed , and I knew I 'd be emotionally riven if the film were even partially accurate . Indeed , it was painful to watch a film that captured so many of the core emotions of the past three years , and did it so well .

The film did not portray my own memories : it mediated the emotional history of the revolution through the subjective experiences of certain key characters . They were all archetypes of the revolution . I wondered -- would the filmmakers do what so many writers on Egypt have done , and go for the easy way out , focusing on spoiled rich kids , playing revolutionary ? They did n't -- the first revolutionary character , Ahmad , is hardly rich -- he 's a young , middle class , average Egyptian . Another central character is Magdy -- a loyal member of the Muslim Brotherhood , the political Islamist group . Ahmad has struggled economically his whole short life -- Magdy has spent time imprisoned for his political beliefs .

There was naivetÃ © -- the naivetÃ © of the revolutionaries to understand where their power was , and where it was n't . On the second anniversary of the uprising , I was near Tahrir Square trying to convince some activists that , actually , they 'd lost the public 's support for protests some time before . The protest , for too many of them , had become the strategy itself , as opposed to a tactic for a better-defined goal . Considering the film 's partiality to the ideals of revolution , I was pleasantly surprised to see the idealism of one of the characters , Egyptian-Briton Khalid , challenged , more than once . Ahmad shows an innocent unwariness about the June 30 protests against then-President Mohamed Morsy : the film would have benefited from showing a counter to his exceedingly ill-placed confidence that the military of 2013 would be more restrained than the military of 2011 .

There was pain . There was the killing of largely Christian protesters at Maspero by the military in late 2011 -- a tragedy the film crew witnessed , and which turned a sizeable number against the military . There have now been more than a dozen `` mass protester killings , '' as the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights put it -- and no acknowledgement or justice for them . The single worst incident was the clearing of the pro-Morsy sit-in -- a scene insufficiently covered in the film , though mentioned .

The film is not the story of every Egyptian , or even every revolutionary . It 's a mediation of the revolutionary experience through these specific characters . The film is a story of the relationships of these individual characters with the revolution , and with each other . Even though this is a deeply political film , political parties are rarely shown . Central , nevertheless , to the film 's development , is the persona of Magdy , a loyal Brotherhood member . He humanizes ordinary Brotherhood members , and of all the central characters , we know Magdy as the most tortured , who suffered the most under Mubarak 's regime .
