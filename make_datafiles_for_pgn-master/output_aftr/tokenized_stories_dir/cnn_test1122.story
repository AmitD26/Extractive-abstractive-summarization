He was released from prison to a halfway house , said Edmond Ross , spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons .

Frequently during his trial -- for allegedly extorting almost $ 3 million from casino applicants -- he held his own court on the courthouse steps . `` Today , I took care of some housekeeping and had my car fixed and went and cashed a check before they freeze my accounts , '' he told reporters at one point .

Edwards served several terms in office -- from 1972 to 1980 , 1984 to 1988 and 1992 to 1996 . The Democrat , U.S. Navy aviation cadet and lawyer began his career as a city councilman and state representative before being elected to Congress , and then governor .

`` Edwards named blacks to key state positions and his support of black politicians resulted in a mutually beneficial relationship , '' the biography says .

His third term `` was marked by federal indictments , but not convictions , for mail fraud , obstruction of justice and public bribery , '' the biography adds .

The bio does not refer to Edwards ' conviction later on .

The U.S. District Attorney 's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana , on its website , describes Edwards as `` leader of the corrupt enterprise whose objectives included the illegal and corrupt manipulation of the riverboat gaming licensing process during and after his four terms as governor . ''

`` Also convicted were Edwin 's son , Stephen Edwards and his close associates Andrew Martin , Cecil Brown , and Bobby Johnson , '' the office says .
