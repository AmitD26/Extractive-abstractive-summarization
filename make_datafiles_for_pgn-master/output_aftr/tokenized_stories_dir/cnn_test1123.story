MANCHESTER , New Hampshire -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the eve of the New Hampshire primary , Sen. Barack Obama has a nine-point lead over Sen. Hillary Clinton in the state , according to a CNN-WMUR poll out Monday .

Preliminary results from the poll released Sunday night showed Obama with a lead of 10 percentage points .

New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson ranked fourth among the Democratic contenders with 7 percent , while Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich trailed at 1 percent . Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel had less than one half of 1 percent support .

`` The Iowa caucus results have convinced growing numbers of Granite State voters that Obama can really go all the way , '' CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said . `` In December , 45 percent thought Clinton had the best chance of beating the GOP nominee . But in Saturday 's poll , Clinton and Obama were tied on that measure , and now Obama has a 42 percent to 31 percent edge over Clinton on electability . ''

Obama 's success depends on whether independents turn out in large numbers on Tuesday and vote in the Democratic rather than Republican primary , according to Schneider .

On the Republican side , Sen. John McCain leads former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney by a narrower margin -- 31 percent to 26 percent , the survey found . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- whose upset win in Iowa came after being outspent by millions of dollars by Romney -- passed former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to gain third place . Watch Candy Crowley explain the high stakes in New Hampshire ''

The results suggest that Huckabee 's win in Iowa , which saw him win strong support among evangelical Christian voters , is giving him momentum in more secular , libertarian-oriented New Hampshire , CNN Political Analyst Bill Schneider said .

The poll , conducted by the University of New Hampshire , surveyed 599 likely Democrats and 492 Republicans likely to vote in Tuesday 's primary . It had a sampling error of 4 percentage points .

With time running out , 6 percent of likely Democratic primary voters and 5 percent of those likely to vote in the GOP primary remain undecided .

Whether independents decide to vote in the Democratic or Republican primaries could affect the outcome of both races , Schneider said , noting that McCain ties Romney among registered Republicans but has an 11-point lead when independent voters are included .

Obama appears to be pulling even with Clinton among women , a voting bloc that she once dominated in the polls . And when asked which candidate has the best chance of beating the Republican presidential nominee , likely Democratic primary voters now choose Obama over Clinton 42 percent to 31 percent .

That 's a dramatic reversal from the last CNN/WMUR New Hampshire poll taken after Christmas and just before the Iowa caucuses , when Clinton beat Obama in electability by a two to one margin . E-mail to a friend
