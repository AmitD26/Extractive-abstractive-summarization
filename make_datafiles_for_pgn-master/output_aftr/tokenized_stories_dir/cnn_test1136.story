-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As saber rattling grows over the Syrian president 's alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people , Bashar al-Assad 's once high-profile wife , Asma , has kept a low profile .

No images of bloody battle fields mar the view of the president caught in the middle of the civil war . Instead , photo after photo of the couple show a picture of caring . In one , the first lady -- who majored in computer science and French literature at King 's College London -- wipes away a boy 's tear . In another , she is listening intently to a group of women .

And , judging from the comments , he has fans in Syria , Russia and Turkey .

But not all the remarks are positive .

Some of the president 's almost 34,000 Instagram followers seem to sense spin in the postings , with one asking of the fashion-conscious first lady , `` So she managed to find time to stop shopping for shoes ? '' and another demanding photos of her Christian Louboutins , the brand of French shoes that can command $ 1,000 a pair .

Almost as common as the comments asserting , `` What a load of BS this account is '' are followers offering warm wishes of `` God bless you , '' `` We love you '' and `` We want you to win this war . '' Some supporters used a '' #LongLiveBasharAlAssad '' hashtag .

Western intervention looms in Syria

`` They 're pretty standard , '' Tabler said Wednesday in a telephone interview about the propaganda tools . `` I do n't think there are any surprises there . ''

But Tabler , who once lived in Syria and interacted with the first family , said he had little insight into her current doings . `` We broke relations a long time ago , '' he said about the 38-year-old former investment banker with J.P. Morgan , who was born in Britain to a family of Syrian descent .

When Asma al-Akhras met Bashar al-Assad during the 1990s , he was studying in London to be an eye doctor . After the death of her beau 's father , Syrian President Hafez Assad , in June 2000 , the ophthalmologist became president and , that December , the couple married .

Since then , they have had at least three children . She was reported last spring to be pregnant with a fourth .

Before the outbreak of the civil war in Syria in March 2011 , the first lady had projected an image of a reformer .

A 2011 Vogue magazine article described her as `` a rose in the desert . ''

The story , which was published after the uprising had begun , was ridiculed for being tone-deaf to suffering in the country .

Afterward , the writer of the Vogue article told CNN she felt duped by the first lady when she learned that the Syrian president 's forces had killed children . `` I wondered how this English woman I had met who so believed in the youth of Syria could stand by and not do anything , '' said Joan Juliet Buck . `` I fell for the line this woman fed me . ''

Throughout her years as first lady , Asma al-Assad has focused on children . In a 2009 CNN interview , she spoke about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict , saying that she would not tolerate an oppressive and violent regime . She spoke at length about how it broke her heart that children on either side would be caught in the crossfire .

Getting to know Syria 's first family

In February 2012 , an article published in The Times of London said Asma al-Assad appeared to support her husband , while also seeking dialogue and comfort for the bereaved in the country .

Meanwhile , the little that has emerged about her life has contrasted sharply with the brutality of the civil war that has engulfed the country : Leaked e-mails between the president and the first lady showed that she was shopping online for jewelry , art and furniture .
