Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States is replacing its much-mocked system of color-coded terrorism alerts with detailed advisories about specific threats , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Thursday .

The five-color system has rarely changed from its middle setting of yellow , or `` elevated , '' for the general public and orange , or `` high , '' for commercial aviation . It has not been lowered below those levels since its establishment in 2002 .

The system was the butt of jokes and parodies almost from the start , and polls found that the public considered it confusing . Kate Hanni , of the airline travelers ' advocacy group FlyersRights.org , called it `` very useless . ''

`` People just ignored it , '' Hanni told CNN on Wednesday . Since the color rarely changed , passengers came to believe it did n't mean anything , she said .

In addition , some critics accused the Bush administration of manipulating the system to gin up fear at politically sensitive times . Just days after he announced his resignation in 2005 , then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told a Washington forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the administration 's Homeland Security Advisory Council , which made the decisions . The Bush administration denied Ridge 's assertions .

Napolitano said the new system `` is built on a clear and simple premise : When a threat develops that could impact you -- the public -- we will tell you . ''

The alerts will distinguish between `` elevated '' and `` imminent '' threats and could be limited to warnings for specific industries or police or communicated more broadly to the public , she said .
