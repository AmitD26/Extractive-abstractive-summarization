London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In five years time , all new homes built in the UK will be required to be zero carbon , with no net carbon emissions over a year .

CNN spoke to green house-builders and environmentalists to answer some burning questions about zero carbon homes .

Some 26 % of UK 's carbon emissions come from homes , making it a significant area for reducing emissions overall , according to UK Green Building Council and WWF .

By 2016 , all new homes will have zero carbon emissions over a year . This will be a minimum requirement for homes to gain planning permission .

The UK aims to build somewhere in the region of 200,000 new homes a year , a drop in the ocean compared to more than 22 million existing homes .

What exactly does zero carbon mean ?

Zero carbon homes will have no net carbon emissions over the course of a year . Energy use will be minimized by use of thermally efficient building materials and insulation .

All the energy used to heat and light the home and run its appliances will need to be off-set using zero carbon technology such as wind turbines , solar panels and ground source heat pumps .

However , following a report in 2008 , which took in views from industry and green groups , it was decided that to be realistic , the definition needed to be relaxed to allow contributions to off-site renewable energy schemes .

The exact definition of these `` allowable solutions '' as the off-site schemes are known , is still being worked out .

Leader , of WWF , said : `` We need to make sure these allowable solutions are truly additional , and not things that would have happened anyway . ''

How does the UK 's target compare with others worldwide ?

`` EU legislation is leading towards zero carbon building , but the UK is ahead of the picture in having such an ambitious target . Germany and Scandinavia have historically had better building standards and some countries have decided to tackle the commercial building stock first . ''

Leader agreed : `` There are pockets of sustainable developments such as Freiburg in Germany and Malmo in Sweden , but nowhere else has a far-reaching policy like this .

`` EU legislation is heading toward zero carbon building by 2020 . ''

However , Bill Dunster , an architect who founded ZED Factory , based in the UK and China , and has built between 300 and 500 zero carbon homes worldwide , said : `` There 's very little demand in the UK compared with Germany and China , who are both far more ambitious and innovative . ''

However , this tax relief was based on the definition that all off-set energy had to be produced onsite , a definition which has since been considered unrealistic .

He added : `` In the UK , we are doing small-scale privately funded developments , whereas in China we are being asked to design whole city extensions with thousands of homes . ''
