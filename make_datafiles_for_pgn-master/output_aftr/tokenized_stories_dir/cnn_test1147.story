Alas , Pompeii has the field to itself , a big-budget 3-D disaster epic that lands smack in the box-office dead zone of February . It 's just crazy enough to work !

Game of Thrones ' Kit Harington plays Milo , a Roman slave-turned-gladiator who catches the eye of an upper-class beauty -LRB- Emily Browning -RRB- who in turn is promised to the corrupt Roman politician -LRB- Kiefer Sutherland -RRB- who butchered his family . Conflict ! Harrington sculpted his body to look the part of a gladiator , but EW 's Owen Gleiberman thinks Russell Crowe 's Maximus from Gladiator is n't in danger of being surpassed anytime soon , writing , `` Harington knows how to handle a broadsword , but mostly he comes off as the British Taylor Kitsch , a glorified fashion model striking Blue Steel poses that smolder , boringly . ''

Owen Gleiberman -LRB- Entertainment Weekly -RRB- ▼

`` The volcano spews an endless shower of fiery asteroids trailed by smoky plumes -- an apocalyptic fireworks show that takes down the city . ... Bodies get frozen into sculptures of ash that will last forever . It 's supposed to make this love story timeless , but by the end of Pompeii , you 'll be grateful that the movie only lasts 104 minutes . ''

`` Taking a page from Titanic , the film invents a rich-girl/poor-boy romance , puts a powerful suitor in their way and then besets their star-crossed love story with CG lava showers , rendered all the more spectacular in stereoscopic 3-D . In short , Pompeii is a blast , at least by guilty-pleasure standards ... ''

Mick LaSalle -LRB- San Francisco Chronicle -RRB- ▼

`` As for the fact that there 's no reason to care whom the fireballs hit , or who gets covered in lava , or whose house caves , or whose ship blows up -- well , that 's unfortunate . Although , if you think of Pompeii as a ride , a conveyance for special effects , and not anything resembling an emotional experience , indifference can almost be a good thing . ''

Jordan Mintzer -LRB- Hollywood Reporter -RRB- ▼

`` The lava flows by the ton , as does the cheese , in Pompeii , a kitschy apocalyptic peplum whose visual epiphanies -- of which there are definitely a few -- can not outdo a B - -LRB- or C - or D - -RRB- grade scenario that will have lots of eyes rolling by the time the big stack finally blows . ''

`` Besides Gladiator and Titanic , the film borrows from 300 , Troy , Spartacus , Clash of the Titans , and even The Princess Bride . The result is a generic saga with a cast of forgettable one-dimensional characters . ''

Gary Goldstein -LRB- Los Angeles Times -RRB-

Liam Lacey -LRB- Toronto Globe and Mail -RRB-

`` No doubt the audiences in the Coliseum would offer a thumbs-up to the scale of the destruction , though even they might have had some quibbles about the special effects , which , too often , resemble a very large pile of melting crayons . ''
