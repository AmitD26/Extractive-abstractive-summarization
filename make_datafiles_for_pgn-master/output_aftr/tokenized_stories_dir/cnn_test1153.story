Studies have indeed shown that people attribute more intelligence and competence to taller , well-turned-out or otherwise good-looking people . However , a new briefing paper by the Council on Contemporary Families tell us life 's uneven distribution of beauty counts in an even more poignant place than we may have considered : in school evaluations of our children by teachers and peers .

More than that , they will actually get higher grades and be more likely to graduate from college .

They say there is a cumulative boost -LRB- or loss -RRB- of self-esteem about one 's own appearance that carries over from high school into college and perhaps over a lifetime .

And even though the authors say that beauty has its pitfalls -LRB- good-looking men and women , for example , dated more and drank more and some of this had a negative impact on their grades and college success -RRB- , their conclusion is that , overall , this period of `` lookism '' in high school is important enough to merit the same kind of consciousness-raising discussion given to unfair racial or class stereotypes .

The other side of the coin is what 's concerning : There is , as many parents know , the depression and sense of worthlessness a young adult may feel when he or she is not deemed good-looking in high school . It is frightening to think this may lead to a lifetime of feeling awkward , unlovable and inferior .

We have all become more sensitive and activist about issues of adolescence we used to ignore . We now know how dangerous bullying is , how destructive depression can be and how important it is to reframe our view of people who have physical or mental disabilities .

While we ca n't mandate that people change their opinion about who is or is not good-looking , we could ask our kids ' teachers to be aware of their own tendency to give a higher grade or greater approval to a good-looking kid than to one that is not . We could all bring attention to slang that kids use to assess or denigrate another person 's looks .

Does this sound too PC ? Maybe . But a little sensitivity here would n't be a bad thing .

Terms such as `` tubby '' or `` skinny '' or `` lame '' or other insult equivalents you may have heard do n't need to be leveled at anyone . Young people are acutely aware when they are not the favored ones , and they know that popularity and good looks are usually paired .

Talking openly about this could make it clearer to the people in our children 's day-to-day world that their casual remarks can have long-term effects . It can also take some of the sting out of not being in the running for prom king or queen . And here I would suggest that such beauty and popularity contests are a dicey idea for schools in the first place . They have an impact on the impressions and behavior of everyone in the school , even , potentially , teachers .
