-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Memorial Day is more than just a three-day weekend and a chance to get the year 's first sunburn . Here 's a handy 10-pack of facts to give the holiday some perspective .

1 . It started with the Civil War

Memorial Day was a response to the unprecedented carnage of the Civil War , in which some 620,000 soldiers on both sides died . The loss of life and its effect on communities throughout the North and South led to spontaneous commemorations of the dead :

2 . General Logan made it official

From the practice of decorating graves with flowers , wreaths and flags , the holiday was long known as Decoration Day . The name Memorial Day goes back to 1882 , but the older name did n't disappear until after World War II . Federal law declared `` Memorial Day '' the official name in 1967 .

4 . The holiday is a franchise

For the rest of us , our holidays were enacted state by state . New York was the first state to designate Memorial Day a legal holiday , in 1873 . Most Northern states had followed suit by the 1890s . The states of the former Confederacy were unenthusiastic about a holiday memorializing those who , in Gen. Logan 's words , `` united to suppress the late rebellion . '' The South did n't adopt the May 30 Memorial Day until after World War I , by which time its purpose had been broadened to include those who died in all the country 's wars .

5 . It was James Garfield 's finest hour -- or maybe hour-and-a-half

As the songs , speeches and sermons ended , the participants helped to decorate the graves of the Union and Confederate soldiers buried in the cemetery .

6 . Not even the Unknown Soldier can avoid media scrutiny these days

`` Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God . '' That is the inscription on the Tomb of the Unknowns , established at Arlington National Cemetery to inter the remains of the first Unknown Soldier , a World War I fighter , on November 11 , 1921 . Unknown soldiers from World War II and the Korean War subsequently were interred in the tomb on Memorial Day 1958 .

An emotional President Ronald Reagan presided over the interment of six bones , the remains of an unidentified Vietnam War soldier , on November 28 , 1984 . Fourteen years later , those remains were disinterred , no longer unknown . Spurred by an investigation by CBS News , the defense department removed the remains from the Tomb of the Unknowns for DNA testing .

The once-unknown fighter was Air Force pilot Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie , whose jet crashed in South Vietnam in 1972 . `` The CBS investigation suggested that the military review board that had changed the designation on Lt. Blassie 's remains to ` unknown ' did so under pressure from veterans ' groups to honor a casualty from the Vietnam War , '' The New York Times reported in 1998 .

Lt. Blassie was reburied near his hometown of St. Louis , Missouri . His crypt at Arlington remains permanently empty . Watch digital memorial to troops of Afghanistan and Iraq ''

7 . Vietnam vets go whole hog

8 . Memorial Day has its customs

General Orders No. 11 stated that `` in this observance no form of ceremony is prescribed , '' but over time several customs and symbols became associated with the holiday .

It is customary on Memorial Day to fly the flag at half staff until noon , and then raise it to the top of the staff until sunset .

Not long after , the melody was used at a burial for the first time , when a battery commander ordered it played in lieu of the customary three rifle volleys over the grave . The battery was so close to enemy lines , the commander was worried the shots would spark renewed fighting .

9 . There is still a grey Memorial Day

Several Southern states continue to set aside a day for honoring the Confederate dead , which is usually called Confederate Memorial Day : Alabama : fourth Monday in April ; Georgia : April 26 ; Louisiana : June 3 ; Mississippi : last Monday in April ; North Carolina : May 10 ; South Carolina : May 10 ; Tennessee -LRB- Confederate Decoration Day -RRB- : June 3 ; Texas -LRB- Confederate Heroes Day -RRB- : January 19 ; Virginia : last Monday in May .

10 . Each Memorial Day is a little different

And in 2000 , Congress established a National Moment of Remembrance , which asks Americans to pause for one minute at 3 p.m. in an act of national unity . The time was chosen because 3 p.m. `` is the time when most Americans are enjoying their freedoms on the national holiday . ''
