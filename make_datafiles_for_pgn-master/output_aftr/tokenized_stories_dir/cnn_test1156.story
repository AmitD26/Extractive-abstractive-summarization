-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It is likely that radical cleric Abu Hamza -- who was found guilty on terror charges by a New York federal jury this week -- will now spend the rest of his life in a U.S. top security prison while his victims will gain some succor from the fact that he is finally behind bars .

There was a time , during the 1980s and early 1990s , when individuals would rarely become radicalized without direct contact with an extremist preacher of some description .

The fact that an estimated 400 British citizens are believed to have traveled to Syria to join jihadist groups suggests their efforts are having some success .

In tackling extremism we need to ensure universities and colleges are not hosting extremist preachers without providing a robust challenge to their views . We need to ensure prisoners are offered mentoring and support to turn their lives around , making them less susceptible to recruitment within prisons . Online extremism also needs to be challenged with counter-arguments ; this could be done through websites and social media accounts that confront the extremist narrative . A recent Quilliam report further details how this can be done .

We need to enter the realm of ideas and pitch more positive and enlightened values against extreme and regressive arguments .

The extreme Islamist narrative offers listeners a simplistic framework through which all geo-political developments are misconstrued .

Conflict zones -- such as Syria , Iraq or Afghanistan -- are viewed not as localised or isolated conflicts but part of a grand conspiracy to undermine Islam and prevent the emergence of a utopian Islamist super-power .

Undermining extreme Islamism is about undermining the framework or narrative that is being used . This involves discrediting it and exposing its inaccuracies from a political , historical and theological point of view . It is also about revealing the true nature of the extremist narrative and presenting it in its unembellished form .

For this to happen we need more political literacy , more spaces in which young people can discuss political and social developments and a stronger sense of national and regional identity so that people feel a greater sense of rootedness and belonging .

We undermine extremists by illustrating how our values are better than theirs and offering constructive answers in opposition to their destructive proposals .
