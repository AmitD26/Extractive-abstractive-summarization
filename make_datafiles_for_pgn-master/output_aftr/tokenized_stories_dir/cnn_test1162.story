-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Democracy campaigners in Bahrain and politicians around the world are calling for this Sunday 's Formula 1 race in the Gulf state to be canceled as violent clashes continue between activists and authorities . What are the issues around the controversy , and how are the sport and its fans reacting ?

In Britain , where many F1 teams are based , opposition leader Ed Miliband said : `` Sport and politics generally should n't mix , but ... what kind of signal does it send to the world when this grand prix is going ahead , given the concerns there are , given the violence we have seen in Bahrain , given the continuing issues around human rights ?

And opposition politician Yvette Cooper urged British F1 stars Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to pull out of the race . `` It should n't go ahead , I do n't think British drivers should go . I think the Formula 1 should not go ahead in Bahrain , '' Cooper told the BBC .

Shiite opposition groups in the Sunni-ruled kingdom say they want equality , and have posted calls on social networking sites for daily protests during the Grand Prix weekend , to focus media attention on their demands .

An Amnesty International report this week says promised reforms in Bahrain are inadequate and fail to provide justice for victims of human rights violations .

Protesters are also demanding the release of jailed activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja , who has been on hunger strike for more than 70 days . Al-Khawaja , 52 , was arrested in April 2011 for his role in anti-government protests that began a month earlier with demands for political reform and greater freedoms for Shiites .

In June , Bahrain found him and seven other Shiite opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the country 's royal family .

The authorities maintain they were part of illegal , violent protests .

This is the big question . Protesters have vowed to protest near the Sakhir circuit , which is about 25 miles -LRB- 40 kilometers -RRB- from Manama , but witnesses there say there is a heavy police presence on the road between the track and the airport .

On Thursday protesters burned tyres , briefly blocking several main roads leading to Sakhir . A Molotov cocktail exploded late Wednesday near a car carrying members of one F1 team , Force India , during clashes between protesters and security forces . No one was reported injured in the incident .

Formula One 's governing body , the FIA , decided last week the race should go ahead , after weeks of speculation . The governing body said its president traveled to Bahrain in November and met `` decision-makers and opinion formers , including elected Shiite members of parliament . All expressed their wish for the Grand Prix to go ahead in 2012 , '' it said .

Drivers have attempted to distance themselves from the violence . Romain Grosjean of France-based Team Lotus said his team was preparing for the event `` as well as we can . ''

`` As you say , we ca n't ignore the situation . But in another way , I hope the race may make a clear vision and help the situation and I think the Grand Prix will be nice , '' he told reporters in Bahrain .

`` Generally in the paddock -LRB- staging area for the cars -RRB- it seems to be no problem , '' he told the Press Association . `` Outside of the paddock maybe there is a risk , but I think there is a risk everywhere we go . ''

Seven-times title winner Michael Schumacher initially insisted he did not want to get involved before saying : `` I just want to say one thing which is I do n't want to mix the sport with politics . I 'm here for the sport . ''

How much is the race worth to Bahrain and to F1 itself ?

Of more importance is the issue of prestige that the race could bring . `` Bahrain is no different from the other Persian Gulf states in using high profile sporting events like tennis and golf tournaments to raise their own international prestige , '' James Montague , a journalist who has written about sport in the Middle East and is the author of `` When Friday Comes : Football in the War Zone , '' told CNN .

`` Qatar winning the bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals is a case in point . The F1 grand prix has been instrumental in raising Bahrain 's international profile far higher than a small island with a population of around 1 million people could expect .

Have there been protests against F1 races held in other countries accused of human rights abuses ?

No . Last week 's race in China took place without any calls for it to be cancelled despite concerns about human rights in that country . The same could be said for races in Russia and Singapore .

The only serious protests in the history of Formula One -- a multi-billion dollar sport and industry -- were before the South Africa Grand Prix at Kayalami in 1985 against the apartheid regime . Despite a boycott of South African teams in other leading sports at the time , the event still took place , but was cancelled the following year and only resumed in 1992 .

How have F1 fans reacted ?

Many fans of the sport have reacted with disgust , with countless posts on Twitter saying that they would refuse to even watch the race on television in protest . Ed Foster , a writer for British magazine Motorsport , told CNN : `` We did a poll on our website recently and the response was instant . We simply wrote ` Should F1 go to Bahrain ? Yes or no ? ' and hundreds of people got back to us straight away .

`` I think only one said that we should . It 's pretty clear speaking to people that a lot of the fans have decided to not watch the race out of principle . ''

It remains unclear how F1 fans will react to calls to boycott the race -- either at the track or watching on TV . But one news agency , the UK 's Press Association , reported there were few spectators in the main grandstand at Sakhir to watch Friday 's practice session .
