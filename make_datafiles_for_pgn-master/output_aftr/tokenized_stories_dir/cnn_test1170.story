In the event someone walked into the Justice Department `` with a box full of evidence , '' Mukasey said Friday , that could change his stance .

The State Department confirmed last week that contract personnel had accessed Sen. Barack Obama 's file on three occasions , and had made unauthorized entry once each into the passport files of Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain . Obama and Clinton are competing to be the Democratic nominee for president . McCain is the likely Republican nominee .

Justice prosecutors met with State Department officials `` after the attorney general 's remarks on Friday and are coordinating with the Office of Inspector General on its investigative efforts , '' Justice spokesman Peter Carr said Tuesday . Watch more on the passport breach ''

He said the department would have no further comment .

The official said the guidance requested by State officials does not constitute what could be described as a `` joint investigation '' by the two departments . Watch the Secretary of State 's comments ''

Several members of Congress have urged the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation to determine whether charges should be brought .

The latest such call came Tuesday from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , and the panel 's ranking Republican , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .

`` The Justice Department should not wait to be handed ` a box full of evidence ' as you said at your recent briefing , before determining whether federal laws were broken , '' Leahy and Specter said in a joint letter to Mukasey . `` We both strongly believe that our government has a duty to protect the private information of its citizens .
