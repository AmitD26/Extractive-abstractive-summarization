ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tuba Sahaab looks nothing like a warrior . She is a slight girl of 11 , living in a simple home in a suburb of Islamabad . But in Tuba 's case , looks are deceiving .

`` I want to give peace to my nation , '' Tuba Sahaab says , `` I will fight for it . ''

With her pen , Tuba is taking on the swords of the Taliban . She crafts poems telling of the pain and suffering of children just like her ; girls banned from school , their books burned , as the hard-core Islamic militants spread their reign of terror across parts of Pakistan .

A stanza of one of her poems reads : `` Tiny drops of tears , their faces like angels , Washed with blood , they sleep forever with anger . ''

Tuba is not afraid to express her views . Of the Taliban forcing young girls out of the classroom , she says : `` This is very shocking to hear that girls ca n't go to school , they are taking us back to the Stone Age . ''

On the day we spend with her , Tuba and her mother appear on a talk radio program . Back home , she tells me how she would give her life for her country .

`` I want to go the White Palace and show him my poems , show him what is happening and ask him to come to Pakistan and control it because he is a super power . ''

In her playground at school , Tuba dances and laughs with her friends . She loves writing her short stories -LRB- she has already published one book -RRB- and shows me a cartoon character she has created called `` Tomato Man . ''

And Tuba has the dreams of any young child . She tells me she wants to be an astronaut and then one day lead her country .

`` I will do anything , if my life goes I do n't worry , I just want to do something . '' `` I think you will get the chance , '' I say .

`` Yes , if someone gives me the chance you will see what I can do . ''

Of that , I have no doubt .
