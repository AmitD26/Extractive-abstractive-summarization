Monday 's storms were forecast to stretch into the Midwest and Ohio River Valley , with much of Illinois , Indiana and Kentucky at a lesser risk of severe weather , forecasters said . In Alabama , numerous school districts announced plans to dismiss early Monday afternoon in advance of the worst weather .

Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said the storm was one of the worst to hit the state in recent memory .

Emergency workers tended to the scene throughout the night . Shelters were set up at a high school and local church . Nearly 18,000 homes and businesses were without power Monday in Arkansas , more than 10,000 of them in Faulkner County , Entergy Arkansas reported .
