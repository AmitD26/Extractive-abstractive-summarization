Hitting out of the rough at the ice golf course at Uummannaq in Greenland can be tough .

But the increasing popularity of the sport has seen golf courses spring up in some unlikely places .

1 . Longest The average round of golf usually lasts a few hours , but prospective players on the Nullarbor Links Course in southern Australia can expect to complete the course in closer to four days . Measuring 848 miles in length the course is the longest in the world and spans two time zones with holes situated at 18 towns and service stations aimed along the Nullarbor Plain .

3 . Coldest Uummannaq in Greenland is home to the World Ice Golf Championships where the entire course is laid on gigantic icebergs and rounds of golf are played in subzero temperatures . The rules remain the same as regular golf although the course is a little shorter , the holes a little larger , the ball is orange and the green is white .

4 . Most dangerous Camp Bonifas is the closest military base to North Korea on the border in Panmunjom and is also home to what has been dubbed the world 's most dangerous golf course . The ` course ' is a single hole , par three which stretches 192 yards and is close to the most heavily fortified border in the world . And it is no place for a stroll in the rough either - the fairway is ringed by landmines .

7 . Unluckiest hole Jean Van de Velde infamously pondered a chip out of the water at The British Open at Carnoustie in 1999 but he would be well advised to not try the same at the Lost City Golf Course in Sun City , South Africa . The water trap at the 13th hole houses 38 hungry crocodiles which is a graveyard for the balls of hundreds of sliced shots .

8 Full steam ahead Located in a picturesque suburb of the city the Royal Colombo Golf Club in Sri Lanka has the distinguishing feature of the Kelani Valley steam railroad running through the course . Four of the holes are traversed by the trains which run past packed full of people ensuring the golfer will often have a audience , although a drop is permitted if your drive lands on the tracks .

10 . Out of this world Astronaut Alan Shepard is the only person to actually hit a golf ball on the moon when he did during 1971 's lunar visit , but plans for a course on the cratered satellite are already on the drawing board . Japanese company Shimizu Construction revealed a blueprint for the development of a course for the future , although an intergalactic open championship is probably quite a few years off yet .
