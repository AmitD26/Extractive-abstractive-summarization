The Justices on Monday declined to review two cases brought by the National Rifle Association that deal with whether those age 18-20 can buy and then carry handguns in public for self-defense .

The justices gave no reason for denying those cases and a third gun-control appeal on out-of-state weapon transfers .

Both current handgun cases originated in Texas , which included a challenge to state restrictions over `` concealed carry '' permits .

At issue in NRA v. McCraw -LRB- 13-390 -RRB- was whether the right to bear arms in public for self-defense extends to responsible , law-abiding 18 - to 20-year-olds .

Many states have similar restrictions , citing concerns over crime rates among certain young adults , and whether they have the necessary level of maturity and responsibility to carry a handgun .

Again , the nation 's most powerful gun rights group failed to convince the high court to address whether a nationwide , class-based , categorical ban on meaningful access to exercise the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense violated the Second Amendment .

The justices also turned down a more narrow appeal in Lane v. Holder -LRB- 12-1401 -RRB- , denying gun owners in Washington D.C. the ability to sue over city laws making it hard to legally transfer weapons purchased in nearby jurisdictions .

Once the high court established an `` individual '' right to keep a handgun in the home , it has been reluctant to broaden that right in a variety of subsequent challenges to other firearm restrictions .

The Justice Department estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the United States . In 2005 , the last time figures were available , three-quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns .

`` Given the number of laws enacted by the federal government , states , and localities in the years when a mistaken understanding of the Second Amendment held sway , one would have expected a major reconsideration of extant firearms laws to have occurred , '' said Clement in a brief filed with the court .

`` Instead , jurisdictions have engaged in massive resistance to the clear import of those landmark decisions , and the lower federal courts , long out of the habit of taking the Second Amendment seriously , have largely facilitated the resistance , '' he said .

Efforts to craft compromise gun-control legislation have stalled in Congress despite the Newtown , Connecticut , school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since .

The high court six years ago -- for the first time -- affirmed an individual 's right to own a firearm , when it struck down Washington D.C. 's handgun restrictions .

But the court confined its analysis just to the home , leaving in place other gun control laws , including those `` forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools . ''

While the court for now is staying out of the concealed carry issue , it may be forced back into the debate .
