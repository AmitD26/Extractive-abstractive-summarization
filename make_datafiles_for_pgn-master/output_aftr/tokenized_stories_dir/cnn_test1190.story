Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Charles Grassley on Thursday asked Attorney General Eric Holder to provide a legal analysis that endorsed the swap of five Taliban figures held at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl .

Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he was rebuffed earlier this year when he asked the Justice Department to release its legal analysis for when the President issues executive orders .

Grassley also said sharing the Justice Department 's legal advice may also ensure the President abides by his oath '' to carry out the law .

Obama attached a statement when he signed the law that called the restrictions on transfers an illegal infringement on presidential executive powers and declared the right to ignore them when national security interests required it .

Susan Rice said on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' on Sunday that the Defense Department was given advice by the Justice Department before the swap .

Hints of the legal advice provided to the Pentagon can be found in statements issued in recent days by the White House .

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in a statement that the administration 's interpretation of the law determined that the 30-day notification requirement `` should be construed not to apply to this unique set of circumstances , in which the transfer would secure the release of a captive U.S. soldier , and the secretary of defense , acting on behalf of the President , has determined that providing notice as specified in the statute could endanger the soldier 's life . ''

Hayden 's statement said that because the 30-day notice would have required the Pentagon to delay the swap , the notification requirement would interfere with the President 's constitutional power to protect Americans abroad and protecting U.S. soldiers .
