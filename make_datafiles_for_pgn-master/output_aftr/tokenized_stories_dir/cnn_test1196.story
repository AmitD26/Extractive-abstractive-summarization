-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I was born in Tallahassee , Florida , in 1954 , the year of the landmark school desegregation case , Brown v. Board of Education .

When my father , an art professor at Florida A&M University , sought to pursue his doctorate in art education at Florida State University , the state of Florida chose to pay his transportation to Penn State rather than open its doors to an African-American graduate student .

They achieved their goal . My three siblings and I attended predominantly white public schools in our small Massachusetts town without protest or high court drama , and graduated well-prepared for the colleges we all attended .

Forty-four years later , in 2002 , my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family 's reverse migration .

But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools , public education is again segregating along racial lines . And not just in the South , but across the United States .

As school districts move back to `` neighborhood school '' policies , white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had . Particularly for young white children , interaction with people of color is likely to be a virtual reality rather than an actual one , with media images -LRB- often negative ones -RRB- most clearly shaping their attitudes and perceived knowledge of communities of color .

For students of color , the return to segregation means the increased likelihood of attending a school with limited resources . Most highly segregated black and Latino schools have high percentages of poor children . At most highly segregated white schools , middle-class students are in the majority .

The negative educational impact of attending high-poverty schools is well-documented .

Whether a student comes from a poor or middle-income family , academic achievement is likely to decline if the student attends a high-poverty school .

So , what must we do ?

In particular , white children will need to be in schools that are intentional about helping them understand social justice issues like prejudice , discrimination and racism , empowering them to think critically about the stereotypes to which they are exposed in the culture .

The hopeful news is that there are educators around the country working hard to create anti-racist classrooms and learning environments even when their classrooms are predominantly white .

Children of color in under-resourced , racially isolated schools also need these same tools . But they will also require powerful advocates to insure that they have committed and well-trained teachers , a challenging curriculum and the educational resources needed to inspire their own striving for excellence .

Providing these resources equitably is a daunting task , one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the United States .

In 2014 , the question we all must ask is : How do we build strong school communities where every student , regardless of race , is supported to achieve his or her personal best , and teach the skills needed to live in healthy , democratic society ?
