-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 29-year-old Somali man was found guilty Thursday of attacking a Danish political cartoonist known for his drawing of the Muslim prophet Mohammed with a turban shaped as a bomb , authorities said .

In a unanimous verdict , Mohamed Geele was found guilty of attempted terrorism , attempted manslaughter and attacking a police officer with a knife and an ax , said Danish Prosecutor Lene Lemt .

Geele was accused of trying to break into the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on January 1 , 2010 . He was shot in the right leg and left hand by an officer during the incident and hospitalized for his wounds .

Prosecutors are seeking 12 years in prison for Geele , who is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday .

Al-Shabaab , the militant organization with alleged ties to Geele , is waging a bloody battle against Somalia 's transitional government and is currently on a U.S. government list of terrorist organizations .

Police had no indication that an attack was being planned on Westergaard , a police official said , though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist links .

Police said the suspect managed to crack the glass front door of Westergaard 's home . A home alarm alerted police to the scene , and they were attacked by the suspect , authorities said .
