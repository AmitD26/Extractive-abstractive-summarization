-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A possible workers strike at Belmont Park racetrack on Long Island , New York , could rein in I 'll Have Another 's chance at the coveted Triple Crown title on Saturday .

The union voted to authorize a strike more than a week ago , he said .

Racing association officials issued a statement calling UBEW Local 3 's potential strike `` extremely self-serving , '' alleging that the union is using `` the attention and excitement of a Triple Crown attempt to further its own agenda . ''

Racetrack officials are expecting a crowd of more than 100,000 for Saturday 's race .

Part of the dispute revolves around the definition of the workweek .

In their former contract , which ended after a year-long extension in early 2011 , UBEW workers were paid overtime on weekends , McElroen said . But in 2012 , the racing association changed the workweek to reflect Belmont 's Wednesday through Sunday race schedule , eliminating weekend overtime pay .

`` This change resulted in a drastic reduction in their take-home pay , '' McElroen said .

UBEW workers at Belmont have also had to start paying into their health insurance benefits and are no longer given retiree medical benefits , he added .

In the statement , New York Racing Association officials responded that `` Local 3 is unwilling to pay a reasonable share of the cost to provide these benefits and they refuse to work with us to create shifts that reflect the reality of how a race track operates . ''

'' -LRB- The New York Racing Association -RRB- took the position that it 's our way or the highway when they implemented these unilateral changes , '' he said . `` The workers are not going to accept that . ''
