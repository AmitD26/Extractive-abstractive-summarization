-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazil had promised there would be a time where the world would finally see a special player .

He 's 22 years of age -- a player with quick feet , a mind which sees each and every move before his opponents have drawn breath , a player who can score a goal when for all the world it appears impossible .

His two strikes propelled Colombia to a 2-0 victory over Uruguay and into its first ever World Cup quarterfinal where it will play Brazil and made him top scorer in the tournament with five goals .

Valderrama , known as `` El Pibe '' is widely acknowledged as the greatest Colombian to have kicked a ball -- though even he expects that to change .

Sometimes you witness something so special that it 's difficult to imagine quite how it came to pass .

Perhaps on Friday night , Rodriguez went to sleep and dreamed of how he 'd score the perfect World Cup goal .

But even then , as the moon looked down upon Rio de Janeiro , it is doubtful that Rodriguez would have envisaged scoring a goal so perfect that it will no doubt be played over and over for years to come .

Make no mistake -- Rodriguez 's volleyed strike , which would have caused a gasp and a sharp intake of breath from those watching around the world , was a moment never to be forgotten .

But his emergence on the international stage has captured the imagination of those who have yet to witness the talented playmaker in action .

While it may be the host nation , Brazil will surely feel more pressure and anxiety at the thought of facing this Colombia team -- a side which plays with a style and swagger which Luiz Scolari 's men have so far lacked .

That everyone who walked out of the Maracana after the game was speaking about Rodriguez was a testament to the player but also ensured another star name was temporarily forgotten at least .

After all , much of the lead up to the game had focused on one man -- a man who was nowhere to be seen .

Luis Suarez , banned for four months from all football and suspended for nine international games following his bite on Italy 's Giorgio Chiellini , may have been absent from the Maracana , but his shadow loomed large .

Instead , back at home in Uruguay , he could only watch on as his teammates were brushed aside by a vibrant , exciting and hugely talented Colombian side .

Colombia , playing in its first World Cup since 1998 , has produced some of the most eye-catching football witnessed so far -- an impressive feat given the absence of Falcao , the team 's star striker .

Led by Rodriguez , this is a team which oozes flair , adventure and style while still ensuring the backdoor remains slammed firmly shut .

When the ball popped up to him , some 20-yards from goal , most would have expected Rodriguez to control the ball , take it down , and possibly have an effort on goal .

Rodriguez took the ball on his chest , allowed the ball to drop , and then unleashed a volley which flew past Fernando Muslera in the Uruguay goal , hit the underside of the crossbar , and nestled in the back of the net .

It was thing of beauty -- a goal which took the breath away .

As Rodriguez ran away to celebrate with what has become an almost traditional dance , Uruguay appeared stunned by what had just occurred .

With its own talisman missing , it was Colombia 's which began to dictate the game .

Rodriguez , appearing at his first World Cup , plays with a poise and experience which belies his years .

Its second goal was a case in point -- a wonderful team move which led to Rodriguez slotting the ball home from close range after Juan Cuadrado had headed the ball back across goal .

That goal , which arrived five minutes after the interval , killed off any hopes Uruguay might have had of launching a comeback .

It briefly rallied late on with David Ospina in the Colombia goal forced to make saves from Cristian Rodriguez and Maxi Pereira , but its late pressure proved futile .

Instead , Uruguay 's players will fly home where Suarez will no doubt be waiting for them and wondering what might have had happened had he been able to play .
