LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is writing a prequel to her best-selling series to be auctioned for charity -- but at just 800 words , it may lack some of the magic fans of the boy wizard might be hoping for .

Rowling 's hand-written prequel , signed by the author , will be auctioned alongside works by other famous writers to raise cash for a dyslexia charity .

Despite the brevity of the piece , experts believe it could fetch big money , since other autographed works by the blockbuster author have sold for millions of dollars .

`` We never dreamed that J.K. Rowling would donate something so precious , and we 're incredibly grateful , '' said Gerry Johnson , managing director of Waterstone 's , the UK book chain organizing the auction .

A previous 93-word storycard from Rowling , which referred to the book `` Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , '' sold in 2002 for $ 53,000 . Rowling later produced seven hand-written copies of a new work , `` The Tales of Beedle the Bard , '' one of which sold for $ 3.9 million in 2007 .

All profits from the book will benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN , a writers ' association , Waterstone 's said .
