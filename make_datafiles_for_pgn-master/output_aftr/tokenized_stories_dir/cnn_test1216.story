-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Cannes Film festival , which kicked off Wednesday on the French Riviera , is an Olympics of cinema , where endurance matters as much as victory to the 30,000 industry insiders who attend each year .

The festival was conceived in the late 1930s as a reaction against Italian dictator Benito Mussolini promoting fascist-Italian and national-socialist German films at the Venice Film Festival . Its first edition , planned in September 1939 , was delayed by war till 1946 but its ideals remained the same : to show films from all over the world without prejudice of any sort .

Cannes still regards itself as the grande dame of film events the world over -- but does it still matter ?

The festival , which this year celebrates its 67th edition , stands firmly apart -- and , some would argue , above -- the rest of the crowd .

This comes in part from its original ambition , as put by the festival 's first president , poet Jean Cocteau : `` The Cannes Film Festival is an apolitical no man 's land , a microcosm of what the world would be like if people could make direct contact with one another and speak the same language . ''

For Cannes is to cinema what the motto `` liberte , egalite , fraternite '' -LRB- `` liberty , egality , fraternity '' -RRB- is to France : an aspiration , an ideal , an inclusive forum for all talents , old and new , coming from all over the world , and motivated by one common love : films . Without prejudices .

Then , Cannes raised its game . First came the Palme d'Or , its top award , given in 1955 and rivaling the Oscars as the most prestigious prize in the film industry . In 1972 , the festival declared its independence by setting up its own selection committee : until then , each country had chosen the films which would represent them at Cannes , as still happens with the Oscars ' best foreign film category .

For Cannes is where directors will throw tantrums and tell critics to go to hell in no uncertain terms ; where the winner of the Palme d'Or can be booed , as happened to film-maker Maurice Pialat in 1987 when he collected the coveted prize for `` Under the Sun ; '' and where a talent like Danish maverick Lars Von Trier can express sympathy at a press conference for Adolf Hitler , then apologize , then be kicked out of the festival by the organizers -LRB- he later withdrew his apology -RRB- .

In 2004 , Michael Moore 's `` Fahrenheit 9/11 '' -- which criticized U.S. foreign policy -- became the first documentary to win the Palme d'Or from a festival jury which numbered more Americans than French .
