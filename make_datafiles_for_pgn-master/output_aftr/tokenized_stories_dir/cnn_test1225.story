Berryville , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Travis and Joyce Miller might have the most fragrant garage in the Shenandoah Valley .

What 's cooking , though , is something a little bit sweeter -LRB- sorry , grandma -RRB- : It 's Falling Bark Farm hickory syrup .

Never heard of hickory syrup ? Neither had the Millers until a few years ago when a chance Internet search turned up mentions of it .

In 2011 , they showed up to the farmers market in nearby Purcellville , Virginia , with 48 bottles of their new science project -- `` which we felt was a little bit risky , '' Travis says .

They 're the first to admit they did n't have a divine syrup destiny ; they 're just retirees looking to get by via trial and error -- a challenge that Americans of all ages face regularly .

`` Everybody out there is looking for something new , '' Travis says . `` The difficulty is not necessarily producing the product , it 's about marketing the product . ''

The Millers have built their business by intriguing the average consumer , who often associates the flavor of syrup strictly with maple or `` pancake syrup '' poured from a character-shaped bottle .

`` We do n't say it 's better or worse than maple ; it 's just a different culinary experience , '' she says . The sugar content is similar to that of maple syrup , but the intensity of the sweetness is not there , Travis adds , which is why they suggest use in meat glazes or even cocktails .

Throughout the Millers ' 33-year marriage , the couple have always looked to their hands -- and the land around them -- as a means of making a living . They grow and eat their own produce , hunt and cook their own game , and have even built most of their houses from the ground up .

Three years later , the notion seems to have stuck .

`` I think the family that works together , stays together , '' Travis says .

At first , they experimented with compound butters and smoked salts . The smoking led them to looking into different woods to smoke -- from there they branched into hickory .

`` And then syrup just started happening , '' Joyce says . `` And it 's continued to happen . We 're going to follow it wherever it takes us . ''

They individually bottle each unit in their home using a Hamilton Beach coffee urn , and drive orders to the post office in their truck with a license plate that reads , `` SRP HPNS '' -LRB- syrup happens -RRB- .

`` We just try to do the right thing , '' Joyce says . `` I guess maybe all that 's karma . It 's come back around and starting to pay off . ''

An 8-ounce bottle retails for around $ 9.99 , and the syrup is available nationwide in retailers such as Whole Foods as well as in Falling Bark Farm 's online store .

For the Millers , at the moment , money really does grow on trees .
