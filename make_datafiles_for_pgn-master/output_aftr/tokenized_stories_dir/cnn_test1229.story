That was the core of the message Friday from Michael Foley , the brother of the American journalist James Foley , beheaded this month by his ISIS captors .

Michael Foley told CNN 's Anderson Cooper he hopes Western nations get on the same page when it comes to dealing with kidnappers from militant groups like ISIS -- saying that having some European nations pay ransoms while the United States does n't sends an inconsistent message .

And Michael Foley hopes others can find comfort -- and strength -- like his family has in how his brother acted in his darkest and final moments , as seen in the horrific video of his killing posted online .

`` I 'm certain that he put himself in a position to be first in line -LRB- among the captives to be killed -RRB- , and he wanted us to be strong . And that is the message that he was sending , without sending it . ''

Even as ISIS touted the journalist 's killing and threatened others , the world has responded -- in words at least .

`` Horror is a good word , '' James Foley said . `` It 's right out of a Hollywood movie .

His brother thinks so ; in fact , he says he knows `` that there 's more that could have been done . ''

'' -LRB- U.S. officials -RRB- hands are tied , in many ways , by the rigid policies that we tend to follow , '' Michael Foley added .

Balboni told the Wall Street Journal that the captors originally demanded a ransom sum of 100 million euros , or about $ 132.5 million , from Foley 's family and GlobalPost .

Michael Foley noted that several European journalists have been freed , after their captors got paid ransoms -- something Washington refuses to do , saying it wo n't negotiate with terrorists .

`` I do n't have all the answers , but I do think that a more cooperative approach -LRB- is needed -RRB- , '' he said . `` And there was n't sharing of information . You would n't believe how difficult it was to get information -LRB- on -RRB- released journalists ... from the ways that we have these walls built . ''

U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue Foley and other hostages held by Islamic militants , a U.S. official told CNN . Several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos from units like Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 flew in aboard helicopters but could n't find the hostages , including Foley .

Ben Rhodes , a deputy national security adviser on Friday said the administration was looking at options beyond the current airstrikes in Iraq against the Sunni extremists .

`` If we see plotting against Americans , see a threat to the United States emanating from anywhere , we stand ready to take action against that threat , '' Rhodes told reporters . '' ... We 're actively considering what 's going to be necessary to deal with that threat , and we 're not going to be restricted by borders . ''

Up until last month , the Foley family thought they had `` made a lot of progress '' toward James ' release . But when the United States began hitting ISIS in Iraq , the Foley family knew it would n't help -- even though , as Michael Foley acknowledges , what happened to his brother underscores the evil nature of this group .

`` I think there 's a lot of utility to what 's being done there , '' he added . `` It 's just horrible what ISIL is doing to the citizens over there and something needs to be done . I 'm just not sure that containment and some of these strikes are enough . ''
