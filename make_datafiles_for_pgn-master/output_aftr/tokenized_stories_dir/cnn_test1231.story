Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of a New Jersey man who went missing while studying in Israel has joined police and hundreds of volunteers searching the forest outside Jerusalem where his son disappeared .

Yeshiva student Aaron Sofer , 23 , was reported missing Friday by a friend who was hiking with him in the Jerusalem Forest , Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN .

`` It means a lot to us that everyone is doing their share , whatever they could to help us find my son , '' he told CNN at the search site Wednesday .

Landau , who 's been volunteering on search and rescue missions for years , called Sofer 's disappearance `` extremely unusual , '' and said that the search party has come up empty-handed .

`` We have absolutely nothing that could explain what happened to him , '' he said .

Police have questioned a friend of Sofer 's who was `` the last man who saw him face-to-face , eye-to-eye , '' Rosenfeld said .

The friend lost contact with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to authorities , the police spokesman added .

What happened ?

`` We are looking in a number of directions , '' Rosenfeld said . `` It is not clear if the disappearance was personal -LSB- or a -RSB- kidnapping . It 's not clear at all . ''

The missing man 's brother , Joel Sofer , told CNN Tuesday that family members are `` just praying hard and doing everything we could do . ''

He said he had visited the area where his brother went missing .

U.S. State Department assisting

Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said the U.S. Department of State was helping Israeli authorities in the search for Sofer .

Two minors and an adult were indicted in the killing . Prosecutors allege the killing was retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank in June . One of the Israeli youths also had American citizenship .
