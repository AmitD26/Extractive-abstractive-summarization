-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Huma , please say it is n't so .

That was the overwhelming sentiment of women I chatted with on Facebook , Twitter and over e-mail after I heard reports that Huma Abedin , wife of embattled New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner , might partly blame herself for her husband 's return to sexting .

Weiner 's wife : Should Huma stand by her man ?

`` What a sad thing to hear , that Huma blames herself , but it 's not so unusual , is it ? '' said Jessica Dukes , a mom of two and freelance writer in Brooklyn , New York . `` When relationships hit the rocks , does n't everyone have those ` What did I do to deserve this ? ' thoughts . ''

Andrea Kristina says she knows exactly what Abedin is going through . She put up with her husband 's infidelities for years , she said , and that battered her self-worth .

`` When a woman 's self-esteem is already low , and she is already so insecure , it is easy for a man like this to bend her thinking in a way that makes her feel as if she is the one who failed somehow , '' the divorced mom of a teenager said . `` For so long , that 's how I felt . ''

Pam Selker Rak , a married public relations executive in Pittsburgh , said if she were Huma 's friend , she 'd tell her she feels terrible she is choosing to `` carry this burden on her own shoulders . ''

Allison Kluger , a married mom of two in Palo Alto , California , believes Huma 's `` self-blame stance '' is `` very generous . ''

`` If I acknowledge I am powerless to stop his behavior , that is very disheartening , '' she said . `` If I can figure out what I did wrong , I can figure out how to fix it , and if you tell me that I did n't do anything wrong , then what do I do with that ? ''

`` But either you live in denial of reality or you eventually face the facts in the situation : she did n't make him seek something outside their marriage . He did that all on his own , '' she said .

We , as women , are wired to be fixers , Watt added . `` But the important thing is to realize that the only person who can ` fix ' infidelity is the one who chose to commit it . ''
