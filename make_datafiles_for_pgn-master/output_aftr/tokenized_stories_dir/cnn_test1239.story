Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A `` defiant '' pregnant woman who was subjected to three Taser stun gun shocks by law enforcement officers after refusing to sign a speeding ticket will not get her appeal addressed by the Supreme Court .

A speeding citation was issued but the woman refused to sign it as state law required . Brooks later claimed she mistakenly believed signing the ticket was an admission of guilt . An argument ensued with two police officers . A federal appeals court later said , `` she remained defiant even after -LRB- Officer -RRB- Jones told her she 'd be arrested if she continued to refuse . ''

A police sergeant soon arrived and informed the motorist that force would be applied if she did not get out of her vehicle as ordered . Brooks refused . A Taser electro-shock weapon was displayed , and officers warned her it would be used if there was further resistance . Brooks explained her pregnancy , and later claimed one of the officers replied , `` Well , do n't do it in her stomach , do it in her thigh . ''

The Taser was applied in a `` drive-stun '' mode three times in a one-minute span -- in her thigh , arm , then neck , according to court testimony .

Brooks fell out of the vehicle , was dragged onto the street face down , and then was handcuffed .

She gave birth weeks later to a healthy girl . Soon after , the then-33-year-old woman was cited for a misdemeanor , refusing to sign the ticket , but not for resisting arrest . She sued , claiming emotional and physical scars from the incident .

And Judge Barry Silverman noted force must sometimes be used even when the underlying offense is minor .

A similar appeal heard by the judges came from Maui , when a 2006 domestic disturbance got out of hand after officers arrived on the scene . Jayzel Mattos was tased with a dart-mode device in a rapidly escalating and confusing scene inside a residence . She and her husband , Troy , were arrested on harassment , resisting arrest and obstruction charges , which were eventually dropped .

The appeals court ruled the same : force was excessive , but the officers could not be sued .

The Supreme Court has generally been tolerant of police use of force when dealing with belligerent or defiant individuals , but has not yet accepted any cases on the specific use of Tasers , a brand name from a company by the same name .

In an unrelated the 2007 ruling , the high court noted that while any `` attempt to craft an easy-to-apply legal test in the Fourth Amendment context is admirable , in the end we must still slosh our way through the factbound morass of ` reasonableness . ' Whether or not -LRB- an officer 's use of forceful -RRB- actions constituted application of `` deadly force , '' all that matters is whether -LRB- the officer 's -RRB- actions were reasonable . ''

Tasers are handheld devices that use electric current to cause a disruption of physical control from `` neuromuscular incapacitation , '' according to the company 's website .

Some law enforcement agencies consider them a safer alternative to other forced-restraint methods , for both suspects and police .

Brooks asked the high court to hold the officers liable for damages , while the officers asked the high court not to restrict future use of the forced-compliance and immobilizing tools . Their employer , the Seattle Police Department , had asked the justices to stay out of the case , worried it and other law enforcement agencies would be subject to a flood of personal injury claims .

The cases are Daman v. Brooks -LRB- 11-898 -RRB- ; Brooks v. Daman -LRB- 11-1045 -RRB- ; Agarano v. Mattos -LRB- 11-1032 -RRB- ; and Mattos v. Agarano -LRB- 11-1165 -RRB- .
