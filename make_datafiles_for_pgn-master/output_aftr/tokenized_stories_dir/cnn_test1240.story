Apparently they make pretty tasty snacks too , if you 're not too discriminating and you happen to be a 3-year-old Great Dane .

Just do n't eat too many .

`` We opened up his stomach and kept removing sock after sock of all different shapes and sizes , '' Dr. Ashley Magee at DoveLewis Animal Hospital in Portland , Oregon , told CNN affiliate KGW .

Oh , and those X-rays even impressed the experts . The vet clinic submitted them to the annual `` They Ate WHAT ? '' contest at Veterinary Practice News and won the $ 500 third prize , losing out to a frog who gobbled up 30 rocks from the bottom his cage and a German shorthaired pointer who swallowed a metal shish kabob skewer .

The Great Dane is doing just fine . He was home a day after his surgery .

So far , no reported sock incidents .
