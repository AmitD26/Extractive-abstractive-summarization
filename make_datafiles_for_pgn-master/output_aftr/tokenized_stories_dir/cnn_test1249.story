The recently implemented law has been criticized by U.S. President Barack Obama and there have been calls by some to boycott next year 's winter Olympics in the Russian city of Sochi .

`` As an American who believes in freedom of speech and freedom of assembly I take huge offense that the Russian government is limiting their people in that way , '' Symmonds told CNN Friday .

`` If we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street , we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal , standard people , '' Isinbayeva said in English at a press conference . `` We just live boys with woman , women with boys . ''

After the pole vaulter was criticized , too -- Symmonds was one of those who took offense -- she backtracked Friday , claiming she had been misunderstood as English was n't her first language .

However he `` could n't stay silent anymore '' after watching a CNN story that showed two Russian women shoved to the ground after they appeared to kiss each other in the street .

It was `` based on nothing more than they wanted to express their love for each other , '' he told CNN . `` I was just appalled . ''

`` This is the defining civil rights movement of our time , '' Symmonds told CNN . `` I just want to say in 100 years when people look back on this moment , the people who are against equality and against love are going to be remembered on the wrong side of history .

He is n't the only competitor at the world championships supporting gay rights .

Swedish high-jumper Emma Green Tregaro and sprinter Mao Hjelmer wore rainbow-colored fingernails in their events . Green Tregaro posted a picture on her Instagram account captioned : `` Nails painted in rainbow sign #pride #moscow2013 . ''

That prompted Isinbayeva to hit back .

`` We have our home and everyone has to respect -LRB- it -RRB- . When we arrive to different countries , we try to follow their rules . ''

Symmonds said he was trying to be respectful but felt he had to speak up .

`` I 'm a guest in this nation , '' he told CNN . `` And if I really wanted to press this issue I could go a lot further and be assembling in the streets but I want to be respectful . Respect the fact that there are a lot of competitors around here that still have to compete and I 'm trying to not create a huge distraction for them .
