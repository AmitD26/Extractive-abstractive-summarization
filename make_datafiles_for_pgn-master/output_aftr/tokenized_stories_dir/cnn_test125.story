Yet 10 years ago , the conflict in Darfur began . Many Darfuris are still waiting for the international community to help stop the bloodshed and ethnic cleansing . Civilians are still being systematically targeted , raped and killed and a recent upsurge in state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses is particularly worrying . Yet the response from the international community is to look the other way .

But the international community already confronts a similar reality in Sudan -- it just fails to truly understand the ugly nature of President Omar al-Bashir 's regime . You only have to take a look at the friends he keeps , including Iran -- designated by the U.S. government as a sponsor of international terrorism . And let 's not forget Sudan 's long history of harboring global terrorists . In the early 1990s this included international terrorist `` most wanted , Osama bin Laden .

Domestically , the Sudanese government promotes a violent , extreme form of Sharia law . At the very least this means anyone who fails to live by their strict and extreme interpretation of Islamism is castigated with public floggings and jail sentences . Moderate Muslims who signed the New Dawn Charter in January -- separating religion from state -- were labeled non-believers and infidels .

At worst , Khartoum 's attempt to establish a racially pure Islamic state involves waging war against its own unarmed civilians , systematically and with impunity . In Darfur this has lasted a decade .

However , since these human-rights violations occur in a media vacuum the world assumes `` Darfur is over . '' It is n't -- and wo n't be until the international community stops applying a lesser standard to Darfuris than to others who have needed its help .

That 's why a coalition of Darfuri organizations , like the Darfur Union and NGOs like Waging Peace -- which campaigns against genocide and human rights abuses in Sudan -- are launching a new campaign , Darfur10 , to bring this war-torn region back onto the international agenda .

Taking action need not require lengthy international negotiations . Let 's just start by finally implementing the numerous U.N. resolutions against Sudan since 2004 .

But addressing the underlying cause of Sudan 's troubles means ensuring al-Bashir and others in his regime are brought to the International Criminal Court to stand trial for crimes against humanity .

Media outlets are already publishing retrospectives on Darfur , 10 years on . But for the inhabitants of this blighted land , we are still staring the conflict in the face -- every day . It 's time to take action .
