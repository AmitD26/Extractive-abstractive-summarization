Maybe it was . Or maybe it was n't .

The truth is that 13 years after the September 11 attacks , the United States does not have an effective strategy for dealing with radical Islamists and their deep commitment to waging war against us and against our civilization .

Instead , the most important aspect about Islamic State is that it is a vector for attracting , training and preparing foreign terrorists from all over the world .

Islamic State comprises 10,000 potential terrorists from more than 50 countries . Estimates vary widely on how many Americans have gone Syria to join ISIS and other extremist groups . Some officials say dozens have gone ; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says `` hundreds . '' At least one of them , from Minneapolis , was recently killed .

British Prime Minister David Cameron has begun to recognize the depth and power of the terrorism crisis . He is proposing a series of major legal changes in Britain to eliminate would-be terrorists from British life . There will be even more draconian laws proposed in the near future if this conflict escalates .

We are facing a new kind of crisis in the rise of radical Islamists who spread their ideology worldwide through the Internet and through human networking . It is a global phenomenon and the analytical models and strategic patterns that have worked with nation-states will simply fail when applied to the Islamic State and its fellow terrorists in Hamas , Boko Haram , Libyan militants , Yemeni jihadis or any other group .

We need a new analysis with new language and new strategies that relate to defeating a viral system that spreads across national boundaries .

We 're better off with a president who does n't have a good strategy and knows he does n't than with a president who has a bad strategy but thinks he has a good one . For most of his administration , the president was firmly in the latter category , so his recent epiphany marks an improvement .

If there is a silver lining in President Obama 's disastrous foreign policy , it has been in awakening Americans and perhaps even the President himself to the need for a profound rethinking of our approach to radical Islamism .
