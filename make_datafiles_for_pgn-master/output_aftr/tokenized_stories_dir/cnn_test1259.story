Jihadists have felt the opposite , that the region should be united into a new caliphate -- indeed that is precisely what the militant group the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant -LRB- ISIS -RRB- declared this week . Both are wrong .

Dividing Iraq

Ever since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the division of Iraq into three parts -- roughly , a Kurdish north , a Sunni middle and a Shia south -- has been proposed earnestly , often by people with barely any knowledge of the region , its peoples and societies .

The casualness with which the suggestion of such an immense change is made mirrors the callous approach taken by the colonial surveyors who first drew these borders , seeking to change the lives of nations with the stroke of a pen .

Such a project , however , faces immense technical as well as human challenges , which are rarely addressed . Any division of Iraq has to take into account people , politics and economics .

In the most often suggested scenario , the northern Kurdish region would take the oil-fields around Kirkuk in the north , the Shia state would take the capital Baghdad and the main port in the southern city of Basra , leaving a Sunni rump state in the west , denuded of resources with which to survive . Moreover , the new smaller Shia state in the south would come under Iran 's influence , extending Tehran 's reach into a state that would now border Kuwait and Saudi Arabia . The idea that this division would solve anything is a dangerous fantasy .

As things stand today , an attempt to divide Iraq would not occur calmly but would be a furious scramble for the country 's resources , as well as a rush by Iraq 's neighbors for influence over the three new states in their midst . It would not solve the problem . Rather it would entrench the failures of politicians , writing failed policies across the lines of a map .

To ask or force so many to move , even from , say , Baghdad to Basra , would mean uprooting them from jobs , friends and families . It would need a strategy to ensure that there are sufficient jobs waiting , that there are schools for the children to attend , that there are apartments and houses for people to live in . Mass migration can not be accomplished safely by speeches alone .

Even with the most extensive planning , the results would likely be chaotic . As Feisal Istrabadi , former deputy Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations , pointed out two weeks ago : `` If Iraq falls apart , it will not fall apart into three neat pieces . What you 're much more likely to see is a Somalia in Iraq . ''

Iraqis are simply too mixed together . Even today , more than a decade after the invasion of Iraq , the same mistakes of understanding are made .

One is to imagine a neat division of Sunnis , Shia and Kurds , mixing up ethnic and religious categories . The Kurds , after all , are mainly Sunni Muslims and both Sunni and Shia Muslims and Christians are Arabs . Add to that mix the other minorities of Iraq , the Yezidis , the Armenians , the Circassians . In a divided Iraq , where would they go ? If the answer is that they could stay as minorities in the areas they currently live , why could n't that formulation equally apply to Sunnis in Shia areas and Shia in Sunni areas ?

` Iraqis must make decision '

None of that means that partitioning Iraq should not be considered . But it has to come with the understanding that it is Iraqis themselves who must make the decision and that rearranging what were lines in the sand is a serious business , because the new borders will have to be drawn across the bodies of real people .

It is always easier to speak of division than to speak of good policy . But that is what is needed now . The colonial-era divisions were a mess . But seeking to change them now , at this moment , is a recipe for a generation of war . For better or worse , the Middle East is stuck with the lines drawn by Sykes-Picot .
