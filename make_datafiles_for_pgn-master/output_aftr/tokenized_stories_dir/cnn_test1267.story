-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Robert Molnar has a vision : an ocean race from New York to the Canadian Pacific city of Victoria , via the Arctic .

`` Because of climate change , we can do this race , '' Molnar told CNN .

He pictures oceangoing sailboats hugging the Atlantic coast up through Halifax to western Greenland , then heading west through the Northwest Passage to Tuktoyaktuk on Canada 's Arctic coastline , before rounding Alaska to Dutch Harbor and , at last , Victoria .

In 2017 , Molnar plans to make this a reality in the form of the Sailing the Arctic Race , or STAR .

`` The Arctic is the big attraction . There is a romanticism about it , '' says the 66-year-old , who spent decades working in advertising while nursing his passion for sailing .

Sea ice conditions are much more favorable to shipping in the 21st century , and that makes Molnar confident his race can work .

`` But it is dangerous . It is definitely an extreme sport . ''

Molnar tells CNN he has Volvo Ocean Race participants prepared to take part in the inaugural race through the Northwest Passage , scheduled to begin in June 2017 and end in late September or early October .

`` We already have more people willing to attend than there are spaces for boats , '' he adds . `` I want to go with 20 to 25 boats and the good thing is we have so many people wanting to go .

`` That means we can pick who is the best-financed and who is the most experienced and , by doing so , we reduce the danger of trouble . ''

`` All the races in the Southern Ocean currently , interestingly , have waypoints which keep them away from the main danger of icebergs , '' notes Haworth . `` This race , clearly , wo n't be able to do that . So that 's a different safety philosophy .

Mario Pelletier represents those authorities . As assistant commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard , he shares Haworth 's concerns .

`` If we 're talking the Northwest Passage , the ice conditions we 're seeing -- with multi-year ice coming down from the high Arctic -- it would be a huge challenge for 2017 , '' says Pelletier .

`` It 's certainly not something , with the conditions we see today , that is likely to happen . And that is the first I 've heard of it . ''

Molnar dismisses the suggestion his race will not go ahead , claiming the contested ownership of high Arctic waters is providing the political clout to push the event forward .

`` Canada wants to say , ` the Northwest Passage belongs to us . ' There is a reason the Canadian prime minister , Stephen Harper , was just there . He wants to make sure this is part of Canada .

`` We will do that without the military . We will do that with sport . ''

The project is self-financed for now , though Molnar adds `` quite a bit of federal , provincial and local sponsorship '' has been secured .

STAR 's plans call for children at each stopover destination on the race route to engage in up to six months of related schoolwork prior to the race 's visit , culminating in presentations to local political and industry leaders .

`` This is almost the most important part of the race , '' says Molnar .

`` I do n't think we will save the planet , but we can show people how beautiful this place is -- and just do n't mess it up . If you go there , go there gently . ''
