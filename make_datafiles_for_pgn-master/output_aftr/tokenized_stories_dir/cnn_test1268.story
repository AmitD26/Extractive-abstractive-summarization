An official fund for victims ' families , and the community as a whole , has now been established : The Sandy Hook School Support Fund , set up by the United Way of Western Connecticut will provide support services to families and the community . All donations to this fund will go directly to those affected .

The Newtown Parent Connection has also pledged to try and bring in extra counselors to help parents cope .

Chewie , Barnabas , Hannah and others will be visiting schoolchildren , attending funerals and memorial services , and will be at the memorial area . You can donate to help support the dogs ' visit to Newtown here .

For families from the Newtown area , and even beyond , a pressing problem will be how to help children cope with the aftermath of this tragedy -- and indeed how to give parents space to grieve , knowing their children are being looked after . To that end , Save The Children has opened a `` child-friendly space '' in Newtown to give kids a place to play and express themselves while parents seek support or counseling . The space is located in Newtown 's Reed Intermediate School , where students of Sandy Hook elementary go after graduating .

In addition , Save The Children has released 10 tips for parents wondering how to help their children deal with their feelings about such a traumatic event , such as spending extra time with your kids , and limiting TV time .

A number of other organizations , such as the National Association of School Psychologists , and the American Academy of Pediatrics , have released recommendations for parents and teachers as to how to support children if they want to talk about what happened .

The US Postal Service has added a PO Box for those who wish to send letters of condolence to the residents of Newtown . Please address mail to : Message of Condolence , PO Box 3700 , Newtown , CT 06470 .

You can also send words of support and messages for families affected in an evergram here . They will be collated and given to the families in the future .
