Kiev -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia 's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a treaty Thursday to annex the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine , prompting tougher sanctions from the United States .

Russia responded with its own sanctions against a list of U.S. officials and lawmakers .

Speaking `` on behalf '' of Putin , Lavrov had told the State Duma that folding Crimea into Russia was needed to protect ethnic Russians there .

Approval of the treaty in the State Duma was in no doubt as Russia has stood defiant despite Western leaders denouncing Moscow 's actions as a violation of Ukraine 's sovereignty and a breach of international law .

EU member states also are threatening possible tougher targeted measures , European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters .

But U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced more sanctions on individuals and one bank in response to Russia 's annexation moves .

He also signed a new executive order that authorizes possible further sanctions on what he called `` key sectors '' of the Russian economy if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation .

`` This is not our preferred outcome . These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy , but could also be disruptive to the global economy , '' he said . `` However Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community . ''

Russia must respect `` basic principles '' of sovereignty and territorial integrity , he said , adding that the United States should also provide financial support for Ukraine 's government and people .

Sanctions lists

That bank was listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as Bank Rossiya .

The individuals named by the Treasury include major Putin allies , both in the Kremlin and in business . Among the 16 government officials listed are Putin 's chief of staff , Sergei Ivanov ; the speaker of the State Duma , Sergey Naryshkin ; and Viktor Ozerov , chairman of the Security and Defense Committee of the Russia parliament 's upper house .

Four others were named as members of the government 's inner circle . They are financier Yuri Kovalchuk , labeled Putin 's personal banker by a senior U.S. administration official ; magnate Gennady Timchenko , whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin , according to the Treasury ; and businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg .

Besides Russia 's Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin , The expanded EU sanctions target list includes two advisors to President Putin , Sergey Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov , as well as the chairwoman of the Russian Senate Valentina Matvienko .

Boehner 's spokesman , Michael Steel , said the lawmaker was `` proud to be included on a list of those willing to stand against Putin 's aggression . ''

McCain responded , `` I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off , my Gazprom stock is lost , and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen . Nonetheless , I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom , independence , and territorial integrity of Ukraine , including Crimea . ''

The U.S. Treasury said Bank Rossiya is controlled by Yuri Kovalchuk and is the 17th-largest bank in Russia .

`` As a result of Treasury 's action , any assets of the persons designated today that are within U.S. jurisdiction must be frozen , '' the Treasury said .

Finland 's Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Alexander Stubb told CNN more names would be added Thursday .

`` There will probably be over 10 new names on the list and then of course people are going to argue , are these people good to be on the list , bad to be on the list are they to be taken seriously and so on , but there will be more names , '' Stubb said .

Kiev defiant

Russia 's defense minister assured U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in phone call Thursday that Russian troops on the Ukraine border do not intend to cross the border or take aggressive action , Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said .

Hagel made it clear in the lengthy and sometimes `` direct '' talk with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu that the Russians bear responsibility for what happens in Crimea , including the recent violence , since they are in control there , Kirby said .

While Russia insists its actions are legitimate , Ukraine 's parliament said Thursday that Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea , even if the country 's new leaders have discussed evacuating military personnel from the region .

In a declaration published online , the Kiev parliament said `` Crimea was , is and will be part of Ukraine . ''

`` The Ukrainian people will never , under no circumstances , stop fighting for the liberation of Crimea from the occupants , no matter how hard and long it is . ''

In a televised briefing , Andriy Porubiy , secretary of the national defense and security council , said that if the United Nations designates Crimea a `` demilitarized zone , '' Ukraine is prepared to evacuate its military personnel and family members . Ukraine has facilities ready to accommodate 25,000 evacuees .

Porubiy had also said the measures included a full-scale visa system for Russians .

Speaking in Brussels on Thursday , Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Kiev was in no hurry to impose a visa regime on Russia , since it could negatively affect Ukrainians living in the predominantly Russian-speaking east of the country .

As diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continue , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon traveled to Russia Thursday , where he met Putin and Lavrov . He will then head to Kiev where he will meet acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov and Yatsenyuk on Friday .

Amid signs the uneasy standoff between pro-Russian and Ukrainian forces could ignite into bloody conflict , about 300 armed men stormed the naval base in Sevastopol on Wednesday . They took away Ukrainian navy chief Sergey Gaiduk .

A statement on the presidential site said Gaiduk and several other hostages had been freed . They were released during the night and were on their way to Kiev Thursday .

Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu had asked authorities in Crimea to free Gaiduk and allow him safe passage out of the region .

After that fatality -- the first Ukrainian military death since the Crimean crisis erupted about three weeks ago -- Ukraine 's Defense Ministry authorized its forces to open fire in self-defense .
