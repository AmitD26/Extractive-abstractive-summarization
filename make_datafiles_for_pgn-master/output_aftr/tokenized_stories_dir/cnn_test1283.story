Welcome to Serbia 2012 , or should that be Bristol 1909 ?

Racism row shines light on Serbian football

At first glance , Walter Tull , an officer in the British Army during the First World War and England Under-21 footballer Danny Rose appear to have little in common .

Rose is a successful Premier League footballer , at the start of a promising career , which he hopes will see him become a full international .

One man is on our television screen with pictures being sent around the world , the other has no grave , only an inscription on the memorial wall at the Fauborg-Amiens war cemetery and memorial at Arras .

Black pioneer

But Tull 's story , recorded some 93 years ago , could not be more apt given what Rose was forced to endure in Krusevac .

While most were left stunned by Rose being sent off for his reaction to being targeted by racist chanting , the tale is all too familiar for those who know their history .

Like Rose , he too suffered racial abuse from the stands with his career almost disappearing from history and public consciousness .

`` I think the play will be very topical , '' said Vasili , author of the biography Walter Tull , 1888-1918 : Officer , Footballer .

`` It 's quite poignant that the play should start so soon given what happened to Rose in Serbia .

`` Rose was racially abused and then sent off , Walter was also abused before being dropped by Tottenham and eventually sold .

`` Both men were punished twice . It 's funny how something which happened nearly a century ago could be so relevant . ''

If it was n't for Vasili 's work the story of the man who changed the face of football for black Britons could have been confined to the scrapheap of history .

Initially Vasili 's attempts to get publishers or media outlets interested in Tull 's story appeared to hit a dead end .

`` I first came across him in 1993 and there was nothing contemporary about him , he had almost become forgotten , '' Vasili recalled .

`` With the play and the film , we 're hoping to show people that whatever obstacles you face , you can achieve the things you strive for .

`` Symbolically , Britain has been a multicultural place for a long time . Tull had a black father and a white mother and if you look at the number of mixed-race footballers , he led the way for them . ''

The grandson of slaves in Barbados , his father arrived in England in 1876 following abolition some 43 years earlier . Walter 's mother , Alice , died when he was just seven before his father passed away two years later .

With all six children surviving their parents ' death , the demands on their stepmother , Clara , were too much to bear and Tull along with his brother Edward were taken to live in a Methodist orphanage in Bethnal Green , east London .

When Edward was adopted two years later by a couple from Glasgow and went on to become the first black dentist in the city , Walter turned to football to help with his solitude .

It was here , while training to be a printer , Walter caught the eye with his football skills and soon won a trial with amateur side Clapton F.C.

Vitriolic racism

His success , which helped the club win the Amateur Cup , London Senior Cup and London County Amateur Cup in the 1908-1909 season , secured him a dream move to Tottenham Hotspur .

Crime and punishment in sport : Laying down the law ?

`` The game at Bristol was the first time I came across racism being mentioned in a match report , '' said Vasili .

`` In previous reports , writers would use coded language such as ` Tull took unwarranted abuse ' but there was no hiding it in this Bristol game . ''

The Football Star described the Bristol City fans racist chants as `` lower than Billingsgate '' , while another newspaper labeled it as `` a cowardly attack '' .

One reporter vented his fury by writing , `` Let me tell those Bristol hooligans that Tull is so clean in his mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football . ''

Under Herbert Chapman , the future manager of Arsenal , Walter enjoyed great success , making 110 appearances and attracting the interest of Scottish giants Glasgow Rangers .

The First World War broke out in 1914 , with Tull signing up to the 17th Service Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment , which was nicknamed , `` The Diehards '' .

Military bravery

In May 1917 , he was appointed an officer , despite it being technically illegal .

`` I guess he never received the medal because the rules at the time prohibited it , '' added Vasili . `` Perhaps those on the ground did n't realize and some civil servant or bureaucrat must have pointed it out .

`` They could n't have given an award to a black soldier and not a white soldier at the time . ''

In Italy , he led his men at the Battle of Piave and was commended for his outstanding leadership abilities by his peers .

After finishing in Italy , Walter was transferred to the Somme Valley in France . It was on March 25 , 1918 while trying to escape a German advance at Favreuil , that he was fatally injured by machine gun fire .

`` Such was Walter 's bond with his men that even with the machine guns firing , his men still tried to recover his body , '' said Vasili .

`` They risked their lives to try and bring him back because he was a person who they all looked up to and respected . He was a very humble character , who wanted to be judged by his actions and deeds .

`` I think that his Methodist background gave him a code to live by and helped guide him through life . ''
