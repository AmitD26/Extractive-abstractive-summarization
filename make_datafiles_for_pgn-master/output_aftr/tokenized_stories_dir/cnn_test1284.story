-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A California Department of Motor Vehicles -LRB- DMV -RRB- employee who allegedly wrote a letter to a transgender woman and condemned her to hell has resigned , officials said Thursday .

The employee , who worked for the DMV for two years , resigned Wednesday and will not receive benefits or unemployment , according to department spokesman Mike Marando .

`` I have learned that the reason for the vast majority of gender change operations is the client 's homosexual orientation , '' the letter dated October 22 states . `` The homosexual act is an abomination that leads to hell . ''

Yust said she also got a pamphlet from a church , which she said contained offensive material directed at her sexual orientation and gender .

The DMV employee had been placed on administrative leave with pay pending an investigation after Yust came forward , according to the San Francisco Chronicle .

George Valverde , director of the DMV , in a statement Thursday said the employee `` acted well outside the course and scope of his duties . We recognized this was unacceptable and wholly unauthorized behavior by this former employee . ''

The DMV employee went through a discipline process and received sensitivity training and counseling after that incident , Marando said . Other DMV employees also received training on transgender situations , he said .

`` We emphasize that customers are treated fairly and equitably , '' Marando said .

Dolan has filed a damage claim with the state , saying Yust suffered embarrassment and emotional distress . It asks for damages in excess of $ 25,000 .
