-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazil 's national football team may have been smoked on the pitch by Germany , but now government officials are claiming a 2014 FIFA World Cup victory of another sort .

According to figures released this week by Brazil 's federal government , the World Cup was a triumph for the country 's transportation and tourism industries .

`` We lost the trophy , but Brazil won the World Cup , '' said Aloisio Mercadante , Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff 's chief of staff , in a statement .

Additionally , according to the government , of the million foreign visitors , `` 95 % of them said they intend to return . ''

`` We were saying that we would host the World Cup of World Cups , '' said President Rousseff in a statement . `` Indeed , we staged the World Cup of World Cups .

`` We had one problem , our match against Germany . However ... we beat the pessimistic predictions and hosted the World Cup of World Cups with the immense and wonderful contribution of our people . ''

Not everyone on board

Citing figures from the Brazilian Airline Association , that story projected total air travel in Brazil falling 11 % to 15 % during the World Cup compared with the same period in 2013 . The story blamed hiked-up prices and large crowds for scaring off domestic tourists .

Economists who study the impact of large sporting and other events on local and national economies tend to be less sanguine than the governments that host them .

`` Every time you get a World Cup tourist you get one less regular tourist , '' Dr. Andrew Zimbalist , a sports economist and economics professor at Smith College in Massachusetts , tells CNN .

Zimbalist says it 's doubtful Brazil 's international tourism profile will experience long-term positive impact as a result of the World Cup .

Furthermore , he said , the World Cup wo n't provide sustained promotion for the smaller of the event 's 12 host cities .

The Amazonas city of Manaus is an example .

More where that came from

Turning mega-sporting events such as the World Cup and Olympics into proxy tourism campaigns remains an uncertain enterprise .

Meanwhile , a decade after hosting the 2004 summer games , Olympic venues in Athens have become decaying ghost towns .
