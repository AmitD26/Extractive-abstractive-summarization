-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Practically from the day the Space Age started on October 4 , 1957 , when the Soviet Union launched the first human-made satellite into Earth orbit , it 's been like this . Every time there 's a conspicuous breakthrough in space , somebody , somewhere will find a way to kill the buzz .

Americans ' consensus love-hate for space exploration has assumed many forms over the years . Once the nation got over its collective shock-and-awe of Sputnik , its citizenry demanded that its scientists and politicians figure out a way to get our own projectiles up there ASAP . We did it , with some notable disasters on the way , at which time the moaning over whether we should spend so much taxpayer money on such risky endeavors would begin .

Both these catastrophes were too reminiscent of the serial test failures of the 1950s in which rockets regularly blew up before reaching the stratosphere and test pilots seeking faster , higher records in the same Mojave skies lost their planes and their lives . It was through such trial and error that , eventually , America got proficient enough to send satellites and people into space and succeed much more often than it did n't .

And we fell in love .

The romance of space flight became part of our national identity , especially after we started sending humans of our own . As we exceeded our planetary boundaries by sending probes , and then men to the moon , other boundaries seemed less daunting and forbidding .

My own cheerleading for space travel was often countered with some spoilsport , honest and sincere , complaining that all that money being shot into the skies could be put to better use on Earth : e.g. . Why do we need to go to Mars when we have all these problems on Earth to solve ?

For a long time , I had no strong counterargument . But now , with the space shuttle program literally mounted in museums and no government plans to return to the moon or head for Mars any time soon , I find myself asking how that solving-problems-on-Earth thing is going now .

I 'm still waiting for a sensible answer , but I do n't think one exists . The urge to explore and push ourselves out into the universe is not mutually exclusive from the effort to improve our own minds and environment .

Even the movies bring this up . `` We used to be explorers and pioneers , '' says a character in the just-released science fiction spectacular , `` Interstellar . '' `` Now we 're a generation of caretakers . '' Christopher Nolan 's film conceives a potential future in which what 's left of NASA has gone underground to figure out options for humankind literally choking to death on ecological decay on Earth . In this future , it seems as though the moon-landing-denial constituency has gained such a foothold in the public schools that a student can get in trouble for suggesting we did in fact land on the moon .

Americans loved-hated space travel since challenge of Sputnik . They want in , but leery of cost
