Jose Mourinho 's men have been far and away the best team in England over recent months but were frustrated by their opponents who thoroughly deserved their point from this hard-fought 0-0 draw .

Brazilian midfielder Willian struck a post midway through a first-half that saw Chelsea repeatedly press forward and Sunderland frantically try to keep them at bay .

Gus Poyet 's men were well drilled and composed , a far cry from the side that conceded eight to Southampton just a few weeks ago .

But it was n't all hustle and bustle from the Black Cats who also chances of their own . Santiago Vergini came closest when he grazed the crossbar after swiveling to connect with a Lee Cattermole cross .

A Gary Cahill header and a stinging drive from Nemanja Matic was the extent of opportunities until midway through the second half .

It appeared Sunderland had been applying the rope-a-dope strategy until this point , becoming stronger as the game wore on .

Adam Johnson screwed wide when it looked easier to score after a shot from Jose Altidore fell at his feet 13-yards out .

The tie means Chelsea are now seven points clear at the top of the EPL table , although that lead could be cut to four points if Southampton triumph at home to Manchester City Sunday .
