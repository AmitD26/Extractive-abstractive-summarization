-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- How does your sex life measure up ? That 's the central premise of `` The Normal Bar , '' a new book by Chrisanna Northrup and sociologists Pepper Schwartz and James Witte .

Based on the responses of an Internet survey of some 70,000 people , `` The Normal Bar '' endeavors to ease people 's concerns about their sexual relationships by providing readers with an idea of what 's `` normal '' for most couples -- from how often they have sex , to how sexually adventurous they are , to how they romance each other outside the bedroom .

`` It is n't about a 98.6 kind of normal -- just the normal of exceptionally happy couples -LRB- gay and straight -RRB- and what we can learn from them , '' Schwartz says .

One juicy nugget -- 86 % of all men and women are intrigued by having kinky sex . `` This just goes to show that both men and women want to be kept on their toes , '' says Patty Brisben , sex educator and entrepreneur . `` I ca n't think of any couple who would be ` satisfied ' with predictable sex for the same reason people do n't watch the same movie every weekend : There 's no mystery , no excitement . ''

Adds social psychologist Justin Lehmiller , `` Almost all couples , both heterosexual and same-sex , worry about how their relationship stacks up . This naturally leads us to compare our relationships to those of other couples . ''

It may be natural , but is that comparison healthy ? It depends , say experts .

`` Because kink and open relationships are more common among lesbian , gay and bisexual people , these couples face more options and choices , something that can add a layer of complexity to a couple 's sex life as well as more freedom . ''

`` Responses like these might encourage some women to raise the bar on how they talk and act in the bedroom , '' sex educator Jamye Waxman says .

`` Men are often described as rigidly separating sex and feelings , '' he says . `` However , many straight , gay or bisexual men I encounter in my clinical practice appreciate meaningful sexual intimacy . They often long for a sexuality anchored in the complicity and playfulness of their romantic relationship . ''
