-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The days of memorizing arcane , recondite vocabulary words might be ending for high school students who will take a redesigned SAT in two years .

With fewer questions overall , the new test aims to assess students ' analytical skills and better help them prepare for college .

`` Recent SAT results tell a troubling story about students ' readiness for and likelihood for success in their postsecondary endeavors , '' the College Board said . `` Far too few students are ready to succeed in the kinds of education and training that they will need to participate effectively in an increasingly competitive economy . ''

The College Board released 211 pages of detailed test specifications , including sample questions to show how the test is changing . Here 's a look at some examples across all sections :

With 153 questions -- 52 in reading , 44 in writing and language and 57 in math -- the new test will have fewer questions than the current version 's 171 questions . But , there will be no more mandatory essay , leading to the next big change .

For example , the College Board documents provide a passage and asked students to write an essay explaining how the author `` builds an argument to persuade his audience '' by looking for `` evidence , such as facts or examples , to support claims , '' or stylistic elements , `` such as word choice '' to add power to the ideas expressed in the passage .

No more $ 5 words ! `` Relevant words '' are in :

Here 's an example :

`` The coming decades will likely see more intense clustering of jobs , innovation , and productivity in a smaller number of bigger cities and city-regions . Some regions could end up bloated beyond the capacity of their infrastructure , while others struggle , their promise stymied by inadequate human or other resources . ''

C -RRB- brilliant

D -RRB- determined

The test will `` focus on math that matters most -- algebra :

Students will have 80 minutes -- 10 minutes longer than the current version -- to answer 57 math questions . Most will be multiple-choice but some will require students to provide answers . And , unlike the current version , students will be required to put away their calculators for 25 minutes .

Students will have to analyze texts based on the strength of the writer 's arguments

Students will be asked to demonstrate their ability to interpret and synthesize the underlying ideas of a variety of sources , from informational graphics and political speeches to fiction novels and scholarly texts .

One sample question asks students to read a political speech and determine which lines support the overall argument .
