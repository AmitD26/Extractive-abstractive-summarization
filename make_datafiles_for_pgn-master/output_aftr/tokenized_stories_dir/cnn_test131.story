The sheriff 's office told CNN there have been ongoing issues with Hakken since he attended an anti-government rally somewhere in Louisiana in June of last year . He was arrested at the rally on multiple drug charges , officials said .

At some point over the past few months , the children were sent to Tampa to live with their grandmother , Patricia Hauser , the mother of Sharyn Hakken .

`` Somehow they found out where the kids were and an Amber Alert is being issued now , '' said Detective Larry McKinnon of the Hillsborough County Sheriff 's Office .

Authorities said the abducted children are Chase Hakken , 2 , and Cole Hakken , 4 . Both have brown hair and brown eyes and were last seen wearing pajamas .

`` We suspect that the wife is with him . He has a history of being armed , '' McKinnon said .

Investigators have brought in the FBI to help them track the family , who could have left the state of Florida by Wednesday afternoon .
