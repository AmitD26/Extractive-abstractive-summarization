It also includes a six-game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct , including domestic violence and sexual assault , which Commissioner Roger Goodell had written about in an August memo to owners . The suspension could be longer if there are `` possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances . ''

Goodell called the enhanced policy `` significantly more robust , thorough and formal . '' It applies to all NFL personnel , not just players .

`` Sadly , those discussions will be through the media , not through formal negotiations , which the NFL has said they 're not interested in . ''

In a statement on its website , the players ' union said it was never offered the professional courtesy of seeing the new policy before it was announced publicly .

`` The victim is an afterthought in this ` new ' policy -- as she was in the old policy , '' NOW President Terry O'Neill said in a written statement . `` There is no guarantee that economic support will be there for as long as it takes for a victim to get back on her feet , and no indication that the NFL even understands that a six-game unpaid suspension could spark even higher level of violence . ''

A new conduct committee will include Cardinals owner Michael Bidwell , Falcons owner Arthur Blank , Chiefs owner Clark Hunt , Bears owner George McCaskey and Texans owner Robert McNair . Other members are Dee Haslam , the wife of Browns owner Jimmy Haslam ; Cowboys Executive Vice President Charlotte Jones Anderson and two former players who hold ownership stakes -- Warrick Dunn and John Stallworth .

Their job will be to review the policy at least once a year .
