North Korea 's decision comes as tensions on the Korean peninsula escalate over Kim Jong Un 's threats to wage war against the United States and South Korea .

`` And I reiterate again the United States will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies , Korea and Japan . We are fully prepared and capable of doing so , and I think the DPRK understands that . ''

Those facilities include a uranium enrichment facility and a reactor that was `` mothballed and disabled '' under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks among North Korea , the United States and four other nations , KCNA said .

The announcement was followed by a plea for calm from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who is South Korean .

`` The current crisis has already gone too far , '' he said in a statement from Andorra . `` Nuclear threats are not a game . Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counteractions , and fuel fear and instability .

`` Things must begin to calm down , as this situation , made worse by the lack of communication , could lead down a path that nobody should want to follow . ''

Ban said dialogue and negotiations are `` the only way to resolve the current crisis . ''

The tensions on the Korean Peninsula have led Pyongyang to sever a key military hot line with Seoul and declare void the 1953 armistice that stopped the Korean War .

The United States has made a show of its military strength amid annual training exercises with South Korea , flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons , Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea .

On Tuesday , the United States positioned a second destroyer -- the USS Decatur -- near the Korean peninsula , a defense official said on condition of anonymity . The official was not authorized to release details to the media .

North Korea on Wednesday also blocked more than 480 South Korean workers from entering the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Complex , which sits on the North Korea side of the border , according to the South Korean Unification Ministry .

`` North Korea said today that it is only approving people to go back to South Korea and not approving entrance '' to the complex , said Kim Hyung-seok , a spokesman for the ministry . He urged the North to resume letting workers enter .

The symbol of an era of better relations between Seoul and Pyongyang , Kaesong is a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas where scores of South Korean companies operate . It also is an important source of hard currency for the North .

The move comes after threats in recent days by Pyongyang to shut down the industrial complex .

Seoul , meanwhile , on Monday warned that any provocative moves from North Korea would trigger a strong response `` without any political considerations . ''

Murky motivation

The motivation behind the North 's announcement Tuesday on the nuclear facilities was unclear , said Ramesh Thakur , director of the Center for Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament at Australian National University in Canberra , suggesting that it was unlikely to make a big difference militarily for the country , which is already believed to have four to 10 nuclear weapons .

China , a key North Korean ally , expressed regret over Pyongyang 's announcement about the reactor .

On Tuesday , Kerry refused to speculate about North Korea 's intentions or what its strategy may be with regard to its plans to reopen its reactor .

Kerry was scheduled to visit Seoul next week , while South Korea 's president was due in Washington for talks with President Barack Obama .

South Korea warns North of ` strong response ' to any attack

A torrent of threats

The North 's latest declaration comes after a stream of verbal attacks against South Korea and the United States in recent weeks , including the threat of a nuclear strike .

Pyongyang 's angry words appear to have been fueled by the recent joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea in the region , as well as tougher U.N. sanctions in response to North Korea 's latest nuclear test in February .

Much of the bellicose rhetoric , analysts say , is n't matched by the country 's military capabilities .

Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans

Yongbyon 's back story

But two months later , as its then-leader , Kim Jong Il , balked at U.S. demands for close inspections of its nuclear facilities , the North started to express second thoughts .

It said it was suspending the disabling of its nuclear facilities and considering steps to restore the facilities at Yongbyon `` to their original state . ''

In November 2009 , it announced it was reprocessing nuclear fuel rods as part of measures to resume activities at Yongbyon . It noted success in turning the plutonium it had extracted into weapons-grade material .
