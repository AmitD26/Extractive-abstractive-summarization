-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It might be a bit of a blur to everyone else , but Lionel Messi always seems to keep a clear head -- even in the most pressurized situations .

Mike Hewitt 's artful image of the Argentina star in action against Mexico at the last World Cup in South Africa captures his dynamism down to a tee .

`` I had planned to go up into the crowd , '' Hewitt told CNN 's Sports Photo Masterclass series .

The FIFA-accredited Hewitt protested , stayed put and the game started . Then the police arrived .

The image was captured using a technique called panning , where the photographer follows a moving subject during an exposure .

A successful shot will blur the background , giving a sense of movement and speed while keeping the subject , or part of it , in focus .

`` I had a couple of attempts earlier that did n't really work -- a lot of the frames are a complete blur . But then luckily he had a good run down the wing , '' says Hewitt , who is Senior World Cup photographer at leading agency Getty .

`` The key thing you 're trying to do is freeze the head , and we 're quite lucky that the ball looks fairly frozen as well . ''

Messi 's forward-leaning , athletic pose is amplified by the disorganized tangle of arms and legs of his straggling opponent .

`` It actually works better in other sports , particularly ones when they 're on a predictable path like athletics or speed skating , '' Hewitt says of the panning technique .

When he 's not snapping a match action , the 52-year-old is always on the lookout for salable pictures elsewhere .

A good example was a beautiful shot of kids playing football taken in the week before the 2010 tournament kicked off .

`` We were driving back from Johannesburg when my colleague saw these children playing football in this sort of dirt ditch on the edge of a very large township , '' Hewitt explains .

`` The office and the world media were crying out for an image that showed football in South Africa and I 'd like to think that this one summed it up quite nicely . ''

The image of Brazilian players ' hands clutching the trophy following their penalty shootout victory over Italy in the 1994 final will be instantly recognizable to football fans worldwide .

`` I think a large part of its success is that you 've got different ethnic groups holding it -- you 've got white guys and black guys . I think this is Romario and Dunga holding the trophy . ''

`` It 's probably my biggest-selling image . It 's been used everywhere . You see it on games , books and god knows what ! '' he says .

As Brazil 2014 heads toward its climax in Rio de Janeiro 's famous Maracana Stadium on Sunday , Hewitt will be pitch-side once again , ready for another shot at getting his name onto the front pages .

It 's what he lives for .
