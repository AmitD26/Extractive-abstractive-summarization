-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- No advanced seat selection , no changes or refunds .

Nope . It 's Delta Air Lines ' new `` Basic Economy '' fare , part of the airline 's new five-fare class of pricing starting March 1 .

No longer content to just offer first-class and coach-cabin seating , Delta is splitting its aircraft into five fare classes .

Travelers who want more than `` Basic Economy '' will pay more -- Delta 's not saying yet how much more -- although that 's already the reality for many travelers .

Delta topped that list , collecting $ 1.67 billion last year : $ 840 million in reservation change/cancellation fees and $ 833 million in baggage fees . United Airlines came in second place with $ 1.38 billion in fees : $ 756 million in reservation cancellation/change fees and nearly $ 625 million in baggage fees .

Delta hopes its new seating options will also be profitable . Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum : The first-class cabin will be split into `` First Class '' for domestic routes and `` Delta One '' for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights .

The `` First Class '' fare includes `` first to board '' rights , preflight alcoholic drinks , snacks on flights longer than 250 miles and meals on flights longer than 900 miles . The `` Delta One '' elite first class fare includes access to Delta Sky Clubs , full flat-bed seats on widebody aircraft , in-flight bedding , chef-curated menus , noise-reduction headsets and more .

The `` Delta Comfort + '' coach fare on all flights will include priority boarding and dedicated overhead bin space , alcoholic drinks , premium snacks , premium entertainment , up to 4 more inches of legroom and quilted seat covers .

A three-way split in the coach question raises the question : `` Will these new economy fares be lower than previously , because you 're getting less ? '' asked George Hobica , founder of AirWatchdog.com . `` Or will you get less for the same fare ? ''

And who will guard that dedicated overhead bin space for `` Delta Comfort + '' travelers , Hobica asks . Already harried flight attendants trying to negotiate passengers in already crowded planes ?

Aviation journalist Jason Rabinowitz argues that not much will actually change at Delta .

Travel blogger Christina Saull likes the simplified fare benefits chart but is troubled by that basic fare .
