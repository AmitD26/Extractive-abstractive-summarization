As Spain 's economy finds new lows , there is one clear winner in the eurozone crisis : Hong Kong football .

`` I 've decided to come to Hong Kong because opportunities in my country are n't very promising , '' former Spanish La Liga player Lander Panera told CNN .

Panera , 30 , was concerned about the economy in his home country and chose this year to settle in a place where growth is robust .

Ken Ng , head of Hong Kong Kitchee , one of the top local teams , has been working with former Spanish athletes for years to develop local players .

Recently , the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charity Trust donated US$ 5.7 million to Kitchee to start a football talent development center . The project aims to make stars out of young Hongkongers with potential .

`` It 's all about youth development , youth training , and hopefully in six , or eight , or 10 years time we 'll have a much better group of youngsters coming through our program , and that will help Hong Kong be one of the strongest teams in Asia , '' Ng told CNN . '' -LSB- We -RSB- will give Japan a run for their money . ''

Ng brought two Spanish veterans to the Far East to help : Josep Gombau , a veteran of Barcelona youth football education and current Kitchee head coach , and retired La Liga player Roberto `` Chino '' Losada , also a former Kitchee player .

`` We will give them a view of the world , '' Ng told CNN , `` every year we will take them to Spain . '' There , the players will compete in events like the Mediterranean International Cup , a top juvenile international tournament held in Catalonia . The Kitchee 's team competed there last March .

`` It 's all about youth development , youth training , '' Ng said .
