Though it never lost power , the ship was diverted to Freeport in the Bahamas , and the fire , which began in a mooring area , was extinguished just before 5 a.m. , the company said .

`` We probably ran up to that deck faster than we ever ran before , '' Miller said by phone from Freeport on Monday afternoon , a few hours after the ship docked . `` We were terrified , though , and a lot of people were just crying and freaking out . ''

Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said she did n't have further information about the medical reports , `` but the ship has told us that there are no medical emergencies onboard . ''

The fire started on an aft mooring deck and spread to the fourth deck at the crew lounge area before it was extinguished , U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said . Information on the fire 's cause was n't available , she said .

Miller and the rest of the passengers will be flying home from Freeport because the company canceled the rest of the voyage Monday afternoon .

Royal Caribbean said it was arranging flights to get passengers back to Baltimore , where the ship left port on Friday on a seven-night cruise . The first flight carrying cruise guests from the Bahamas left Tuesday morning , and flights will continue throughout the day , Royal Caribbean said .

All passengers will receive refunds for this cruise and a certificate toward a future cruise , Royal Caribbean said .

The company apologized for the stress to passengers and thanked them for their `` patience and cooperation in dealing with this unfortunate situation . ''

Cruise goers will miss scheduled port calls at CocoCay and Nassau in the Bahamas . CocoCay is Royal Caribbean 's `` private island paradise '' in the Bahamas , according to its website .

Video captured by Miller and her friend , Katie Coleman , shows guests gathered on a deck , seemingly calm , wearing orange life jackets and listening to instructions .

`` We 're on deck right now , 3 a.m. , in our life jackets . Not a drill , not a joke , '' a narrator in Miller 's video says .

The ship arrived at Freeport about 10:15 a.m. , Royal Caribbean said . Throughout , the power , propulsion and communications systems were uninterrupted , the company said .

`` Even though it was terrifying , they tried their best to make everyone comfortable . They 're so well-trained that I felt confident that we would be OK , '' she said .
