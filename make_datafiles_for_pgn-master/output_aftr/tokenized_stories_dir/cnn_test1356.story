A day after he allegedly opened fire in the lobby of a Washington office building , in an act that increasingly appears to be politically motivated , Floyd Lee Corkins II remains largely an enigma .

Corkins ' antipathy towards those opposed to homosexuality could explain his alleged actions presence at the Family Research Council headquarters , a group that has been outspoken in its opposition to abortion , same-sex marriage , and other hot-button social issues .

Corkins lived with his mother and father in a middle class single-family home in Herndon , Virginia , a Washington bedroom community minutes from Dulles International Airport .

Mental health evaluation ordered

Prosecutors said they are still investigating the motive behind the shooting , and the motive could determine whether Corkins is charged with domestic terrorism or hate crimes .

Corkins is charged with the federal offense of interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition , along with the District of Columbia offense of assault with intent to kill while armed . The offenses carry the following maximum penalties : 10 years imprisonment on the federal offense and 30 years imprisonment on the District of Columbia offense . The District of Columbia offense also carries a mandatory-minimum term of five years imprisonment .

On Thursday , leaders on all sides of the same-sex marriage issue disavowed the use of violence .

`` I was shocked to hear that someone who has volunteered with the DC Center could be the cause of such a tragic act of violence . No matter the circumstances , we condemn such violence in the strongest terms possible , '' David Mariner , executive director of the DC Center for the LGBT Community said on a note posted on the center 's door .

`` We hope for a full and speedy recovery for the victim and our thoughts are with him and his family . ''
