The cardinals who must pick a successor to Pope Benedict XVI after he steps down on February 28 could meet to make the decision sooner than thought , a Vatican spokesman said Saturday .

The conclave , the meeting which will bring together the 117 cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church , could start before March 15 if all the cardinals are already in Rome , Father Federico Lombardi said .

Lombardi had previously said the conclave was likely to start between March 15 and 19 .

Opinion : Pope Benedict shows true leadership by resigning

Benedict is the first pope to step down in nearly 600 years , throwing the Vatican into some confusion .

Experts are working on points of the Apostolic Constitution that need to be clarified or interpreted , Lombardi said , and are expected to give pointers on the new protocol soon .

Lombardi said he had met with the pope Saturday morning and found him `` calm and relaxed even in these so emotional days . ''

More than two-thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope . The announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican .

He could remain at Castel Gondolfo until the end of April or early May while the works to ready a new residence for him in a monastery within the Vatican are completed , Lombardi said . Once there , he will devote himself to a life of reflection and prayer .

Benedict 's decision to remain in Vatican City has a practical as well as a spiritual motivation , he said .

His presence will enable him to support his successor and the rest of the clergy , Lombardi said , although he dismissed the idea that Benedict would interfere as the new pope takes charge .

The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII , who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope .
