His reputation is in tatters , the cycling victories that made him a legend are wiped away , and the sponsors that gave him enormous wealth have fled faster than a downhill race to a finish line . But that 's only the beginning .

His latest and biggest plunge came Monday when the International Cycling Union stripped the 41-year-old of his seven Tour de France titles .

`` Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling , '' said the union 's president , Pat McQuaid , announcing that Armstrong is also banned from the sport .

The decision followed this month 's finding by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency that there is `` overwhelming '' evidence Armstrong was involved as a professional cyclist in `` the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program . '' Armstrong has steadfastly maintained his innocence .

But he emphasized , `` Cycling has a future . ''

In a statement , the union wrote , `` Today 's young riders do not deserve to be branded or tarnished by the past or to pay the price for the Armstrong era . ''

The group , which officially goes by its French name Union Cycliste Internationale , or UCI , is the cycling 's world governing body .

Following the union 's announcement , the French Cycling Federation said it was reissuing its call for Armstrong to return 2.95 million euros -- nearly $ 4 million -- that he collected for winning the tours .

The Texas insurance company covered bonuses that Armstrong was promised if he won the Tour de France . In 2002 , it paid him $ 1.5 million ; in 2003 , $ 3 million , according to a Texas Monthly article that SCA posted on its website .

So the company could seek as much as $ 12 million back . In a statement Monday , SCA said it was `` considering all legal options to pursue a return of the funds paid by SCA to Mr. Armstrong . ''

Meanwhile , one of the sponsors that had n't yet given up on Armstrong dropped out Monday .

Armstrong did not comment Monday . At an event Sunday , he did not refer to the controversy directly but said it 's been `` an interesting and at times very difficult few weeks . ''

`` People ask me a lot how are you doing , '' he told participants in his foundation 's annual Ride for the Roses in Austin , Texas . `` And I tell them I 've been better , but I 've also been worse . ''

Though in the past he has often tweeted angry responses against those who accused him of doping , Armstrong has remained uncharacteristically quiet in recent days .

His attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN 's requests for comment Monday , and the foundation said it would not make a statement .

Armstrong 's story -- that of an outspoken cancer survivor who tamed the grueling three-week race more than any other cyclist before or since -- had made him a household name . But allegations of doping long dogged his career .

Then came the USADA finding .

McQuaid , speaking at a news conference , said he does not believe cycling will ever be free from doping , because `` I do n't think in any aspect of society there are no cheats . I do believe that doping can be hugely reduced . ''

The keys are education programs and how teams are structured , he said .

Monday 's news conference turned somewhat contentious as reporters asked whether the cycling union had looked the other way for years despite growing allegations of widespread doping in the sport . Armstrong had made two donations to the union for anti-doping technology .

McQuaid insisted his organization never ignored the concerns raised about possible doping . And he wrote off any suggestion that Armstrong 's contributions had led the organization to make any decision on the issue .

`` The UCI has tested Lance Armstrong 218 times . If Lance Armstrong was able to beat the system , then the responsibility for addressing that rests not only with the UCI but also with '' the anti-doping agencies that accepted the results , the cycling union said in its statement .

With Armstrong 's disgrace , will anything change ?

U.S. cyclist Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France victory in 2010 .

In the past , Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed . In its 202-page report , the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests .

`` Thus the number of actual controls on Mr. Armstrong over the years appears to have been considerably fewer than the number claimed by Armstrong and his lawyers , '' the USADA said .

The agency did n't say that Armstrong ever failed one of those tests , but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the test administrators altogether . Several riders also said team officials seemed to know when random drug tests were coming , the report said .
