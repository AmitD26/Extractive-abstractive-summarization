Devyani Khobragade , the Indian diplomat at the heart of a dispute that has strained ties between New Delhi and Washington , is on her way back to India from the United States , officials said .

But the Indian government denied a request by the State Department to waive Khobragade 's diplomatic immunity so she can answer the charges , U.S. and Indian officials said .

India said Friday that it had transferred her to the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi .

`` At the time of her departure for India , Counsellor Khobragade reiterated her innocence on charges filed against her , '' the ministry said in a statement . It was unclear when exactly she would arrive in India .

Allegations denied

Federal prosecutors allege Khobragade promised in the visa application under which her housekeeper moved from India to the United States to pay her at least $ 9.75 per hour , the minimum wage in New York , and to require she work no more than 40 hours per week .

`` She is pleased to be returning to her country , '' her attorney Dan Arshack said Thursday . `` Her head is held high . ''

Diplomatic status

Through that post , she was accorded `` the privileges and immunities of a diplomatic envoy , '' the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said .

When India refused the U.S. request to waive the immunity so that she could face the charges against her , she had to leave the country , the officials said .

Pressure from New Delhi

India has expressed outrage over the arrest of Khobragade , who was handcuffed and strip-searched by federal agents on December 12 after a complaint filed by Richard .

U.S. law enforcement officials have said that Khobragade 's strip-search was standard procedure and that she received a number of privileges not usually accorded to defendants .

Amid the uproar , Indian authorities removed concrete barriers from outside the U.S. Embassy and took away American diplomats ' identification cards .

That was followed recently by an order that the United States shut down `` commercial activities '' at a recreational facility at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi .

The multipurpose club in the embassy compound was used by nondiplomats , Indian officials said , accusing the U.S. of contravening an article of the Vienna Convention .

Khobragade 's father supported India 's order that the U.S. Embassy shut down what it said were commercial activities on the mission 's premises .

`` The charges against her are atrocious , and the treatment meted out to her inhuman , '' Uttam Khobragade said Thursday .

`` We have been in conversation with Indian counterparts about the dates , and we have agreed to hold the dialogue in the near future at a mutually convenient date , '' an Energy Department official said .

Human rights activists say India 's anger about the strip search misses the bigger issue . They say the mistreatment of domestic workers is a widespread and often overlooked problem worldwide .

Officials from both nations have repeatedly said that they hope the issue does not undermine their relations .
