A massive explosion at a train station in the Russian city of Volgograd killed at least 16 people , including one police officer , the Investigative Committee of Russia said on its website Sunday .

The head of the committee , Vladimir Markin , said 16 people had been killed and 34 people were injured , including a 9-year-old girl .

He said the bomber used the equivalent of 10 kilograms of TNT and included shrapnel .

Investigators also found an unexploded grenade .

President Vladimir Putin posted a message on the Kremlin 's website sending his condolences to the family of those killed and wishing a quick recovery to those hurt .

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack .

`` There can be no justification for such barbarous attacks . '' said NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen . `` NATO and Russia stand together in the fight against terrorism. , including by working together on technology to prevent attacks on public transport systems . ''

A White House spokeswoman said , `` Our hearts go out to the victims and their families . ''

In October , a bomber blew up a passenger bus , killing six people and wounding more than 30 others . Russian media reported that a female Islamist suicide bomber from the Russian region of Dagestan was responsible for the attack .

Volgograd , once called Stalingrad , is a major rail hub in the region , and each day thousands of passengers pass through the station , many on their way to Moscow . The station likely was packed with holiday travelers .

The restive region of Chechnya is also located in this southern portion of Russia .
