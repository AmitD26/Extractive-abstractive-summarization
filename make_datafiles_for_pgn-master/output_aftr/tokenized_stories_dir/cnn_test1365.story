-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Christopher Columbus has long been the poster boy Renaissance explorer who found fame and fortune by sailing from the Old World to the New .

Crossing the great unknown waters between Spain and the Caribbean in 1492 , he became one of the most renowned -- and pivotal -- Europeans to set foot in America .

But more than five centuries later , a British adventurer plans to show that the New World could have been reached by another seafaring nation 2,000 years before Columbus .

`` It is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it -LSB- before Columbus -RSB- , it was the Phoenicians , '' said Beale .

`` Of all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- Lebanon had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats , they were the first to use iron nails , and they had knowledge of astronomy and currents . ''

The prospect of sailing a 50-ton wooden vessel identical to those built 2,600 years ago across the Atlantic might appear foolhardy , had Beale not already challenged maritime history two years ago .

Setting sail from Syria in 2008 , The Phoenician covered 32,000 kilometers over two years , battling everything from six-meter waves off the Cape of Good Hope to Somali pirates .

`` We had run the gauntlet of pirate-infested waters , overcome numerous technical problems and traveled deep into the Indian and Atlantic Oceans , '' Beale says in a new book on the incredible voyage ; ` Sailing Close to the Wind . '

Beale based his ambitious quest on a quote by Greek Historian Herodotus , who claimed the Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa in 600BC .

Along with their sophisticated seafaring skills , the Phoenicians were renowned as an intellectual and industrious civilization who helped develop the alphabet we still use today .

The boat was modeled on an ancient 19-meter Phoenician shipwreck excavated off the coast of Marseille . Using locally-sourced materials , shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast .

`` We did n't have any mechanical winches and the anchor had to be pulled up and down by hand -- it was back-breaking work , '' Beale said .

The final leg of the journey took them wide out across the Atlantic and a mere 965 kilometers off the coast of Florida . It was here Beale got his inspiration for the journey to the U.S.

`` Archeologists have found Egyptian mummies with traces of tobacco and cocaine which could only have come from the New World , '' Beale said . `` It indicates there was something going on across the Atlantic . ''

Dr Mark McMenamin , professor of geology at Holyoke College , also points to evidence of Phoenician coins bearing maps of the Old and New World . He said copper coins with Phoenician iconography have also also been discovered in North America .

Many historians however , remain doubtful . `` If the Phoenicians got to England -- which we think they did -- I would n't be surprised if the boat could get to America physically . But whether they could have done it without running out of food is a different matter , '' maritime historian Sam Willis said .

`` If you 're circumnavigating Africa you can always stop along the way . But you ca n't when you 're going to America -- it 's a massive stretch of sea and that 's the difference . ''

Setting off from Tunisia , the modern-day Phoenician vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach America -- granted Beale can raise Â £ 100,000 -LRB- $ 156,000 -RRB- for the expedition .
