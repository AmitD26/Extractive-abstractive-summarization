`` The first time you do it you feel a bit nervous , but after two or three times , it becomes normal , like rugby or boxing or any sport . ''

Fidael Beaf could easily be describing bungee jumping .

Every year from April to June , the Vanuatuan island of Pentecost hosts one of the most spectacular and death-defying cultural ceremonies ever conceived .

Known as the Nagol , it sees men climb flimsy 100-foot wooden towers and dive headfirst into empty space , with nothing to break their fall but vines tied their ankles .

Ours is the first of the day 's five planes , all bringing in tourists to land at what 's more of a concrete bunker than an airport .

A portion of every ticket helps pay for children 's school fees and church programs .

Dysfunctional marriage

Ironically , European missionaries banned land diving on Pentecost in the early 20th century , but the priests never reached the rugged southeast corner of the island , where the ritual was passed on to successive generations .

Hotly pursued by her husband , she ran up a tree then tied a vine around her ankle and jumped from the top , landing safely .

The husband followed suit but without the aid of the vine he hit the ground with a fatal splat .

But uneasy with seeing the women dangling from trees in compromising positions , the island 's men called an end to their fun and stole the activity for themselves .

It 's also been transformed into a ritual rife with religious symbolism -- the success of the all-important yam harvest is said to depend on the courage of the previous year 's divers .

After the last plane touches down , we 're shepherded to a clearing in the jungle where the impressive tower known as a `` Nagol Adi '' stands upon a treeless slope .

Held together by vines without a single nail or screw , this outwardly phallic shrine takes 30 men up to a month to build .

At its center is a lopped tree surrounded by a crisscross of pole scaffolding lashed together and anchored into the earth by vines .

Protruding from its face are a dozen diving planks , the lowest of which is for boys who start diving from the age of five .

Despite its primitive appearance , the Nagol Adi is a marvel of intelligent design .

The diving boards are designed to snap and hinge downward to absorb much of the divers ' G-force , the wood is freshly cut to ensure strength and vines are carefully tailored to each diver 's weight and height .

Adherence to religious customs is also considered essential to a diver 's safety .

As belief in sorcery is widespread in Vanuatu , divers are also prohibited from asking witchdoctors to supply them `` love potions '' during this period .

On a few occasions when the rules have been bent , it has cost lives .

When Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II visited Pentecost in February 1974 , a diver died when his vine snapped during an out-of-season Nagol held in her honor .

In 2008 , Vanuatuan cameraman Hardy Ligo was killed when a poorly constructed tower collapsed under his weight during a Nagol that some said had been held too close to the yam harvest .

On a terrace cut into the hill behind the tower , a troupe of about 100 men and boys wearing only penis sheaths begin chanting in Sa , the language of Southern Pentecost .

Minutes pass as the frayed ends of two vines are tied around the volunteer 's ankles .

Once the vines are secured , the diver spreads his arms wide and calls out for emotional support from the dancers .

The crowd 's yelps and whistles reach fever pitch , the diver crosses his arms against his chest and makes an incredible leap of faith , trying to put as much distance between himself and the sharp edges of the tower .

Braver than bungee

Assistants rush in , pull the diver to his feet and confirm he 's in one piece .

Among them , 33-year-old Michael Olul scornfully dismisses comparisons with thrill seekers who use elastic ropes .

Few who have seen the Vanuatu land divers in action would argue .
