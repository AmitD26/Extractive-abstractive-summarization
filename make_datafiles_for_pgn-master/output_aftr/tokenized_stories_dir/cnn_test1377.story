So , on September 24 , 2003 -- my 18th birthday -- I enlisted in the Marine Corps while my parents were away on vacation , a trip they promptly returned from upon hearing the news .

My time in the Marine Corps offered an escape from the isolated Midwest upbringing that I 'd experienced . Once my training was completed , I found myself stationed in Okinawa , Japan 's sacrificial prefecture to the American Empire .

On a regular basis I found myself the target of homophobic and racist comments from those entrusted with my well-being and training , often times in front of those I was in charge of leading .

My time on Okinawa came to an end when I received orders to Iraq . I happily reported to my new unit , hoping deployment would offer a welcome escape from the physical and verbal harassment , degradation and humiliation that had become daily life .

The enemy within

After my first deployment I was experiencing emotional detachment . The world felt mundane . I was emotionally numb . Empathy escaped my being . I felt myself not participating in the world around me , observing from a distance . I found no place in the society I had returned to . I became violent at the slightest cue , and began drinking heavily .

Depression and anxiety swept through me . Though I can now articulate the emotional context of my experience , at the time every emotion , fear , hurt , shame , guilt , was externalized through anger , rage and violence .

I was blinded to the reality of what I was experiencing .

My anger was simply the intensity that a Marine required . Emotional detachment and numbness cultivated the objectivity needed to evaluate and execute the mission . My drinking seamlessly blended with the would-be frat-house Marine barracks culture .

I reported symptoms of PTSD to my command via a pencil and paper questionnaire known as a Post Deployment Health Assessment , at the discouragement and warning of a Corpsman , yet no offer of treatment was extended . My subsequent deployments would only serve to compound the trauma I had experienced , as I was on guard not only for the so-called enemy , but like so many of my sisters-in-arms , for my fellow Marines as well .

My struggles in the Marines had come to a close . Little did I know that my battle with Veterans Affairs was on the horizon .

As self-isolation became my preferred method of treating my anxiety , my relationships with my parents and my partner deteriorated . I felt distanced from those around me and those I cared about , which fed my anger .

My anger fed into guilt , then isolation and then anger . This became my every day . After nearly three years , my anger and depression drove my partner to leave .

The Uncounted : War 's impact on military families

With the barrel to my temple and my finger on the trigger , I began to wonder what the moments between the gun firing and my death would be like . In my questioning I realized that what I wanted was not to die , but to reclaim agency of my life and live it instead of simply survive through it .

While I had no desire to harm myself , more than anything , I desired relief .

My first appointment requesting mental health treatment was December 2011 . My first appointment with a therapist was October 2012 , a 10-month gap . In those 10 months , according to the VA estimates , more than 6,000 veterans took their own lives .

Upon graduation , I relocated to Denver and immediately enrolled in the local VA system , looking to continue the treatment I had fought so hard to receive before . After my initial intake , every mental health appointment I scheduled would be involuntarily canceled and pushed to a later date , only to have them , too , be canceled .

Gingrich : We owe vets real change

It was my search for true healing that led me to Peru . I traveled there as part of a study conducted by Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies . I had been following the association 's MDMA PTSD treatment research for years , and regularly advocated for MAPS in my daily discussions with fellow veterans .

In Peru , I met other veterans who had also become disillusioned with the cold , sterile , institutionalized treatment they had received when they returned home from combat .

I participated in three ayahuasca ceremonies , all conducted alongside other veterans . Each ceremony lasted approximately four hours . Before each ceremony we would come together and discuss our intention or focus would be for the ceremony that evening . We sat by candlelight , as one by one we drank our cup of medicine , then in darkness as we waited for the medicine to come up through us .

Ayahuasca allowed me to examine myself from a new perspective , progressively deeper with each ceremony . I was able to recall trauma and remember parts of my experiences that had previously been blocked out .

I was able to process not only experiences from the military , but also from throughout my entire life and see how they synthesized into the person I had become .

Since returning home to Colorado , I 've become an even more vocal advocate for psychedelic treatment .

Psychedelics including MDMA , LSD and psilocybin should be rescheduled to allow research into their medicinal benefits and let the facts speak for themselves .

America 's veterans are returning from over a decade of perpetual war , only to find themselves on the front lines , this time battling the government that sent them to fight , for their right to heal .
