Long Beach , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer , despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul , is , ` What does a woman want ? ' ''

His question is alive today : Last week , a Food and Drug Administration panel reviewed the efficacy and safety of a new drug to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder -- lack of sexual desire . -LRB- The panel did not recommend approval . -RRB- I 'll come back to this in a minute .

Why does Freud 's question persist ?

He studied their bodies and sketched their contours , looking for clues to their sensitivities and habits . Female genitals were texts for the doctor to read . But so were the tales of erotic misery -- or just plain indifference -- that his patients would tell him .

Dickinson thereafter proposed to write a book he never published -- one that would be addressed to men , husbands in particular , to teach them how to give pleasure to women .

Here we must turn to money and to the current news of the FDA panel 's hearings last week to decide whether to approve the new pharmaceutical pill flibanserin . The drug joins a plethora of pleasure-enhancing drugs and devices that in one way or another are premised upon variations of Freud 's nagging question .

Developed by the German drug company Boehringer-Ingelheim , the `` little pink pill '' -LRB- `` little blue '' Viagra 's sister ? -RRB- is meant to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder . How ? By increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine -LRB- libido boosters -RRB- and decreasing seratonin -LRB- libido downers -RRB- in the brains of its sufferers . If the drug were approved , The New York Times reported , annual sales might reach $ 2 billion in the United States alone .

Boehringer-Ingelheim had run a marketing campaign that consisted mainly of convincing women of a certain age and wealth strata that they lack sufficient sexual desire and that they deserve a remedy .

In a market-driven society , convincing people that they lack something they need is what advertising is all about . `` Do I lack sexual desire ? '' If you answer yes to this question -- and Boehringer-Ingelheim reports that 1,323 premenopausal women they studied did -- you become a member of the target market for flibanserin . The company 's success or failure in the marketplace rests in large part on women realizing they do n't have enough mojo .

The company limited its subject sample to women living in the U.S. and Canada who were otherwise healthy , well-educated and mostly married -- `` normal '' but for their deficiency of desire . Studied in a double-blind trial over 24 months , women taking the pill reported that `` sexually satisfying events '' increased to about 4.5 a month , while those taking a placebo reported about 3.7 such events . Incidentally , according to the framework of the study , these events need not include orgasm .

Boehringer-Ingelheim offers online medical education courses for health practitioners to get them involved in diagnosing HSDD . Doctors taking the courses are quizzed on how to diagnose the condition of various kinds of women . In one exercise , the test-taker is asked to figure out what is wrong with a 42-year-old working woman who cares for three children and an ailing mother , and lacks sexual desire . Her husband is a very minor character in the test 's scenario . Dr. Dickinson may be spinning in his grave now .

Psychologist Lenore Tiefer , who testified before the FDA panel Friday , put it well when she remarked that if the drug had been approved , it would have given women the false impression that they can take a pill to get `` the sex life they read about , the one they think everyone else is having . ''

One is tempted to ask whether the alleged upward trend in cases of HSDD in women can be correlated to the `` little blue pill 's '' market debut in 1998 . With all the talk of erectile dysfunction in men , maybe what women want now , sexually speaking , is a little less pressure to perform through pharmaceutically prolonged sexual encounters and a little more emotional support for their efforts , in and out of the bedroom .
