President Barack Obama on Monday reminisced of better times with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , his onetime hug-buddy turned Republican antagonist as the governor has turned his focus to an expected presidential bid .

The governor greeted Obama on the tarmac as he emerged from Air Force One for a visit to the state to speak to troops at New Jersey 's Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst . There , Obama recounted to the press his visit to the Jersey Shore with Christie last year to survey the Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts there .

He admitted : `` It was hard . ''

`` And then Christie beat me at football toss , which really aggravated me , '' Obama said , remembering that Christie `` bragged '' about his win afterwards .

Christie has previously complimented Obama and drew criticism from Republicans after he was photographed in a sideways embrace with the president when he visited the state to survey the damage done by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 . The warm relationship between the two has been called a `` bromance '' in the media .

And in recent years , Christie has become more critical of Obama . In September , Christie charged the President had `` underestimated what had been taking place in Syria '' and saying he was `` disturbed '' by how the president had handled the growing threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria -LRB- ISIS -RRB- .
