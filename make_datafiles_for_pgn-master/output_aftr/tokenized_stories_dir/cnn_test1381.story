-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The No. 2 leader in a Marxist guerrilla group that has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s has been killed in a military raid , President Juan Manuel Santos said Thursday .

Victor Julio Suarez Rojas , also known as Jorge Briceno Suarez and by his nom de guerre Mono Jojoy , was the military leader for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , commonly called the FARC .

Firefights between the military and the FARC continued into Thursday night , Defense Minister Rodrigo Rivera told CNN en Espa√±ol .

Rivera called the site where the military raid took place `` the mother of all FARC camps . '' The camp was 300 meters -LRB- 1,000 feet -RRB- long and had a bunker reinforced with concrete in the middle , he said . There were 13 satellite camps around the main camp , he said .

At the camp , troops also found four tons of fresh food .

`` This is the biggest blow the FARC has suffered in its history , '' Santos said from New York , where he is participating in meetings of the United Nations General Assembly .

Santos said that some 20 others were killed in the raid , but later Rivera clarified that by saying as of Thursday night , only seven bodies had been recovered .

Details of the intelligence that led to the operation was not disclosed , but Rivera said that there would be a reward handed out in connection with the death of Suarez .

Five Colombian soldiers were wounded in the operation , which included heavy airstrikes , Rivera said at a news conference from Bogota , the nation 's capital .

The guerrilla leader 's death was the FARC 's second major setback in the past few days .

Sixto Antonio Cabana Guillen was among the more than two dozen guerrillas killed in a Colombian air force bombing operation Sunday , the National Police said Monday .

Cabana , as a top member of the FARC , helped set policies directing and controlling the production and distribution of hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States and the world , according to a statement on the State Department 's website .

Speaking at Thursday 's news conference in Bogota , Rivera urged FARC leader Guillermo Leon Saenz , known as Alfonso Cano , to surrender .

`` We guarantee your life , '' Rivera said . `` We guarantee just treatment . ''

`` They have robbed us of nearly 50 years as a nation , '' he said . `` We are going to end the narco-terrorist FARC nightmare . ''

Although he was considered the No. 2 person in the rebel group , Suarez had much more military experience and time served in the FARC than its leader , Cano , who was appointed to the general secretariat as the result of a deal with the Colombian communist party .

In recent years , Suarez had been in charge of holding significant prisoners and kidnap victims in jungle camps . He also was in direct command of units responsible for the deaths of three Americans in 1999 . He was under indictment in the United States for those deaths as well as drug-trafficking charges .
