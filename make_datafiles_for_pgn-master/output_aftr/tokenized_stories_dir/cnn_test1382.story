Officially the coffee shop is called `` 15th Ave Coffee and Tea '' but the store and a similar sister location have earned another name : `` the Stealth Starbucks . ''

The ubiquitous smiling Mermaid logo has apparently swum away , there are no baristas in trademark green smocks either and not a tall , grande or venti sized beverage in sight .

The only hint that the store is owned by the coffee giant and not a local java seller is the `` Inspired by Starbucks '' lettering across the front door

Inside , pages from Plato 's dialogues decorate an entire wall , sweeteners sit on a bathtub converted into a table , beer and wine are for sale and employees dole out customized drip coffees along with advice on which are the best beans .

After first checking that her Starbucks rewards card would actually work at the location , customer Donna Godfrey said she liked the store precisely because it did n't seem like -- well -- such a Starbucks .

`` I really liked the ambience , its not as loud as most of your Starbucks . It just feels more European , '' Godfrey said .

`` You get to the point where you walk down the street and on every corner or on every other corner there 's a Starbucks . So I think this is a way to have a presence without it being that thumb in your face presence . ''

`` These are learning environments for us to be innovative and push the envelope , Starbucks customers worldwide have come to expect a certain amount of offerings and timing in our stores we wanted to change things up here but did n't want to disappoint any of our customers , '' Rubinfeld .

Like many retailers , 2009 was not a great year for Starbucks . The company closed hundreds of their stores amidst the economic downturn and battled the perception that their business was based on what critics complained was overpriced coffee

`` It 's rooted at the very core of Starbucks , we are an innovative company , '' Rubinfeld said . `` We most continue to be that , and stay relevant as we continue to move forward and grow . ''

Rubinfeld said Starbucks is closely watching the ideas that come out of the new stores and may eventually adopt some of those innovations company-wide .

As simple as the coffeehouse is , Simsch says his place is genuine .
