On Saturday , tragedy became triumph when the victory parade of the World Series champions Boston Red Sox crossed the same line surrounded by crowds , which were expected to reach 1 million people over the entire celebration route .

What the Red Sox mean to Boston

Led by an announcer , the team and crowd sang `` God Bless America '' at the line , which remains painted on the street .

The championship parade marked the restoration of a city 's soul , darkened during bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others who gathered last spring to watch the marathon near the finish line .

A great American city found its spirit returned . And it rejoiced .

`` The last time I was standing on the streets of Boston was the day of the marathon , and I 'd just like to say thank you to the Red Sox for bringing all these people back to the streets for something so great to celebrate , '' said parade attendee Laurie Delaney of Dedham , Massachusetts .

In fact , on the day of the bombings six months ago , Delaney was on Boylston Street where the explosions occurred , and earlier that day , she was at a Red Sox game .

Saturday 's celebration was emotional , she said .

`` It does n't fix what we went through , but it helps cover it up , '' Sedlacek said of the collective rejoicing .

`` It feels like it should have happened , '' Sedlacek said .

The parade ended in the Charles River when the duck boats took to the water and motored along the shore .
