Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- The lame duck is loose . Little more than two years before the moment he stands next to his successor at the presidential inauguration of 2017 , President Barack Obama is feeling unshackled from the constraints of eyeing the next election cycle after last month 's disastrous midterms for Democrats .

Simply put , top White House officials say , the President is on a mission to get stuff done .

From his dramatic decision to open up diplomatic relations with Cuba to his executive actions on immigration , Obama no longer has to worry about the hand-wringing of endangered Senate Democrats concerned with reelection .

`` I think it 's absolutely true , '' former White House press secretary and CNN political contributor Jay Carney said . `` Having lost -LRB- the Senate -RRB- , it does provide some liberation to him . ''

`` You know , if you look at the history of almost every President , those last two years , all kinds of stuff happens . In some cases , stuff that we could n't predict , '' the President said .

Current White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama accomplished his goal of making 2014 a `` year of action , '' filled with executive orders carried out with the President 's `` pen and phone . ''

`` There is a lot more that needs to get done and the President has a long list of things that he 's looking forward to tackling in the new year after a couple weeks with his family after the holidays , '' Earnest told reporters at his final press briefing of 2014 .

Privately , senior aides push back on the notion that Obama has adopted the newly frenetic pace solely because the midterms are behind him . The administration 's sanctions on Russia may only now be paying dividends but they were applied over a course of the last year . Re-establishing ties with Cuba , one official notes , was a long-term project that began 18 months ago .

`` It 's more difficult when the chairman is your own party member , '' Carney added .

Case in point is the administration 's long-delayed but persistent hope to contain Iran 's nuclear program . A deadline for a deal with the Iranian government was pushed back again just weeks ago .

Cuba is another matter . The unpredictability of the Castro brothers could create headaches for the Obama administration and , by extension , the Democrats heading into 2016 .

`` Hillary is going to have a hard time with this one , '' Miller said .

But successes in foreign policy could easily translate into higher approval ratings . Witness the strides made by Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War . Reagan 's cry , `` Mr. Gorbachev , tear down this wall , '' still resonates today .

`` Indeed views of Obama are not any worse than were attitudes toward Ronald Reagan at about this time in his second term . Understanding the arc of a presidential popularity rating , especially one as varied as Obama 's , requires a longer perspective than a single midterm snapshot , '' Andrew Kohut , Pew Research Center 's founding director wrote in a Politico op-ed .

Reagan was also buoyed by a rapidly expanding economy . As the Obama White House is finding , the economic picture is finally brightening after the worst recession since the Great Depression .
