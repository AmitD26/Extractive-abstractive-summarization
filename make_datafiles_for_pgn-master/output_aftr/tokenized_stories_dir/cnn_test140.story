Where would the world be without them ? Yes , the Irish might have taken over the world had God not invented whisky , but what about rum , gin , vodka , beer and wine ?

We 'll likely never know the answer to that question , but we can find out exactly how the drinks that rule the world are made . Whichever flavor you like to toss back , somewhere there 's a booze tour with your name on it . From Belgium to Barbados , here are 10 of our favorites .

Kentucky 's oldest and smallest distillery , Woodford Reserve lovingly crafts its bourbon in small batches . Maybe that 's why it 's the official bourbon of the Kentucky Derby .

On the Corn to Cork tour you can dive deeper into the bourbon-making process . Or you can just start serving up mint juleps .

Cost : $ 7 .

Grape for grape , this family-owned estate 100 kilometers north of Santiago pumps out some of the best wine in South America . It helps that Viña Errazuriz has the perfect climate for it : cool , rainy winters and hot , dry summers .

On the two-hour tour , visitors take to the underground cellars and walk the hillside vineyards , covering topics like viticulture , climate conditions and grape management .

The Pinot Noir contains some amazingly smoky notes from oak aging .

Rum : Mount Gay Visitor Center , Brandons , Barbados

It 's the classic rum stereotype -- turquoise waters , tropical island , white-sand beaches .

And for a reason . As the birthplace of rum , Barbados is home to the oldest rum in existence , Mount Gay . Launched in 1703 , Mount Gay is a smooth , medium-bodied rum combining notes of ripe banana , almond , vanilla , coffee and chocolate . It gets those last two from an aging process that involves Kentucky oak barrels that previously contained bourbon .

At the Mount Gay visitor center in Brandons -LRB- near the capital , Bridgetown -RRB- , travelers learn about these rum properties in the brand museum . Later , they snoop around a Barbadian rum shop and sample two of Mount Gay 's finest rums in the official bar .

An optional lunch is served outdoors , with a Mount Gay punch , naturally .

Cost : U.S. $ 7 - $ 50 .

In 1926 , the Artois brewery in Leuven , Belgium -LRB- which has been in existence since 1366 -RRB- , produced a beer so bright it was given the name Stella , Latin for `` star . ''

Which goes to show sometimes a company requires a few centuries to discover its true calling . Today , Stella Artois is sold in more than 80 countries .

The hourlong tour at the Stella Artois brewery divulges all the beer 's secrets -LRB- so they say -RRB- . Visitors sample a cool Stella in the cozy Den Thuis bar before being guided to the Stella Artois shop , where they can stock up on chalices . And maybe a bottle opener .

Stout : Guinness Storehouse , Dublin

Guinness is like a beer milkshake and the tour of the brand 's headquarters is just as filling .

It starts in the atrium next to the world 's largest pint glass , which rises up through the middle of the seven-story building .

Whisky : Glenfiddich Distillery , Dufftown , Scotland

Glenfiddich is the world 's most awarded single-malt Scotch whisky , having claimed more big-time international medals since 2000 than any other single-malt Scotch .

Cost : Free to £ 75 -LRB- U.S. $ 121 -RRB- .

Tequila : Casa Herradura , Amatitán , Mexico

Thirty kilometers later , visitors arrive at Casa Herradura , home of the award-winning and picturesque Herradura Tequila distillery . Surrounded by mountains and agave fields , the tour takes in the original factory and a few 100 % agave tequilas -LRB- silver , reposado , añejo -RRB- .

Throw in a mariachi band and a little Mexican folk dancing and it could be a wedding night .

While their resources may be modest , they produce one hell of a vodka , ultra-clean and as neutral as Switzerland . It costs a mere $ 5 to take the distillery tour . Visitors observe the patient fermentation of mash and slow , small-batch distilling processes .

Then comes a sample of their best stuff in the tasting room . These Midwesterners also churn out a pretty solid bourbon .

Cost : $ 5 .

Healey 's makes a number of ciders , most notably the Cornish Rattler , a cloudy cider with a hefty bite , hence the name and snake on the bottle .

Or , they can take a tractor ride through apple orchards in the valley below , have lunch and a slew of ciders in the restaurant , even pet the farm animals . It 's all kid-friendly .

OK , this is n't much of a distillery tour . The New York Distilling Co. is small ; tours are informal and do n't last long .

The hook here is the distillery , located in the hip , converted-warehouse-heavy neighborhood of Williamsburg , Brooklyn , attached to a fully functioning bar called The Shanty .

Cocktails are available , made with the distillery 's two gins , the citrus Dorothy Parker and the strong -LRB- 57 % ABV -RRB- Perry 's Tot . A distillery-produced rye is on its way .

Cost : Free .
