It was a violation of Pakistani criminal law and prevented a medical conclusion about what killed the former prime minister , said Athar Minallah , who serves on the board that manages Rawalpindi General Hospital .

However , the police chief involved , Aziz Saud , told CNN that he suggested an autopsy be done , but that Bhutto 's husband objected .

The revelation came on Monday after new videotape of Bhutto 's assassination emerged , showing her slumping just after gunshots rang out .

The tape provided the clearest view yet of the attack and appeared to show that Bhutto was shot . That would contradict the Pakistan government 's account . Read Bhutto 's full medical report

A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun , pointing it toward Bhutto , who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof . He fired three shots , then there was an explosion .

In the video that emerged on Sunday , Bhutto was standing , and her hair and scarf appeared to move , perhaps from the bullet . Bhutto fell into the car , then came the blast . Watch new tape showing apparent gunman ''

These images seem to support the theory that Bhutto died at the hands of a shooter before a bomb was detonated , killing another 23 people .

Doctors at Rawalpindi General Hospital declared the 54-year-old dead hours after Thursday 's attack , but the cause of her death has been widely debated .

Bhutto 's husband , in an interview with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Monday , called for an international investigation into his wife 's death , saying the new video proves the Pakistani government `` has been trying to muddy the water from the first day . ''

Javed Iqbal Cheema , spokesman for Pakistan 's Interior Ministry , said the government 's conclusion on Bhutto 's death was based on `` absolute facts , nothing but the facts '' and `` it was corroborated by the doctor 's report . ''

But Minallah issued an open letter on Monday and released the doctors ' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement , and he also talked to CNN .

Minallah told CNN that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were `` threatened . ''

`` They are government servants who can not speak ; I am not , '' he said . He did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors .

Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto 's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it .

Her widower has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government .

Minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge .

The wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear .

`` Sharp bones edges were felt in the wound , '' it read . `` No foreign body was felt in the wound . '' E-mail to a friend
