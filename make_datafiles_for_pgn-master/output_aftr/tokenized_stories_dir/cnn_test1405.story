The HBO television news satire `` Last Week Tonight '' found a clever way to illustrate the court 's public sessions , which are closed to cameras . Audio of the oral arguments -- where the justices debate the issues with opposing counsel -- is recorded and made available to the public .

The solution -- pair each of the nine robed justices -- as well as the lawyers and court staff -- with a dog -LRB- or a duck in one case -RRB- , with fake paws . It 's an exercise in democracy that has to be watched for the full effect .

The featured case was from earlier this month , over whether a Muslim prisoner had a First Amendment right to keep his beard for religious reasons , in the face of strict security policies by corrections officers .

`` I thought it was hilarious , '' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said of the dog video at a Washington event earlier this week . `` And I imagine my colleagues who have seen it would share that view . ''

Ginsburg was portrayed as a Chihuahua , complete with glasses .

For the record the other members of the court and their canine counterparts : Chief Justice John Roberts -LRB- German shorthaired pointer -RRB- ; and Justices Antonin Scalia -LRB- bulldog -RRB- ; Anthony Kennedy -LRB- boxer -RRB- ; Clarence Thomas -LRB- Rottweiler -RRB- ; Stephen Breyer -LRB- beagle -RRB- ; Samuel Alito -LRB- Portuguese water dog -RRB- ; Sonia Sotomayor -LRB- Boston terrier -RRB- ; and Elena Kagan -LRB- bull terrier -RRB- .

`` It 's news entertainment , and whatever , and they -LRB- the media -RRB- want ` man bites dog ' stories , '' he has said . `` They do n't want people to watch what the Supreme Court does over the course of a whole hour argument . ''

For the record , no man bit any of the dogs in the making of the new video , but one animal was seen drinking sloppily from a glass .

On the bench , the justices wear plain black robes and are referred to by their official title . Off the bench , however , the court 's oldest member might prefer a t-shirt and her fresh moniker : Notorious R.B.G.

`` I think a law clerk told me about this Tumblr and also explained to me what Notorious RBG was a parody on . And now my grandchildren love it and I try to keep abreast of the latest that 's on the Tumblr , '' she said . `` I have quite a large supply '' of the shirts .

Ginsburg has previously applauded Shana Knizhnik , a law student at New York University , who created the site and the nickname -- a play on the late rapper Biggie Smalls , who was also known as Notorious B.I.G.

It 's not the only Ginsburg-palooza floating around popular culture . After her recent sharp dissents in cases involving affirmative action and voting rights gained national attention , activists began placing homemade stickers around the nation 's capital , labeled `` Ca n't Spell Truth Without Ruth . ''

The 81-year-old justice has seen a recent surge in popularity , and -- rare for a sitting justice -- has given a number of media interviews in the past year . She has publicly , but politely , resisted calls from many on the left to step down from the bench now , to give President Obama another chance to enhance his legacy with a justice who might serve for decades .
