Each year , U.S. News & World Report asks experts to rank various nutrition plans to help consumers make informed decisions . This year the panel evaluated 32 of the most popular diets .

`` If the cavemen did n't eat it , you should n't either , '' U.S. News & World Report summarized .

The diet has gained a significant following in recent years , especially among the CrossFit crowd . `` Paleo Diet '' was the most searched diet term on Google in 2013 .

Being last on the Best Diets list does n't mean Paleo is the worst diet ever -LRB- the `` Cookie Diet '' did n't even make the list -RRB- . But U.S. News & World Report 's experts said the Paleo Diet was too restrictive for most people to follow long term , and that it limited some essential nutrients . They also cited a lack of research proving the Paleo Diet 's cardiovascular health and weight loss benefits in their ranking .

The Paleo Diet tied for last place on the list alongside the Dukan diet , which is also a high-protein , low-carbohydrate approach .

For the fourth year in a row , the DASH Diet Eating Plan was named the best overall diet . DASH , or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension , was developed by the National Institutes of Health for people with high blood pressure . But it is also effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing a person 's risk for heart disease , stroke , kidney stones and diabetes , its website states .

The diet 's only downfalls , the expert panel said , are that it takes some `` grunt work '' to adhere to , and that it may cost more than a diet based on `` processed , fatty , sugary foods . ''

U.S. News & World Report also published several other lists , including best weight-loss diets , best diabetes diets , best commercial diet plans and easiest diets to follow .

Weight Watchers topped the best weight-loss , best commercial diet plan and easiest to follow lists . Also high on several lists were the Jenny Craig plan and `` The Biggest Loser '' plan .
