Condoleezza Rice , former US secretary of state announced on Facebook Saturday that she would not be speaking at the Rutgers University commencement this year , following student protests against her appearance .

The students made accusations against her in connection with the war in Iraq .

`` Commencement should be a time of joyous celebration for the graduates and their families , '' Rice wrote .

In publicized minutes of the February New Brunswick Faculty Council Meeting , Robert Boikess presented and moved for adoption a Resolution in Opposition to Condoleezza Rice as Commencement Speaker .

In an article published in the school paper Friday , staff writers Lan and Lidia De Los Santos said nearly 100 students gathered at the student center during a senate meeting that day to question the university president .

President Robert Barchi posted a statement Saturday on the school website in response to Rice . `` While Rutgers University stands fully behind the invitation to Dr. Rice to be our commencement speaker and receive an honorary degree , we respect her decision not to participate in the upcoming Rutgers University commencement , which she clearly articulated in her statement this morning . ''

Rice wrote Saturday `` I am honored to have served my country . I have defended America 's belief in free speech and the exchange of ideas . These values are essential to the health of our democracy . But that is not what is at issue here . As a Professor for thirty years at Stanford University and as its former Provost and Chief academic officer , I understand and embrace the purpose of the commencement ceremony and I am simply unwilling to detract from it in any way . ''

She said that the feeling on campus is not one of relief .

`` From my personal social media people are upset that the protest led to her declining her invitation ... and I have seen a petition to get her back . ''
