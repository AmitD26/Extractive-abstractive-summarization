`` It 's great that people are finally standing up against the privileged few people who want to rule together , '' Gard said . `` I wanted to stand together and say , ` Enough is enough ' . ''

Gard is one of the organizers of `` Occupy Melbourne , '' a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square . Similar calls have sprung up around Australia : `` Occupy Brisbane , '' `` Occupy Perth , '' and `` Occupy Sydney . ''

Gard and the planned Australian spin-offs of `` Occupy Wall Street '' are not alone . There are Facebook calls for a global demonstration on October 15 in cities in more than 25 countries stretching from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires , Dublin to Madrid .

Some protest pages show only a few dozen will attend ; others have thousands . Protest pages in Spain and Italy -- two countries hard hit by the financial crisis and subsequent European Union debt woes -- have the largest Facebook attendees so far , with 42,410 and 20,568 , respectively .

`` What we have in common is that we are the other 99 % , that we want people over profit , that we are making our voices heard against greed and corruption and for a democratic and just society , '' London organizer James Alexander Fancourt told the Telegraph newspaper . `` And we are doing that in a non-violent and peaceful way . ''

In Melbourne , `` some demonstrators are planning to camp for days , maybe weeks , '' Gard said .

While the Australian economy -- driven by strong commodity sales of iron ore and coal -- escaped the brunt of the 2008 financial crisis , Gard said many Australians do n't feel they 're sharing in the wealth .
