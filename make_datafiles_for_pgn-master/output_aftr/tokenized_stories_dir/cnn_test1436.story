John Grisham is taking back statements he made about child pornography and sex offenders .

`` We have prisons now filled with guys my age , 60-year-old white men , in prison , who 've never harmed anybody -LRB- and -RRB- would never touch a child , '' Grisham said during a conversation about high U.S. prison rates . `` But they got online one night and started surfing around , probably had too much to drink or whatever , and pushed the wrong buttons and went too far and got into child porn . ... They deserve some type of punishment , but 10 years in prison ?

`` There 's so many of them now , sex offenders ... that they put them in the same prison , like they 're a bunch of perverts or something . ''

`` I have no sympathy for a real pedophile . But so many of these guys do n't deserve harsh prison sentences . A friend of mine , this was 10 years ago , was drinking , and his drinking was out of control . And he went to a website , and it was labeled , 16-year-old wannabe hookers or something , some stupid website . And it said 16-year-old girls . So he went there and downloaded some stuff .

`` It was 16-year-old girls that look 30 . ... He should n't have done it . It was stupid . But it was n't 10-year-old boys , and he did n't touch anything . ''

`` How do you think child porn is made ? '' a poster named John Kelly asked on Grisham 's page . `` Someone is still getting hurt you imbecile . I 'm sad to say that I will never purchase , nor consume , one of your books ever again . I am disgusted . ''

`` Anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure , or who in any way participates in child pornography -- online or otherwise -- should be punished to the fullest extent of the law , '' the author said in a statement . `` My comments made two days ago during an interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes , especially the sexual molestation of children . I can think of nothing more despicable . I regret having made these comments , and apologize to all . ''

That may not be enough for some of his former followers .

`` You clearly said in the interview that people -LRB- like your drunk friend -RRB- who look at child porn do n't deserve severe punishment , '' Facebook user Raylene Jolly Wheeler posted in response to Grisham . `` Not sure how you can backtrack that statement . ''
