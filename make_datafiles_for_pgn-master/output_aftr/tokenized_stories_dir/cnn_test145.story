-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The capture of the surviving Boston Marathon bombing suspect last Friday ended the city 's nightmare . But for investigators , a huge task lies ahead .

They `` have a million questions , and those questions need to be answered , '' Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said over the weekend .

Those answers could help authorities explain why two brothers might have done this and how the terrorist attack could have been prevented .

Here is a look at five of the burning questions vexing investigators :

He has conveyed that Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's motivation stemmed from jihadist thought and the idea that Islam is under attack , so jihadists need to fight back , the source said Monday . Authorities might never have all the answers about Tamerlan Tsarnaev , 26 , who died after an encounter with police early Friday .

The government source cautioned that the interviews were preliminary , and that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's account needs to be checked out and followed up on by investigators .

And even if the suspected Boston bombers were not connected to a terrorist organization , the brothers may have had help .

2 . What was Tamerlan Tsarnaev doing in Russia ?

His father has said that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was with him at all times during that trip . But investigators are not ruling out that he could have met up with some nefarious characters during that visit to Makhachkala , the capital of Russia 's Dagestan republic , where his father still lives today .

The trip came after the suspect , an accomplished boxer , became increasingly religious , his aunt said .

After returning from the trip , Tamerlan Tsarnaev started a YouTube channel with links to various videos . Two were posted under a category labeled `` terrorists , '' but later deleted . It 's not clear by whom .

A CNN analysis of the YouTube channel determined one deleted video featured a militant named Abu Dujana , whose real name was Gadzhimurad Dolgatov . Russian security services killed Dolgatov in December during an assault on an apartment in Makhachkala .

The investigation also will look into whether Tamerlan Tsarnaev made other trips to the northern Caucasus region , McCaul said Sunday .

3 . How did Dzhokhar Tsarnaev go from ` lovely kid ' to suspected terrorist ?

He was `` a lovely , lovely kid , '' said Larry Aaronson , a former teacher at the younger Tsarnaev 's high school . Aaronson described the young man as compassionate , caring , and jovial .

Ruslan Tsarni , the boys ' uncle -- who made headlines for calling the boys `` losers '' -- said he believes Tamerlan Tsarnaev influenced his younger brother . Investigators are looking into whether that was the case .

Some acquaintances of the boys believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been brainwashed by his brother . `` All I can say is I think his brother put him up to it , '' said Peter Tenzin , who co-captained the high school wrestling team with Dzhokhar . `` There 's no way in heck that he would do it . Mentally , he 's just not that kind of guy . ''

4 . Why was n't the FBI tracking Tamerlan ?

Acting on Russia 's concerns that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a follower of radical Islam , FBI agents interviewed the older brother in 2011 , an FBI official said .

`` This man was pointed out by a foreign government to be dangerous . He was interviewed by the FBI once ... then , he went to Russia . ... Why was n't he interviewed when he came back either at the airport when he was returning or later ? '' Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said to CNN .

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham also voiced concern about the FBI 's handling of Tamerlan Tsarnaev , but the senator from South Carolina pulled back his criticism on Monday , saying that the problem might have been partly the result of Tsarnaev 's misspelled name on a travel document .

`` I think there 's going to be an awful lot of questions about this , that 's going to be looked at over the coming months and maybe longer than that , '' said Rep. Michael Capuano , a Massachusetts Democrat .

`` Like every situation , I have faith that the FBI and other agencies have done their job . Can they improve their job going forward ? Absolutely . ''

Collier was inside his police vehicle Thursday night after responding to a loud disturbance call when he was shot and killed on the MIT campus , according to Watertown Police Chief Edward Duveau .

`` It appears that the suspects approached from the rear ... and then fired four to five shots into the cruiser , '' Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas said on `` CNN Newsroom '' Monday .

A short time after the MIT shooting , the suspects are believed to have carjacked an SUV about a mile away . Later , Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a police confrontation .

The capture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev last week ended Boston 's nightmare

Yet , investigators must answer `` a million questions ''

@highlight

There is still no clear motive for last week 's bombings

And it 's still unclear if the suspects acted alone
