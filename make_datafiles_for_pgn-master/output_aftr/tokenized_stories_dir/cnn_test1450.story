Mexican authorities , acting on tips , last week located his green Kawasaki motorcycle in a shallow grave in the state of Guerrero , along with the badly decomposed remains of a man in two bags .

On Thursday , DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Devert , a representative of the Guerrero state attorney general 's office not authorized to speak to the media told CNN .

The investigation was turned over to federal prosecutor because of the nature of the crime and the fact that it involved an American tourist , he said .

Mother has been looking for information

Devert 's mother , Ann , traveled to Mexico last weekend after identifying the vehicle identification number on the motorcycle found in the shallow grave . A day earlier she provided a DNA sample to police in New York to match against the remains , said Darren Del Sardo , an attorney for Devert 's mother .

Del Sardo said Mexican authorities informed Ann Devert of the findings late Thursday . She is considering having a private lab conduct DNA tests , he said .

`` This is horrible , '' he said . `` The major component now is to try to find out who is responsible for this and hope that the Mexican authorities bring them to justice as soon as possible . ''

The discovery of the remains and the motorcycle was made nearly 300 miles southwest of where Devert was last heard from in January .

Del Sardo said Ann Devert spent time in Mexico after her son 's disappearance , meeting local authorities and residents in the western Mexican state of Michoacan in an attempt to find him . There was hope with unconfirmed tips that he was being held at a ranch . Last week , she learned of the remains and the bike in the shallow grave .

Del Sardo said Ann Devert was told that the remains may have been moved to the shallow grave .

Devert , 32 , had not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in New York since January 25 . That day he sent girlfriend Sarah Ashley Schiear a text message via the WhatsApp messenger app .

`` Just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be , '' the message said . `` Stopping for lunch and ... voila Internet . ... Gon na get back on the road soon . Apparently there 's another military escort waiting for me in some other town ... I 'm running way late because of the crazy military stuff ... hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when I -LRB- hopefully -RRB- finally arrive . ''

He had checked out of a bed and breakfast in Michoacan and planned to travel to a beach in Zihuatanejo , on the Pacific Ocean , that was in the final scene of the film `` The Shawshank Redemption , '' according to friends and family .

She told CNN earlier this year that he would call every January 29 , his late father 's birthday , `` and when he did n't , I felt a misgiving but I thought maybe it would take a couple of days , '' she said . `` He did n't call . ''

Then , Ann Devert heard from a friend who recently returned from Michoacan , where vigilante self-defense groups in numerous communities have engaged in deadly confrontations with the Knights Templar drug cartel .

Devert 's friends and family were hopeful that his disappearance was only temporary , another story to recount from his wild travels around the world -- from Pamplona , Spain , to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , and beyond .

He added , `` Then in the next 2 or 3 weeks I 'm going to drive it across America , through Central America , down to Brazil for the World Cup , and eventually south to Ushuaia , which as far as I can tell from a map is about as far south as one can get on the continent . ''

He purchased a green 2002 Kawasaki . Ann Devert said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying YouTube videos on how to survive falls from bikes .

Friends and family created the Help Find Harry page in Facebook , with more than 25,000 likes .
