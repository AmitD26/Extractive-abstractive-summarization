Violations would result in the students ' portraits being edited , the school said .

Now that the yearbook has been distributed , several female students are complaining that their pictures were altered to show less skin without their knowledge , according to CNN affiliate KSTU .

`` They did n't tell you before they edited it , and they did n't give you an option to fix it , so you look funny in your yearbook picture , '' sophomore Shelby Baum told the news outlet .

But the high school asserts that a large sign -- 4 feet by 5 feet -- warned all students of the policy at picture day last fall , the school said on its Facebook page .

In response , the female students say that the pictures of some girls who apparently violated the dress policy were n't edited at all -- an accusation that prompted the superintendent 's apology and a school promise to review its editing practices .

`` I feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who , '' sophomore Rachel Russel told the affiliate . `` There were plenty of girls that were wearing thicker tank tops , and half of them got edited and half of them did n't . ''

Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker of the Wasatch County School District defended the policy , but he apologized `` in the sense that we wanted to be more consistent with what it is we 're trying to do , '' he told the affiliate .

On its Facebook page , the school acknowledged that errors were made .

But the Rape Recovery Center in Salt Lake City raised broader issues , noting how female survivors of sexual violence `` almost always blame themselves for wearing the wrong clothing or somehow encouraging men to rape them through their reckless behavior , '' the center said on its Facebook page .

`` This is the start of a continuum that nurtures and even encourages control over girls and women . What is more personal than their clothing choices ? This is not about setting school dress codes , which schools certainly have the right to do . These were photos the girls paid for , yearbooks they bought with their own money . This is a public school , supported with tax dollars , '' Mullen said .

Shoemaker was n't immediately available for comment on Mullen 's accusations .

For now , students will have to live forever with what they describe as unflattering photos in their yearbook .

`` I was upset because my shirt was a cream color and the color of the cover-up was completely white . It looks like white-out on my skin , '' sophomore Kimberly Montoya told KSTU .
