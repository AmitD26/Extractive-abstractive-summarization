-LRB- CNN -RRB- At least 30 people , including two children , have been killed in shelling in the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol , city officials said Saturday , in the latest violence to rock the disputed Donetsk region .

Another 102 people were injured , at least 75 of whom needed hospital treatment , and many suffered shrapnel injuries , Mariupol City Council said .

Pro-Russian separatists are blamed for the attack on residential areas in the port city , Donetsk regional police chief Vyacheslav Abroskin said on his Facebook page .

The Interior Ministry said one person was arrested in connection with the attack .

Monitors with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said they conducted a crater analysis which showed the use of Grad and Uragan rockets that likely originated from areas controlled by the pro-Russian rebel group Donetsk People 's Republic -LRB- DPR -RRB- .

The shelling comes amid a surge in fighting between government forces and pro-Russian separatists .

`` We call on Russia to end its support for separatists immediately , close the international border with Ukraine , and withdraw all weapons , fighters and financial backing , '' Kerry said in a statement .

The White House says Vice President Biden spoke with Ukraine President Poroshenko on Saturday .

They `` expressed grave concern over Russia 's blatant disregard for its commitments under the September Minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict , '' the White House said .

The two leaders vowed to `` ensure that the costs continue to rise on Russia for its aggressive actions against Ukraine . ''

Thousands have been killed since the conflict broke out in the spring of last year and a ceasefire agreed to in September in Minsk , Belarus , crumbled long ago .

U.S. officials took to Twitter to condemn the latest violence .

`` Today 's indiscriminate shelling of Mariupol -LRB- is -RRB- part of an apparently Russian-backed general offensive in complete violation of Minsk agreements , '' said U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt .

`` Russia 's escalation continues -- Kremlin 's callous disregard for human life -LRB- incl Russian soldiers -RRB- on full display in Ukraine , '' said Daniel Baer , the U.S. ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe -LRB- OSCE -RRB- .

The foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia met this week in Berlin to discuss a way out of the violence . But despite the talks , violence in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions shows no sign of abating .

Thursday 's shelling of a transit stop in Donetsk city -- an attack that Ukraine 's Defense Ministry blamed on rebels -- killed eight civilians , according to state news reports . But Ukrainian troops have come under heavy fire as well .

That includes 115 attacks in a recent 24-hour period that killed three troops and wounded 50 more , Ukrinform , the Ukrainian national news agency , reported Friday .

`` Using residential areas as firing positions attracts counter-firing to these areas , further endangering the lives of civilians , '' it said .

Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment over the border . In a bid to put pressure on Moscow over Ukraine , the United States and European Union have imposed financial sanctions against Russian interests .

Moscow denies the claims .
