Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- As accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev goes on trial Monday few doubt the outcome of the first phase of the two-phase trial . It 's the second , the sentencing phase , including a possible death sentence , that has been the subject of behind the scenes discussions .

Federal prosecutors and defense attorneys for Tsarnaev have held talks on a possible plea agreement but failed to reach one , U.S. officials familiar with the talks say .

The discussions in recent months have centered on the possibility of Tsarnaev pleading guilty and receiving a life sentence without parole , according to the officials .

But the talks have reached an impasse because the Justice Department has resisted removing the death penalty as a possibility , these officials say .

Jury selection is set to begin Monday in the case , with Tsarnaev facing 30 counts including detonating a weapon of mass destruction . Three people died and 264 people were injured in the April 15 attacks .

Tsnarnaev 's brother Tamerlan was killed in a confrontation with police during the manhunt that followed the bombing .

There are several reasons to pursue a plea deal , including to spare survivors and victim families from having to relive the trauma of the bombings , and to save financial costs in a case that has already cost millions of dollars .

Boston US Attorney Carmen Ortiz has overseen the plea discussions . Any decision to remove the death penalty as a possibility would have approval from Holder .

The attorney general Friday also authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against the man accused of shooting a TSA employee at Los Angeles Airport in 2013 .
