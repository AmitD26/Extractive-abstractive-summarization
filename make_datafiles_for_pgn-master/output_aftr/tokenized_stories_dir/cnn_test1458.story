-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ghana 's World Cup challenge is in danger of imploding after two of its star players were thrown out of their squad following allegations of physical and verbal attacks within the team 's camp .

Muntari , who plays his football with Italian side AC Milan , was accused of launching an `` unprovoked physical attack '' on Moses Armah -- a member of the GFA , in a statement on their website .

The incident , which took place on Tuesday according to the GFA , has led to Muntari 's expulsion from the camp .

`` Boateng has since showed no remorse for his actions which has resulted in the decision , '' added the GFA statement .

In an interview with German magazine , Sport-Bild , Boateng says he `` absolutely accepts '' his punishment and blamed a training ground bust-up for his exclusion .

`` Afterwards I went to him and asked what he had against me and he started yelling . He insulted me . ''

`` No-one should think I insulted the coach . I 'm traveling now , and I wish my colleagues all the best for the match against Portugal , '' added Boateng , referring to Ghana 's final World Cup Group G match Thursday .

Ghana 's campaign had already been blighted by controversy over the payment of appearance fees to players .

According to coach Appiah , `` the practice in Ghana has always been paying the money in cash '' as many of the players do n't have Ghanian bank accounts .

A statement from the Ghana Football Association said : `` The government is pre-financing the payment of the Black Stars appearance fees , which will be reimbursed when FIFA 's prize money for Ghana 's participation in the World Cup is paid . ''

The African nation , which reached the quarterfinals four years ago , must defeat Portugal and hope the U.S. fails to gain a result against Germany , though Boateng had already been ruled out of Thursday 's game having been sent off in Ghana 's 2-2 draw against Germany Saturday .

Jurgen Klinsmann 's team takes on the Germans in Recife Thursday needing just a point to qualify for the last 16 .

But fans hoping to access the stadium were facing a challenge with rainfall causing chaos around the city .
