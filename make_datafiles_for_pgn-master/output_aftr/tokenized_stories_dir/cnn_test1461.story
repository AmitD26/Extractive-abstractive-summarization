Police around the United States are recording the license plates of passing drivers and storing the information for years with little privacy protection , the American Civil Liberties Union said Wednesday .

The information potentially allows authorities to track the movements of everyone who drives a car .

Opinion : Supreme Court must protect our privacy from the government

Police are gathering the vehicle information with surveillance technology called automatic license plate readers , and it 's being stored -- sometimes indefinitely -- with few or no privacy protections , the ACLU said .

`` The documents paint a startling picture of a technology deployed with too few rules that is becoming a tool for mass routine location tracking and surveillance , '' the ACLU said in a written statement .

`` Private companies are also using license plate readers and sharing the information they collect with police with little or no oversight or privacy protections . A lack of regulation means that policies governing how long our location data is kept vary widely , '' the ACLU said .

The readers have been proliferating at `` worrying speed '' and are typically mounted on bridges , overpasses and patrol cars , the ACLU said .

`` If not properly secured , license plate reader databases open the door to abusive tracking , enabling anyone with access to pry into the lives of his boss , his ex-wife , or his romantic , political , or workplace rivals , '' the ACLU said .

Law enforcement argues the tools keep officers and the public safe .

In a blog post last week , the Los Angeles Police Protective League said that license plate recognition -LRB- LPR -RRB- technology has helped with `` literally thousands of cases nationwide . ''

The ACLU report cited how the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2012 tracked the movement of the Mayor R.T. Rybak 's car 41 times at a license police reader in the prior year . The newspaper put the information on a map and gathered the data through public records requests .

A hit means that a read matched a listing in a database of vehicles law enforcement was interested in , for whatever reason . They might be reported stolen , for instance , or belonging to missing persons .

As a result , the mayor directed the police chief to recommend a new policy on data retention , the group said .
