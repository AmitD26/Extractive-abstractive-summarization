-LRB- CNN -RRB- Serena Williams is ending her Indian Wells boycott in a spirit of `` forgiveness '' 14 years after suffering racist abuse at the Californian resort 's showpiece tennis tournament .

Back in 2001 , age 19 , she lifted her second Indian Wells trophy by beating Kim Clijsters -- but she and her family were racially abused by some members of the crowd after sister Venus withdrew from their semifinal with an injury .

That sparked accusations from some that their father , Richard , was `` fixing '' games between the two . He later said the abuse the family had suffered during the final `` shamed America . ''

His daughter told TIME he `` had to sit and watch his daughter being taunted , sparking cold memories of his experiences growing up in the South . ''

The 33-year-old said a feeling that attitudes in tennis had progressed had helped to make up her mind , citing the prompt action taken by the Women 's Tennis Association and United States Tennis Association when she and Venus were victims of racist and sexist comments made by a Russian official last year .

She said it had been `` difficult for me to forget spending hours crying in the Indian Wells locker room after winning in 2001 , driving back to Los Angeles feeling as if I had lost the biggest game ever -- not a mere tennis game but a bigger fight for equality . ''

`` Emotionally it seemed easier to stay away , '' she explained . `` There are some who say I should never go back . There are others who say I should have returned years ago .

Her decision was welcomed by tournament CEO Raymond Moore , who confirmed that she had accepted a wild card for the event . `` We really look forward to watching her compete again , '' he said .
