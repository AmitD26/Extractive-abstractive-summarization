Kano , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- Authorities in the landlocked African nation of Niger have arrested 160 suspected Boko Haram militants allegedly involved in deadly attacks near that country 's border with Nigeria , a national police spokesman said Tuesday .

Some of the suspects fled south , only to be arrested while on the run or in `` their hiding places , '' said Yakubu Sumana Gawo , the governor of Niger 's Diffa region .

Members of the Nigerien police 's anti-terrorism unit are interrogating the suspects , all of them Niger citizens .

Two Cameroon security sources said more than 1,000 alleged terrorists are in custody in the central prison in the town of Maroua . Col. Joseph Nouma , commander of Cameroon 's special military operation targeting terrorists , offered a more conservative number of more than 600 detained .

Nouma said his forces squared off Monday with Boko Haram fighters and beat them decisively .

The battle in Gnam-Gnam , which is 4 kilometers -LRB- 2.5 miles -RRB- from the Nigerian border , began when Cameroonian soldiers on a reconnaissance mission `` were ambushed by the terrorists , '' the Cameroonian colonel said .

It ended a few hours later with at least 100 militants and five Cameroonian soldiers dead , according to Nouma . He said Cameroonian troops also seized an armored vehicle , two machine guns and a large amount of ammunition .

Much of this violence has taken place in Nigeria . But neighboring countries , such as Cameroon and Chad , have also been hit increasingly hard .

Niger became more of a target following its decision to join the regional alliance fighting Boko Haram . The group has been blamed for raids and suicide bombings in recent days in Diffa , which is in the far southeastern part of the country .

Cameroon has been battling the terrorist group for longer .

These include cross-border raids and attempts to take over a Cameroon military base in Kolofata and another in Achigashia , forcing Cameroonian soldiers to retreat and then for the first time use airstrikes against the insurgents .
