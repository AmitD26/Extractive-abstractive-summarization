Tunis -LRB- CNN -RRB- The bodies of four Italian tourists slain in a terror attack on Tunisia 's Bardo Museum three days ago arrived back in Italy on Saturday , an official with the Tunis Crisis Center told CNN , but 14 victims ' remains still lie in the morgue .

Most of the 23 victims were foreigners , making the process of identification more complicated . Nineteen of them were tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in Tunis .

Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid identified two suspects in the attack , Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaou , in an interview with French radio station RTL on Thursday , though it was n't immediately clear if they were the pair killed at the museum by Tunisian security forces .

Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi .

An uncle of Yassine Labidi , Abeld Malik Labidi , told CNN on Friday that no one he knew had seen any signs of extremism in his 26-year-old nephew .

But he said Yassine Labidi was one of the two gunmen killed at the museum .

But , he said , he believed Yassine and other young Tunisians like him were also victims of terrorism -- of the recruiters who paid them money , organized the logistics and took them to places like Syria and Libya to train as fighters .

He had known his nephew well , he said . `` After the revolution of 2011 he started to pray , before he would drink beers from time to time , like a young Tunisian . He was n't extreme in any way . ''

`` When he came back his behavior was the same : he was still himself , calm , serious . Nobody noticed anything , even the neighbors I spoke to , '' said Abeld Malik Labidi .

Abeld Malik Labidi said Yassine 's father , sister and brother had undergone lengthy interrogations by anti-terror police since the attack . Officers had seized his nephew 's computer and phone , as well as taking samples of his fingerprints , he said .

`` We are all shocked , we lost someone even if what he did was wrong , may God forgive him . Those he killed were innocent , why would you go and harm Australians or Japanese ... our Islam does n't mention about killing people , Islam has never been this , '' he said .

He also said he had no idea how his cousin had been radicalized , saying he was `` a normal Tunisian guy ... but not an extremist . ''

`` They left the country illegally last December for Libya , and they were able to train with weapons there , '' he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV .

Like Tunisia , Libya saw its longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the Arab Spring . But unlike its neighbor to the west , Libya has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by Islamist militants .

In an audio message posted online Thursday , ISIS claimed responsibility for Wednesday 's attack , which it said targeted `` crusaders and apostates '' with `` automatic weapons and hand grenades . '' CNN can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement .

That bloodshed is `` just the start , '' the ISIS message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for Tunisian investigators .
