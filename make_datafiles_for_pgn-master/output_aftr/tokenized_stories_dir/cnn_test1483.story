-LRB- CNN -RRB- Here are some of the names you might be hearing about as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev goes on trial in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings :

• Dzhokhar `` Jahar '' Tsarnaev : Born July 22 , 1993 , Tsarnaev and his family immigrated to the United States and applied for political asylum when he was 8 . A popular student , Tsarnaev attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and was captain of his high school wrestling team . He received a $ 2,500 scholarship from the city of Cambridge , Massachusetts , and attended the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth .

After the bombings , Tsarnaev returned to campus and stayed there until the FBI publicly identified him as a suspect . Tsarnaev texted a friend to come to his room and take whatever he wanted as he would not be coming back . He and older brother Tamerlan went on the run , allegedly killing an MIT officer , carjacking an SUV and engaging Watertown , Massachusetts , police in a firefight . Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed , and Dzhokhar was discovered the next day , badly wounded , hiding in a boat .

• Tamerlan Tsarnaev : Tamerlan Tsarnaev , born October 21 , 1986 , was an accomplished boxer . He won the New England Golden Gloves heavyweight division in 2009-2010 . Known for his flashy clothes and in-your-face self-confidence , Tamerlan aspired to join the U.S. boxing team despite being only a permanent resident and therefore ineligible . In early 2011 , Russia asked the FBI to look at Tsarnaev 's activities . After interviewing Tsarnaev and family members , the FBI said it `` did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government . '' In January 2012 , Tsarnaev left New York for Russia . It 's not clear what he did while there , but Tsarnaev 's father has said his son was with him at all times . He returned to the United States in July 2012 .

Seventy-two hours before the bombing , he was seen working out at the Wai Kru mixed martial arts gym with his younger brother . He was killed following a gunfight with Watertown police after his brother tried to free him with a stolen SUV but ran him down instead , according to an indictment against the younger Tsarnaev .

• Anzor Tsarnaev : Anzor Tsarnaev is the father of the Tsarnaev brothers . Originally from Chechnya , the family was exiled by Russians and settled in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan before seeking political asylum in the United States . The elder Tsarnaev fixed cars for a living , making ends meet through welfare . He and wife Zubeidat divorced in 2011 , and he returned to the Russian republic of Dagestan , where he now lives .

• Zubeidat Tsarnaeva : Mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva worked as a home health aide before switching to facials and skin care , both at a local spa and in her Cambridge home . She was charged with shoplifting in summer 2012 and soon after moved to Dagestan . If she returns to the United States , she could be arrested for failing to resolve the shoplifting charges . She has phoned several times during her younger son 's incarceration .

• Ailina Tsarnaeva : Ailina Tsarnaeva is the sister of the Tsarnaev brothers . At age 16 , she entered an arranged marriage that produced a son and lasted little more than a year , according to an investigative piece by The Boston Globe . Last year , Tsarnaeva was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment , accused of making a bomb threat against the mother of her boyfriend 's child . She denies the charge . Her last known address was in North Bergen , New Jersey , near her sister and the widow of Tamerlan Tsarnaev .

• Dias Kadyrbayev : Dias Kadyrbayev , a friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's , pleaded guilty to `` obstructing justice with the intent to impede the Boston Marathon bombing investigation , '' and he also pleaded guilty to conspiracy with his actions in the days immediately following the bombing .

Kadyrbayev was charged with four counts , including obstructing justice and conspiracy for throwing Tsarnaev 's backpack into a trash bin after discovering it contained fireworks with gunpowder , and removing a jar of Vaseline and a computer thumb drive . Investigators later recovered the backpack at a landfill .

Kadyrbayev also took Tsarnaev 's computer to his off-campus apartment , where the FBI later seized it . He is awaiting sentencing .

• Azamat Tazhayakov : In July , a jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's dorm room after the bombings .

Tazhayakov was another friend of Tsarnaev 's and was Kadyrbayev 's roommate .

Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are both nationals of Kazakhstan who were temporarily living in the United States on student visas while attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth . Tazhayakov is expected to appeal .
