-LRB- CNN -RRB- One-year-old Viktoria lives almost entirely in the dark .

It 's an extraordinary contrast with just a few years before , when Donetsk was a thriving city that helped host the European Football Championship . Now the streets are empty and most of the shops are closed . The shelling is so incessant that our driver tells me it feels like having techno music playing constantly in the background .

Around 1.7 million children are affected by the conflict in Ukraine -- including more than a thousand who are seeking refuge in bomb shelters in Donetsk . These are not modern bunkers . They are freezing holes , normally in the cellar of a house , which are simply unfit for human habitation . If a building collapses in a bombing , everyone will be buried .

That is why in Debaltseve , for example , aid organizations are bringing body bags with them . Children are unbelievably stressed . They have seen friends and relatives die . They are afraid to even step outside of the cellars , as they fear they will never come back .

In a country where children are too often institutionalized , the ongoing crisis can only exacerbate the problem . Social systems are collapsing and children are bearing the brunt . In an orphanage for babies born to HIV-positive women , we found there were no tests to check if babies were HIV positive or not , let alone the necessary medication to treat them . These babies are in limbo -- nobody wants to adopt them and their status is not known .

We have to help these children now , but also plan for when the fighting stops -- people will need new homes , and we 'll have to deal with unexploded ordnance and the terrible psychological damage on children , among other things . This is not a case of delivering aid now and that 's the end of the story . We need to commit for the long term .

In the basement shelter , Viktoria 's parents cradle her tightly . They ask me the same question again and again : `` When will it all be over ? ''
