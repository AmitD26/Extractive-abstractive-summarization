It seemed to go well -- political points were scored , and polls were commissioned looking for advantages gained or lost . It was a drama of sorts , even though no knock-out punches were landed .

Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative party won the election , but not by enough to go into government alone .

Britain 's broadcasters , keen to channel lively politics onto prime time TV and boost ratings , have been working the corridors of power themselves over the past year to try to nail down a repeat -- or two -- of the 2010 knockabout .

But Miliband 's Labour party is holding out for at least one head-to-head debate with Cameron .

No one seems to be budging but both of the UK 's largest parties could use the bump in the polls such a debate might bring .

Part of the problem is the British electorate , which has changed since 2010 , boosting the fortunes of some of the country 's former political outliers .

The rightwing UKIP , which has pledged to take the UK out of the European Union , has made massive gains in the past year -- mostly at the expense of Cameron 's Conservatives .

In Scotland , the September independence referendum -LRB- which narrowly failed -RRB- so reinvigorated the Scottish National Party that they could hit what is usually a key Labour stronghold , undermining Miliband 's bid for power .

All of this has made the whole process of nailing down precisely who will be allowed in the debate that much more tortuous . For the big leaders who drive that conversation , it is about how each outlier can help them -- and hinder their rivals .

It once looked like it would become as much of a British institution as rain , or fish and chips , but now the election debate seems in danger of not happening at all .

But factional politics and arguments about who is invited may derail a TV debate
