Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- A report on lab safety at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together by a committee of external experts calls the agency 's commitment to safety `` inconsistent and insufficient . '' The report , which was completed in January but posted on the agency 's website this week , also says `` laboratory safety training is inadequate . ''

One incident occurred in June when dozens of employees in a bioterrorism lab working with the deadly anthrax virus , were at risk because of a failure to properly follow sterilization techniques . The head of that lab resigned after the incident .

Then in December , with the advisory group already working to reduce lab safety risks and improve the culture of safety , employees in the Ebola lab were potentially exposed to that virus when a technician mistakenly transported the wrong specimens from a high-level lab to a lower-level lab .

The report recommends all CDC labs go through an external review and accreditation process . They suggest the College of American Pathologists for clinical labs and the American Biological Safety Association for research labs . To that point , the committee says in the report , `` The CDC must not see itself as special . The internal controls and rules that the rest of the world works under also apply to CDC . ''

-- Funding for lab safety programs and standardized training .

-- Implementing risk assessments .

-- Establishing a system of responsible science and accountability .

-- Rewarding researchers who run safe labs .

-- Hiring a director to oversee lab safety .
