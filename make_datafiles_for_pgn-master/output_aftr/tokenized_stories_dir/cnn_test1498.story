Yet he is still sending thousands of copies across the border from South to North Korea in balloons , determined his people will see the movie in which the leader Kim Jong Un is assassinated on screen .

`` The regime hates this film because it shows Kim Jong Un as a man , not a God , '' says Lee . `` He cries and is afraid like us and then he 's assassinated . ''

Kim is portrayed in the movie as a Katy Perry-loving , sensitive soul with daddy issues , clashing with the all-powerful image beamed out by Pyongyang 's tightly controlled state media and propaganda machine .

This irritates Lee .

`` We can help towards reunification with these balloons , '' says Lee . `` It costs millions of dollars to buy a F-22 fighter jet which the South Korean government insist they need and that 's not for peaceful purposes . So why do civilians like me have to do this under cover of darkness ? ''

The decision to launch the balloons in the dead of night is not just to avoid confrontation with North Korea , but also with South Korea 's local residents .

The chances of at least some North Koreans having watched the film that North Korea sees as `` an act of terrorism '' is certainly possible .
