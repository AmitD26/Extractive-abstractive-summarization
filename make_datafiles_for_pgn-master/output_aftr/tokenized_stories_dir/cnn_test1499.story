Almost exactly four years ago , in Libya , I caught , perhaps , a glimpse of what was to come .

It was late at night in the besieged city of Misrata . Hundreds of African migrants were caught between the Libyan civil war -LRB- back then some optimistically called it a `` revolution '' -RRB- and the deep blue sea . They had come to Misrata from Ghana , Nigeria and elsewhere , hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to Europe .

They had been pinned down under sporadic shelling from government forces , but were n't welcome by the rebels who controlled the city . They appealed to us to help them escape .

We could do nothing , but they may have eventually found their way out when the fighting subsided .

The fall of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's regime , which we reporters covered so avidly , was followed by chaos , which we in the news media largely neglected , focused as we journalists were on the next catastrophe , the Syrian civil war . In that chaos , the business of human trafficking has boomed .

That is certainly the case in the Sicilian port of Catania , where many migrants arrive . The city 's mayor , Enzo Bianco , insists city residents bear no ill will toward the migrants , but says Catania , and Sicily can not absorb the ever-growing numbers . The rest of Europe must help carry the burden .

Increasingly , some Italians are losing their patience . Two northern regions , Veneto and Valle d'Aosta , have declared they will no longer accept new migrants . The rightist Lega Nord has made opposition to new migrants a pillar of its party program .

Indeed , in tougher times , millions of impoverished Italians left their homeland to settle in the Americas and Australia . They , too , like the migrants from Africa and the Middle East , were fleeing grinding poverty and war . And they , too , experienced the kind of prejudice and resentment in lands their descendants now proudly call home .

That 's the long view , perhaps . But now , today , Italians are grappling to deal with the consequences of an array of old and new ills , ranging from failing states and failing economies to endemic corruption , hopeless poverty , oppression and injustice that no one state or group of states can solve without a gargantuan , expensive and politically daunting effort .

And Italians are alarmed that this year as many as a million migrants could arrive in Europe
