Villagers grieve in Patargata , around 125 miles south of Dhaka , capital of Bangladesh , Monday .

The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000 .

In the fishing village of Galachipa , in Patuakhali district , Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities .

Thousands are still missing , while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm . Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them .

In addition , the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through , wiping out many villages and littering the river 's shores with debris . Watch as people are left to fend for themselves ''

Improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991 , when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands .

Sidr has already ruined Bangladesh 's rice harvest , but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past . Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country 's rice production in 1974 .

In addition , the U.S. Agency for International Development -LRB- USAID -RRB- is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm .

Bangladesh 's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues , Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN .

Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions can not yet be determined .

Munaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh 's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone , most of those along the southern coast . The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced .

Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm , or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use .

Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process .

Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara , the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial .

Overwhelmed with sadness , her mother Khadija was steadied by a relative .
