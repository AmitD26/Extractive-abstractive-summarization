`` It might 've been lesser time , but then again , I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home , '' Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m.

`` I would n't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister . You know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . Basically , I ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? '' he asked .

In 2005 , a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year 's Eve party . Wilson was 17 at the time of the party . Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal ''

The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation .

According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , prosecutors in Douglas County , Georgia , offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record .

He wants to major in sociology , he said , `` because I feel like I 've been living my major . ''

The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said .

`` When it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it 's all gone , and I know what it feels like to be without and I do n't want to ever feel like that again , '' said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king . `` I do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period . ''

Though he called his sentence `` absurd , '' Wilson said he understands that prosecutors `` were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law . ''

`` I was young then . I did some idiotic things in my teen years , but you know , every average teen does , '' he said . `` I do n't think any of us made very wise decisions , but I do n't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened . '' E-mail to a friend
