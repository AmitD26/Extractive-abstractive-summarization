Canadian NATO-led soldiers walk patrol near Kandahar , Afghanistan .

James Appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help NATO meet Canada 's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar , where Canadian troops are based .

Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar .

Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces , the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S. , Canadian , British and Dutch troops .

Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but , he said , the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not `` whether , but when . ''

U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance .

Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia 's bid , because of Greece 's objections .
