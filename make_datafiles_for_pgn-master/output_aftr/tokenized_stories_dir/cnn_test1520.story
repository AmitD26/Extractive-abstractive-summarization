`` Change has come to America , '' President-elect Barack Obama told the nation on Tuesday night .

`` At this defining moment , change has come to America , '' Obama , who will be the nation 's first black president , told a crowd of about 125,000 people in Chicago 's Grant Park .

Paying tribute to the legions of volunteers and voters who carried him to victory , Obama echoed the words of Abraham Lincoln in the Gettysburg Address , saying those legions proved `` a government of the people , by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth . ''

Obama pledged to heal partisan wounds left after a bruising election battle , again using the words of Lincoln , the first Republican in White House .

`` As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours , ` We are not enemies , but friends ... though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection . '

`` Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long , '' Obama said .

Obama used the life of 106-year-old Ann Nixon Cooper of Atlanta , Georgia , to illustrate what the nation has overcome in her lifetime , including the Depression , world wars , the nation 's quest for civil rights , a man on the moon , the fall of the Berlin Wall and even a world connected by technology .

Obama hinted he 's even looking beyond his first term , and through the first eight of those next hundred years .

Obama congratulated his rival John McCain and praised McCain 's service to the country as a politician and Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam .

`` He fought long and hard in this campaign , and he 's fought even longer and harder for the country he loves , '' Obama said . `` I look forward to working with -LRB- him -RRB- to renew this nation 's promise in the months ahead . '' Watch Obama 's praise of John McCain ''

`` You have earned the new puppy that 's coming with us to the White House , '' he told his daughters .

Obama spent the first part of his historic Election Day voting , visiting campaign staffers and playing a little basketball .

Following an Obama campaign tradition , he arrived Tuesday afternoon at a gym on Chicago 's west side , where a campaign spokeswoman said he met with friends for a game of round ball .

`` I hope this works , '' Obama said after placing his ballot into a scanning machine . `` I 'll be really embarrassed if it does n't . '' Watch Obama family at voting station ''
