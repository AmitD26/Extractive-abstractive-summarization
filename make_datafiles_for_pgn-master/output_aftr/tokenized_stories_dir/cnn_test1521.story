Joran van der Sloot awaits transfer from the Netherlands to Aruba in November . He later was released .

The exact location of that meeting was not disclosed , but van der Sloot 's attorney , Joe Tacopina , said his client has `` agreed to answer any questions . ''

In the video that aired Sunday on Dutch television , van der Sloot , a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Holloway , told a man he was with the Alabama teen on an Aruban beach when she apparently died and that a friend of his with a boat disposed of Holloway 's body .

Van der Sloot later said the statements were lies , and on Monday , Tacopina said the video contains `` no admission of a crime . ''

The chief prosecutor in Aruba , Hans Mos , was denied an initial attempt to arrest van der Sloot by the investigating judge last Sunday .

Holloway disappeared while visiting Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham , Alabama , and was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe .

Mos dropped charges against the three men in December , saying he could n't be sure of a conviction . E-mail to a friend
