Roland S. Martin says Sasha Obama is from a generation raised in a diverse world and open to possibility .

WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are so many things that we could take away and remember forever regarding the inauguration of the first African-American president in the history of the United States , but I 'll always remember the laughter of a little girl .

People cried , others hugged , celebrities and everyday folks snapped photos to capture the moment .

I was shooting photos from the CNN platform just across from where he spoke , and one of the many images was of a beaming Sasha alongside her mom and 10-year-old sister , Malia .

Can you imagine what was going through this young girl 's mind , to see her father stand there and take the oath of office ?

These young girls , and countless other black children , among others , will grow up in an America where what they can imagine is backed up by what they see . Despite the reality that racism has n't left us , these children have the advantage of not being burdened with being separated by race .

So much has been written about today 's generation living in a world where hip-hop music brought them all together in one room , coupled with the diverse images on television and movies . Their reality is not the reality of their parents , and we will see that play out a lot in the future .

What also is most compelling about this age of Obama is how he has been received thus far internationally . Many political experts are simply stunned that a man who has only been on the national stage for five years would have so much good will across the pond .

Of course , a lot of that has to do with the fact that President George W. Bush and his team were seen as running roughshod over their international partners , praising them when they needed something , and savaging them when they disagreed with the U.S. position .

Obama 's election sends a powerful signal to the world that Americans are backing up their rhetoric and ideals with action , and Obama serves as that powerful symbol .

Barack Hussein Obama now has the opportunity to show those who voted for him -- and those who did n't -- that the change he often spoke about can come to pass .

If he is able to fulfill many of the promises he made during the campaign , he will go down as one of America 's most successful presidents , looked at fondly by the American people .
