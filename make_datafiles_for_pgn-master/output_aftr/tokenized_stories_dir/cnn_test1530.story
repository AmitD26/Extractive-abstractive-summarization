BEDFORD HEIGHTS , Ohio -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After two years of traveling around the country and criticizing President Bush , President-elect Barack Obama said Friday that he `` always thought -LSB- Bush -RSB- was a good guy . ''

Barack Obama tells CNN 's John King that it was `` tough '' for him to request the additional bailout funds .

`` I mean , I think personally he is a good man who loves his family and loves his country , '' Obama said in an exclusive interview with CNN 's John King .

During the election season , Obama frequently campaigned against what he called Bush 's `` failed policies '' and promised a `` clean break '' from the past eight years .

Asked if there was anything he wanted to take back , now that he has spent more time with the president , Obama praised Bush 's team for helping with a smooth transition and said part of what America is about is being able to have `` disagreements politically and yet treat each other civilly . ''

Obama also said he thought Bush made `` the best decisions that he could at times under some very difficult circumstances . ''

Even before taking the oath of office , Obama has already faced a showdown with Congress over releasing what remains of the $ 700 bailout bill that Bush and Congress authorized before the election .
