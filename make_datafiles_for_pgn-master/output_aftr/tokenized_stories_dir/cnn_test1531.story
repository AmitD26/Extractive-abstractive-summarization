-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Back in my day -LRB- a day not long ago , as it turns out -RRB- , you could go down to the local record shop and plunk down your paper-route money for little disks of plastic that were embedded with the latest sounds of your favorite musical performers .

A self-admitted tech geek , Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com , a blogging network .

Whether your tastes ran from Al Jarreau to `` Weird Al '' Yankovic , you could be assured that those purchased disks were yours -- for keeps .

This scheme would come to be known as DRM . Digital rights management or devious rental misappropriation ? That 's right . Rental . You see , you do n't really buy music for keeps anymore . I mean , how can you when this is the sort of thing that can happen ?

It 's a bit like buying your dream car , driving it around for a while , then being told it 's got to be given back to the factory because the dealership where it was purchased no longer has a legal association with the factory .

Sorry if you thought you could drive it around until it was worn out beyond repair , if you thought you could lend it to your friends , if you thought you could drive it to the illicit Charleston dancing party , if you thought you could sell it to a used car dealer or if you thought you could store it under a tarp in your garage for the next couple of decades in hopes it would gain value as a collector 's item .

Being used to the old , tangible business model , you were under the impression that you 'd actually bought something . No one told you that you were merely borrowing someone else 's property for a while -LRB- and paying for the privilege to do so -RRB- . Like a sharecropper . Like a serf . Like a sucker .

And most people do feel like suckers when DRM locks them out of something that they feel they have every right to use , often to the point of attempting to circumnavigate this crappy , unfair system by means that might lead to trouble .

I can only conclude that , like bootleggers at the repealing of Prohibition , viruses and spyware acquired in pursuit of overcoming content restrictions would n't prosper in a DRM-free world . Really , it 's hard to take alarm from DRM-happy organizations such as the MPAA as anything but a double dose of dookie when you find out that 2007 was a record box office year in spite of all the pirates and ne'er - do-wells and whatnot !

-LRB- This column was written before Apple announced that iTunes would be , at some point in the future , capable of providing DRM-free music throughout its entire library . This was pretty big news , considering how many people use iTunes to manage their music library . This is n't to say that the DRM-free tracks available at Amazon or eMusic are any less valid , but let 's face it : just about everybody who carries an iPod or iPhone also uses iTunes as the gateway for purchasing music . -RRB-

But DRM ? It 's no good . It 's downright evil . I find it very difficult to purchase something outright when I 'm told that I can only play it X times , only on X devices or for X long . That 's counter-intuitive and consumer unfriendly . There are certainly exceptions to the rule , but not when the content is a commodity .

The MP3 ? It 's as perfect as it needs to be , playable on just about anything these days . That 's consumer friendly .

Services that limit when and how you play digital music are ripping off consumers

Digital rights management , or DRM , means you do n't really own the music you buy
