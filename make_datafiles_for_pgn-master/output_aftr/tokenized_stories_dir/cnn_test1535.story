LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sky News , the British-based 24-hour news broadcaster , will not show a controversial appeal for aid for the people of Gaza , it announced Monday .

Protesters demonstrate in London Sunday against the BBC 's decision not to show Gaza aid appeal .

Sky News joins the BBC in refusing to show the appeal by the Disasters Emergency Committee , an umbrella group of 13 leading British aid agencies .

The BBC , Britain 's public broadcaster , has been criticized by politicians and religious leaders for refusing to show the appeal , which launches Monday . There have been demonstrations against the decision at BBC buildings in England and Scotland .

`` Broadcasting an appeal for Gaza at this time is incompatible with our role in providing balanced and objective reporting of this continuing situation to our audiences in the UK and around the world , '' John Ryley , the head of Sky News , said Monday in a statement on the company 's Web site .

British broadcasters , led by the BBC , originally declined to air the Gaza appeal , but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others , ITV , Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds . CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad , a DEC spokesman said .

But the BBC is sticking with its position , director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation 's Web site .

`` Gaza remains a major ongoing news story , in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict , the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious , '' he added .

The BBC , which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television , is required by its charter to be impartial .

`` That is a decision they must make . We have no view on that subject , '' he said .

Many readers of Thompson 's blog post did have a view , however . The statement received hundreds of comments , most of them critical of the BBC .

A commenter who signed in as bully -- baiter said the BBC was taking a side no matter what it did .

Other commenters simply rejected Thompson 's position out of hand .

The corporation had its defenders as well .

`` The last thing I want to do , is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda , '' SternG wrote : `` There 's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC 's politically-motivated ` appeal ' for Gaza . Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group , including by the EU . There is no doubt that some aid/fund will be ` procured ' by Hamas ... . Good decision BBC . ''

A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because `` there were genuine concerns , shared by the aid agencies , about the deliverability of aid . ''
