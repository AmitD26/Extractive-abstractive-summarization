A bare-chested Drogba is congratulated by Salomon Kalou after scoring the winner at Wembley .

The all-London clash rarely hit the heights on a difficult pitch , but Drogba 's 84th minute strike gave Guus Hiddink 's men a deserved victory and leaves them in contention for three trophies .

Dutchman Hiddink , who took temporary charge of the Blues in February and has lost only one match , said Drogba had proved his worth again .

`` We respect each other very much but also challenge each other without thinking this is a big name . ''

Chelsea looked the stronger against an Arsenal team missing key defenders and goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and it came as no surprise when Ivory Coast star Drogba scored a typical winner .

He latched on to Frank Lampard 's hopeful volleyed through ball , shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net .

Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick .

Arsenal had made a fine start , but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal , Chelsea came back strongly into the game .

Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski , but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post .

More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten .

Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted , but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score .
