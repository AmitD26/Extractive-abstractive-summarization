The Porsche 911 has several versions , but all have been annointed with the `` supercar '' appellation .

Using CR 's recommendations as a guideline , here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $ 30,000 + price range :

2007 Acura MDX

The newer MDX is classified as a crossover SUV , but it 's a deluxe version . It was all-new in ' 07 , and was built on a proper platform -- as opposed to being adapated from the Accord passenger-car platform . It also came in three flavors : Base , Technology and Sport Packages , and all three were powered by a 3.7-liter 300-hp V6 .

Consumer Reports also recommended the 3-Series coupe and convertible that joined BMW 's model line-up in ' 07 . AOL Autos : Used BMW

The M3 is the top-of-the-line , high-performance-tuned version of the 3-series coupe . Performance power , therefore , is much higher than the other 3-Series editions . It came as a coupe or convertible , and churned out 333 horses . The M3 is often favorably compared to the Porsche 911 when it comes to quick acceleration , crisp braking and taking tough corners at brisk speeds without breaking a sweat .

Well , the marketplace surely is not lacking for luxury crossovers . Here is yet another one that appeals to luxury buyers with its balance of SUV-type spaciousness , pampering amenities , deft handling and burly engine muscle . For ' 07 , the FX35 was a two-wheel-drive vehicle powered by a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission . AOL Autos : Used Infiniti

Lexus

Just like in the $ 24,000-to - $ 30,000 category , Consumer Reports recommended a slew of world-beating used Lexus models in this segment : the ' 06 - '07 6-cylinder GS RWD ; the '07 GS450h Hybrid ; ' 05 - '07 GX ; '07 IS ; ' 04 - '07 LS ; ' 03 - '06 LX and ' 06 - '07 RX . AOL Autos : Used Lexus

Lexus has placed No 1 in the JD Power Dependability Survey every year for the last 12 years - until ' 07 , when another carmaker , Buick , finally tied them for first .

Porsche 911 -LRB- various years -RRB-

Consumer Reports included the '98 911 in the $ 24,000 to $ 30,000 category . Here , the model years get more recent as the price range climbs . The 911 went through some changes over this time period , of course , but all have been anointed with the `` supercar '' appellation . AOL Autos : Used Porsche

And by the latest recommended used-model year , the ' 07 , you could choose among various styles and engine sizes , including the Carrera , with its 3.6-L 325-hp flat-six plant ; the Carrera S and S Cabriolet , with the 3.8-L 355 hp V6 ; the 911 Turbo , with twin-turbocharged 480 hp six-cylinder engine ; and the GT3 track model , powered by a high-revving 415-hp six-cylinder engine .
