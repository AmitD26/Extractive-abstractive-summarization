-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An elderly American man has been released from a Mexican jail more than two months after the grandson he was traveling with was arrested on child pornography charges , a family member said .

Edward Chrisman , left , crosses the Mexican border back into the United States after being freed Saturday .

It was at that point , the family says , that the girls ' mother demanded more money from Chrisman and called local authorities alleging that Chrisman had tried taking pornographic pictures of her daughters , after he refused to ante up .

The Chrisman family says the men were set up as a ploy for money . Since early January , the family says , they have paid thousands of dollars to at least three attorneys for legal representation and have reached out to numerous officials and politicians in Mexico and the United States for help .

Traveling abroad for health care is a phenomenon known as medical tourism . Many do it to save money or to get medical care not approved in the United States . Internationally recognized hospitals in Thailand and Singapore can often perform orthopedic and heart procedures at a fraction of the cost . Mexico is a popular choice for dental care .

The estimated number of Americans seeking treatment overseas annually varies widely , but starts at a half-million people .
