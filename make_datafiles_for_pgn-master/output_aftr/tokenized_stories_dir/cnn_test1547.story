Hugh Jackman emerges as Wolverine in `` X-Men Origins : Wolverine , '' which opened Friday .

Actor Hugh Jackman and film producer Lauren Shuler Donner recently sat down for a candid conversation about their new film , `` X-Men Origins : Wolverine . ''

This scene represents the ultimate birth of a comic legend as the character is transformed from Logan to Wolverine . Watch the scene in which Wolverine is unleashed ''

Hugh Jackman : I knew this was the birth of the character ; this is where we see him in full flight . It 's called in the comic book `` berserker rage . '' It 's not really in the English language , but it may be now ! But , this idea that this complete animal -LSB- has been -RSB- unleashed , which is obviously the entire story -- this battle between the animal and human is something we all relate to .

Lauren Shuler Donner : There were many things he had to do in the tank , you know . One of them was he had to be lowered , and then the needles had to come towards him .

Jackman : I had in my head that I 've got to be in much better shape -- not better shape , different shape , kind of ridiculous shape because I wanted it to be uncomfortable . I wanted it to feel like I felt when I saw Robert De Niro in `` Cape Fear , '' that -- whoa , this guy is dangerous , he 's powerful , he 's dangerous , and he can snap at any point .

Jackman : I was a little frightened when I watched it , like , `` Is that me ? '' -LSB- My wife -RSB- Deb was like , `` Hugh , this is ridiculous . I do n't even know who that is . ''
