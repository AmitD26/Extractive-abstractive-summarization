-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama 's address to Congress was full of lofty promises to make unprecedented investments in government programs , even as he aims to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term .

President Obama on Tuesday outlined an ambitious agenda to help revive the economy .

CNN political analyst David Gergen says the answer will be `` one of the greatest political dramas of our time . ''

Economy

Promise : `` To ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again , I ask Congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system . ''

Promise : `` My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs . As you can imagine , this is a process that will take some time , but we have already identified $ 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . ''

Analysis : Democratic strategist Lisa Caputo said so far , Obama is taking the right steps to revive the economy , but the country needs to see his plans put into action . He 's already passed a massive stimulus bill , and he has a housing bill and a banking regulatory reform bill in the works .

`` This was a speech about aspirations . There was not a strategy or the details . They may come later , but it 's an overly ambitious program , and if he can accomplish just the financial part of it , he 'll move the country forward , '' he said .

Larry Winget , a personal finance expert , said he agrees with everything that Obama said needs to be done , but said he does n't agree that the country can borrow or spend its way out of debt .

`` If you came to me and said , ` I 'm in a financial crisis , I 've screwed up everything based on all of my bad decisions , what should I do ? ' the last thing in the world I would tell you is to go borrow more money or go try to spend something that -- money you do n't have on something you do n't need , '' he said .

`` The practical thing would be to put more money in the hands of people , which would always go back to , we need to give bigger ... tax cuts , '' he said .

Education

Promise : `` By 2020 , America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world . That is a goal we can meet . ''

`` We have $ 59 billion in this year 's education budget . We added another $ 100 billion to build schools and do those things . That 's never been the role of the federal government . So it 's a whole new way to go , and obviously if it works , it may benefit the country , '' he said .

CNN Senior Political Correspondent Candy Crowley said Obama 's proposals are just the start of a new direction .

Energy

Promise : `` We will invest $ 15 billion a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power , advanced biofuels , clean coal , and more efficient cars and trucks built right here in America . ''

Promise : `` Thanks to our recovery plan , we will double this nation 's supply of renewable energy in the next three years . '' Watch Obama say , ` It begins with energy ' ''

Analysis : Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute , said Obama laid out a `` tall order '' of what needs to be done , and tried to show how everything is connected .

`` So he showed , here 's the short term , which is stimulus , banking , housing . Here 's the longer term : If we want to own the century , we have to deal with energy , education , health , for example , and connecting those things , '' he said .

Health care

Analysis : Larry Elder , a libertarian commentator , thought that Obama gave a `` great political speech '' but Elder questioned the president 's economics .

`` Whenever I hear somebody talk about investing in health care , investing in education , investing in energy , I put my hand on my wallet and I say , ` These guys are not good stewards of your money the way you are of your own money . ' ''

Gibbs said Wednesday that the president is well aware of the difficulty of reforming health care .

But , Gibbs said , the president does n't plan on setting any `` artificial deadlines '' to pass health care reform .

Promise : `` To relieve the strain on our forces , my budget increases the number of our soldiers and Marines . And to keep our sacred trust with those who serve , we will raise their pay and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned . ''

Analysis : Patricia Murphy , editor of Citizen Jane Politics , said she thought Obama 's speech was strong , but she did n't follow Obama 's math . Watch : How to cut defense spending ''

`` The problem in this speech , I think , is his promise to cut the deficit in half and layering on program after program after program , saying we 'll pull the troops out of Iraq , but we 'll increase the size of the military . Those numbers do n't add up , '' she said .

CNN contributor Roland Martin on Tuesday compared Obama to rapper Kanye West . Martin : Obama 's ambitious agenda is a good thing

All of the president 's promises -- fixing health care , fixing the economy , halving the deficit , boosting funds to troops , curing cancer , achieving energy independence and solving Pakistan 's problems , to name a few -- are just the markers in terms of his presidency , Martin said .

'' -LSB- Obama -RSB- is a guy who is saying , a president who 's saying , ` Look , I want to raise the stakes . ' And , so , is n't it amazing that we 're sitting here , saying , ` Wow , an ambitious president ' ? Well , should n't we have an ambitious president ? Should n't we have a president saying , ` We can do more ' ? ''
