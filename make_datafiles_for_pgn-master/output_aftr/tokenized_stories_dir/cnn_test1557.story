The case cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabia 's strict Islamic law .

Al-Jazirah newspaper quoted a Saudi Justice Ministry official saying King Abdullah issued a royal pardon Monday -- the same day that the Hajj , the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca , begins in Saudi Arabia .

The victim 's husband told CNN he has not received an official letter regarding her pardon , but considers it to be legitimate since it was announced in an official Saudi newspaper .

Saudi sources told CNN that the king 's pardon was not related to the beginning of the Hajj nor the Eid al-Adha festival that follows , which is normally when the Saudi monarch issues amnesty for prisoners . Watch how Arab media is reporting the story . ''

Saudi Arabia 's Justice Minister Abdullah Bin Mohammad al-Sheikh told al-Jazirah newspaper that the king felt the pardon would be in the best interests of the Saudi people , and the decision did not reflect any lack of confidence in the Saudi justice system .

A Saudi court ruled the 19-year-old had an `` illegitimate relationship '' with a man who was not her husband , and that she was raped after she and the man were discovered in a `` compromising situation , her clothes on the ground . ''

The rape took place in Qatif in March 2006 when the woman was engaged to be married .

The case has drawn international attention , provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under strict Islamic law in Saudi Arabia .

The woman was meeting with a man -- described by the woman 's attorney as a former friend from whom she was retrieving a photograph -- when they both were abducted last March .

Seven men , convicted of abducting the pair and raping her , were sentenced from two to nine years in prison .

Abdul Rahman al-Lahim , the lawyer who represented the woman , faced a disciplinary hearing for `` insulting the Supreme Judicial Council and disobeying the rules and regulations '' of the judiciary . The hearing has been postponed .

Al-Lahim has said he hopes the case changes the Saudi justice system .

`` We want to highlight the rape crimes in Saudi Arabia and the way they are handled and sentenced in court , '' he added . `` This is a new era for all of us . ''
