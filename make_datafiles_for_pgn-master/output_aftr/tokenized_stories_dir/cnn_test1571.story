A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura 's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005 .

Sounds like a great sci-fi flick . But it 's not .

The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world . But Nomura 's stands out because of its enormous size .

`` The sheer size of them , individually , makes them fairly spectacular , '' Graham said .

Spectacular , perhaps , to scientists , but perilous to villagers along the Japanese coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past . They had giant-jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007 , and because they 've recently been spotted in the Sea of Japan , they 're bracing for another , potentially harmful wave this summer .

`` Communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets , '' Graham said . `` When these nets get wiped out , it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community . ''

The good news is that previous attacks have prompted Japan to put in place a warning system for fishermen . While they still risk losing a big catch , they can , at least , save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish .

It 's not clear why waves of Nomura 's jellyfish have made it to the Sea of Japan in recent years . Some have speculated that overfishing , pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on Nomura 's jellyfish in the polyp stage . However , no one is certain , Graham said .
