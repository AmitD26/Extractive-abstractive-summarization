Life expectancy during the peak years of the Great Depression increased 6.2 years -- from 57.1 years in 1929 to 63.3 years in 1933 -- according to University of Michigan researchers Jose A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux . The increase applied to men and women , whites and non-whites .

The team crunched data from the federal government and concluded that `` population health did not decline and indeed generally improved during the four years of the Great Depression , 1930-1933 , with mortality decreasing for almost all ages , and life expectancy increasing by several years in males , females , whites , and non-whites . ''

The researchers used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine the association between economic growth and population health from 1920 to 1940 . Though population health improved during 1930-1933 and during the recessions of 1921 and 1938 , mortality -- the death rate -- increased and life expectancy fell during times of economic expansion , such as 1923 , 1926 , 1929 and 1936-1937 , they wrote .

The researchers looked at mortality rates due to six causes of death that made up two-thirds of total mortality in the 1930s : cardiovascular and kidney diseases , cancer , influenza and pneumonia , tuberculosis , motor vehicle injuries and suicide .

Only suicide went up during economic downturns , they said , citing the recession years 1921 , 1932 and 1938 , but suicides accounted for less than 2 percent of total deaths . Those years were marked by high unemployment ; the nation experienced its highest unemployment rate of 22.9 percent in 1932 , they wrote .

Yet from 1920 to 1940 , life expectancy increased 8.8 years .

In addition , new , inexperienced workers may be more likely to become injured ; workers may sleep less and adopt less healthy eating habits , he said .

Further , boom times may translate into more industrial pollution , which can take a toll on populations ' health , he said .

During recessions , with less work to do , employees may work slower , sleep longer and spend more time with family and friends , he said . With less money , they may spend less on alcohol and tobacco .

`` In the three of them , it was the same , '' he said .
