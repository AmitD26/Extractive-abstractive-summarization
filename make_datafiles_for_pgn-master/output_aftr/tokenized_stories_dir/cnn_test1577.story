-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Because you were n't going into botany , the priesthood , or coin manufacturing , you thought you were safe to dismiss Latin as a dead language . Obviously , you did n't graduate cum laude .

I think , therefore I am the famous statue `` The Thinker '' by French sculptor Auguste Rodin .

Caveat Emptor : -LRB- KAV-ee-OT emp-TOR -RRB- : `` Let the buyer beware ''

Before money-back guarantees and 20-year warranties , caveat emptor was indispensable advice for the consumer .

For extra credit points , remember that caveat often makes solo appearances at cocktail parties as a fancy term for a warning or caution .

Oh , and just so you know , caveat lector means `` let the reader beware . ''

The term is most commonly used in diplomatic circles to indicate that a person is unwelcome due to ideological differences or a breach of trust .

Michael Moore was treated as a persona non grata at the Republican National Convention . Bill O'Reilly would experience the same at Burning Man .

Habeas Corpus : -LRB- HAY-bee-as KOR-pus -RRB- : `` You have the body ''

When you wake up in the New Orleans Parish Prison after a foggy night at Mardi Gras , remember this one .

It 's also one of the cornerstones of the American and British legal systems . Without it , tyrannical and unjust imprisonments would be possible .

Cogito Ergo Sum : -LRB- CO-gee-toe ER-go SOME -RRB- : `` I think , therefore I am ''

Ren√© Descartes , the 17th-century French philosopher , coined the phrase as a means of justifying reality . According to him , nothing in life could be proven except one 's thoughts . Well , so he thought , anyway .

E Pluribus Unum : -LRB- EE PLUR-uh-buhs OOH-nuhm -RRB- : `` Out of many , one ''

Less unique than it sounds , America 's original national motto , e pluribus unum , was plagiarized from an ancient recipe for salad dressing .

As a slogan , it really nailed that whole cultural melting pot thing we were going for . And while it continues to appear on U.S. coins , `` In God We Trust '' came along later -LRB- officially in 1956 -RRB- to share the motto spotlight .

Quid Pro Quo : -LRB- kwid proh KWOH -RRB- : `` You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours ''

And if you give someone some quid , you 're going to expect some quo .

Something of a quantified value is traded for something of equal value ; elements are parted and parceled off until quid pro quo is achieved .

Most recently , Arizona Senator John McCain co-opted the phrase to describe campaign finance and influence pedaling because he believes that one does n't give major milk to a campaign without expecting major cheese in return .

In the world of public discourse , ad hominem is a means of attacking one 's rhetorical opponent by questioning his or her reputation or expertise rather than sticking to the issue at hand . Translation : Politicians are really good at it .

People who resort to ad hominem techniques are usually derided as having a diluted argument or lack of discipline . If pressed , they 'll brandish it like a saber and refuse to get back to the heart of the matter . Who said the debate team does n't have sex appeal ?

Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam : -LRB- ad-MA-yor-em DAY-ee GLOR-ee-um -RRB- : `` All for the Greater Glory of God ''

Remind your Jesuit-educated buddies of this when they seem to be straying from the path . -LRB- Best used with a wink and a hint of irony . -RRB-

Granted , labeling something `` sui generis '' is really just classifying the unclassifiable . But let 's not over-think it . Use it at a dinner party to describe Andy Kaufman , and you impress your friends . Use it too often , and you just sound pretentious . E-mail to a friend
