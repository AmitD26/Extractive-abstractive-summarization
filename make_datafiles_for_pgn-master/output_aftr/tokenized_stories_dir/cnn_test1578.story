-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Pennsylvania teens will serve time in a county jail for participating in a brawl that left a Mexican immigrant dead last July .

Brandon Piekarsky , 17 , was sentenced to 6 to 23 months , and Derrick Donchak , 19 , received 7 to 23 months for their roles in the beating death of 25-year-old Luis Ramirez .

Judge William Baldwin ordered the two to report to Schuylkill County jail on July 19 to begin serving their sentences .

In fashioning his sentence , Baldwin acknowledged the severity of the attack , which left Ramirez on life support for two days before he died , but said he could pass a sentence only in accordance with the jury 's verdict .

`` You picked out a guy who was n't one of you and beat the pulp out of him , '' Baldwin said .

After the verdict , Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending that the Department of Justice pursue civil rights charges .

`` I 'm disappointed that the court exceeded the aggravated range and sentenced him to six months . Having said that , I 'm glad we finally have some finality with this case , '' Fanelli told CNN affiliate WBRE after the sentencing .

Baldwin heard from several teachers , coaches and family friends who testified that the teens were good kids who fell into a bad situation . They urged leniency so the teens could realize their potential as adults .

Ramirez 's longtime girlfriend and mother of two of his children read a statement in open court before an audience consisting mostly of the defendants ' supporters .

`` He was my one and only love , and they took him away from me , and they took my children 's father , '' Crystal Dillman said . `` Now I have to live without my best friend and love of my life . ''

The court also heard a prepared statement from Ramirez 's mother , Elisa Zavala , who lives in Guanajuato , Mexico .

`` I 'm not the same person as before , now I feel a great emptiness within my heart , '' she wrote . `` There are moments in which I 'm alone and I ask myself : What do I do now that I do n't have my son ? I feel that without him , I am no one . ''

Jurors found Piekarsky not guilty of third-degree murder . Prosecutors had said he delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez 's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground in the alcohol-fueled brawl , which occurred on a residential street in Shenandoah the evening of July 12 .

Prosecutors alleged that a group of teens , which included Piekarsky and Donchak , baited Ramirez into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking , hurling racial epithets at the undocumented Mexican immigrant .

Advocacy groups condemned the verdict and sentences , and called on the Department of Justice to bring federal hate crime charges against the defendants .

`` The meager sentences handed to the defendants today leaves justice gasping for further redress , '' said Gladys Limon , staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund .

`` The failure to hold these defendants responsible for their atrocious crimes denies justice not just to the Ramirez family , but also to the entire community by failing to deter similar crimes in the future , '' she said .

`` Since the year 2000 , we 've seen a 50 percent surge in the number of hate groups across the country , to a record 926 by our latest count , '' he said .
