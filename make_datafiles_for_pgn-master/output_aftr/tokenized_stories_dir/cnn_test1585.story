`` It 's not like 9/11 , '' Brennan said , adding that the `` system did n't work as it should have '' due to `` lapses '' and `` human error . ''

`` There was n't an effort to try to conceal information , '' he said , referring to the well-chronicled competition and turf wars among security agencies prior to the 2001 attacks , which was later blamed for the failure to prevent them .

Meanwhile , the Transportation Security Administration announced Sunday new security measures to be implemented by domestic and international air carriers on flights bound for the United States , effective Monday .

`` That was certainly an alert that came to our attention , '' Brennan said of the father 's warnings . `` He said , ` He 's consorting with extremists in Yemen . ' ''

However , Brennan rejected another potential warning sign -- that the suspect purchased the airline ticket with cash in Ghana before traveling to Nigeria for the first leg of his journey .

`` A lot of people buy their tickets in Africa with cash . That is the way , in fact , things are done , because there 's so much fraud there . So that was n't a necessary -LSB- warning -RSB- bell , '' Brennan said . `` People in the Amsterdam airport did n't even know that he had bought the ticket for cash . He did bring on carry-on luggage . So there were a lot of things that were out there . ''

At the same time , Brennan conceded `` there was information that was in the system that should have allowed us to stop it . ''

`` A number of pieces were out there that were n't brought together , '' Brennan said .

On the same program , however , the Republican chairman of the 9/11 commission said Brennan was `` wrong when he says this was n't like 9/11 . ''

Thomas Kean , a former governor of New Jersey , said both events occurred because the U.S. intelligence community failed to piece together various bits of information it already possessed in the weeks and months prior to the attacks .
