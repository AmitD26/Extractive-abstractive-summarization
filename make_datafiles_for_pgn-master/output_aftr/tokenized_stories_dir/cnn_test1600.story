-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prague has not been nicknamed `` Zlata Praha '' or `` Golden Prague '' for no good reason . The well-deserved eponym is a tribute to this city that mixes architecture , history , art and beauty like no other .

All more impressive than the others , these are the historical sites you should not miss in Prague .

Wenceslas Square : In 1348 , King Charles IV of Bohemia -LRB- now the Czech Republic -RRB- founded the town of Prague . The King built several open areas for markets , including Wenceslas Square , previously known as the Horse Market .

Named after Saint Wenceslas , the patron saint of the Czech state , the square is the largest in the city and was at the center of much of Prague 's history , including the Nazi occupation , the Soviet invasion , and the Velvet Revolution .

In 1969 , Prague student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia . And in 1989 , during the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the Communist regime , hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered here to protest .

Today the square has become one of the trendiest and busiest in the country . Lining Wenceslas Square are fashion stores , cafes , bars and kiosks . Above the square is Prague 's Museum of Natural History , which was shot at by Communist troops when they mistook it for the Parliament building .

Its construction started in 1357 under King Charles IV and finished in the beginning of the 15th century . Until the 19th century , the bridge was the only way to cross between the Old Town and adjacent areas , also known as the `` Lesser Town . ''

During the day , thousands of people traverse the bridge to watch the views of the city and enjoy the numerous street performers .

Dancing House : A masterpiece of modern architecture , Dancing House was named after dancing duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers . Dancing House is also sometimes nicknamed `` Drunk House '' for its wavy curves .

The building was constructed between 1992 and 1996 by Czech architect Vlado Milunc and world-renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry . The top floor houses one of the city 's most exclusive restaurants , Celeste .

Another fixture of the Old Town Square is the baroque-style St. Nicholas Church .

Astronomical Clock : Built in 1410 , the Astronomical Clock still functions and provides accurate data on a number of astrological events , such as the relative positions of the sun , moon and major planets .

Each hour , the clock bells and a series of moving wooden puppets come out . Below the Astronomical Clock are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac , added by painter Josef Manes in 1865 .

Today it is the seat of the Archbishop of Prague and contains the tombs of many of the Bohemian Kings . The interior features stained-glass windows from different eras .

One of the cathedral 's chambers was used to crown several Kings and it is said the room can only be opened with seven golden keys given to different members of parliament .

Its thick walls house the National Cemetery , where many of Prague 's most illustrious citizens are buried , including Czech composer Anton√≠n Leopold Dvorak and writer Karel Capek .
