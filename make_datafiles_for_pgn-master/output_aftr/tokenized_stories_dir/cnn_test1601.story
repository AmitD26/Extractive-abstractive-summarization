Before shipping overseas , every soldier must sign military Form D-A 53-05 , which states that failure to maintain a family care plan could result in disciplinary action .

But after a week with the infant , Hughes , who cares for ailing relatives and runs a day-care out of her home , said she felt so overwhelmed that she backed out .

`` It was that hard , because he 's a very busy baby , '' Hughes told CNN affiliate WTOC in Savannah , Georgia . `` You have to keep an eye on him 24 hours a day . ''

Hutchinson 's attorney , Rai Sue Sussman , said the soldier informed the Army that her family care plan had fallen through and that there was no one to take care of Kamani .

Fort Stewart spokesman Kevin Larson said Hutchinson 's unit had known for months about its pending deployment and that it was n't until the last minute that Hutchinson notified the Army of her child-care woes .

Like all soldiers who face similar circumstances , Hutchinson received a 30-day extension back in August and September , Larson said .

That 's `` plenty of time , '' he said , `` to work out another care plan . ''

On the eve of her unit 's departure , Hutchinson was ordered to be on the plane .

`` The sense I got from her and the reason I think why she was scared enough to not go and get on her plane was because they would take her child from her . ''

More than 30,000 single mothers have served in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars , according to a new report compiled by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America . Former Air Force JAG Officer Michelle McCleur said Hutchinson is not likely to win a legal battle with the Army .

`` When soldiers are ordered to deploy , and single soldiers included , they have to have a family care plan in place ... and they need to implement that , '' she said .
