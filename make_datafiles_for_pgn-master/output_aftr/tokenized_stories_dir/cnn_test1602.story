The top U.S. envoy for North Korea , Stephen Bosworth , is on a three-day visit for meetings to determine whether North Korea will return to six-party talks on its nuclear program .

The White House offered no new details about the talks , and North Koreanstate media only acknowledged Bosworth 's arrival in a one-line report .

North Korea abandoned the six-party talks last April , declaring them `` dead , '' in anger over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests . But the North also sent signals that it wanted to pursue bilateral talks with the United States instead of a multilateral dialogue .

Meanwhile , the North also has cooled its tough rhetoric against the United States .

Another reason for Pyongyang 's moves , analysts say , is neighboring China .

During the three-day visit , President Kim Jong Il indicated that North Korea was willing to return to the stalled six-party talks -- on condition that there would be progress in direct talks between North Korea and the United States .

China has hosted several rounds of the six-party talks , which bring together the United States , North and South Korea , Japan , Russia and China . The talks aim to negotiate a deal for North Korea to abandon its nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and aid .

In the end , Pyongyang wants direct talks with Washington that will eventually lead to diplomatic ties , a peace treaty and economic and trade relations .

`` China can only act as a go-between , but in the end , the U.S. and North Korea will have to resolve critical issues between themselves , '' Jiang said .

A U.S. State Department official said Bosworth would not carry any new proposals or new initiatives on his visit .

He added : `` The complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ... will be the focus of Ambassador Bosworth 's trip to Pyongyang . ''

Selig Harrison , an expert on North Korea who has visited the North many times said , `` the U.S. side always says we do n't want to buy the same horse twice . Defense Secretary -LRB- Robert -RRB- Gates actually said that several months ago , meaning that we keep giving North Korea things to get results which we do n't get and we feel that we 've been cheated and we 're making the same deal over and over again . But actually the North Koreans feel that they 're the ones who do n't get what we have promised . ''

`` If Bosworth can persuade the North Koreans to return to the six-party talks , all the better , '' said Zha Daojiong , a professor at Peking University in China .

`` On the other hand , it will be understandable if he does not . In terms of negotiations , just about all the cards have been put on the table , '' he said . `` It is critically important to be patient with both North Korea and the United States . ''

Some see the potential for progress .

Koh Yu-hwan , an expert on North Korea at Dongguk University in Seoul , South Korea , said there might be options when it comes to North Korea 's nuclear weapons .

`` It 's not that clear-cut , '' he said . `` The Korean War ended with an armistice . Technically the war is not yet over . The North wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent against the U.S. So , if the U.S. offers a security guarantee , pledges that it would n't try a ` regime change ' and sign a peace treaty with North Korea , the goal of denuclearization is still possible . ''

Bosworth 's visit comes after meeting with U.S. allies . He stopped in Seoul on Monday to brief South Korean officials on his trip to the North .
