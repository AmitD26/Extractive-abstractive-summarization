NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What started as a college a cappella pastime became a ticket to the big time for 10 Indiana University graduates .

Straight No Chaser broke up years ago , but success on YouTube brought the band back together .

Last year a member of the disbanded group -- called Straight No Chaser -- posted a video of a quirky 1998 performance of `` The 12 Days of Christmas '' on YouTube . It got more than 8 million hits . And one of the people watching was Craig Kallman , chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records .

And you thought your college reunion was exciting . Watch Straight No Chaser blend their voices ''

`` Holiday Spirits '' mostly features festive covers such as `` Santa Claus Is Coming to Town '' and `` Silent Night , '' all sung in the a cappella tradition but with creative and entertaining tweaks . -LRB- They do a stirring Christmas-infused rendition of Toto 's `` Africa . '' -RRB-

Members of Straight No Chaser sang for CNN in New York recently , talked about their surprising career turn and where it leaves their day jobs .

CNN : What is it like then to actually become a YouTube sensation ?

Randy Stine : Well , -LSB- Jerome -RSB- got recognized on the street in Hong Kong .

Stine : I was half believing it was a prank . I got the call from Craig , and while I 'm talking to him the first time , I 'm on the computer Googling his name to read his bio . It was just kind of a dream phone call . And I kept thinking , `` Is this really happening ? '' It was pretty amazing .

CNN : You all have day jobs , do n't you ?

CNN : What were you doing in Hong Kong ?

Collins : I was doing a festival of `` The Lion King , '' and I was Simba . We have one guy selling medical devices , another guy a reporter for ABC , one guy working at a bank , another guy a teacher . ... You name it , we have it .

CNN : And how do you arrange rehearsing or performances if you are scattered throughout the country ?

Stine : That 's probably one of the big challenges . We all have to fly in from whatever city we 're in to New York , to Chicago , L.A. , wherever we have to meet up to rehearse or record . But when we get together it 's like no time has passed .

CNN : Are you going to keep your day jobs ?

CNN : That 's what you 're hoping ? You 're hoping that they will get fired ? That 's nice !

Collins : Well , that 's the whole point . We hope that that momentum -- not only with YouTube , but with our album -- keeps going so we can get right back in the studio and come out with some fresh new music that 's not holiday . We do n't want to pigeonhole ourselves . We do all genres , all types of music .

CNN : What about your personalities ... have you all changed a little since you were at school together ?

Collins : Some of us have wives . That 's the only thing that 's changed .
