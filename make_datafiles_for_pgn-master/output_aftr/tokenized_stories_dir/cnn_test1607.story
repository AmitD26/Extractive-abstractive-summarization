-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After eight months in hibernation , ABC 's `` Lost '' returns to television tonight to finally explain , among other things , the dazzling white light that ended the 2009 season not with a whimper , but with a bang .

Who cares ?

That 's not a flippant question , because both TV and the audience have changed in the years since `` Lost '' pulled back from Jack 's eyeball to reveal , slowly and masterfully , the panicked insanity of a remote island plane crash .

Little more than a decade ago , `` Lost '' would have been riveting `` appointment television , '' but DVRs and DVD boxed sets have changed the rules of the game .

Instead of clearing calendars to watch in real time and line up for the water-cooler conversation the next morning , fans of such shows as `` Lost '' and Fox 's similarly serialized `` 24 '' might just as easily record and time-shift their viewing , avoiding office chats until they watched on their own schedules . Or , even more aggressively , they might actively avoid the broadcasts of their favorite show , just for the delayed gratification of watching the entire season later on DVD -- gobbling up episodes at their own pace , and without commercials .

Or in 1983 , when the finale of CBS ' `` M * A * S * H , '' with its end to the Korean War , drew 77 percent of all TV viewers that night , and set a viewership record of 121.6 million that still stands . And , given the fragmentation of TV audiences , most likely will never be equaled .

After all , how many more opportunities like this will viewers get ? On cable TV , perhaps many . But on broadcast TV , how many shows are left that are even worth caring about -- much less anticipating their conclusion ?

Despite all the changes in technology and viewership , `` Lost '' is a series that rewards , if not demands , watching in real time . ABC did n't even provide critics with preview copies of the final-season premiere -- and even though I 'm therefore deprived , I 'm not complaining .

This is a show I want to watch as it airs , and discuss with friends afterward . I do n't take for granted how rare that is these days -- and neither should you .
