Osh , Kyrgyzstan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Life in this embattled country 's second-largest city appeared calm Tuesday even as concerns over the plight of refugees grew .

The calm came as the Central Asian nation 's news agency AKI Press reported that the death toll had risen to 176 , a number that some observers discounted as low . A team of Red Cross doctors who visited Jalalabad 's main hospital estimated the death toll at `` several hundred . ''

The streets of the southern city of Osh appeared deserted , except for a few pedestrians and army checkpoints . Stores , warehouses and shops were burned along miles of streets , which were patrolled armed police and soldiers .

Thousands more have been denied passage into Uzbekistan because of a lack of resources . Many were standing on the Kyrgyz side of a barbed-wire fence .

Three border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were open , Uzbekistan 's Foreign Ministry said . One , at Yor Kishlok , Uzbekistan , remained closed . The closure came after throngs of people fleeing the violence overwhelmed refugee camps in Uzbekistan .

Working together , the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan have helped 16 medical facilities caring for more than 1,130 injured people in the past week , the ICRC said in a statement .

The United States is providing humanitarian assistance to the impoverished country and evaluating what further help may be needed , including military , a senior U.S. health official said in Washington .

`` Right now our focus is humanitarian but it remains to be seen exactly what , if any , security assistance Kyrgystan needs , '' said the official , who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue . The official said the United States is not considering acting alone to provide any security assistance .

U.S. officials were working with the provisional government to determine how best to distribute another $ 200,000 in medical and emergency supplies .

The clashes are part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990 , when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh .

It was not clear what sparked the violence , which came weeks after bloody protests removed Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev from office . But it was clear that Tuesday 's calm did not indicate an end to the crisis .

Mosques and hospitals in Jalalabad are receiving large numbers of burn victims and people with gunshot wounds , she said .

On Uzbekistan 's side of the border , refugees were seeking shelter in parking lots and abandoned buildings , the ICRC said . As demand for water outpaced supply , some refugees were drinking from irrigation ditches , raising concern about outbreaks of diarrhea .

Refugees were seeking help at bleak camps on the Kyrgyz border with Uzbekistan .

`` People are screaming , ` We need food ; we need food , ' to those who are passing by , '' EU Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva said .

But in the refugee camp in Yor Kishlock , there were ample supplies of food , tents , beds , sheets and blankets . The vast majority of the camp 's occupants were female . They said the males had largely stayed behind to look after their homes .

The United Nations said it was sending an emergency team to Uzbekistan to aid refugees who had crossed the border . U.N. Security Council President Claude Heller said the group condemns the `` continued acts of violence in the Kyrgyz Republic and notes the need to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance . ''

He said the council was assessing the situation in Kyrgyzstan and called for `` calm and a return to the rule of law '' in the country .

`` A pause before the unknown , and it 's not clear if dark or light is ahead , '' said relief worker Will Lynch said .
