-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North and South Korea marked the 60th anniversary of the Korean War with sober commemorations and sharp rhetoric as tensions continued to ripple between the two countries over the sinking in March of a South Korean warship .

North Korea -- which took the opportunity to blame the United States for causing nearly $ 65 trillion in `` human and material damage '' over the last six decades -- continued to ramp up its rhetoric , accusing America of `` persistently antagonizing '' the country over the sinking of the Cheonan .

The North Korean People 's Army invaded South Korea on June 25 , 1950 , in what would become known as the Korean War . The fighting ended on July 27 , 1953 , when an armistice agreement was signed . Since there has never been a peace treaty , the Korean War has technically never ended .

While there have been efforts over the years to defuse hostilities and pursue peace and stability , great anguish has emerged over the Cheonan , which South Korea says was sunk by a torpedo .

At a national ceremony on Friday commemorating the start of the war , South Korean President Lee Myung-bak urged North Korea to stop what he says are military provocations . The Yonhap News Agency quoted him as saying , `` Our ultimate goal is not a military confrontation but peaceful reunification . ''

Yonhap quoted Gen. Walter Sharp , the top U.S. commander in South Korea , as saying North Korean provocations would be deterred .

North Korea 's Korean Central News Agency , meanwhile , cited an article in the North 's ruling party newspaper , Rodong Sinmun , that said the South Korean government is trying to escalate a confrontation with North Korea .

`` They are working with bloodshot eyes to ignite a war while crying out for ` retaliation ' and ` punishment ' of someone with the ` Cheonan ' case as a momentum , '' KCNA said , citing the article .

North and South Korea presented their cases to the United Nations over the Cheonan sinking recently , with South Korea urging the Security Council to take `` timely and appropriate measures . ''

Although many of `` those brave soldiers are no longer physically with us , they remain with us in spirit , '' said Bo Hi Pak , head of the Korean War 60th Anniversary Memorial Project . The performance , which included renditions of `` America the Beautiful '' and `` God Bless America , '' was attended by former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert and South Korean Ambassador to the United States Han Duk-Soo , among others .

The causes of the Korean War stem back to the 1940s , when the 38th parallel division of Korea occurred and the two newly formed countries became ideologically opposite , with the North as communist and the South as capitalist . North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to achieve its goal of Korean unification under communist rule .
