-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Venezuelan journalist who has been held for two years without a trial reported that he has gone on a hunger strike , saying he wants the judge in his case to recuse himself .

Leocenis Garcia made the announcement June 30 on Twitter .

`` I am starting an indefinite hunger strike until the Judge Jesus Jimenez of Court 20 stops working on my case , '' Garcia said .

The journalist was arrested in May 2008 and charged with five offenses , including illegal possession of a firearm , resistance to authority and property damage .

In June , the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights sent a letter to Venezuela 's foreign minister , criticizing the government on its record of freedom of expression .

The charges were brought because of a 2009 newspaper column published in the city of Carabobo that highlighted many of the mayor 's family members who were hired as contractors by the local government .

`` The evident disproportion of the sentence handed down for the publication of a piece that was clearly in the public interest demonstrates the serious state of vulnerability in which freedom of expression in Venezuela finds itself , '' the commission said in a statement .

In February , the commission issued a 319-page report accusing Venezuela of routinely violating human rights . The report said that a lack of independence by Venezuela 's judiciary and legislature in their dealings with Chavez often leads to the abuses .

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an independent arm of the Organization of American States .

Chavez 's opponents say his government represses political opponents and the expression of free ideas by jailing critics on trumped-up charges or pulling licenses for TV and radio stations and shutting down newspapers . There are about 40 such political prisoners in Venezuelan jails , the critics say .

Most of those prisoners , Chavez critics say , are journalists and former military and police officials and others associated with a short-lived coup against Chavez in April 2002 .

`` Attacks on journalists were widespread , '' said Amnesty International 's 2009 Report on Human Rights in Venezuela . `` Human rights defenders continued to suffer harassment . Prison conditions provoked hunger strikes in facilities across the country . ''

The Chavez government has routinely denied any allegations of human rights abuses , saying that authorities arrest citizens only on suspicion of breaking the law .
