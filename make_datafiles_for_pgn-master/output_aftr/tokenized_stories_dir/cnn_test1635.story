Kamara survived one of Africa 's most brutal civil wars , nearly losing his life in his homeland .

`` Today is going to be your day , where you 're going to hang out with us on this Hope Week and we 're going to make this day about you , because you make every day about everybody else , '' said Brian Chashman , general manager of the Yankees , as Kamara was being honored .

Hanging out was an understatement , even by Yankee standards .

Kamara got the shock of life when he walked into a room at the New York Stock Exchange and was greeted by Yankee brass and players , including star lefthander C.C. Sabathia along with Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson . He toured the trading floor and was awarded an internship for next year by the stock exchange .

He did n't know it then , but his surprise itinerary would next include a chat with Mayor Michael Bloomberg , a visit to the United Nations to meet the ambassador from Sierre Leone and to stand on the rostrum of the General Assembly , plus that trip to Yankee Stadium to throw out the first pitch at the Yankee-Tigers contest Wednesday night .

When a shaky ceasefire began in Sierre Leone , Mohamed came to the U.S. a few years ago to live with an aunt and uncle in the Bronx and to pursue his hope that he could create a better life for himself and his family .

A high school mentor helped him get a job as a golf caddy , and he commutes by train for almost five hours a day to and from New Jersey for that job . Seventy percent of what he earns is sent back to his family .

'' -LRB- I -RRB- get up every day at four o'clock in the morning to go to work . It was hard for me , but you know , I was determined to do it because I have a family to take care of and that was my main focus , '' Kamara said .

Kamara recognizes the problems created by Wall Street but is not deterred ; rather , he believes he has a role to play in its recovery .

`` You know , it takes someone to fix it up , so hopefully one day I will be that person , '' Kamara said .

Derek Jeter , captain of the Yankees , who met Kamara at the U.N. , described him as `` a remarkable young man . He 's come over to this country , goes to school , works to support his family , now he 's headed off to college . We could n't be more proud of him . ''

`` We 're inspired by the younger generations , moving like this , and trying to rebrandish the country of Sierra Leone , '' said Ambassador Shekou Touray . .
