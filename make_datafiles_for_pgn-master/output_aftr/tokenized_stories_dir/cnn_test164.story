-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You 're an Olympic champion and you 've gone out at the top of your game -- so what next ?

While the cyclist -- one of the official faces of London 2012 alongside fellow golden girl Jessica Ennis -- is not exactly short of lucrative endorsement deals to tide her over in these times of economic uncertainty , she told CNN she has no idea what she is going to do next .

`` I 'm going to take some time out just to work out what , because obviously I 've spent my whole life turning left at speed . I think I need time to try lots of different things to find out what I enjoy , what I might be good at -- I do n't really know , '' said Pendleton , who won silver in her final race in a GB kit .

`` My only concern is not being able to find something that I can be equally as successful at . Obviously you ca n't win Olympic gold medals for every aspect of life , but I just want to be good at something -- I just want to be really good at something , that 's all I want . ''

Cycling has been Pendleton 's life , and her success and good looks have made her a regular in glossy men 's magazines and a big draw for advertisers , but she says she 's glad her competitive days are now behind her .

`` It was just an absolute relief ; I will never have to do that ever again . Going into the home Olympics as the Olympic champion and being named as one of the poster girls of the Games , people were much more aware of me as an athlete and my profile because I was marked as one of the potential gold medalists , '' the 31-year-old said .

`` I think if the Olympics were in any other country in the world I would have retired after Beijing . I was looking at continuing for another four years past where I 'd kind of decided I 'd perhaps had enough already .

Hoy wins fifth gold after disqualifications mar women 's team sprint

Pendleton was unable to retain her sprint title from Beijing 2008 , but bounced back from a disqualification in her opening event -- the team sprint -- to claim gold in the keirin .

Pendleton was beaten in the two-woman sprint final by Anna Meares after having her win in the first ride ruled out , as the Australian reversed their podium placings from four years ago .

Hoy becomes Britain 's greatest Olympian after taking sixth gold

Pendleton , who has also won nine world titles , hopes that British cycling can continue its recent dominance .

`` We were lucky enough to have significant funding from UK Sport and The Lottery in the beginning because we had been successful and won the occasional medal through the likes of Chris Boardman , Jason Queally , Chris Hoy , and it set the program up to develop and improve , '' she said .

`` Success brings success and I think that 's slightly coincidental almost , but then it 's created a kind of momentum that we 've just been rolling with ever since . ''

`` It 's the ones that take the hard work and the effort , tolerance , the sacrifice , and the commitment , all the tough things , they 're the ones that you really remember and that really count . ''
