A bill that would repeal the U.S. military 's `` do n't ask-don ' t tell '' policy has 149 co-sponsors in the House .

Obama has pledged to lift the ban on gays serving openly in the U.S. military .

A spokesman for Obama 's transition office would not comment for this story , but two months ago , Obama suggested he would move cautiously , telling the Philadelphia Gay News he would first get the military on board .

`` Although I have consistently said I would repeal ` do n't ask-don ' t tell , ' I believe that the way to do it is to make sure that we are working through processes , getting the Joint Chiefs of Staff clear in terms of what our priorities are going to be , '' Obama told the newspaper .

Instituted in 1993 , the policy ended the military 's practice of asking potential service members if they are gay , but requires the dismissal of openly gay service members .

A bill to replace the law with a policy that would allow gays to openly serve has 149 co-sponsors in the U.S. House , including Ellen Tauscher , D-California . Tauscher said that with a new administration , the timing is right to try to pass the bill .

Gay rights advocates say it 's important for Obama to avoid the approach used by the Clinton administration .

A Washington Post/ABC News poll this summer found 75 percent of Americans support allowing gays to serve openly , compared to only 45 percent in 1993 .

Retired Adm. Charles Larson , the former head of the Naval Academy , heads a list of more than 100 retired U.S. military leaders who have signed a statement calling for an end the policy , according to the Palm Center at the University of California-Santa Barbara . The think tank has studied issues involving gays in the military for the past decade .
