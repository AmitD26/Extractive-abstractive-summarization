New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Russian cargo pilot and his Nigerian broker were found guilty on Thursday of conspiring to traffic more than $ 100 million worth of cocaine into the United States and Europe from ports in West Africa .

Federal prosecutors say Konstantin Yaroshenko , 42 , and Chigbo Peter Umeh , 43 , were arrested in Liberia in May after trying to bribe high-level Liberian government officials -- including the son of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf -- in an effort to safeguard the route they used to bring Colombian cocaine to market .

Sirleaf 's son , the country 's national security agency director , and his deputy had been working with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency as undercover agents , unbeknownst to the two alleged traffickers , prosecutors said .

The men were convicted on conspiracy charges related to at least three large trans-Atlantic shipments of cocaine that were to transit through Liberia , according to a statement from the U.S. attorney 's office in New York .

`` This is absolutely a trend we 're seeing coming through West Africa and on to Europe , '' said Dawn Dearden , a spokeswoman for the DEA .

Umeh , who prosecutors said served as a broker between suppliers in South America and distributors in West Africa , faces a minimum of 20 years in federal prison .

The 42-year-old-cargo pilot was held in the same pre-trial detention facility in New York as suspected Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout .

The so-called ` Merchant of Death ' is now in U.S. custody awaiting trial on charges that he agreed to sell millions of dollars of weapons to the FARC .

`` We are talking about kidnapping of a Russian citizen on the territory of a third country , '' a Russian Foreign Ministry statement said in July . `` The actions of the U.S. special services at forcibly and secretly transferring of our citizen from Monrovia -LRB- Liberia -RRB- to New York can be qualified as outright lawlessness . ''

The two men are scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. federal court in New York on July 28 .
