-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An extraordinary thing is about to happen in my native state . More than three decades of communism is about to fall -- not through revolution or bloodshed but by the sheer power of the ballot box .

But if election results to be announced Friday are as predicted , one of the world 's little-known bastions of communism will be no more .

Exit polls this week confirmed what political analysts have been predicting for months . The Left Front , firmly entrenched in West Bengal since 1977 , will go down in defeat to the populist Trinamool Congress .

People have descended on the state capital , Kolkata , this week to watch the retreat of the red tide , to document for themselves a pivotal moment of Bengali history .

Led by the former Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee , Trinamool won support as the champion of the poor and through its alliance with the Congress Party that rules India .

`` The Congress governments in the past were all urban oriented and connected with the landed gentry , '' said Shibashis Chatterjee , a professor of international relations at Kolkata 's Jadavpur University . `` The idea was to economically enfranchise the rural poor who had been long neglected in the past . ''

But after three decades , many questioned the relevancy of their ideas in a modern , fast-growing India .

Critics accused West Bengal 's Marxist leaders of corruption , cronyism and failing to deliver what they promised to the people .

How much real change comes to the Indian state remains to be seen but one thing is for sure . Culturally , the end to a government dominated by the Communist Party of India -LRB- Marxist -RRB- is sure to be huge .

We drove down Karl Marx road and past Vladimir Lenin 's statue . Fidel Castro was a hero . And in a snub to Americans , the street where the U.S. consulate stands was renamed Ho Chi Minh Street after the North Vietnamese leader .

We grew up with the power of labor unions and government employees who called bandhs , or strikes , that were frequent enough to paralyze the city , sometimes for days .

The juxtaposition of communist ideology and India 's thriving democracy was difficult to reconcile at times .

`` This is a real anachronism that the world has moved on but this peculiar form of communism still persists in a corner of India , '' said Ganguly , who holds a chair of Indian cultures and civilizations at Indiana University .

Perhaps even more so because it took hold in a corner of India that was known historically for its intellect , talent , skills . Bengal was the home for the Indian intelligentsia , the birthplace of Indian independence .

Young people , including many of my relatives and friends , have fled in droves to seek jobs elsewhere in India .

As long as there are millions of poor in India 's still burgeoning population , Chatterjee said , there will be room for the ideas of Karl Marx .
