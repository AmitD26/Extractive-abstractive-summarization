Second-ranked Djokovic ended the Spaniard 's two-year unbeaten run on clay in the Madrid final , but it remains to be seen whether he has enough energy in reserve to repeat that on Sunday .

Djokovic had to dig deep as Murray showed tremendous resolve after capitulating in the first set -- a showing that raised the prospect of a repeat of his Australian Open final defeat against the same player in January .

But the fourth seed -- who turns 24 on Sunday -- battled back to level , inflicting Djokovic 's first dropped set of the tournament , and then fought back again after going down 3-1 in the decider .

Murray , seeking to become the first British player to reach a top-level clay final since 1982 , broke Djokovic 's serve twice in a row -- the second time to love - as he went 4-3 ahead .

Both players then dropped serve again -- Murray after a morale-sapping double fault -- but then held to take the match to a tie-break .

He then roared with relief at an appreciative crowd as he showed just how much the victory meant to him ahead of his own 24th birthday on May 22 .

Nadal beat Djokovic in the 2009 Rome final , and has won the event for five of the past six years .

`` I am playing better every day and a little bit higher , so I think that in general I am happy for everything , '' Nadal , who was hampered by illness earlier this week , told the ATP Tour website .

`` I 'm in another final , six in a row , and it is unbelievable . I had a tough week , so I am very happy for everything . ''
