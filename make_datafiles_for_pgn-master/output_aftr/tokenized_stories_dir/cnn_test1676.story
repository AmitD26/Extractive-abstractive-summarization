Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed new national guidelines on Wednesday for mercury and air toxics released from power plants .

The move came in response to a court-ordered deadline and would require many power plants to install pollution control technologies .

The D.C. Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to make the rules final by November . Companies have three years to comply , but some could get a one-year extension if the technology can not be installed in time .

The announcement was hailed by the American Lung Association and several groups of doctors who spoke at the press event .

A group of second-graders from Amidon-Bowen Elementary School in Washington , D.C. , joined EPA Administration Lisa Jackson as she signed the new guidelines .

Dr. Marian Burton , the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics , told the students , `` I think you already know this rule is for you and for all the children in the America who will follow you .

`` Dirty air makes people sick . That 's the long and short of it , '' Burton continued . `` If you think it 's expensive to put a scrubber on a smokestack you should see how much it costs to treat a preventable birth defect . ''

Jackson emphasized these new measures would come at a financial cost for utility companies but said it would level the playing field for utility companies once they are all operating from the same clean air standard . Consumers will see a bump in their bills while utility companies put the new technology in place , she said .
