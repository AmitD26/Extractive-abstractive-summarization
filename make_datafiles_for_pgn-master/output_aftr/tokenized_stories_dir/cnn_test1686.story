When family members inquired why soldiers were returning early , they were told by a military official : `` Basically , what 's happened ... is that the United States and Iraq have not come to an agreement , '' according to a CNN reporter who attended the meeting .

Additionally , the brigade official told families : `` We were over there for a couple of missions . Those missions are finished . ''

U.S. officials in Washington on Saturday declined to comment on reports that troops were being withdrawn ahead of schedule or because of a breakdown in negotiations , except to say the United States is committed to withdrawing all troops by the December 31 deadline .

`` At the same time we 're building a comprehensive partnership with Iraq under the Strategic Framework Agreement including a robust security relationship , and discussions with the Iraqis about the nature of that relationship are ongoing , '' said Tommy Vietor of the National Security Council .

Pentagon spokesman George Little also dismissed reports of a breakdown in talks with Iraqis , saying `` Suggestions that a final decision has been reached about our training relationship with the Iraqi government are wrong . Those discussions are ongoing . ''

Officials at Fort Bliss said the brigade 's return is in line with the U.S. planned departure .

`` In the process , we are bringing troops back home to meet the December 31st agreed-upon deadline , '' said Lt. Col. Dennis Swanson , a public affairs officer for the First Armored Division .

`` We should n't see American soldiers in Iraqi courts on trumped-up charges , '' he said .

His comments echo recent statements by Panetta and U.S. Army Chief of Staff Raymond Odierno .

U.S. officials have been pressuring Iraq 's leadership for months for an answer to whether it would request a troop extension , with former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen saying over the summer that the U.S. needed a a decision by August .

The negotiations have been strained following WikiLeaks ' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged Iraqi civilians , including children , were killed in a 2006 raid by American troops rather than in an airstrike as initially reported by the U.S. military .

The Pentagon dismissed the cable from U.N. investigator Philip Alston to U.S. officials , saying it had investigated the claims and found there was no merit .

Shortly after the WikiLeaks cable gained attention in news reports in September by McClatchy Newspapers , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered an investigation into the deaths outside of Tikrit .

Odierno said last month that there would be risks in leaving a large force of U.S. troops in Iraq , noting such a force could provoke new claims of U.S. occupation and distract from efforts to develop the Iraqi military 's abilities . He would not comment directly on reports that the White House administration had decided to leave between 3,000 and 5,000 troops , should they be requested by Iraq .

Odierno , who served as the top U.S. commander in Iraq , said that training of Iraqi security forces was not complete .

`` We need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while , '' he said last month in a question-and-answer session with journalists at the Pentagon .

CNN 's Dan Lothian and Adam Levine contributed to this report .
