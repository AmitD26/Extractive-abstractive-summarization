Basnet 's group also provides a day care program for young children who live in prison .

Basnet says : `` I hope that ECDC is soon able to expand its services so that it is able to accommodate more children who are still living behind prison walls . ... We are working to rescue them and give them a better life . ''

Wanda Butts

Most of the children in the program are minorities like Butts , who lost her 16-year-old son because he did n't know how to swim . Statistics show that minority children in the United States are more likely to drown than white children .

Butts says : `` Our objective is to change the drowning statistics . Drowning is preventable if you know the rules . Awareness , education and knowledge are key . That was something I did not have . ''
