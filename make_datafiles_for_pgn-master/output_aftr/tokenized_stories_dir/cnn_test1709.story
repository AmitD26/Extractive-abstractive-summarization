`` We are in a critical situation . This is the most austere budget in our democracy , and with tax measures to bring in new income to guarantee public services , '' Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro said after the weekly Cabinet meeting .

The much-anticipated announcement came a day after a general strike called to protest labor market reform laws , which the government has approved , that unions say make it cheaper and easier to fire workers .

The strike slowed industry and transport but had less impact on commerce . Hundreds of thousands of union supporters demonstrated late Thursday in Madrid and across Spain . There were scattered incidents of violence , including in Barcelona .

Spain 's unemployment rate is 23 % , and twice that for young people . A total of 5.3 million Spaniards are out of work . The government predicts that the economy will contract this year by 1.7 % .

Spain has come under increased scrutiny from the European Union after Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that Spain 's deficit , as a percentage of gross domestic product , would not be 4.4 % this year , as previously targeted , but 5.8 % . Brussels responded by demanding that it be 5.3 % .

Economy Minister Luis de Guindos , attending a European Union ministers meeting in Copenhagen that was closely monitoring Spain 's budget announcement , said , `` We are convinced that Spain will stop being a problem for the Union . ''

Montoro said he would take the budget to parliament on Tuesday . The government has a commanding majority in parliament and does not need the support of any other party to approve its budget .

Pensions will not be affected .
