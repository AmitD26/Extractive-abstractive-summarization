Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Questions swirled Sunday about what caused iconic singer Whitney Houston 's sudden death , with authorities offering little information at a time when many were still struggling to come to grips with the news .

Winter , from the coroner 's office , said Houston was removed from the tub before paramedics performed CPR . She was pronounced dead at 3:55 p.m.

Pill bottles were found at the scene , entertainment news website TMZ reported , citing `` informed sources . '' CNN could not immediately confirm the TMZ report and Winter declined to comment .

Whatever the exact cause , the grief about the death of Houston -- whose soaring voice and enormous talent were clouded in recent years by her battles with drug addiction -- was evident Sunday at the 54th annual Grammy awards show , which is typically the biggest night on the music industry 's calendar .

Earlier , on the red carpet , Kim Burrell told CNN she 'd exchanged voicemails with her good friend Houston shortly before her death , describing her as being `` in great spirits , as always . '' She always thought of Houston as a `` fighter '' and a `` survivor , '' which made the idea of her passing all the more difficult to comprehend .

Burrell said she 'd flown to California to join Houston in attending a pre-Grammy party Saturday night hosted by the songstress ' longtime mentor , Clive Davis .

Houston never made it , dying at the age of 48 .

Amid the outpouring of grief , Beverly Hills police said Houston 's 18-year-old daughter , Bobbi Kristina , was taken to Los Angeles ' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , at about 11:15 a.m. Sunday . Details of her condition were not disclosed .

The previous night , he was openly emotional during a concert in Southaven , Mississippi , said attendee and CNN iReporter Moshiu Knox , at one point asking people to say a prayer for his daughter , for his mother and `` for me , because I 'm going to need it . ''

Houston 's battles with drugs had long made headlines , but she was in the midst of a comeback , with a few shows scheduled and a movie in the works .

`` I did really get the sense that she was really trying to make a comeback , '' megachurch pastor T.D. Jakes , executive producer of Houston 's upcoming movie `` Sparkle , '' said Sunday .

`` I think the believability of her human struggle made her song and her acting that much more powerful because we recognize that often it is the caged bird that sings , '' Jakes said .

Fans : Houston 's music spanned an era

The two looked happy , she recalled , and Houston seemed healthy and beautiful . However , it remained unknown whether the singer had won her battle with substance abuse for good .

Houston had performed as late as Thursday night at a pre-Grammy event in the area , singing a raspy rendition of `` Jesus Loves Me '' with singer Kelly Price .

Grief flows at hotel where Houston died

`` Perhaps now Whitney can rest in everlasting life without the harsh judgment that she felt in this world , '' said CNN iReporters Kimberly and Betty Kiel from Pearland , Texas .

And in the church where Houston grew up , the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark , New Jersey , members gathered to honor her .

As a young girl , Houston grew sang solos in the choir at the church . Her mother served as director of sacred music at the church for 54 years and is still a member there .

Whitney Houston was born in Newark in 1963 and was soloing in the junior choir by age 11 , according to the All Music Guide . `` Whitney 's mother and cousins nurtured her passion for gospel music since birth , '' according to Houston 's official website .

Jackson said he spoke to Cissy Houston on Saturday night and Sunday morning and headed to her home after the service .

`` They 're having to process this , '' he said of Houston 's family . `` This was not some long , debilitating sickness . This was sudden . And so when this happens , there 's no rational explanation , just you have to cling to your faith and hold on until the morning comes . ''
