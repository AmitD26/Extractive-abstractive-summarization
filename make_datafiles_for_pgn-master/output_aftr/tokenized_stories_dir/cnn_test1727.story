-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wild Oats XI crossed the line first in the 66th Rolex Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Tuesday , but the Australian super maxi 's fifth victory in the annual event is in doubt due to an official protest .

Wild Oats and British entry Ran were both reported by the race committee a few hours earlier after breaking safety rules by failing to make radio contact , and a hearing will be held on Wednesday .

The rules are in place after six people died when severe weather conditions hit the 1998 race , sinking five yachts and forcing a record 66 to retire .

`` A few people got their facts mixed up , '' Richards said . `` We 've got some of the most accredited yachtsmen and women on this boat . We 've won numerous world championships . We 've dealt with juries all our lives and we 're very confident we did everything by the book .

`` It is disappointing . There is no way that as skipper I would have left Green Cape -LSB- on the south coast of New South Wales -RSB- without knowing we were 100 % compliant with the rules . ''

But this time Richards and crew safely negotiated gale-force conditions which led to 16 boats retiring to finish well ahead of their rivals , completing their journey up the Derwent River at 8:37 p.m. local time -LRB- 0937 GMT . -RRB-

Second-placed Investec Royal finished almost four hours later , having been becalmed in sight of the docks .

`` The damage we sustained was to the reef lines earlier and some tack lines on the headsail which , running without a headsail , put us an hour back . Also , a fuel tank broke lose . These tanks carry so much fuel that you 've got a quarter of a ton to manhandle , which is difficult , '' he said on Tuesday .

Ran , skippered by Niklas Zennstrom and one of the pre-race favorites for line honors , had yet to finish .
