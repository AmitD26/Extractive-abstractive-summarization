But , the commanders say , they could do a better job if they were able to obtain modern equipment denied to them because of sanctions and if they received cooperation from the U.S. military .

`` We work within our abilities , '' said Gen. Khaklil Al-Khaled , a provincial military commander in northeastern Syria . `` The border constitutes a daily obsession to us , to prevent infiltration and confront the contraband groups and jihadist groups that infiltrate the border . '' Watch what life is like on the Syrian border ''

Syrian commanders were interviewed by CNN along the border , where Syria and the United States have a complicated relationship .

The Syrian government `` began limited cooperation with the United States in the global war against terrorism '' after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , the U.S. State Department has said .

The United States has long criticized Syria for being a staging ground for insurgents who infiltrate Iraq in the Euphrates River valley of Anbar province and conduct attacks in the towns along that waterway and in Baghdad .

It has also criticized Syria for its ties to Iran , the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , and the Palestinian movement Hamas .

Syria says it is doing what it can to thwart insurgent activity and the United States in turn has softened its negative rhetoric toward President Bashar Al-Assad 's regime . They say they 've arrested many foreign fighters and have confiscated many weapons .

`` There have been many arrests of jihadi groups that infiltrate the Iraqi side , and they have been turned to the authorities . These jihadi groups belong to different nationalities , such as Egyptians , Saudis , Moroccans , Tunisians , and Libyans that fight in Iraq , '' Al-Khaled said .

Al-Khaled said Syria does n't like the U.S. administration casting blame on Syria for lax border security when `` America itself can not control its border with Mexico . ''

`` Every now and then there are airspace violations -- sometimes not less than five to six times per month with their military jets and helicopters , '' Al-Khaled said .

He said Syria lodges its complaints with an Iraqi liaison officer . Americans say the errors are tactical or human , he said , but he doubts those assertions because of the U.S. military 's acumen and resources .

Mohammed Askari , spokesman for Iraq 's Defense Ministry , declined to comment , saying these are Multi-National Forces issues . The U.S. military has not responded to a request for comment .
