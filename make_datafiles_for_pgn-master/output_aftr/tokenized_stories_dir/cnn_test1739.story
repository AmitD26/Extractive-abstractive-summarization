Meeting part of the target of one of the U.N. 's Millennium Development Goals -LRB- MDGs -RRB- ahead of the 2015 deadline was `` a testament to all those who see -LRB- them -RRB- not as a dream , but as a vital tool , '' he added .

But the goal of universal access to clean water is far from complete says Stef Smits , program officer for IRC International Water and Sanitation Center .

Furthermore , he says , the MDGs on basic sanitation are unlikely to be met before 2025 .

It 's an area which the U.N. concedes is `` lagging far behind '' the millennium commitments , with 2.5 billion people -LRB- including one billion children -RRB- still exposed to poor sanitation and one child dying every 20 seconds as a consequence , the U.N. estimates .

The mobile technology android-based system uses camera and GPS to collect information on wells and pumps .

These then link to a web-based dashboard where survey data can be tracked on Google Maps and Google Earth , according to Water for People .

The Liberian government , in partnership with the World Bank 's Water and Sanitation program , has already put it to good use Kugler says , mapping 10,000 water points during 2011 .

The secret life of drinking water

Water for People recently teamed up with Akvo , a Dutch open source software company , to help develop the FLOW 's -LRB- now officially called Akvo FLOW -RRB- features and international reach .

Today , little appears to have changed .

`` Water sanitation is a harder goal to get to . There just are n't enough NGOs out there to put a latrine in every household , '' Kugler said .

But efforts to shift the emphasis away from traditional methods of improving sanitation to simple technology-based ones might pay dividends .

`` The aim of FLOW is to remove some of those barriers and create something that is easy to use . ''
