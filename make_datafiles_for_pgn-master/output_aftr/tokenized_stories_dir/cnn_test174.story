Shrien Dewani 's appeal was dismissed by Judge Howard Riddle , paving the way for extradition , said an official at Westminster Magistrates ' Court .

Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife , Anni Dewani , 28 , during a taxi ride in Cape Town in 2010 .

Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of Anni Dewani 's death that he had hired two men to kill her .

Speaking outside the court Wednesday , Anni Dewani 's sister , who did not give her name , said the family was satisfied by the ruling , but it was just one step in the battle to find answers .

The ongoing case has been hard on her family , she said . `` Look at my mum , look at my dad -- they are struggling every day with this . They have lost a daughter . ''

`` We want to know what happened . Our view on this is quite simple . There were five people in the car , four men , one lady . She was murdered , '' he said .

Dewani 's legal team may still seek to appeal Wednesday 's ruling .

His extradition was halted last year on mental health grounds .

Psychiatric experts told a UK court last year that Dewani was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he 'd tried to take his life .

` Fair trial '

South African Justice Minister Jeff Radebe welcomed Wednesday 's extradition ruling , saying it reaffirms the view that South Africa 's legal system is fair and upholds the rule of law .

But he said the ruling would not mean that Dewani would immediately be returned to South Africa , since he has further legal avenues to explore . If successful , they could lead to a further appeal in the UK courts .

Dewani 's attorneys argued last year at the High Court in London that extradition to South Africa would breach his human rights under European law .

Their appeal cited concerns over the effect of extradition on his mental illness , the provision of facilities for its treatment and the risk of attack and sexual violence from other inmates .
