It is not just the kit athletes will wear on the track or in the pool which will make a splash , it is also the official uniforms which will be worn for Friday 's opening ceremony .

It is not surprising given the convergence between sport and fashion .

The German company has a long-standing relationship with Stella McCartney , the daughter of music legend and former Beatle Paul McCartney , and she has designed the uniforms for the host Team GB squad .

`` Being a designer , a fashion designer this is not the type of opportunity that normally comes your way and I feel really very lucky and privileged . It 's been a really exciting challenge . ''

`` It also involves looking at the best athletes in the world and how to do them proud and to help enhance and support their performance . ''

While making sure the kit is fit for purpose , McCartney was also keen for each kit to safeguard the masculinity and femininity of competitors .

`` Every athlete I talked to have said they perform better when they feel confident about how they look , so I really tried to do that , '' said McCartney .

`` Also , how everything will come across visually on television , when billions of people are watching it , to try and make it different . There are a million things to think of , working with a lot of guidelines . ''

McCartney 's efforts have received the backing of one of Team GB 's leading lights , the nation 's first Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins -- sort of .

Wiggins , who will make his London 2012 bow in the cycling road race on Saturday , said on Twitter : `` Just arrived at the Olympics , got all me kit , still think Stella was a bit Lucy in the Sky when she knocked this one up , '' a reference to one of McCartney 's Dad 's classic records .

`` In a good way , certainly gon na -LRB- sic -RRB- stand out , '' added Wiggins in a subsequent tweet .

The confidence gained from looking slick is something Willie Walters , fashion course director at London 's Central Saint Martins college of art and design , believes could give athletes the edge when it comes to winning medals .

`` It is important that leading athletes are given the confidence of looking their best at such an important occasion when all the world is observing them , '' said Walters .

`` This should be provided by the best designers available . A versatile designer can turn their talents to a range of aesthetics within the parameters of sporting attire . ''

Walters also detailed the possible benefits for designers able to attach their name to a successful Olympic squad , both in terms of reputation and financially .

`` The coverage of the Olympics brings the attention of a much wider audience to these designers work .
