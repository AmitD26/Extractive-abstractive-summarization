-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rafael Nadal remains on course for a record seventh French Open title after he dismissed the challenge of fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro to notch up his 50th Roland Garros victory .

The world No. 2 triumphed 7-6 6-2 6-3 over the 12th seed as he goes in search of the 11th grand slam title in his illustrious career .

Standing between Nadal and a seventh Paris final is another Spaniard , David Ferrer , after the No. 6 seed beat Britain 's Andy Murray 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-2 .

Murray , who said he was satisfied with his performance in the tournament despite going out to a player seeded two places below him , said Nadal is the favorite to win .

He told reporters : `` I think the four best clay court players in the world are left in and whoever plays best will win . Probably have to favor Rafa slightly , but everyone is playing very , very well . ''

Ferrer 's victory ensured he made the final four of the French Open for the first time in his career , a surprise statistic for someone who is renowned as a clay court specialist .

He said his four-set win over Murray was grueling , but good preparation for his showdown with Nadal , who he labeled the best player on clay ever .

`` It will be a tough match against Rafa , he 's the best in history on this surface , but I hope to have a good match . ''

Murray 's disappointment was evident on court , as he made 59 unforced errors during the match and seemed to be troubled by a series of injuries .

Thursday sees the first semifinal , between world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 16-time grand slam champion Roger Federer , take place .
