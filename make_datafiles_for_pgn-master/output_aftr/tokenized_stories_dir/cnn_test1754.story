Her schedule made it impossible for her to watch a live broadcast of the speech by her husband , Bill Clinton , at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte , North Carolina , on Wednesday night .

As she toured a coffee cooperative in Dili , a project manager showing her around remarked that Clinton 's husband had `` a big job today . ''

She will have to watch her husband 's speech on playback later , an aide traveling with her said .

Clinton is visiting a nation still working to find its feet . East Timor celebrated its 10th birthday as an independent nation in May , but it still suffers bouts of political violence and faces stiff economic challenges to alleviate high poverty rates .

China talks tough in Japan island dispute

After meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Wednesday , Clinton repeated the U.S. position on the territorial disputes between China and other countries in the South China Sea , urging those involved to `` begin to engage in a diplomatic process toward the shared goal of a code of conduct . ''

Tensions over territorial disputes have spiked this year between China and a string of countries around its coastline -- from Vietnam in the south to Japan in the northeast -- and the United States has been drawn into the fray .

But Beijing , which prefers to tackle the disputes bilaterally , has reacted angrily to Washington 's involvement in the matter , accusing the U.S. State Department of `` unfounded accusations '' and showing a `` total disregard of facts . ''

At the joint news conference with Clinton on Wednesday , Yang took a more diplomatic tack , saying that `` freedom of navigation and safety in the South China Sea is assured . ''

The uninhabited islands are known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu , and are privately owned by a Japanese family .

`` I want to emphasize again that any unilateral actions taken by the Japanese regarding the Diaoyu Islands are illegal and invalid , '' he said .

`` We are closely monitoring the developments and will take necessary measures to defend our territorial sovereignty , '' Hong added .

Furious anti-Japan protests erupted across China last month when a Japanese group sailed to one of the disputed islets and symbolically waved Japanese flags .

China does n't seem eager for the United States to get involved in the quarrel .

The Global Times , a Chinese newspaper affiliated with the ruling Communist Party , said in an editorial published Tuesday that Clinton 's diplomacy in the region `` has fomented frictions between China and some surrounding countries . ''

It called on her to `` reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the Sino-U.S. relationship . ''

CNN 's Jethro Mullen in Hong Kong ; and Jaime FlorCruz and Chi-Chi Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report .
