For Camelot stands on the brink of that rarest of achievements , the English `` Triple Crown '' of thoroughbred racing .

Royal regulations for Ascot 's fashionistas

Only 15 horses have ever done the treble in the century and a half in which the 2,000 Guineas , Epsom Derby and St. Ledger Stakes have been run .

Three of those , wartime winners Pommern , Gay Crusader and Gainsborough will forever have an asterisk next to their names as racing was considered too disrupted in that period for their achievements to stand , making the `` official '' figure as low as 12 .

The last Triple Crown winner was the great Nijinsky , way back in 1970 -LRB- although the brilliant filly Oh So Sharp did win the `` Fillies ' Triple Crown '' -- the 1,000 Guineas , the Epsom Oaks and the St. Ledger -- in 1985 -RRB- .

Few horses these days even attempt the full set . Since Nijinsky -LRB- who , incidentally , also won the Irish Derby en route to his treble -RRB- , only two other horses have won both the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby , and both of those -- Nashwan -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and Sea The Stars -LRB- 2009 -RRB- -- opted for a tilt at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe instead of the St. Ledger .

For many years it was considered so unlikely that a horse would ever win the Triple Crown again that the soubriquet itself fell into disuse .

First , of course , Camelot must get through the Irish Derby unscathed . He spearheads a three-strong O'Brien challenge that also includes Astrology and Imperial Monarch .

He rode his first winner for his father at 16 and bagged his first Classic a year later on Roderic O'Connor in the Irish 2,000 Guineas . Last year he became the youngest jockey to ride a winner in the Breeders ' Cup on St. Nicholas Abbey .

Camelot 's impressive performances in the 2,000 Guineas and Epsom Derby this season have raised hopes that the son of Montjeu will have sufficient staying power to land the St. Ledger Stakes , run over the longer distance of one mile and six furlongs .

If successful , there will be more than a hint of a sense of destiny being fulfilled : the last horse to win the Triple Crown , the legendary Nijinsky , was trained by the great Vincent O'Brien .

The stage seems to be set for a fairytale ending . In Camelot , English racing may have found its own Arthurian legend .
