Re : Project November

From : The Buyout Nation Team

First , if we 're successful in the upcoming auction -LRB- they call it an election -RRB- , we will have bought in cheap and should make a killing since the economy is improving and is likely to do so for the next four years even if we do n't do much after the takeover .

Second , it looks like we have a lot , and I mean a lot , of room to increase sales . I 've never seen a business with so much ability to raise prices .

A lot of the premium customers , the ones who 've done really well for the last decade or two , actually pay the lowest rates ! So raising prices on these guys should be a cinch . And we can also get some early revenue from one-time gimmicks like drilling a million gas wells , selling non-core assets -LRB- Guam ? -RRB- , sale-and-lease-backs on real estate -LRB- the Capitol ? -RRB- and more aggressive corporate partnerships -LRB- Exxon-Yellowstone National Park ? -RRB-

Third , on the expense side things look equally promising . As Larry Summers first discovered , a lot of the value created in takeovers can come from promise breaking and we 've got great opportunities to do that with Medicare and Social Security .

Second , we 're unlikely to make money by restructuring or refinancing the debt . It 's already dirt-cheap -LRB- we could borrow for 30 years at 3 % -RRB- and the experts I 've spoken with are convinced that the nation really is too big to fail . I know you 've been through a lot of tough restructurings , think the market should be allowed to work things out , and were willing to let the auto industry go to the wall . But I 've pushed these guys hard and they remain adamant that if we get too close to that fiscal cliff , really bad stuff will start to happen : markets gyrating , interest rates rising , the dollar plunging , rating downgrades , you name it .

While this type of chaos might actually be a boon to some of our hedge fund supporters , I really think we should try to avoid it . -LRB- And there 's no guarantee that the guys running your blind trust will have had time to bet against America before things start to unravel . -RRB-

Finally , I reviewed the nation 's shareholders agreement and bylaws -LRB- they call it the Constitution -RRB- and it 's a catastrophe .

In fact , the bottom line is that even after we take control , there will be real limits on what we can do without the support of some really crazy people . People who do n't appear to believe in arithmetic or science , let alone rationality and analysis . These guys are definitely not the McKinsey and Goldman types we 're used to dealing with so it 's going to be a total nightmare .

It makes me wonder whether this whole thing is really worth the hassle . Where 's the upside ? Do we really have a special insight that makes us the natural owner or are we just willing to spend more than the competition to win ? I 'm a little bit worried that we may have a touch of deal fever for another trophy on the wall .

Anyway , the model is ready so just send me your plan so I can finalize the assumptions about price hikes , expense reductions , investments and the like . I could n't find a copy on the server and everything in the public domain is vague and contradictory . My daughter 's got soccer tonight so I hope to leave the office by 7 but call my cell if you need anything else .
