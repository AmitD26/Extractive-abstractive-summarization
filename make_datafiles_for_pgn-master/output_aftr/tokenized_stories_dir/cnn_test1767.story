`` We had choir practice Wednesday night , and then Thursday morning , it 's gone , '' she said . `` Not even 12 hours later . ''

There is no clear theme linking the fires , which have struck various church denominations -- Methodist , Baptist , Church of Christ Scientist -- on different days of the week and at different times of the day , he said . And while the churches are in small towns -- such as Wills Point , which has a population of about 3,800 people -- not all the fires were in remote locations , Crowley said .

Authorities believe one person , or perhaps a group of people , are responsible . Investigators have `` people we 're looking at '' from tips called in , but `` nothing specific yet , '' he said .

`` I think maybe I would characterize the mood of our people as perplexed , '' said Randy Daniels , mayor of Athens , Texas , a town of about 12,000 that has seen three of the church fires . '' ... I think most people would just wonder who could be doing this or even why . Most people consider it just incomprehensible and unconscionable that somebody could and would be doing this . ''

The fires have been a blow , he said , especially in east Texas , which has `` a faithful , church-going people . ''

In Tyler , Texas , Tyland Baptist Church is `` displaced , but very much alive , '' the Rev. David Mahfood wrote on the church Web site .

`` We grieve the loss of -LSB- our -RSB- church home , the place that we loved and shared so many memories with our church family , '' he wrote . `` It was a very special place to all of us , and our emotions at this time are varied and many . ''

Tyland burned on January 16 , Mahfood told CNN Wednesday , so members have had some time to process the event . Still , he said , there is a `` real feeling of violation , a real feeling of ` I never thought this would happen to me . ' ''

Like Russell Memorial , the 120-member church was destroyed . `` Not a Bible , not a hymnal '' was left , Mahfood said . `` We 've got some bricks . That 's it . '' Tyland Baptist is currently holding services in another church 's sanctuary , he said .

`` We had a big , beautiful sanctuary , '' she said . `` It 's a million-dollar loss . '' Members are sorrowful , she said , because the church was built by donations -- one person donated the pews , another the cushions , and members donated hymnals , including some in memory of loved ones .

`` If we still had that funding , then some of the people who were victimized in 1996 might not be victimized again in 2010 . ''

The NCBC tallied nearly 500 suspicious church fires from 2005 to 2008 , the last year they had complete data , including nearly 200 in 2006 .

`` We 're a rural area , '' he said . `` We do n't have the cameras and surveillance devices that people have . ''

`` We 're certainly concerned , '' said Tyler Mayor Barbara Bass . In addition , she pointed out , with the current economic downturn , the burned churches will have to rebuild by using resources that could have been used to help assist others in the community .

However , `` it 's brought the community together in a lot of ways , '' she said . Churches in Tyler held a prayer rally on January 24 to show support for the churches struck by arson . Members are watching out for other churches as well as their own , she said .

The ATF is offering a $ 25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible , Crowley said .

At Russell Memorial , meanwhile , church members are counting their blessings in the face of tragedy .

Members are grateful the church 's offices and records remained intact , she said , as well as the church 's set of English handbells .

`` We 're saddened , '' she said . `` But you know what , that building was not our church . ... We 're OK , because we 're strong people , and we know that God 's hand is on us and he will take care of us . ''
