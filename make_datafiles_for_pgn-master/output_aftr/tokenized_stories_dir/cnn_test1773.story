Detectives recovered the duffel bag from the house of Perrone 's girlfriend on Wednesday morning and found the carbine with a sawed-off stock and a combination laser/flashlight attached to its barrel with duct tape and two thick , pink rubber bands .

Police said the .22-caliber rifle was used to kill Vahidipour Rahmatollah , 78 , at his She-She boutique on November 16 ; Isaac Kadare , 59 , at Amazing 99-Cent Deals on August 2 ; and Mohamed Gebeli , 65 , on July 6 at Valentino Fashion in Brooklyn .

Kelly did n't provide a motive for the murders .

Perrone was an independent seller of men 's and women 's clothing to boutiques in Brooklyn , said Kelly .

`` After his photograph was circulated , we received several calls from proprietors of similar stores to inform us that they recognized Perrone as a salesman who would periodically visit their stores , '' he said .

He was spotted at a pharmacy in Brooklyn on Tuesday evening and voluntarily agreed to come to the precinct .

In 2001 , Perrone was also arrested in Franconia Township , Pennsylvania , on a forcible entry charge .

It was not immediately clear whether Perrone had any legal representation .
