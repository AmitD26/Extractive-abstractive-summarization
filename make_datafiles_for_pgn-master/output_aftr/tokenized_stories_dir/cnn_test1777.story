-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They 're calling it the `` Crews missile . ''

Fired from the keyboard of 67-year-old Nick Crews , the missive blew the lid off his dysfunctional family .

In an e-mail titled `` Dear All Three , '' published in U.K. newspaper The Telegraph , Crews excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the `` bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out '' to him and his wife .

`` I for one , and I sense Mum feels the same , have had enough of being forced to live through the never-ending bad dream of our children 's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes . ''

5 ways to raise a grateful child

In the e-mail , made public with his permission by his daughter Emily , Crews describes his concern for his grandchildren .

`` It makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you , their parents . ''

Whoa . This is beyond disappointment . This sounds just plain mean .

I asked Dr. Gail Saltz , associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine , whether the former submarine captain took the right tack .

For a parent fed up with his child 's behavior , `` It can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart , '' said Saltz . But , she added , one must pave the way long before the children became adults , with a warm , communicative relationship .

The secret life of my sixth grader

The Crews story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents .

`` Not everything is parenting and not everything is biology , '' said Saltz . `` There 's a combination here . '' And sometimes , she added , families just have bad luck .

Still , the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing , Saltz said , especially in a world full of `` overly indulgent parents , '' who are n't teaching children life skills .

`` If you do n't teach your kids any resilience , you fail them out of everything , '' Saltz said . `` They need to fall down , say I fell down before but got back up , and I know I can do that . ''

I 'm guilty of this sort of thing . Growing up , I never once called my mother at work . Yet I allowed my own kids to call me all the time . It just took that much longer to wean them off the `` workday quickie advice call . '' Perhaps I should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own .

Many parents have blinders on . If you do n't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude , why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades , which they likely deserve , or for failing them for cheating ?

When heroes disappoint our kids

`` It 's at its worst when the parent is living through their child , '' he said . `` The parents ' successes , even life accomplishments , are identified entirely with those of their child . ''

Case in point : when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well , or poorly , they 've played .

Such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood , and that 's not a good thing . Nor is having too many choices too soon .

Take the beauty salon . How young is too young for a manicure ? In my salon , there 's a 4-year-old girl who 's been getting `` mani-peds '' for two years . She loves the pedicure bath , '' the manicurist told me . What happens to that little girl when she grows up and ca n't afford manicures ?

And think , does your 6-year-old really need a cellphone ?

`` Someday they 'll have to frustrate their child , disappoint their child , point out their child 's mistakes . By doing those things earlier rather than later , they 'll help their children to be better people . ''
