-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Geneticists have begun studying the DNA of Connecticut gunman Adam Lanza , a spokeswoman for the University of Connecticut Health Center said Thursday .

The geneticists were asked to join the investigation by the state medical examiner 's office , spokeswoman Carolyn Pennington told CNN . She said there is no specific genetic marker the team is looking for , and that lab results and a complete analysis of the DNA `` are not expected for several weeks ... probably the end of January . ''

CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said it is unlikely investigators will be able to find a genetic clue for what motivated Lanza , who fatally shot 26 people , including 20 children , in the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut on December 14 . Lanza , who had also killed his mother before the school massacre , took his own life with a gunshot to the head .

Newtown : No more gifts , please

`` There 's no clear-cut sort of ... genes identified with the types of illnesses , mental illnesses , that may cause this sort of behavior , '' says Gupta .
