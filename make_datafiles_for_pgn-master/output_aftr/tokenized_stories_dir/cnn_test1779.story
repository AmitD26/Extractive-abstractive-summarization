Mahmoud Jibril also called for a thaw of Libyan financial assets , frozen during the ongoing conflict between pro and anti-Gadhafi forces .

Col. Moammar Gadhafi -- who ruled Libya with near absolute power for more than four decades -- fled from office last month , although pockets of resistance have remained .

Jibril 's speech was in stark contrast to a rambling 90-minute address given by the former Libyan leader two years ago in which he criticized the United Nations and the composition of its security council .

From Egypt , Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr also addressed the assembly -- the first time an Egyptian delegate has done so representing a post - Mubarak government .

In a move that seemed to punctuate recent tensions between Egypt and Israel -LRB- rioters stormed the Israeli embassy in Cairo earlier this month -RRB- the country 's foreign minister told delegates that Egypt is supportive of a Palestinian U.N. bid for statehood .

He added that the Quartet -- representatives from the U.S. , the U.N. , Russia and the European Union -- had failed `` to come up with a balanced vision . ''

The first week of U.N. debates wrapped up on Saturday as delegates outlined their visions for peace and global security .

But one topic remained at the forefront of the annual session : The bid for Palestinian statehood .

The measure prompted the Quartet to issue a call for renewed talks , after they broke down last year .

`` All these meeting , which were confusing , did not make us change our position because our goal was to deliver the official and humanitarian Palestinian message , '' Abbas said .

`` Peace will not come through statements and resolutions at the U.N. , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said in a speech to delegates at the General Assembly earlier this week . `` If it were that easy , it would have been accomplished by now . ''

The American president said he supports Palestinian statehood , but reiterated a long-standing U.S. position that Israel must be part of the discussions .

Israel has described the bid as counterproductive , and has called for an immediate resumption of talks to begin in New York and to be continued in Ramallah and Jerusalem .

The Security Council is expected to meet Monday to further discuss the issue .

The mini-summit coincided with a World Bank decision in Washington to boost aid to the region to $ 1.88 billion from more than $ 500 million , the D.C.-based financial institution announced Saturday .
