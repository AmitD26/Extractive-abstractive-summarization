The NRA is reasonable and a good citizen . Consistent with past practice , LaPierre recounted the NRA 's horror at the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre and stated its silence came out of respect for the victims . Others exploit such tragedies , LaPierre said , but the NRA and its members are better than that .

Did the NRA miss an opportunity ?

The great divide : Little common ground with pro- and anti-gun forces

While these themes are familiar , LaPierre broke with precedent in key ways , most significantly with his explosive broadside against journalists , movie studios , video game producers , record labels and elected officials who have failed to embrace the NRA 's policy goals . If you want to blame someone besides the shooter for Sandy Hook , then blame the `` enablers '' and NRA haters and purveyors of `` dishonest thinking . ''

LaPierre 's attempt to shift the focus to anything but guns was predictable , but the particular message may have some resonance . A Pew Research Center poll found that 47 % of Americans -- including 54 % of women -- thought the Sandy Hook massacre reflected broader social problems , such as parental failures , moral and religious decline , a general devaluation of life , violent depictions in the media and problems with mental health and its treatment . Although 18 % cited easy access to guns -- the most popular single answer -- the poll showed that Americans are far more likely to see gun massacres in a broader context .

iReport : Why would someone own a military-style rifle ?

LaPierre 's apocalyptic vision of the `` unknown number of genuine monsters '' who at this very moment may be plotting the next attack on our schoolchildren -- and the organization 's single-minded and unrealistic call to put an armed guard immediately in all our schools -- felt weirdly out of step with the equally urgent yet more thoughtful conversations occurring at dinner tables around the nation . It was a missed opportunity .
