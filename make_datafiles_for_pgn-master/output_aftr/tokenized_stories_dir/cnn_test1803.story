`` A lot of paranormal societies use graveyards for training grounds , '' said Alan Brown , author of more than 20 books on the subject . `` If you get an EMF reading in a graveyard , there is no electricity there , so it has to be coming from some other source . ''

Oftentimes , the spirits you may encounter in a cemetery are n't kind or frightening but rather full of grief in this final resting place .

`` Oddly enough , a lot of cemeteries are n't that haunted , '' said Richard Senate , a historian and ghost hunter of 33 years . `` People haunt where they loved . The idea of haunting a cemetery outside of someone who is grieving -- that 's what we 're picking up , the grief of a person , rather than their spirit linked to a site . ''

However , there are still an abundance of spirits roaming their final resting place , he said . Senate shared what he regards as some of the most haunted cemeteries in America . Visiting one of these historic sites just may introduce you to someone , or something , waiting on the other side .

St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 , New Orleans

Cemetery No. 1 is perhaps the most famous of New Orleans ' cemeteries . Visitors have witnessed phantom figures , Civil War ghosts and yellow fever victims restlessly stalking through the maze of crypts , Senate said . But perhaps the most well-known spirit is that of Marie Laveau , the city 's own voodoo queen . She is often seen walking the grounds .

After pausing , Senate added , `` It 's a pretty creepy place . I do n't know if I want to be there at night . ''

Resurrection Catholic Cemetery , Chicago

Not all cemetery hauntings involve walking through a graveyard at night . Chicago 's most famous spirit is really just looking for some company , and a way home .

The locals call her `` Resurrection Mary , '' Senate said . She is seen not only within the cemetery but just outside of the gates . If you 're driving through the area , she just may try to hitch a ride .

During the '30s , a Polish woman between the ages of 17 and 22 was on her way back from a dance at the O'Henry Ballroom when she was killed in a car accident . She was buried in Resurrection Cemetery , and locals believe that this is `` Mary . '' She is always seen wearing a vintage ball gown and seems incredibly lifelike -- until she vanishes .

Not only is this cemetery full of Hollywood legends from the silent film era to our recently departed celebrities , Senate says it is also full of ghosts . And they do n't just come out at night ; you can see Hollywood 's ghosts during the day .

When Valentino died , she vowed to visit his grave each year and place a red rose on his gravestone . She became known as `` the lady in black , '' and she was quite visible in the '30s . But when the lady in black died , her ghost carried on the tradition . Both her and Valentino 's ghosts have been seen by his grave , Senate said .

Of course , these are just a couple of the site 's rumored hauntings .

Boothill Cemetery , Tombstone , Arizona

Once a rollicking silver rush town , Tombstone is now the true embodiment of a ghost town . The scenes of incredible violence that took place in its lawless streets still resonate , especially the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral among the Clantons , the Earps and Doc Holliday . Three of the Clanton gang were killed in the fight , which only lasted about 30 seconds . They now rest in Boothill Cemetery , alongside gamblers , smugglers and outlaws , Senate said .

Gettsyburg Cemetery , Gettysburg , Pennsylvania

If you go

Should you decide to stop by any of these cemeteries and go on your own ghost hunt , Senate has a few words of advice . Remember to be respectful of those who have passed on , and do n't disturb any grave to try to incite a ghost .
