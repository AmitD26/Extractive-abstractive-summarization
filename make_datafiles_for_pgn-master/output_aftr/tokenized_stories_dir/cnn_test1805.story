The biggest reason we need to stop New Year 's wishes weeks into the year is that it sounds so insincere . Hollow , not heartfelt , like something you say to a co-worker you really do n't know well to fill an awkward silence , a small step up from , `` That 's some weather we 're having , huh ? ''

Look : No one says `` Happy Thanksgiving '' on December 1 . I never heard anyone offer a `` Happy Fourth of July '' on July 6 . And when is the last time you heard a `` Happy St. Patrick 's Day '' on March 19 ?

Even with the big religious holidays , well wishing starts before the holiday and stops with its occurrence . Go ahead and joyfully exchange wishes of `` Have a Merry Christmas '' the week before the holiday through Christmas Day , but not on December 29 . Happy Hanukah greetings are fine throughout the eight-day holiday but not after . And Ramadan wishes are contained within the 30 days of the holy month and stop with the Eid celebration at the month 's end .

Sure , I get it : It 's a wish for a full year , not just a day . But among the vast array of omens that predict good fortune for the coming year , not one involves saying Happy New Year 's for weeks on end . Believe me , there are some odd superstitions out there that will supposedly bring you luck for the year , from kissing a loved one as the clock strikes midnight to writing your new year 's wishes on a piece of paper and planting it in the ground to eating lentils or black-eyed peas on New Year 's Day .

There are even admonitions to avoid certain activities on New Year 's Day because they portend bad luck for the coming year . One such superstition tells us that eating poultry on New Year 's Day means you will financially struggle for the coming year , which I really wish I had known before I ate chicken with mixed vegetables on January 1 .

In time , hopefully we 'll all be on the same page on this issue . However , even if you are reading this after January 7 , I still sincerely wish you , and your family , a very happy and healthy New Year . But this is the very last time I will say that in 2013 .

Dean Obeidallah : You can stop saying Happy New Year now . It 's tacky and too late

Even South Jersey School of Etiquette president said after the first week , stop

He says we do n't say Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukah when those holidays are over

Obeidallah : It gets progressively more insincere . Lets agree to cut off the greeting at 7 days
