Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Politics is full of second chances .

Mark Sanford is living proof .

`` Look , I made some big mistakes , and I know I let a lot of people down . But I 've also learned some tough lessons . I 'm running for mayor because I 've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life . And I hope I get a second chance to work for you . ''

The video also features his wife , Huma Abedin , a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton , and their young son .

Later in the video , Abedin says `` we love this city , and no one will work harder to make it better than Anthony . ''

Sanford 's political career was left for dead following an infamous affair , but he made a bid for political redemption , running in a special election to fill a vacant congressional seat .

Sanford succeeded in his comeback by winning this month 's election and is again representing South Carolina 's 1st Congressional District , a seat he once held before he became governor .

`` Voters love a good comeback story . We identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves , '' says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos . `` But voters also love justice . We want people to pay for their mistakes . Anthony Weiner has n't yet paid for his . He probably will in this election . But who knows ? ''

`` Anthony was of the most talented politicians in either party , and this race is going to be steep climb for any of the candidates . Anthony definitely has a shot , '' says a Democratic strategist who 's worked in New York City politics .

`` When you have someone as skillful as a messenger as Anthony , that makes a big difference in a race where TV ad spending is limited due to New York City election laws and the fact that it 's the most expensive media market in county , '' adds the strategist , who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely .

As of now , nearly half of New York City voters do n't think Weiner should run for mayor this year , according to a new poll .

According to a Quinnipiac University survey , which was conducted in the week before Weiner 's announcement and released Wednesday , 49 % of New York City voters said Weiner should not run for mayor , with 38 % saying he should make a bid and 12 % unsure .

The 49 % figure is up five percentage points from a Quinnipiac poll conducted in mid-April . The survey indicates Democratic voters are divided , with 41 % saying Weiner should run and 44 % disagreeing .

But Weiner 's entry into the race finds him in the second spot for his party 's nomination , according to the poll , with 15 % of registered Democrats saying they would vote for Weiner if the primary were held today .

The other Democratic candidates are at 10 % or less in the survey , with more than a quarter of voters undecided . The poll also indicates that at this stage in the campaign , the eventual Democratic nominee would be the front-runner in the November election .
