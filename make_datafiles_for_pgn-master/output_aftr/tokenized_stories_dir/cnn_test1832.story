-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's a lot that will happen in 2013 with respect to health care , but the truth of the matter is that most of it will be in preparation for 2014 . That 's the year the Affordable Care Act really kicks into effect . Here are my guesses for what to watch in 2013 :

1 . The Medicaid expansion

Much of this year 's election was fought over whether Medicaid should be cut . Now the big decision is how much Medicaid will be expanded . About half of the uninsured who hope for coverage under the Affordable Care Act will do so under Medicaid , an estimated 16 million to 17 million people . But June 's Supreme Court ruling made the expansion optional , and states get to decide if they will participate . At last count , 17 states have said yes , and nine have said no . The rest will need to commit in 2013 . My guess is that most will . The Obama administration has decided to play hardball , and leaving that money on the table will be met with screams by the uninsured and providers alike .

2 . Medicaid provider payments

These are going up . Way up . Part of the Affordable Care Act makes Medicaid payments to physicians look more like Medicare payments . There is such a difference that many physicians will see fees for primary care services go up by 73 % . Physicians will be thrilled . Those who think Medicaid costs too much already will not .

But many states are choosing not to form local exchanges , leaving it to the federal government . For those states that opt for exchanges , there 's a ton of work to do next year to get them ready to go . The federal government will be responsible for all the states that are opting out , and it has even more work to do . Expect a lot of news on their development . October 1 , 2013 , is the date they 're all supposed to go live .

Taxes are going up . Right now , employees pay a tax of 1.45 % for Medicare -LRB- employers pay an equal amount -RRB- . Starting next year , for couples making more than $ 250,000 that tax will go up by 0.9 % on income above the threshold . Additionally , investment income will also be taxed at 3.8 % for people above the threshold . This is the first time that unearned income will be subject to a Medicare tax .

5 . Medicare reform

A small but important benefit of the Affordable Care Act will start in 2013 . From now on , insurance companies are mandated to describe all plans in easy-to-understand English in a standardized format . Here 's a sample -LRB- PDF -RRB- . This will make things easier for many people , although insurance policies will still be hard to understand .

That should account for most of the excitement next year . Whether I 'm right or wrong , we 'll be covering it here on CNN.com .
