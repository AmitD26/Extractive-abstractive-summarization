The 19-year-old reacted to a photo that colleague Jose Enrique had posted on social networking site Twitter that showed him having treatment on his teeth .

He posted : `` What f *** is he doing ? This guy is gay ... he does everything except play football . ''

Enrique defended his teammate after news of the fine emerged , saying it was just `` banter '' .

'' ` Is amazing how fa can fine my friend @suso30fernandez for a banter thing . Was just a joke ! '' Enrique posted on his own Twitter site .

A statement on their website read : `` Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing Liverpool 's Jesus Fernandez Saez -LRB- Suso -RRB- has been fined Â £ 10,000 and warned as to his future conduct for a comment posted on Twitter .

The sanctions meted out to Suso were welcomed by the Gay Football Supporters Network , but their chair Chris Basiurski said in a statement he thought the fine should go towards the fight against discrimination .

`` However , in a time where resources to fight discrimination in football are limited , we would like to see the monies received by The FA in fines reinvested in the fight against homophobia .

`` Not only would it serve as an appropriate punishment for offences , but also provide a positive outcome , with the fines used to fund some of the important initiatives needed in the game to spread the inclusive message . ''

Suso apologized on Twitter after the FA 's verdict . He said : `` I 'm very sorry if anyone has been offended by my comments about the photo of my team-mate Jose Enrique .
