-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At first glance , the death of Trayvon Martin seemed to be a straightforward example of ugly , racial conflict resulting in the killing of an innocent black teenager by a white man , George Zimmerman . But now , as evidence continues to come forward , the facts seem much more complicated and the `` obvious truth '' premature .

A mob mentality seems to be in the ascendancy .

The New Black Panther Party offered a bounty for Zimmerman 's capture .

Jackson said that Martin 's death shows how `` blacks are under attack '' and `` targeting , arresting , convicting blacks and ultimately killing us is big business . '' Apart from the obvious incendiary nature of such comments , what in heaven 's name could Jackson mean ?

These actions and words illustrate a problem in dealing with Martin 's death : Many people are not on an impartial hunt for justice but are exploiting this crisis for personal or political gain and claiming that it is representative of larger societal problems .

It 's clear that some of the people raising the most noise are trying to make this less about the horrible death of a young man and more about claims of racial resentment that may or may not exist .

The loudest voices should be particularly careful not to rush to conclusions . Remember the Duke lacrosse case , in which members of the team were accused of a gang rape . The public rushed to judgment long before the young men were eventually acquitted .

Zimmerman may or may not be guilty ; there may or may not be racial motivations . We do not know yet . In the absence of complete evidence , inflammatory comments and belligerent reactions will not aid the search for justice . An angry crowd should not be in charge .

Lastly , why is there so much selective outrage on the part of so many ?

In his Letter from a Birmingham Jail , Martin Luther King Jr. wrote , `` Any law that uplifts human personality is just . Any law that degrades human personality is unjust . ''

While we wait and respect due process of law , we should do our part to uplift human personality . We can do so by giving both Martin and Zimmerman a just weighing of the evidence , both in the court of law and public opinion . Let us not assume the worst of anybody but be guided by the facts .
