-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For decades , Mike Wallace defined the image of the hard-charging investigative reporter . News of his death at 93 came Sunday and with it a multitude of remembrances and assessments of a complex man .

Wallace 's longevity and his medium -- the TV network -- put a face on investigative reporting for the public . His career reflected how investigative journalism evolved from the 1950s into the 21st century -- and showed why we still need it .

We watched too as he underwent two major controversies that would have demolished other careers . One was a $ 120 million libel suit by Gen. William C. Westmoreland over a story that said the military had deceived the American public about the size of opposition forces during the Vietnam War . The suit was eventually withdrawn but not before it had damaged reputations and sent Wallace into depression .

The second was over an investigation into the tobacco industry that led to a fierce internal dispute at CBS on airing the story . Eventually , all the information came out and Wallace criticized his own bosses at CBS . But the controversy still resulted in a film highly critical of the network and Wallace 's handling of the story .

However , the public stuck with him -- perhaps because he continued to give hope that liars could be exposed , that dangerous practices could be stopped and wrongheaded policies overturned .

Backed by a series of talented reporters and producers over the years , he was the front man -- the `` closer '' so to speak -- for teams of investigative journalists and for the public . In the theater of the interview , he conveyed the outrage and skepticism of journalists who spent months digging for the truth .

One of his former producers , Charles Lewis , wrote Sunday , `` Mike Wallace will go down in history as the finest investigative interviewer on the most popular and most honored network television news program in U.S. history . ''

In the end , one might wonder how he could continue to get those interviews after all those years of blistering confrontations , but I got a clue in 2000 .

But while waiting backstage he suddenly said he needed one of his well-known catnaps . We offered to get a cot , but he said no thanks , folded his suit jacket inside out into a pillow , lay down on the floor and promptly fell asleep .

For 10 minutes the staff delicately stepped over and around him . Then he got up , completely alert , thanked everyone for inviting him , and smiling went on stage to chat with a thousand journalists .
