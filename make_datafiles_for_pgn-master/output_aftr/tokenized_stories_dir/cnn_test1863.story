Mugabe , 89 , has been at the helm since 1980 , the only president the nation has known since it gained independence from Britain . A win would extend his time in office to 38 years .

`` There is no doubt whatsoever that we have seen results everywhere in the country so far that ZANU-PF has won , '' said Didymus Mutasa , a party secretary .

Tsvangirai 's party called the vote `` null and void , '' alleging widespread fraud .

He said irregularities included voter intimidation , unauthorized voter migration and lack of transparency in printing ballot boxes .

But Mutasa dismissed the fraud allegations .

`` That is stupidity . If all the leaders were as stupid as Tsvangirai , the world would be a very sad place to live in , '' he said .

Opinion : Is Zimbabwe ready for elections ?

Regional leaders dismissed that election as a sham and pressured Mugabe to form a power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai , which led to the tense coalition in 2009 .

But Mugabe has denied the accusations and extended a conciliatory message to his main rival .

Mugabe to West : Back off

The elections were held under a new constitution endorsed in a March referendum that limits the president to two five-year terms . Mugabe is allowed to seek another term because the rule does not apply retroactively .

Last week , he had a few words for critics of the election , especially the West .

`` Keep your pink nose out of our affairs , please , '' he said in response to criticisms from the United States on his push for elections without key reforms .

Zimbabwe , seeking election funding , turns to neighboring countries

Citizens say this year 's election is crucial in more ways than one .

Despite the setbacks , it provides another shot at democracy .

This is the first poll since Zimbabwe battled hyperinflation that left investors jittery and led many to abandon the country 's currency .

In 2009 , the nation introduced a 100 trillion-dollar bill that was worth about $ 300 in U.S. currency . At the time , a loaf of bread cost about 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars .

The hyperinflation forced traders to insist on international currency to hedge against losses .

Big strides

Since then , the nation 's gross domestic product `` has grown by an average of over 7 % and inflation has remained in the low single digits , '' the International Monetary Fund said last month . `` Government revenues have more than doubled from 16 % of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 36 % of GDP in 2012 , allowing the restoration of basic public services . ''

And as the nation returns from the brink of a crippled economy , Zimbabweans are hopeful .
