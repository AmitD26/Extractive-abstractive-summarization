Lexington , Kentucky -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the 1950s , when Dr. Andy Moore 's father was the first plastic surgeon in town , many residents did n't have health insurance . But Dr. Andrew Moore Sr. believed that medicine was about service .

`` In this economic time , the people that need this are our friends , neighbors and family , '' said Moore , 61 , a Lexington native . `` They ca n't wait till we get some sort of solution from the national government . They need this health care now . ''

Volunteers arrive bright and early -- the first surgery is at 7:30 a.m. -- and leave in the early afternoon . On an average Sunday , the group cares for 25 to 30 patients . Volunteers include anesthesiologists , nurses , receptionists and other surgeons .

Most cases are gallbladders , hernias and colonoscopies , although SOS offers a wide range of surgical procedures . Different surgeons perform procedures depending on their specialties .

`` It 's our duty to help people that fall between the cracks in the health care system , '' Moore said . `` This is what I went into medicine for . ... It 's about taking care of people and not necessarily expecting something in return for it . ''

According to the Census Bureau , 46.3 million people in the United States are uninsured . In Kentucky , the fifth poorest state in the nation , 33 percent of working-age adults lack health insurance , according to a University of Cincinnati poll .

Moore says he wo n't stop fighting for the uninsured to get the care they deserve . `` Knowing that you 've made a real difference in their lives , at the other end , is the thing that keeps you going , '' he said .

Moore hopes to expand the program nationally . In March , the group is starting its first satellite program in Dallas , Texas , which will be operated by local volunteers using a template provided by Moore and SOS .

In Lexington , costs are covered by donations and private foundations , and patients are referred to SOS by hospitals and free clinics . People are seen based on the urgency of their medical need , and about 1,500 people are on a waiting list .

Michael Weyls had to wait more than a year for his second SOS surgery . A California native , Weyls , 52 , was an avid surfer who worked construction for years . He was diagnosed with malignant melanoma at age 30 and had it removed , but it reappeared 20 years later .

The surgery may have saved his life , but it also left Weyls disfigured and in a deep depression .

`` My face was tore up . I kind of lost hope , '' Weyls said . `` But Dr. Moore gave me hope . ''

A year later , Moore helped reconstruct Weyls ' nose . It took two Moore brothers and four hours of surgery to give Weyls a new start at life .
