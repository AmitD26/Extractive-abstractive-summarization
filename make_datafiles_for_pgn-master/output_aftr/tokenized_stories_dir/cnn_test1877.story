`` Professor Ginsburg is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the Supreme Court , '' said the justice in March 2009 . `` Mainly he performs in the kitchen , for the quarterly spouses ' lunches held at the Court and , occasionally in past years , at a dinner for the entire Court family -- justices , their spouses , and widows of former Court members . In the beginning , when I was the newest justice , my dear husband offered aid in lightening my load . ''

Ruth Ginsburg , who joined the Supreme Court in 1993 , long credited her husband 's open-mindedness for the success she has enjoyed in her legal , academic , and judicial career , especially at a time decades ago when women were encouraged to stay home and devote their energies to supporting their spouses .

Martin David Ginsburg was born in 1932 and grew up in Long Island , New York . He met his future wife on a blind date at Cornell University , and they married in 1954 . After he served a stint in the military , the couple both attended Harvard Law School . During his third year , Ginsburg developed a rare form of testicular cancer and underwent two surgeries . He credited his recovery in part to wife 's ability to juggle caring for him , their young daughter , and their dual legal studies .

He later worked as a lawyer in New York and a professor at Columbia University 's law school , where Ruth Ginsburg had transferred and graduated . Unlike her husband , the future justice was unable to find a job at her alma mater or any decent offers at a law firm , so she began teaching at Rutgers University , and developed a national reputation taking on gender discrimination cases .

He was known for quietly helping build and organize political support for his wife 's appointments to those top government jobs . The justice has called her husband her `` best friend and biggest booster . ''

`` A supportive husband who is willing to share duties and responsibilities is a must for any woman who hopes to combine marriage and a career , '' she recently told a forum on professional opportunities for female lawyers . ''

Through his friendship with billionaire businessman and onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot , a special position -- or `` chair '' in academic circles -- was created at Georgetown for the study of tax law , and named in Martin Ginsburg 's honor .

It was less than successful , however , as the professor himself explained in his professional resume . `` In 1986 , someone who probably prefers never to be identified endowed a Chair in Taxation in his name at Georgetown , '' wrote Ginsburg . `` No one appears willing to occupy the Ginsburg Chair , and it remains vacant , '' a fact he always laughed about .

The Ginsburgs had two children , Jane -- a professor at Columbia -- James , an independent record producer in Chicago , and four grandchildren .
