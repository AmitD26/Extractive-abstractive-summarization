`` A guy walked into a movie theater with a 100-round drum , and one second my son was watching a movie and the next second he was dead , '' Sullivan said .

The ceremonial reading , which lasted more than 10 hours , ended at 12:28 a.m. Saturday , the moment when the shooting began one year earlier .

The event was part of the `` No More Names '' bus tour , sponsored by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's group , Mayors Against Illegal Guns .

On Friday , Carlee Soto came to mark the Aurora killings , although she lost her sister five months later . First-grade teacher Victoria Soto , 27 , was killed in the elementary school massacre in Newton , Connecticut .

A handful of gun rights advocates peacefully protested the event Friday . One of them , Rob Blancken , said all Coloradans should remember the tragedy .

`` It 's also a tragedy that a firearm was not allowed to be used inside that theater that may have prevented that tragedy , '' Blancken said .
