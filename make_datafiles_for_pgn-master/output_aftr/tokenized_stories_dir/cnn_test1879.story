`` Today we lost a friend , mentor and true visionary , '' said Kevin Yeaman , the company 's president and CEO .

Dolby founded the company in London in 1965 , and in the following decades it built on his pioneering work in surround sound and noise reduction , which removed the annoying `` hiss '' from audio recordings .

Dolby 's work earned so much admiration from the film industry that last year the Hollywood landmark known as the `` home of the Academy Awards '' was renamed Dolby Theatre . After each annual star-studded ceremony , the world 's leading actors and actresses toast the occasion in the Ray Dolby Ballroom .

`` With Dolby Laboratories , his passion for sound led to innovations that have changed the way we listen to music and movies for nearly 50 years , '' said Neil Portnow , President and CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences .

`` His technologies have become an essential part of the creative process for recording artists and filmmakers , ensuring his remarkable legacy for generations to come . ''

`` I wanted the experience of traveling to many parts of the world . Inventions were part of my life , but they did n't overtake everything that I was doing , '' he said in quotes released by the company .

`` I think he was the happiest when we would be on the boat , and the waves got really high and the weather forecast was really bad -- that was all the more challenge for him , '' she said .

Tom Dolby , a filmmaker and novelist , said : `` Though he was an engineer at heart , my father 's achievements in technology grew out of a love of music and the arts . He brought his appreciation of the artistic process to all of his work in film and audio recording . ''

After graduating , Dolby moved to India for a two-year stint as a United Nations adviser before returning to London to set up his company . In 2004 , Dolby was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in the U.S. and the Royal Academy of Engineers in the UK .
