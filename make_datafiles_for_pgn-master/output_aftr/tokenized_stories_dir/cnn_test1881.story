-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Full disclosure : I have loved watching the Olympics on television since Munich 1972 and thoroughly enjoyed being in the cities for the run-up to Torino 2006 and London 2012 .

Costs be damned .

Well , not really . But those who moan and groan about the `` costs '' of the Olympic movement have to go a long way to convince me they are automatically bad for a city .

As the Financial Times notes , the current budget projections are 0.2 % of 2012 GDP . Plus , more than half of the $ 8 billion build-out cost projections is already set aside , the new hosts tell us .

Construction firms are getting nice juicy contracts . Architects have already been hard at work . Full-time and part-time jobs will be created .

Sure , the budget will rise . It always does . London tripled its initial budget estimates to $ 14 billion for the construction , security etc. and privately raised $ 3 billion or so to stage the games , from corporate sponsors , ticket sales and broadcasting rights .

Now , Winter Olympics are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs .

Many cities have been left with expensive white elephants in far flung places . Let 's hope Sochi 's $ 10bn budget -LRB- or more -RRB- is worth the cost as the government plans to make the area a year-round resort and also the site of big sporting events like a Formula One grand prix .

Montreal is the proverbial exception to the rule and was the warning sign for all cities to follow . It has rightfully scared the IOC and host cities into getting it right , or face financial headaches for years to come .

Atlanta '96 was no great success either , but for the start of the trend to plan the use of big venues , before the Games began . The Olympic Stadium was partially knocked down and used by the city 's popular baseball team .

While Beijing 's appears to be nothing more than a tourist attraction , London 's will be home to a mix of football , athletics and already stands at the heart of a new urban park -- home to big named concerts and yes , lots of tourists .

London also got new train stations and better access to the east of the city . Sure , the poor in the area should have had that already , but now they do ; along with new schools , swimming pools and housing .

Could Olympic money be `` spent '' in better ways ? Not likely .
