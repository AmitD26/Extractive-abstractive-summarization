The Syrian regime touted gains on Wednesday in the quest to control Syria 's largest city and commercial hub , Aleppo :

`` Units from our heroic Syrian armed forces are in confrontations with terrorist armed groups '' in Aleppo , `` inflicting upon them heavy losses in their numbers and equipment , '' state-run TV reported .

Regime and rebel fighters have battled for months in Aleppo , where civilians routinely dodge snipers and attacks from the air .

Government forces have previously attacked bread lines in Aleppo province , according to human rights groups and U.N. officials . Residents in opposition-friendly areas often wait in lines at night to avoid being targeted by government aircraft .

Across the country , at least 172 people were killed in fresh violence on Wednesday , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . Sixty-seven of the deaths occurred in Aleppo , it said .

`` We face a dangerous stalemate , '' she said Tuesday in a statement . `` The truth is that , despite all the efforts , the international community is in a sense at a deadlock ... the U.N. Security Council has not been able to agree on a common response that could open the way for a political solution . ''
