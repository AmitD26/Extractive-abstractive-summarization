-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When a marriage ends up in court it usually means the end -- but for Todd Rogers it was just the beginning .

The 39-year-old was a single man following the breakdown of his seven-year partnership with Phil Dalhausser -- a relationship which had catapulted both men to the very top .

`` When you get to nine or 10 dates , then you say , ` OK , looks pretty good . I like what I 'm seeing . '

Baseball beginnings

For Doherty , volleyball has given him another chance of a sporting career after his original dreams of playing major league baseball ended in failure .

A minor league player for a team affiliated with the Arizona Diamondbacks organization for three years , Doherty had hoped to become a professional only to be released from his contract .

Struggling for work and suffering under the collapse of his baseball career , Doherty traveled to North Carolina to visit a friend , who would go on to introduce him to beach volleyball .

`` He was living really close to the beach and we found a beach volleyball court and decided ` Oh , we should try this , we should try to learn ' and I just fell in love , '' he said .

`` So after I finished my degree I decided to move out to California and see if I could play this game every day . ''

It proved an inspired decision as Doherty went from strength to strength before pairing up with Rogers -- a move which he believes has given him another crack at becoming a top sportsmen .

`` I would consider myself one of the luckiest guys you can imagine being able to play one sport professionally , two is pretty jaw dropping for me , '' Doherty added .

`` I really lucked out . I do n't know what I did in a previous life but I want to thank that guy . Playing professional baseball was my dream . It was my whole life .

`` I wanted to do that and when it was over I was really depressed . I was really bummed because I loved that lifestyle .

`` Then I was lucky enough to just fall into a lifestyle that 's every bit as fun , challenging and motivating as being a professional baseball player . ''

Professional partnership

`` I watched every match he 's played online well before I was a professional when I first found the sport . One of the most motivating things I 've ever seen was Todd and his former partner winning the gold medal in the 2008 Olympics .

`` It was amazing to me . I was rooting and cheering and screaming at my TV and I also know that the nickname ` Professor ' is very well deserved .

`` He has a really good understanding of how things work and why they happen the way they do , so just as a new guy who 's trying to learn and trying to get better at the sport , I could n't have lucked into anything better .

`` This has been a really great experience for me so far . ''

Rogers is also enjoying his new `` marriage '' and even jokes about Doherty being his `` wife . ''

`` But really the number one thing to me is that he 's a good guy that I enjoy hanging out with and chatting with .

Olympic glory

While the prospect of the pair competing at Rio in 2016 is a slim one , Rogers is not giving up on making it to Brazil just yet .

`` The highlight was winning the Olympic gold medal in Beijing , '' he said .

`` Then there was winning the World Championships in Switzerland in 2007 but the Olympics is once every four years .

`` There 's only been five Olympics for beach volleyball and to be part of that elite group which can claim a victory at it , the greatest sporting event in the world really , is a really cool honor for me .

`` Ryan is only 29 so I definitely would hope that he 's be going to Rio , if I 'm his partner and it works out that way -- great .

`` Right now I tend to think more of a year at a time and if Rio happens for me great , but if nothing else I can watch Ryan playing in Rio and hopefully in 2020 as well . ''
