-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Ivory Coast 's former leader , Laurent Gbagbo , used a lull in fighting this week as a `` trick '' to reinforce their positions around the main city of Abidjan , the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations said Friday .

Though Gbagbo 's men said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months-long fighting in Ivory Coast , they soon restarted shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population , Alain Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations .

`` They have clearly used the lull of Tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position , '' he said .

Most areas of the capital , however , are now under U.N. or French military control , journalist Seyi Rhodes reported from the French military base in Port Bouet . The French military has been working to reconnect the disrupted water and electricity supply in what is the country 's main city .

Rhodes traveled with the French military through Abidjan on Friday and reported seeing civilians in the streets , including one woman selling food , which he took as a positive sign .

Le Roy said that if that hotel comes under attack , the United Nations may have to consider using force against Gbagbo and his men .

Pro-Gbagbo forces have heavy weapons including tanks , mortars , and rocket-propelled grenades and are using them `` as we speak against the civilian population '' and U.N. headquarters , Le Roy said .

The spokesman , Ahoua Don Mello , said the U.N. forces fired on the state television station , which is in the same block as both the French ambassador 's residence and Gbagbo 's residence , and that they have broken the antennae .

`` The national TV station was destroyed by the last attack -LRB- two days ago -RRB- , '' Mello said . `` Right now it is still working , and the French do n't want the national TV to work any more and they are now preparing an attack . ''

The United Nations is still hoping political dialogue will resolve the situation , said Nestor Osorio , Colombia 's ambassador and current president of the U.N. Security Council .

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his nation 's full support of Ouattara on Friday and said the situation in the country `` remains serious . ''

Juppe 's words came amid a disturbing new report of the type of killings and abuses that have plagued Ivory Coast since the disputed November election .

The victims are believed to have been mostly or all Guerre people , who have traditionally supported Gbagbo , and some of the victims were burned alive , the United Nations said .

In the town of Blolequin , human rights investigators said , the perpetrators of killings were Liberian mercenaries who separated the Guerre from the rest and spared them from slaughter .

The report pinned most of the blame , however , on supporters of the internationally recognized president .

The group urged Ouattara to open an investigation into abuses by both sides as soon as he takes power .

`` While the international community has been focused on the political stalemate in Abidjan over the presidency , forces on both sides have committed numerous atrocities against civilians , their leaders showing little interest in reining them in , '' said Daniel Bekele , Africa director for Human Rights Watch . `` Ouattara should send a strong message to -LRB- his forces -RRB- that such abuses will be fully punished at home or by an international tribunal . ''

Nearly 150,000 people have now fled their homes amid Ivory Coast 's war , displaced within the country or seeking refuge in neighboring nations , the U.N. refugee agency said Friday .

Sporadic gunfire rang out Friday in Abidjan , the nation 's largest city , where Gbagbo remained hunkered down in the basement of his residence , guarded by about 200 of his men .

Ouattara has blamed Gbagbo for Ivory Coast 's suffering . He told citizens this week he ordered the military and police to safeguard public places including hospitals and markets .

The November presidential election had been expected to help unify the West African nation , which is rebounding from a 2002 civil war . Instead , the disputed vote sliced the nation in two .

Sporadic post-election violence erupted into all-out war after Ouattara 's troops launched an offensive that swept through the country to Abidjan on the coast .

On Friday , at Ouattara 's request , the European Union lifted sanctions on Ivory Coast entities , including two key ports .

CNN 's Moni Basu , Katy Byron , Saskya Vandoorne , and Aliza Kassim contributed to this report .
