-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Citing inaction by city police , some residents in a Detroit neighborhood attacked and beat a man they suspected of raping a teenage girl .

Authorities confirm they investigated a reported rape in July , that the alleged victim -- a 15-year-old girl with Down syndrome -- was taken to a hospital and evidence was collected , including a rape kit .

Authorities also confirm that processing in the case was delayed in the days and weeks after the alleged incident . Despite questioning of a man identified by the girl 's family and area residents as the suspect , no charges have been filed .

On August 5 -- more than two weeks after the alleged rape was reported -- some residents of the Hubbard Farms neighborhood in southwestern Detroit decided they were n't going to wait for police and prosecutors to act .

They recognized the man -- a resident of the area -- from handbills posted around the neighborhood that included the man 's picture , and some residents went into action , chasing the man when he ran and hitting him with blows that including baseball bat strikes to the knees .

While only a few residents took part in the beating , sentiment was strong that the man was a threat to the community and that police were not proceeding on the rape case , according to resident Angel Garza , also known by his artist name , Anjoe Block .

`` It was way too long for -LRB- authorities -RRB- to do something . All we wanted to do was get him away from our neighborhood , '' said Garza , who did not participate in the incident involving the man , but told CNN he knew people who did .

The physical condition and whereabouts of the man , who had been arrested and released by police before the beating , could not be determined Tuesday . He has not been charged Tuesday .

The Wayne County prosecutor 's office confirmed that the alleged rape was reported to police on July 17 .

Police sent crews to the crime scene and took in evidence . But then processing of the rape kit was delayed , according to Jerome Warfield , a member of Detroit 's civilian commission that oversees police .

The community learned of the incident from a family member 's post on the community list-serve . An e-mail by the relative of the alleged victim outlined the incident , gave purported details about the man , and told how the family tried to contact police .

`` So it 's OK to take the law into your own hands ? '' said one user on the community forum on Facebook . `` And the people who beat him up were n't arrested ? ''

`` When are they going to arrest the people that beat him like they did , '' said another user on the forum . `` They are every bit as guilty as they believe he is . ''

According to a case record in the Wayne County Probate Court , the man is 43 years old and described as `` an individual with a developmental disability . ''

According to Warfield , the processing of the rape kit was delayed some seven to 10 days for unknown reasons .

`` If there was anything that the police could have done better , it would 've been issuing the rape kit more quickly , '' said Warfield .

Following the beating of the man last week , vandals painted the word RAPIST in large letters five times on an apartment building , just below the man 's unit , Warfield said .

They broke in and ransacked the man 's home , according to Warfield .

`` It 's been such a tragedy , '' said John Van Camp , president of Southwest Solutions , an agency involved in neighborhood revitalization , counseling services , and economic development in the community .

`` I 've known the victim and family for many years . We provided as much support as we could . The fact that it 's continuing to unfold is unfathomable . ''

Van Camp believes since the situation is still unfolding , all parties , including the 15-year-old girl , the people within the community and the man who was beaten , have now all become victims .

`` We do understand that the neighbors were enraged , '' said Warfield . `` Detroit police understand how this is emotional . But vigilantism can not be accepted when you 're impeding upon somebody 's rights . ''
