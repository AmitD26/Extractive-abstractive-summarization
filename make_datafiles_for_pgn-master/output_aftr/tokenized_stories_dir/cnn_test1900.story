-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Indian city of Mumbai exploded into chaos early Thursday morning as gunmen launched a series of attacks across the country 's commercial capital , killing scores of people and taking hostages in two luxury hotels frequented by Westerners .

CNN 's Larry King spoke with author Deepak Chopra about the situation .

Deepak Chopra : I was born in Delhi , but I have been in these hotels many , many times . I have stayed there , so I know the scene ; I know the restaurants . I have been trying to get in touch with my friends and relatives , some of whom I have spoken to , some of whom I ca n't speak to . The lines are jammed . We 're texting each other .

A friend of mine from Egypt was in the restaurant at the Taj hotel when the firing started , and somehow she managed to avoid the fray , hid in a basement and is now holed up in a room which is right next to the Taj hotel and is waiting to be told what to do .

And you know , one of the things that I think is happening is that these militant terrorist groups are actually terrified that -LSB- President-elect Barack -RSB- Obama 's gestures to the rest of the Muslim world may actually overturn the tables on them by alienating them from the rest of the Muslim world , so they 're reacting to this .

You know , this is Obama 's opportunity to actually harness the help of the Muslims .

You know , there 's 1.8 billion Muslims in the world . That 's 25 percent of the population of the world . It 's the fastest-growing religion in the world . We can not , if we do not appease and actually recruit the help of this Muslim world , we 're going to have a problem on our hands .

And we can not go after the wrong people , as we did after 9/11 , because then the whole collateral damage that occurs actually aggravates the situation .

King : Do you think that this is just the beginning , that there 's a potential impact , or more ?

It 's not enough for Pakistan to condemn it . Pakistan should cooperate with India in uprooting this . They should be part of the surgery that is going to happen .

It 's not enough for Indians to blame Pakistanis . Indians should actually ask the Pakistanis to help them .

King : What does India immediately do ?

Chopra : India at this moment has to contain any reactive violence from the fundamentalist Hindus , which is very likely and possible . So India has to condemn that by not blaming local Muslims . They have to identify the exact groups .

And the world has to be very careful that they do n't go after the wrong people . Because if you go after the wrong people , you convert moderates into extremists . It happens every time , and retribution against innocent people just because they have the same religion actually aggravates and perpetuates the problem .

Chopra : I think Mr. Obama has a real opportunity here , but a challenging opportunity , a creative opportunity .

Get rid of the phrase `` war on terrorism . '' Ask for a creative solution in which we all participate .

King : Is it because the war on terrorism really can never be won because the terrorists -LRB- inaudible -RRB- ?

You know , terrorists call mechanized death from 35,000 feet above sea level with a press of a button also terror . We do n't call it that , because our soldiers are wearing uniforms . They do n't see what is happening , and innocent people are being killed . So , you know , terror is a term that you apply to the other .
