Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Actor Brandon T. Jackson was kicked off a US Airways flight Monday because he was disruptive , the airline told CNN Wednesday .

But Jackson 's rep insisted the actor was not served any drinks before the incident , which he said began when Jackson walked to the back of the plane to ask for two sandwiches for himself and a seat mate . The attendant told him that other passengers had complained that he was being too loud , he said .

`` The flight attendant told him to sit down and ` I do n't care if you 're Obama 's son , ' then used a derogatory word -- seemingly in jest , '' the rep said .

US Airways `` fully supports the actions of the crew in this situation , '' and the attendant `` denied any use of the n-word or racist slurs '' with Jackson , the airline said .

Jackson , who was traveling from New York to Los Angeles for an audition , tweeted to his 205,000 followers from the plane :

`` they want to escort me off the plane for her saying racial stuff i have witness ''

`` i wish this racist generation just hurry up and die off ... im tired of this ''

`` GUYS i need you help i am not going to jail for be called racial slurs please ... ''

Afterward , Jackson tweeted again : `` I was released from question and stranded in phx they will not let me fly anymore I do n't want to . . I 'm taking this to CNN ''

He boarded another flight to Los Angeles Tuesday morning , his rep said .

Jackson 's rep provided a statement from a woman he said was seated next to Jackson on the flight , whom he did n't know before boarding .

`` He was n't being rowdy at all , and definitely not intoxicated , '' Elisabeth Schwarz said . `` There was another exit row in front of us that was standing , drinking and making noise . We were all in shock when the attendant insinuated other passengers were complaining . The other flight attendant even told us we were n't doing anything wrong . ''

Jackson 's statement also included a conciliatory quote from the actor : `` I realize this was just one flight attendant acting inappropriately and I appreciate the support of the other passengers , US Airways staff at the Phoenix airport , and the Phoenix airport police . ''
