Well , at this juncture , we humbly request that those words not be `` rock star . ''

In recent years , we have noticed an outright epidemic of cliched , narcissistic and , let 's be honest , straight-up embarrassing self-monikerization . In short : A ton of people have started calling themselves `` visionaries '' on their websites , LinkedIn profiles , Twitter profiles , etc. -- and it 's more than a little annoying .

Nina Beckhardt , president and creative director of The Naming Group , blames this pompous proliferation on the fact that our identities are now more public than ever .

Does your title -- `` Executive Engineer of Cross-Functional Branding , '' or whatever -- seem a little boring ? Well , slapping `` ninja '' in front of it may seem like a quick fix -- if it were n't for the fact that there are tons of other people out there who had the same genius idea as you .

Last year , LinkedIn tabulated how many ninjas were sneaking around the job-finding site and found it to be an extremely trendy title . To quote `` Fight Club '' -- which is also cliched , sorry -- `` You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake , '' you Java Script Ninja , you .

You are merely one of huddled masses of gray-suited commuters suffering from Kurosawa-induced delusions of grandeur .

If you do , in fact , feel impelled to flesh out your title with something descriptive , at least mull it over for a moment and come up with something original , like `` Martini Whisperer , '' of which there is only one on LinkedIn .

According to Krista Canfield , spokeswoman for LinkedIn , calling yourself a rock star or something of that nature online could have a downside when it comes to reaching potential employers . `` You always want to make sure that you 're referencing words and phrases that people actually search for in order to make sure your profile appears in those results , '' she says .

Let 's say a potential employer is getting some internet assistance in hiring a photographer . Well , what do you think said potential employer is going to enter into the Monster.com search field ? If you guessed , `` visual media rock star , '' well , then you would be wrong .

`` When you 're crafting your profile , think of the words and phrases you want to be associated with , '' Canfield says .

Speaking of real rock stars , here 's a relevant example of exacting nomenclature from the indie music world . This week , the band Yeasayer sent out an e-mail declaring that it had finally secured the Twitter handle @Yeasayer . Before , the band 's handle had been @OddBlood , which was the title of its last album .

Why ? Because the band is now more accurately representing itself -- it 's easier to find .

If you 're calling yourself a `` universe shifter , '' it pretty much signals to said cosmos that you are not , in fact , anything of the kind .

As Beckhardt says , `` Certain titles , like ` Evangelist ' and ` Visionary ' are just taking it a little too far . If you truly are a visionary , it will most likely show through in other ways . If Ghandi had a LinkedIn profile , I doubt he 'd call himself ` Pre-eminent Ideological Leader . ' ''

So when setting out to `` find yourself '' in the sucking quagmire that is the Web , we suggest getting more creative with the manner in which you define yourself .

Nix the slovenly shorthand and do the whole `` show , do n't tell '' thing they teach you about in high school creative writing classes : Craft a homepage that shows your personality and demonstrates your skills -LRB- services like About.Me and Flavors.me make that idiot-proof -RRB- , for example .
