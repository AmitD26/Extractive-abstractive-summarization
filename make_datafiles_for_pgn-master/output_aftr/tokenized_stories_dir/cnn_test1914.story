-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Train the brain . Until recently , this phrase made me picture Neo from `` The Matrix '' proclaiming `` I know kung fu '' after he had martial arts abilities uploaded into his brain .

For many of us , the days seem to pass in one anxiety-ridden blur after another . Mental health professional increasingly agree that these daily sprints , accompanied by a soundtrack of endless beeps , chirps and vibrations emitting from various devices , set off our stress systems , keeping us in a persistent and physiologically damaging state of fight-or-flight .

`` The way we live our lives now is like running marathons , '' said Dr. Leslie Sherlin , a neuroscientist and chief science officer of Neurotopia , a company that provides brain training to athletes . `` And in some ways , that 's great , but you ca n't run marathons all the time . ''

Keep that pace , says Sherlin , and at some point , you will burn out . You may also suffer from a weakened immune system that can lead to an increased risk of disease .

For these two distinct groups , performance under high stress is a must -LRB- albeit for very different reasons -RRB- . But the technologies being used to train them could benefit the rest of us as well .

Technology could help us reduce stress , too

I became interested in the way athletes train for peak performance in high-stakes environments last year , when I interviewed Michael Gervais , a sports psychologist who works with Sherlin to train elite athletes to perform optimally during high-stress competition . Gervais and Sherlin work with athletes from the NFL , NBA and NHL as well as Olympians , golfers and many others .

As part of their training , Gervais and his colleagues hook up athletes to electrodes and perform a baseline qEEG : a quantitative electroencephalogram . They use the results to create an individualized brain map .

The map helps these sports psychologists assess and quantify mental aspects of performance like focus , decision speed , reaction time and stress regulation .

Once the brain is mapped , the psychologists conduct half-hour neurofeedback sessions to teach athletes how to reach optimal brain wave patterns . In a typical session , the athlete will sit before a large screen as sensors monitoring electrical activity in his or her brain are placed on the scalp .

The athlete then focuses on achieving desirable brain wave patterns that , in turn , influence what happens on the screen . It 's bit like controlling a video game with only your thoughts . The version I saw involved cars racing through a desert .

These sports psychologists have collected a proprietary brain bank of assessments over years of working with elite athletes . They use the brain bank to identify optimal brainwave patterns associated with the highest levels of performance .

Originally developed as a technique to measure brain activity in NASA pilots during flight simulation exercises , neurofeedback has shown promising initial results for helping retrain the brainwaves of children with ADHD and autism and people suffering from chronic migraines . In one study , student eye surgeons were trained to significantly improve their surgical skills by regulating their own brainwave activity .

The method is being examined in a diverse number of other contexts , including to help relieve symptoms of chemotherapy-induced nerve damage . Controlled , randomized trials will help validate these promising starts .

The kind of training that the athletes working with Gervais and Sherlin receive is not available to most of us right now , but it may be in our near future .

A few weeks ago , Sherlin 's company , Neurotopia , began beta-testing a dry -LRB- no goo in your hair -RRB- sensor , mobile headphone and tablet system that purports to do the same kind of assessment and training as the older model . At least in theory , this might make the product accessible to the rest of us .

Training soldiers for the battlefield

Except Rizzo 's jaw-dropping efforts are not fiction , nor are they `` on the horizon . '' They are here , now .

In a collaboration between the military , Hollywood and USC 's Institute for Creative Technologies , where he serves as the associate director for medical virtual reality , Rizzo and his colleagues have developed cutting-edge gaming and virtual reality technologies to serve the clinical needs of soldiers .

One project , Stress Resilience in Virtual Environments -LRB- STRIVE -RRB- , helps train service members to have better resilience and emotional coping skills in realistic virtual-reality combat scenarios before they are exposed to the real stresses of combat .

A second project , called Virtual Iraq -LRB- there is also a Virtual Afghanistan -RRB- , helps soldiers returning from combat work through their trauma by donning a helmet geared with video goggles , earphones and a scent machine , and revisiting the scene in a virtual reality setting , complete with sound and smell . Both STRIVE and Virtual Iraq -LRB- and Afghanistan -RRB- are based on exposure therapy , which has been effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder .

The idea , says Rizzo , is to re-create the stressful environment in a doctor 's office , to help the patients confront and challenge the trauma and to give them the tools to better cope emotionally with what happened .

Both of these technologies require specialists and a clinical setting , but SimCoach , a `` virtual human '' designed for interactive use on the Internet , does not .

`` SimCoach is not a doc-in-the-box , and it 's not going to make a diagnosis , '' Hart observed . Nor is it meant to replace human interaction .

Imagine the possibilities ! An interactive virtual-reality source for information on stress , anxiety and PTSD -- the precursor , perhaps , to a real-life version of `` Star Trek 's '' Emergency Medical Hologram Doctor .

Home sweet home

`` I write , '' I said , `` mostly about stress . ''

So , yes , let 's discuss technology addiction , always being `` on , '' tech fasting and the need to design devices and apps for greater serenity . But let 's also consider how to harness some of these technologies to help us move easier in this new world , Neo-style .
