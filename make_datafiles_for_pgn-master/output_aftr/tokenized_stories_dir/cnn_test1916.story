-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tensions are high in Kenya after the recent general elections saw front-runner , Prime Minister Raila Odinga , contest the Electoral commission 's decision to declare Uhuru Kenyatta the winner . And nowhere is the tension more palpable than on social network platforms such as Facebook and Twitter .

`` I would say that the constitution of Kenya that was put in place in 2010 has considered the scenario we are currently facing , '' said Charles Kanjama , a partner at Kenyan law firm Muma and Kanjama advocates .

At the center of the court case is the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission of Kenya -LRB- IEBC -RRB- which Raila Odinga accuses of failing to ensure a free and fair election and thus subverting the outcome of the presidential election . Electoral officials deny any voter manipulation , and the IEBS says it is confident that the final result was credible .

Kenyatta narrowly won the presidential poll , clinching 50.07 % of the vote , just breaking past the halfway mark needed for the victory .

For Kenya 's Supreme Court , the stakes are incredibly high -- there is the question of ensuring the country 's confidence in its institutions after the disputed 2007 election when some 1,000 people were killed after Odinga also lost that vote , claiming the election had been rigged . He later became prime minister in a power-sharing agreement .

The law gives the Supreme Court timelines within which it needs to arrive at a verdict . In this case , the court has until the Saturday of the Easter holiday to make a ruling .

Analysts in the Kenyan media are saying that if Kenyans across the political sphere can abide by their decision , no matter how it goes , then it will truly be evidence that the country has moved on .
