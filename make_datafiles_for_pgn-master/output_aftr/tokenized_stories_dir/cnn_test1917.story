-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Maria Cole , the widow of singer Nat `` King '' Cole and mother of singer Natalie Cole , died Tuesday after a short battle with cancer , her family said . She was 89 .

`` Our mom was in a class all by herself , '' her three children said in a statement Thursday . `` She epitomized , class , elegance , and truly defined what it is to be a real lady . We are so blessed and privileged to have inherited the legacy that she leaves behind along with our father . She died how she lived -- with great strength , courage and dignity , surrounded by her loving family . ''

`` There were refusals at hotels , there were places we 'd go he would n't let me get out of the car because they would go in first to see if we could get the rooms , '' Maria Cole told CNN in an interview last year . `` He did n't want me embarrassed with him . ''

She dealt with hatred from her neighbors when her family bought a home in Hancock Park , then an exclusive all-white neighborhood next to Hollywood , California , soon after her 1948 marriage .

`` There were no Jews or blacks there and they just almost had a stroke , '' she said . `` And I did n't care if they did . ''

Her husband , though , `` was not an activist , '' she explained .

Cole 's widow reflected on that comment in last year 's interview .

`` Is n't that a wonderful line ? '' Maria Cole said . `` Madison Avenue was afraid of the dark in so many ways . The fact that he was black , the fact that they just do n't seem to know what 's going on . ''

The show drew a who 's who of Hollywood stars -- entertainers who wanted to make the first national show with an African-American host a success .

Maria Cole was partial to the shows with the Mills Brothers and Ella Fitzgerald , who she said was `` the greatest singer , as far as I 'm concerned . ''

The failure to get a national sponsor left her husband `` very disappointed . ''

After a year , Cole decided to quit , she said .

In her last interview with CNN , in February 2011 , the 46th anniversary of her husband 's death , Maria Cole said she wanted fans to remember her husband for his talent .
