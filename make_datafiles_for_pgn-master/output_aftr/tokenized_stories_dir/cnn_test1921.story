-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sebastian Vettel led from start to finish to claim the Canadian Grand Prix Sunday to extend his title lead as he searches for a fourth straight Formula One world championship .

Lewis Hamilton , who started on the front row with Vettel in his Mercedes , claimed the final podium spot , overtaken in the closing stages by the charging Alonso , who had started sixth on the grid in his Ferrari .

It has left him 36 points clear of two-time champion Alonso in the title race . Kimi Raikkonen occupied third spot , a further eight points adrift .

Mark Webber battled a damaged front wing to claim fourth for Red Bull , who increased their lead in the constructors ' race over Ferrari .

Britain 's Paul Di Resta , adopting a one-stop strategy in the Force India , finished seventh with Felipe Massa in eighth for Ferrari . Adrian Sutil claimed the final point for Force India .

`` We had good races here before but it did n't come together to win , '' he said at the victory celebration .

Alonso , clearly the crowd favorite with the fans , who roared their appreciation as he overtook his old rival Hamilton for second , was pleased to limit his losses on Vettel .

`` I think second tastes of victory , because we scored some good points after a very difficult weekend . ''

`` We just have to keep pushing so we can get closer to these guys . ''

His old team McLaren suffered another disappointing race , with Sergio Perez and Jenson Button in 11th and 12th .

It was the first time McLaren has been out of the points in 64 races .

Young Finn Valtteri Bottas , who was a surprise third on the grid for Williams , also slipped back through the field to come home 14th , continuing his team 's pointless start to the campaign .
