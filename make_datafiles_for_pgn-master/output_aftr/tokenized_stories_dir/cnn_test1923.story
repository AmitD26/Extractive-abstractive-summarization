-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three people died Tuesday when a sweeping dust storm impaired visibility on a major interstate in Arizona and caused a chain-reaction of car accidents , according to the state 's Department of Public Safety .

Between 30 and 40 vehicles were involved in the Interstate 10 accidents , which also seriously injured five people , Officer Robert Bailey told CNN 's sister network HLN . A total of 14 people were hurt , DPS spokesman Harold Sanders told CNN .

`` There 's still a lot of carnage and mess out here , '' Bailey said .

Officers in patrol cars are managing rolling traffic breaks to slow traffic , Sanders said . Motorists should n't drive faster than 30 mph in the area or in the vicinity of any dust storm , he said . If a driver sees a dust storm ahead , the first step should be to get off the road , he said .

I-10 from Phoenix to Tucson gets hit by 10 to 20 dust storms per year , mostly during the summer monsoon season , said Ken Waters , warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix . But he would n't describe the Tuesday event as a storm , rather `` a case of very localized dust being picked up and thrown across the highway . ''

Waters gave credence to that theory , saying that winds were clocked at 15 to 20 mph , not as strong as in typical dust storms , in which winds reach 30 to 40 mph . But the area also had seen little rain in the past few weeks , he said , exacerbating the dust problem .
