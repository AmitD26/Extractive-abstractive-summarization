While not much happened in Friday 's hearing before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin , ultimately it could be big trouble for the singer .

In a court filing in February , prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the 180 days of community labor ordered when he pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge in the beating of his girlfriend Rihanna .

Mark Geragos , Brown 's attorney , said after the last hearing that the prosecutor 's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court .

Despite the serious allegations outlined in the court filing , the prosecutor is not asking for Brown 's probation to be revoked and the singer sent to jail . She is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer .

Brown and his mother were in court for Friday 's hearing , but Rihanna , who attended his last court date , was not there .

When the pop star sat behind Brown in court at that hearing , it was Rihanna 's second time in a courtroom with him . The first was the day in August 2009 when Brown was sentenced to five years ' probation and ordered to stay away from her . Then , she was a witness for the prosecution .
