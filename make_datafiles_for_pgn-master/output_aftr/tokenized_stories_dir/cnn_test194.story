Sydney , Australia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Could the leader of a democracy reverse his nation 's slide toward the ever more permissive use of firearms and mandate stringent new gun control laws in less than a fortnight ? Well , yes . One of America 's loyal allies did just that -- and with massive voter support .

In a popular tourist spot at Port Arthur , Tasmania , in April 1996 , a lone gunman killed 20 innocents with his first 29 bullets , all in the space of 90 seconds . This `` pathetic social misfit , '' to quote the judge in the case , was empowered to achieve his final toll of 35 people dead and 18 seriously wounded by firing semi-automatic rifles originally advertised by the gun trade as `` assault weapons . '' Now we discover that a similar military-style rifle enabled the Connecticut killer to add his name to the global list of gun horrors .

Polls : Your thoughts on gun control

Just like President Obama , Howard was seen to weep and to offer the nation 's prayers in the wake of another gun massacre . But only 12 days after the shootings , in Howard 's first major act of leadership and by far the most popular in his first year as prime minister , his government announced nationwide gun law reform .

Attitudes to firearms and the regulations governing them had changed almost overnight . After a decade of gun massacres which saw 100 people shot dead and 38 wounded , Australians had overwhelmingly had enough of anyone with a grudge gaining easy , mostly legal access to weapons designed expressly to kill a lot of people in a very short time .

In two nationwide , federally funded gun buybacks , plus large-scale voluntary surrenders and state gun amnesties both before and after Port Arthur , Australia collected and destroyed more than a million firearms , perhaps one-third of the national stock . No other nation had attempted anything on this scale .

It was n't without cost to John Howard . Self-interest groups among his conservative base raised hell , and at one rural meeting in a country town , he became the first Australian prime minister to be photographed wearing a bullet-proof jacket .

But with statements like : `` We do not want the American disease imported into Australia ... Guns have become a blight on American society , '' Howard knew he was speaking for most Australians . Polling at the time measured public approval of his government 's new gun laws at 90 to 95 per cent .

In the years after the Port Arthur massacre , the risk of dying by gunshot in Australia fell by more than 50 % -- and stayed there . In the 16 years since the announcement of legislation specifically designed to reduce gun massacres , Australia has seen no mass shootings . Gun deaths which attract smaller headlines are 80 times more common , yet the national rate of gun homicide remains 30 times lower than that of the United States .

To claim cause and effect would be to stretch all this too far . Mass shootings are such rare events as to defy prediction , gun death rates were already falling , and John Howard 's gun laws no more prevent every shooting than our traffic laws eliminate the road toll . The best we can say is that the results are encouraging , and suggest a way forward .

The obstructions to gun control are nothing new to public health . An industry and its self-interest groups focused on denial , the propagation of fear , and quasi-religious objections -- we 've seen it all before . Barack Obama , at the center of a maelstrom of clashing convictions few foreigners can comprehend , deserves our sympathy .
