Rome -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta resigned Friday after less than a year in office , according to a statement released by the Italian presidential palace .

The country 's President , Giorgio Napolitano , has accepted the resignation , the statement reads .

Letta , of the center-left Democratic Party , announced Thursday that he would be standing down , plunging the country into fresh political uncertainty .

The party then officially asked Letta to recognize the need to start a new phase , implying that he should resign .

There has been growing disillusionment with Letta in the past couple of months , with many feeling that reforms are moving too slowly and that he is failing to act decisively .

Renzi probably will be asked to form a government by Napolitano but it 's not yet clear whether he will be easily able to do so .

He has alienated many people on the left in his party but , as a perhaps more centrist leader , he has been able to pick up some disgruntled supporters of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .

Letta was sworn in last April at the head of a coalition government , formed after about three months of uncertainty following inconclusive elections .

Italy , the third largest economy in the eurozone , has had more than its share of political turmoil over recent years .
