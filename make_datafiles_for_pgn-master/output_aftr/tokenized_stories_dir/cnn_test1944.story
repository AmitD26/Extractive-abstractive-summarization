Welcome to a world where greens are `` whites , '' where snowplows -- not mowers -- groom fairways , and players swap snazzy pants and Pringle sweaters for ski jackets and mittens .

Like normal golf , the goal remains frustratingly simple and the rules are largely the same as they are on grass . But the obstacles are somewhat different as players battle a strange playing surface and the cold .

At Björkliden , a ski resort in Swedish Lapland which started offering snow golf last year , players can expect a warm welcome but a decidedly chilly round .

`` We are 250 kilometers to the north of the Arctic Circle . It can be anything from zero degrees Celsius down to -25 , but usually the average is around -10 , '' says Merja Bergwall , marketing and sales manager for Lapland Resorts , the company which manages Björkliden 's facilities .

Thin a ball at those temperatures and your poor hands may never recover . But for most the experience is a happy one , Bergwall says , with players enjoying clean , crisp air under frequently blue skies while mastering the art of driving , chipping and putting on snow and ice .

`` Summer golf has been here since the 1930s , but we wanted to do something for the wintertime , '' explains Bergwall .

Visitors pay 350 Swedish Krona -LRB- around $ 50 -RRB- for a round , which includes club hire and balls .

Tee times after dark are also available thanks to glowing golf balls -- and night golf also lets players witness one of nature 's most magnificent spectacles up close .

`` We want to keep the ` whites ' in the right condition to ensure a good standard of play , '' says Bergwall .

Engadin Golf Club in St. Moritz , Switzerland will welcome entrants to the 35th Snow Golf Cup later this month , and in March patrons of the annual Boerl and Kroff Snow Golf tournament will reconvene on Wispile mountain in Gstaad .

Other annual events are scheduled to take place in France and Austria , but 2014 will not see the return of the World Ice Golf Championships in Uummannaq , Greenland which has , since 2009 , fallen foul of the weather .

`` Global warming has made it more difficult to arrange the event as we ca n't rely on ice being formed on the fjord of Uummannaq -- the place where the event used to take place , '' Malik Milfeldt of Visit Greenland told CNN .

Happily for Björkliden , there have been no such issues with the weather so far and plans are in place for a weekend of competitions in late March , with the Scandinavian Snow Golf Masters forming the centerpiece .
