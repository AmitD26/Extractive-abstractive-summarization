-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- That Africans today so dominate distance running is in part testament to the career of Kipchoge -LRB- Kip -RRB- Keino .

Other athletes would win more golds , but few would win races and hold records at all distances from 1,500 meters to 10,000 meters .

Keino was 24-years-old before he competed at his first Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 where he finished 10th and fifth in the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters respectively .

In 1965 he broke two world records : the 3,000 m at Helsingborg in Sweden in seven minutes 39.6 seconds -LRB- his first attempt at the distance -RRB- ; and the 5,000 m in Auckland in 13 minutes 24.2 seconds .

His form looked good for the high-altitude games of Mexico City in 1968 , but stomach cramps forced him out of the 10,000 m with just two laps to go .

Born to run

But it was at the Munich Games of 1972 that the untrained Nandi tribesman from Kipsano , in the high plains of Kenya , proved he was born to run .

Yet , somehow he staved off challenges from his more experienced compatriot , Ben Jipcho , and Finland 's Tapio Kantanen , to win in an Olympic record time of eight minutes 23.6 seconds .

Keino will be remembered for two things : opening up the latent athletic talent of Africa and his disquieting natural ability to conquer all-comers in five distinct events .
