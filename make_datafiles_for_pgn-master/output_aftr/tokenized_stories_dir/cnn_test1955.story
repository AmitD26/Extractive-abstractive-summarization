`` We are determined to end this scourge , which is not just an affront to our two countries , but which has so often become a humanitarian disaster in the seas between our two countries , '' said Abbott during a joint press conference with his host .

Most of the boat 's occupants were from Lebanon and Iraq , officials said , while others came from Nigeria , Jordan and Iran . It 's believed they were heading for the Australian territory of Christmas Island .

`` The last thing I would ever want to do is anything that does n't show the fullest possible respect for Indonesia 's sovereignty , '' Abbott told Fairfax Radio . `` This is a broad and deep relationship which is going to get broader and deeper over time .

`` The last thing anyone should want is to have Australia 's relationship with Indonesia defined by this boats issue , which I am sure will be but a passing irritant . ''

OPINION : Australian parties in ` race to bottom ' on asylum seeker policy

Abbott has ordered a military-led border protection plan in response to an increased number of illegal arrivals by boat -- many of whom use Indonesia as a staging post in onward voyages into Australian waters -- and has told the Royal Australian Navy to turn back vessels when it is safe to do so .

Australia 's new Liberal-Coalition government argues that the tow-back policy would show criminal syndicates in Indonesia that it was serious about smashing people-smuggling operations .

Indonesia , however , has been cool towards the tow-back scheme which it sees as a violation of its sovereignty .

At a meeting in New York with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop last week , Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa warned that Indonesia would not accept violations of its borders , cautioning the Abbott government against taking any `` unilateral steps '' that would put the `` cooperation and trust '' between the two countries .

Ignoring a plea from Bishop to deal with the problem `` behind the scenes , '' Indonesia took the step of publishing details of the private conversation , a move seen by commentators as a blunt warning from Indonesia .

`` Asian diplomacy in particular is marked by understatement ... this is what makes it such an extraordinary development , '' Acting opposition leader Chris Bowen told ABC TV . `` It 's an unprecedented step by an Indonesian foreign minister , I ca n't recall an Indonesian foreign minister taking a step like this in relation to Australia ever before . ''

Indonesian researcher with Human Rights Watch Andreas Harsono told CNN that refugees were caught between harsher policies emanating from Australia and harsh conditions in Indonesia , which is not a signatory to international conventions on refugees .

`` Most of these boats are not seaworthy , many of them do not have GPS or other navigational equipment -- to tow them back into international waters is dangerous , '' he said . `` What Tony Abbott can do is to urge Indonesia to ratify the refugee conventions . ''

The figures also show that for the first time `` irregular maritime arrivals '' -LRB- IMA -RRB- , or boat people , for the first time outnumber arrivals by air -LRB- non-IMA -RRB- .

Despite the recent increases in the number of asylum seekers , Australia takes just 3 % of the world 's refugees , according to figures from the United Nations High Commission of Refugees .

The majority of asylum seekers arriving in Australia by boat were from Afghanistan in 2011-12 , with Iran , Sri Lanka and Pakistan the next largest groups .
