-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A French prosecutor investigating a ski accident in which former world champion racing driver Michael Schumacher was seriously injured said Wednesday that speed was not an important factor .

Police investigator Stephane Bozon said it was not possible to estimate Schumacher 's speed in terms of kilometers per hour , `` but this was the speed of a very good skier on a slope which was not very steep . ''

Another investigator , Benoit Vinneman , said Schumacher was traveling at `` a normal speed for an experienced skier . ''

Quincy ruled out problems with Schumacher 's skis , which he said were almost new . The piste , or ski run , also appeared to be correctly marked according to French standards , he said .

Family ask media for privacy

Schumacher hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while skiing in an area between two marked pistes , the prosecutor said , which catapulted him face first onto another rock . Schumacher ended up 9 meters -LRB- 30 feet -RRB- from the edge of the piste , he said .

Investigators have begun studying footage filmed on a small camera attached to Schumacher 's helmet , but further analysis is needed , Quincy said .

He said experts may be able to use it to determine Schumacher 's precise position in relation to the edge of the piste and possibly the speed at which he was traveling at the time of the accident .

Investigators are talking to family members , witnesses and others in connection with the Schumacher inquiry , he said .

However , his family wants the media to keep its distance and appealed Tuesday for privacy .

Schumacher is the most successful driver in Formula One history , driving for the Benetton and Ferrari teams and claiming a record seven world titles and 91 grand prix wins .
