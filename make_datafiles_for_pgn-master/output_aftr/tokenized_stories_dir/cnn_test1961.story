Shanghai , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Imagine China 's urbanization drive as SimCity on steroids .

The core objective of the video game is to build a metropolis while staying on budget and keeping residents happy .

China has done it on a massive scale over the last three decades , but with disappointing results .

`` You 've got 500 million people that have moved to the cities since 1980 , '' says James McGregor , Beijing-based author and chairman of the consultancy APCO Worldwide .

China 's urbanization drive started decades ago when 80 % of the population lived in the countryside .

Today , China has more than 160 cities with populations of a million or more , with an urban population of around 700 million that represents more than half the total population .

And yet , despite all the thoughtless construction and chaotic urban planning , China has managed to dodge at least one bullet : There are no miles of urban slums . There are no favelas dotting China 's cities .

His top priority ? Urban social welfare reform .

`` Li Keqiang 's new urbanization drive is mainly addressing those already in the city who are not fully integrated to the cities -- those not fully entitled for urban social welfare , '' says Tang .

The government recently announced planned reforms of the household registration system , or `` hukou , '' to gradually allow qualified migrants to receive benefits like education and healthcare in their new homes .

`` In certain cities like Shanghai you can have a points system to actually buy into the hukou system . ''

`` This is very sensitive , '' Tang tells me . `` For those people who already have an urban hukou , they may sell it if a market exists .

`` And for those who have n't got urban citizenship yet , if they sell -LRB- their rural land -RRB- and suddenly lose their job , they have no place to go . So the government is very cautious about this . ''

If land reform moves too quickly , China will lose its unique buffer for unemployment -- the migrant workers ' rural homes , where they can always go back to if they lose their jobs .

But on the other hand , the government acutely feels economic pressure to provide migrant workers with social benefits in their new homes .

`` The great social justice story of China is in order to grow you have to turn these migrants into full citizens and consumers . ''

Game on .
