-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You 're not imagining it : Airline seats are generally getting smaller .

But while many airlines have been slimming down their seats over the past few decades , we 've been bulking up . According to the World Health Organization , the global prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980 .

In the 1960s , a seat width of 17 inches was standard , and for a period in the 1990s and early 2000s , that grew to 18.5 inches with the introduction of the Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 .

Recently , however , airlines been filling planes to a capacity that Natarajan calls `` historic proportions . ''

Airbus ' view : ` Make 'em wider ! '

To fit in the extra seat , passengers are now facing a width that is 17 inches and in some cases as narrow as 16 inches , a state of affairs that has pushed airplane manufacturer Airbus to launch a new marketing campaign called `` it 's the seat . ''

In a call to action to make 18 inches the industry standard , Airbus partnered with the London Sleep Center . They tested a small sample of six adults and found that passenger sleep quality improved 53 % in the larger seats .

`` In the early days of jet travel , people were flying less frequently and over shorter distances . Also , due to a lower load factor , many had empty seats next to them , '' she said , adding that all of Airbus ' long-haul aircraft have been designed to accommodate 18-inch seats .

As for whether Airbus ' campaign will make any difference in years to come , it 's too early to tell , but many are n't convinced .

Making less feel like more

In the past couple of years , Recaro has been charged with the difficult task of making seats that are both more cramped and more comfortable . To achieve this effect , the company has slimmed down armrests to give more room for passengers ' hips and repositioned the literature pocket above the tray table to increase legroom .

Child-free zones on planes . Good or bad ?

Mainly , though , Recaro has replaced traditional foam with a netting material that adheres more to the passenger 's body . The result is that seats are thinner , so even if pitch is reduced , it feels as if there 's more legroom .

What you can do

`` We 've seen complaints that a number of airlines have started putting 10 seats across on the 777 . One customer wrote that he flew one leg of a journey on a 777 in a 17-inch seat and flew back in an 18-inch on an A380 . ` It felt like an upgrade , ' he wrote . ''
