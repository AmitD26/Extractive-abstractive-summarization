-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Stanislas Wawrinka has had little time to rest on his laurels after winning his first grand slam title but the new Australian Open champion rounded off a superb day for Switzerland as they took a commanding 2-0 lead over Serbia in a Davis Cup tie in Novi Sad Friday .

Wawrinka battled jet leg after the long haul flight from Melbourne -- where he had beaten Rafael Nadal in Sunday 's final -- to see off Dusan Lajovic 6-4 4-6 6-1 7-6 .

Serbia , beaten in last year 's final by the Czech Republic , is fielding a much-weakened team with both world number two Novak Djokovic and Janko Tipsarevic sitting out the World Group match .

`` In the second set I was just glad to take advantage and fight back . The most important thing is that I won the match in straight sets , '' Federer told the official Davis Cup website .

Wawrinka took the first set against world number 102 Lajovic , but was in trouble in the second as the Serbian leveled .

The new Swiss number one raced through the third set , but the fourth was again a struggle and he needed unforced errors from the inexperienced Lajovic in the tiebreak to close out the match .

`` It was a tough match and it was n't easy for me to come here after the last few weeks , '' Wawrinka said .

Philipp Kohlschreiber was in superb form as he thrashed Spain 's new boy Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 6-4 6-2 while Florian Mayer came out on top in a marathon battle against Feliciano Lopez to win 7-6 7-6 1-6 5-7 6-3 in just under four hours .

Holders the Czech Republic were involved in a tough battle with the Netherlands with Robin Haase beating Radek Stepanek 3-6 6-4 6-7 6-2 6-1 to put the Dutch ahead .

On the WTA Tour , top seed Maria Sharapova reached the semifinals of the Paris Indoor Open with a 6-2 6-2 win over Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium , who had beaten titleholder Mona Barthel of Germany in the first round .
