A twin-engine CASA C-212 , similar to the plane pictured , crashed in 2004 , killing all six on board .

In its November 2006 report on the crash , the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Blackwater provided insufficient oversight and guidance of the pilots involved in the 2004 crash . Dispatchers failed to ensure that pilots followed their flight plan and did not adequately track flights in the air .

`` You 're an X-wing fighter Star Wars man , '' an NTSB report quoted the plane 's co-pilot , Loren Hammer , saying during the flight -- a reference to the dizzying battle in the 1977 film .

`` You 're -LSB- expletive -RSB- right . This is fun , '' the pilot , Noel English , responded .

About eight minutes later , the plane slammed into the wall of the canyon , which was flanked by ridgelines that rose nearly a mile above surrounding terrain .

When an unidentified passenger asked about the plane 's route before the crash , flight mechanic Melvin Rowe told him , `` I do n't know what we 're gon na see . We do n't normally go this route . ''

English added , `` All we want is to avoid seeing rock at 12 o'clock . ''

English and Hammer had been in Afghanistan less than two weeks , the NTSB found .

He said a company e-mail stated the company had overlooked experience requirements `` in favor of getting the requisite number of personnel on board to start up the contract . ''

Prince said investigators concluded the crash in Afghanistan was not due to corporate error , but pilot error . He rejected Waxman 's contention that the pilots `` acted like cowboys . ''

`` We provided thousands and thousands of flight hours of arrival service since then , '' Prince said . `` Today , still , we 're flying more than a thousand missions a month . ''

Passengers on the flight included Lt. Col. Michael McMahon , the commander of a Hawaii-based Army aviation battalion ; and two members of his unit , Chief Warrant Officer Travis Grogan , and Spc. Harley Miller .

In a letter read to the committee , McMahon 's widow , Col. Jeannette McMahon , wrote the accident was the result of a `` gross lack of judgment in managing this company . '' Her husband 's unit had a great safety record , she wrote : `` It 's ironic and unfortunate that he had to be a passenger on this plane versus one of the people responsible for its safe operation . ''

The families of the passengers have filed suit against Presidential Airways and its related firms . Blackwater 's effort to dismiss the case is before a federal appeals court in Atlanta , plaintiff 's lawyer Robert Spohrer said .

The company has come under scrutiny over its work in Iraq , where government officials accuse its contractors of killing as many as 20 civilians in a September clash in Baghdad .
