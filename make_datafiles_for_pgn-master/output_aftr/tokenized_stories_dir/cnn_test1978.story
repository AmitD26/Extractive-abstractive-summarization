-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than a dozen Chinese activists have been detained by authorities in an apparent crackdown ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre .

Others have been placed under house arrest or questioned by police in what Amnesty International says is an attempt to prevent public commemorations of those who died on June 4 , 1989 .

Among those detained are five activists -- a human rights lawyer , two writers and two academics -- who were held by police on May 6 after attending a low-key seminar in Beijing to discuss the anniversary .

They were subsequently held on suspicion of `` picking quarrels , '' according to Amnesty .

Among them is prominent human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang , well known in the Chinese media for representing high-profile dissidents such as artist Ai Weiwei , and those detained in the now-defunct `` re-education through labor '' system .

On Thursday , Pu 's lawyer and neice , Qu Zhenhong , was also detained on suspicion of `` illegally obtaining personal information , '' according to Human Rights in China .

Pu took part in the student-led demonstrations in the summer of 1989 that ended in a tragic military crackdown on protestors in Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on June 4 of that year . An official death toll has never been announced but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to thousands .

William Nee , a China researcher for Amnesty International , said the arrests were `` distressing . ''

`` It is distressing when some middle-aged people had a small gathering in a private setting , trying to remember the people who died in Tiananmen Square ... that even this kind of low key-event with moderate people is not allowed in China right now , '' he said .

Signs of an apparent crackdown appeared when press freedom advocate Gao Yu and her son Zhao Meng were both taken away by authorities on April 24 . She was reported missing by rights groups after she failed to show up for the Tiananmen commemoration seminar in Beijing .

Another activist , Xie Wenfei , was arrested in Guangdong Province on the same day as the Beijing group , also on suspicion of `` picking quarrels , '' according to Amnesty International .

Others being held include former Tiananmen student leader Xu Guang , who was formally arrested in Zhejiang and charged with `` inciting subversion of state power . ''

Two more are under house arrest , including Ding Zilin , spokesperson for the Tiananmen Mothers group , while 10 had been questioned by police , according to Amnesty .

In another case with links to Pu , a Beijing-based journalist , Wu Wei , has been missing since May 7 . Wu frequently interviews Pu and her last microblog post discusses his case . She is widely believed to be in criminal detention , according to China Human Rights Defenders .

Moderates

Public discussion of the June 4 anniversary is still taboo in mainland China and it is never been publicly marked there , though an annual vigil is held in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong .

In the lead-up to the anniversary each year , many activists in China are typically held by police . But the recent detentions are unusual as the anniversary is still a month away and those targeted are considered moderates .

`` When you block the moderate channels you are pushing people to more extreme actions , '' said Maya Wang , researcher for the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch .

`` The government is detaining people who have acted as bridges between authorities and activists . It leaves the question of what authorities are able to tolerate and what avenues people have to complain . ''
