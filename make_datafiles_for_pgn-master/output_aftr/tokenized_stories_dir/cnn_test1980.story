Among the performers featured on the magazine 's March cover , an annual showcase for Hollywood 's best and brightest , are six actors of color : Chiwetel Ejiofor , Idris Elba , Michael B. Jordan , Lupita Nyong ` o , Naomie Harris and Chadwick Boseman . All starred in notable movies in 2013 , and two -- Ejiofor and Nyong ' o -- are up for Academy Awards .

They share the cover with some Hollywood royalty , including Julia Roberts and George Clooney .

2014 awards season : Does diversity matter more than wins ?

As Stewart notes , in years past , the magazine has been criticized for featuring a narrow branch of Hollywood talent -- usually a gathering of exquisitely made-up , mostly white , twentysomething and thirtysomething actresses .

The 2010 cover , which included a host of young female stars such as Anna Kendrick and Carey Mulligan , probably came in for the most criticism . That year , Jezebel tersely headlined its story , '' ` Young Hollywood ' Is White , Thin . ''

Vanity Fair has also been criticized for sexism , particularly the 2006 cover , which featured dressed-up fashion designer Tom Ford alongside the nude -LRB- and very pale -RRB- Scarlett Johansson and Keira Knightley .

'' -LRB- The cover shows -RRB- a healthy and interesting mix of celebrities on every rung of the star system , from the megastar Roberts to the emerging -LRB- Margot -RRB- Robbie , as well as more than just a group of white stars , '' he wrote .

`` Look at all these beautiful black people on the cover of Vanity Fair , '' wrote @MiaTheBoss .

However , some people said they believed the cover was n't diverse enough .

On Vanity Fair 's website , rmpfdx wrote , `` Black and white is not diversity . It 's easy tokenism . Where are the Latinos -LRB- who far outnumber blacks in this country -RRB- ? Where are the Asians ? Where are the Native Americans ? Hollywood always make sure to include one black and then forgets that other colors and ethnic groups exist too . This cover does n't inspire -- it sickens . ''

`` For the 20th annual Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue , the magazine celebrates a year of spectacular film with a group of distinguished actors , '' the magazine said .
