-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mother whose toddler died in a hot car near Atlanta last month says she finds comfort in faith but struggles to get through each day .

`` Leanna Harris is living every parent 's nightmare -- the child she bore and loved every moment of his life has died . For most parents , it is difficult , if not impossible , to comprehend such a thing .

`` But for Leanna , that nightmare is all too real . She will never again be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him , '' her attorney said Tuesday in a statement .

His death in a hot car tapped parents ' outrage , garnered national headlines , and sparked a wide-ranging debate about whether more can be done to prevent such deaths .

`` She asks that she be allowed to grieve in private without reporters calling , following or watching her home . Since his death , she has been unable to have that time of mourning that every bereaved parent needs . Please allow her the dignity to mourn her son in private , '' Zimmerman wrote .

` Constant speculation and innuendo '

Ross Harris has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty . He remains in jail .

Leanna Harris is not a suspect , although police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her boy .

For example , Ross and Leanna Harris took turns dropping off and picking up their son at day care , and on the day Cooper died , Leanna arrived and was told that Cooper had n't been dropped off that morning .

`` Ross must have left him in the car , '' she allegedly told day-care employees .

The day-care workers told police they tried to tell her that there could be a multitude of reasons that Cooper was n't dropped off , but she insisted that Ross left him in the vehicle , Cobb County police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a hearing for Ross Harris .

`` Reporters have delved into Leanna 's upbringing , her employment , quizzed people for information about her marriage , and her sex life . The constant attention has prevented her from returning to work , '' Zimmerman wrote .

`` Dealing with her grief has become more difficult as the days go on , however , in large part because of the constant speculation and innuendo in the media . Newspapers , television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in which Leanna 's every word , action and emotion -- or failure to cry in front of a crowd -- is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning . ''

` I miss him with all of my heart '

Leanna Harris told CNN at the beginning of the investigation that a lawyer had advised her not to speak to the media , so not much is known about her .

She did not testify at her husband 's probable cause hearing , but arrived before the proceeding began and took a seat with family members , holding hands with the woman sitting next to her .

Leanna Harris described the toddler as perfect and told how he changed her and her husband 's lives .

Leanna Harris said Cooper had had trouble sleeping of late , and he had slept with her and her husband the two nights before he died , `` snuggling in between both of us . ''

`` I remember turning over in the middle of the night . His mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face . I will cherish that moment forever . ''
