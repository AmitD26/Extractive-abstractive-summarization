-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In an age where many school children are ferried to school in their parents ' SUV , the idea of having to swim to school over open ocean or wade through muddy mangrove swamps to get to class might seem part of a cruel and long-forgotten past .

But in some of the fishing communities near Zamboanga City in the Philippines , swimming half a mile of open water in school uniform while carrying school books tied up in plastic bags on their heads is still a daily reality .

When Filipino blogger Jay Jaboneta , co-founder of Yellow Boat of Hope , learned about the situation on the sidelines of a conference in the southern Philippines province of Mindanao in 2010 he was shocked .

Getting to school at another remote community near Zamboanga del Sur required a three-hour walk around the snake-infested shoreline of a lake , even though the school was just 15 minutes by boat .

Often a family 's only boat would be out in open water fishing by 4 am and still at sea at around 7 am when the children began to go to school .

`` We heard reports of some children in the past dying simply trying to get to school , '' Jaboneta said .

The foundation is not only an example of a group of concerned citizens coming together to make a difference , but shows the power of social media to effect change .

Jaboneta said the project really sprang up out of one Facebook status he fired off after he heard about the situation at a bloggers ' summit in Mindanao almost four years ago .

The school boat program in Masbate , in particular , has been a stand out success for the foundation , where enrollments jumped from the seven exhausted swimmers that used to arrive each morning to 150 pupils that come by boat every day .

He said that that a lot of their funds are now earmarked for adding new classrooms onto the schools .

The Yellow Boat of Hope Foundation will soon be able to count a handful of college graduates among the alumni of its school boats program , showing the difference the addition of a simple wooden boat can make to the future of a whole community .

`` In Zamboanga , we 've got eight students at the state university doing their best to finish college and they 'll be the first in their community to ever do that . ''

`` Even if it took several hours by bus or even walking it is not as tough as these kids have it , '' he said . `` We often hear of kids that skip school to go swimming but here we 've got kids swimming so that they can go to school . ''
