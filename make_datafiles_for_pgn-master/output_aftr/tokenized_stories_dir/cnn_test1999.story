Oral arguments in the case will be heard by the justices Tuesday morning .

This case of toxic love has soap-opera elements , but Bond 's lawyers argued she was being treated like an international terrorist or a rogue state engaged in chemical warfare instead of someone caught up on the wrong end of a love triangle . They say she should have been tried in the state system , where Bond may have faced a simple assault charge and just a year behind bars .

The appeal barely made a ripple in local media and had been all but ignored until the high court first heard the issue two years ago . Now the sequel promises to answer larger questions of the limits on Washington 's power .

Bond , a native of Barbados , lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist . As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : `` Bond was excited when her closest friend , Myrlinda Haynes , announced she was pregnant . Bond 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , Clifford Bond , was the child 's father . She vowed revenge . ''

The woman -- known to her family as Betty -- struck back by putting her science training to ill use . The 42-year-old stole a dangerous chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine , to be exact -- from her company , and obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet . Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic , even lethal harm with very little physical contact . She then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox .

Bond claimed she never meant to kill Haynes , but only wanted to cause her `` an uncomfortable rash . '' The defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an `` emotional breakdown '' that made her act in such a shocking fashion .

When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed . She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution .

The Obama administration still believes Bond 's federal conviction was valid .

`` The Constitution does not prohibit federal prosecution in an area of overlapping federal and state authority , '' the Justice Department said in its brief to the high court , rejecting Bond 's assertion the treaty makes an exception for chemicals used for `` peaceful '' purposes that are not `` warlike '' in nature . `` No reasonable construction of that phrase would cover petitioner 's conduct . Petitioner 's deployment of highly toxic chemicals with the intent of harming Haynes can hardly be characterized as ` peaceful ' under that word 's commonly understood meaning . ''

The government says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can `` cause death , temporary incapacitation , or permanent harm '' to another person -- exactly what Bond did here .

Some see hope the right-leaning majority on the bench might use the opportunity to delve further into Act 2 of this legal drama -- the scope of the 10th Amendment , which states , `` The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ''

Many scholars and activists argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh , creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety . They see Bond as an unexpected hero in that fight to return `` the power back to the people . ''

And it is not just felonies . Areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulation , taxation , health care , and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of a high court decision .

As for Bond , the current legal fight will not provide her much practical benefit . She was released from a federal prison in West Virginia 14 months ago , so a second high court victory may only be symbolic .

She has not talked publicly about her case , but her trial lawyer says the husband is supporting Bond in the appeals . When last we checked , the couple was trying to overcome his infidelity and had been working to rebuild their shaky marriage . She had allowed him to visit her while she was incarcerated .
