Nicola Furlong , 21 , was found dead in a hotel room with one of the men , according to Tokyo police .

The men were not charged in Furlong 's death . Rather , police arrested the men on suspicion of improperly touching Furlong 's friend in a taxi early Thursday , as the four headed back to the hotel , authorities said .

Authorities would not say how the four ended up together , but Japanese media reported that the women were attending a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo when they met the men and decided to accompany them to their hotel rooms .

The hotel staff found Furlong unconscious after customers complained of loud noises coming from the room , police said .

The death is believed to be as a result of suffocation by cervical compression , police said .

`` Everyone 's a little devastated , '' in her close-knit rural community , which has only 300 or 400 families , he said .

Her parents last spoke to her the day she died , he said .

The U.S. State Department confirmed the arrests , but could not provide additional details , citing privacy concerns .

CNN 's Jamie Crawford , Randi Kaye and Bharati Naik contributed to the report .
