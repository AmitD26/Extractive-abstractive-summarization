Provocative , outspoken , manipulative , supremely confident , and utterly compelling .

The only thing lacking in the Portuguese 's first campaign back in charge at Chelsea was the usual glut of trophies .

But if you listened to the former Real Madrid and Inter coach opine on the English Premier League title race last season , his side was never in the running .

Despite managing a club owned by Roman Abramovich , who is worth a reputed $ 10 billion , Mourinho decried his team as the `` little horse '' in the scurry for the finish line .

Chelsea may have finished third last season , but Mourinho 's tactical prowess was still in evidence .

Not only did he propel the Londoners to home and away wins over eventual champion Manchester City , he did the same to Liverpool -- a morale-crushing 2-0 victory at Anfield in late April was the beginning of the end for the Reds ' title aspirations .

It was against the lesser lights Chelsea faltered , but with his squad now bolstered by yet more quality , Mourinho 's charges wo n't be as generous this time around .

MANCHESTER CITY

Champion twice in the past three seasons , City might have to play second fiddle to Mourinho and Chelsea in 2014-15 .

Manuel Pellegrini 's charges spent just 15 days at the top over the whole campaign ; the irony of this season may well see it spend more time at the summit without finishing as top dog .

City has raided Portugal to prise Fernando and Eliaquim Mangala from Porto , while goalkeeper Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini have arrived from Spain .

As ever , City 's success will hinge on its twin titans : midfielder Yaya Toure , who has resolved to stay at the club despite threatening to leave after he received a modest birthday present ; and prolific Argentina striker Sergio Aguero , who has signed a new five-year contract .

Verdict : Close but no cigar as City settles for second best .

MANCHESTER UNITED

Can Louis van Gaal transform Manchester United into a serious title contender by sheer force of personality alone ?

The great Alex Ferguson was able to , propelling his team to title success in his final season despite notable deficiencies in his squad .

But those holes remain -- not filled by David Moyes in his disastrous sole season in charge -- even if June 's purchase of Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao in Spain will add some much-needed creativity in the middle of the park .

Promising English left-back Luke Shaw has also been added for what many believe to be a vastly inflated sum , but the 19-year-old will miss the opening month through injury .

For all its limitations , this is still a team that boasts a strike force as lethal as they come .

And Robin van Persie 's four goals at the World Cup were crucial as Van Gaal led Netherlands to third place in Brazil .

ARSENAL

Promising Premier League campaigns have frittered away and shots at silverware squandered .

That is precisely what happened in the top flight last season . Arsenal spent 128 days atop the division in 2013-14 but suffered maulings at the hands of Chelsea and Liverpool as a familiar post-Christmas slump took hold .

A spike as spring emerged helped usher in Champions League qualification for the 17th straight year but then came a watershed moment in May -- an FA Cup triumph .

The purchase of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona after his fine World Cup with Chile has convinced many fans the Gunners can stay in title contention as 2014-15 reaches its business end .

In taking right-back Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle United , Wenger has replaced departing Frenchman Bacary Sagna with an equally competent compatriot .

Another couple of signings before the window shuts on September 1 could catapult the London side into the title reckoning , but a top-four finish should still be comfortable even without .

Verdict : A fast start before a predictable fade to fourth place for the third successive season .

LIVERPOOL

How do you replace Luis Suarez ? The simple answer is you ca n't .

Eight new arrivals means Liverpool 's options are now rich and plentiful but , as Tottenham found out so painfully when trying to replace Gareth Bale last season , it is rare they all hit the ground running .

Rodgers ' renowned man-management skills will be tested as he and aging captain Steven Gerrard attempt to bed the new arrivals into the Liverpool way .

Verdict : A fifth-place finish after a long winter of adjustment . .
