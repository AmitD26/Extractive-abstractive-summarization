More than 100 men from the mainly Muslim southern Philippines came ashore in the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo early last week demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that has historical claims on the area .

The Philippine government also urged them to come back to the country , saying it had n't authorized their voyage . There was no indication of a resolution to the standoff on Monday .

The men claim to be the Royal Army of the Sultanate of Sulu , which once encompassed Sabah , and say they do n't want their people to be sent away from the area , Malaysian authorities said . There are conflicting claims about to what extent the men are armed .

Eroded power

Over the weekend , comments appeared in the news media from representatives of the sultanate , whose power is now largely symbolic , saying that their followers who had gone to Sabah planned to stay where they were .

The sultanate 's claim to Sabah plays a long-standing and important role in the Philippine government 's relationship with the country 's Muslim minority and with neighboring Malaysia , said Julkipli Wadi , the dean of the Institute of Islamic Studies at the University of the Philippines .

But the encroachment of Western colonial powers , followed by the emergence of the Philippines and Malaysia as independent nation states , steadily eroded the sultanate 's power , according to Wadi .

It became `` a sultanate without a kingdom '' to rule over , he said . Sulu is now a province within the Republic of the Philippines .

But the sultanate has nonetheless retained influence over some people in the southern Philippines and Sabah who still identify themselves with it , according to Wadi .

The members of the sultanate 's royal family , although riven by internal disputes over who the rightful sultan is today , appear to have felt isolated by the provisional accord signed in October by the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front , which has fought for decades to establish an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines .

Kiram was cited by AFP as saying that the sultanate 's exclusion from the deal , which aims to set up a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims , prompted the decision to send the men to Sabah this month .

`` The whole aim is not to create conflict or initiate war , it is just to position themselves and make governments like Malaysia and the Philippines recognize them , '' he said .

The economic , cultural and historical links between Sabah and the nearby Philippines islands , as well as the porous nature of the border between the two , means that many of the Filipino men have friends and relatives in Lahad Datu .

But the historical connection still fuels tensions between Malaysia and the Philippines , with Manila retaining a `` dormant claim '' to Sabah through the Sultanate of Sulu , according to the CIA World Factbook .

According to the official Philippine News Agency , Manila still claims much of the eastern part of Sabah , which was leased to the British North Borneo Company in 1878 by the Sultanate of Sulu . In 1963 , Britain transferred Sabah to Malaysia , a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal .
