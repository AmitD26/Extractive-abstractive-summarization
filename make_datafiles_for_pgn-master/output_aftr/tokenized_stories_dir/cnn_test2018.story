-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al-Shabaab , an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia , most recently claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at Kenyan mall in September of this year and is suspected of many other attacks in Somalia . Here is a Q&A that looks at this group :

What is Al-Shabaab and what are its aims ?

The group is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers .

It has struck abroad , too . It was responsible for the July 2010 suicide bombings in Kampala , Uganda , that killed more than 70 people , including a U.S. citizen , as they gathered to watch a World Cup final soccer match .

How big is it ?

A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country .

A U.N. report identifies one insurgent leader who is `` believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters , '' most of them Kenyans .

Though Al-Shabaab 's size may be in doubt , its potential for sowing terror is not .

`` I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent , '' said Gen. Carter Ham in 2011 , when he was commander of the U.S. Africa Command .

Al-Shabaab 's predecessor was al-Ittihad al-Islami -LRB- AIAI -RRB- , which worked to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia . It was , in part , funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , according to the Council on Foreign Relations .

AIAI , which the U.S. State Department designated as a terrorist organization , strengthened after the fall in 1991 of Siad Barre 's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued .

That led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union -LRB- ICU -RRB- -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city .

Working together , the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu . That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there , according to the Council on Foreign Relations .

That move proved to be a turning point , one that radicalized Al-Shabaab , which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia , according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise , who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

What is Al-Shabaab 's relationship with Kenya ?

Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters , several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group .

The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities .

`` Remember Mumbai ? '' one tweet asked Saturday , as gunfire was erupting from Westgate mall in Nairobi . The comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 Pakistani men associated with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed several buildings in Mumbai , India , killing 164 people over a three-day period .

The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki , a U.S. citizen from Alabama . `` Away from your family , away from our friends , away from ice , candy bars , all those things is because we 're waiting to meet the enemy , '' he says .

But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift .

Al-Amriki , whose real name is Omar Hammami , said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab `` regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy '' and feared for his life . He was reported last week to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab . CNN is not able to confirm the report .

Sheikh Ahmed Matan , a member of Britain 's Somali community , said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training .

The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad .

How have Somalis been affected ?

Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped . In 2011 , the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle , and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas .

That year , the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world .

What is the United States doing ?

The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group .

It has also donated millions in aid .

What is the status of Somalia 's government today ?

In September 2012 , Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation , which had not had a stable central government since Barre 's overthrow 21 years before .

That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits . In January , French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group . The raid left the soldier dead , another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead .

But there has been political progress there .

In January , for the first time in more than two decades , the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government .
