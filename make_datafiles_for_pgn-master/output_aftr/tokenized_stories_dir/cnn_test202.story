Lawyer Peter Madden said , `` I intend to travel to Lima next week to attend the sentencing hearing , and after the sentence is handed down by the judge , it will be possible -LRB- to -RRB- make further comment . ''

Reid also pleaded guilty to the charges , according to a statement from the court .
