-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You never know what you 're going to find in an unused storage room . Employees at the National Institutes of Health , for example , recently discovered some old vials of variola .

The vials appear to date back to the 1950s , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which released a statement on Tuesday about the discovery .

When the scientists found the vials , they immediately put them in a containment lab and on July 1 notified the branch of the government that deals with toxic substances , called the Division of Select Agents and Toxins .

The CDC says there is no evidence that any of the vials was breached , nor were any of the lab workers exposed to the virus .

The CDC is one of only two official World Health Organization designated repositories for smallpox . The other is in Novosibirsk , Russia . The CDC let the WHO know about the find and invited the WHO to witness the destruction of the vials , which is the standard protocol any time anyone finds smallpox samples unexpectedly .

The FBI is investigating how the samples ended up where they did .
