Here are the key elements about this disturbing case :

What happened ?

Although final autopsy reports are n't yet in , it appears he died the same way at least 619 other children have died since 1998 , according to a study by a San Francisco State University researcher : his body got too hot and there was n't anyone there to cool him down . It 's a condition called hyperthermia .

`` Essentially what happens is that the body temperature gets so high that it begins to kill the cells , '' forensic pathologist and former medical examiner Vincent DiMaio told HLN . `` It 's like you 're cooking something . ''

While hyperthermia can strike anyone with enough exposure to heat , babies and small children strapped into rear-facing car seats are at particular risk , if a parent or caregiver forgets they are there . On an 80-degree day , a car can heat to an unsafe temperature in just two minutes , according to the National Weather Service , and the temperature can rise to 123 degrees in just one hour .

On the day Cooper died , the temperature peaked at 88 degrees .

So why is the father charged with murder ?

A subsequent affidavit released by the Magistrate Court of Cobb County may indeed support the allegation . The document states that when investigators interviewed Justin Harris , `` he stated that he recently researched , through the Internet , child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur . Justin stated that he was fearful this could happen . ''

Leanna Harris spoke in defense of her husband during Cooper 's funeral Saturday in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , Justin Harris ' hometown . Justin Harris spoke as well , by phone from jail , thanking attendees `` for everything you 've done for my boy . '' The family has not answered questions from the media . Neither has anyone close to the family . Of the numerous family and friends of Harris contacted by CNN , none would speak . Most said they had been advised not to .

Cooper 's obituary says the boy was `` loved and cherished and protected by both parents and all family members for his short 22 months of life . '' And on a now-closed change.org petition calling on authorities to drop the charges , several posts from people who said they know Harris spoke well of him . `` He has been nothing but a caring father and supporting husband , '' wrote one poster , identified as Michael Gordon of Northport , Alabama .

Justin Harris is being held without bond at the Cobb County jail after pleading not guilty last week . He 's scheduled for a preliminary appearance on July 3 .

Because he 's charged with murder , a grand jury will also have to review his case if the magistrate in an upcoming hearing finds probable cause for the charge to stand .
