-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She towers above him , but she ca n't do without him -- so much so they even email each other up to 75 times a day .

`` He knows everything that 's going on . He knows where I 'm going to be tomorrow , he knows where I am now , '' she told CNN 's Open Court show .

Then Eisenbud had a low-paying job liaising with young players ' parents at the Bradenton academy that IMG bought off Bollettieri , but now he 's Vice President of Tennis at the world 's leading sports agency -- having made a fortune not only for Sharapova but also China 's most bankable tennis star , Li Na , the No. 2 earner on Forbes ' 2012 female athlete list .

`` I just really try not to mess it up ! ''

Deal maker

His lucky day came on July 3 , 2004 when the 17-year-old Sharapova stunned Serena Williams -- and the tennis world -- in the Wimbledon final to win her first grand slam title .

They might make something of an odd duo , with the glamorous Sharapova standing at 6 foot 2 inches and Eisenbud , a short , balding man from New Jersey , but as a business partnership they have the perfect synergy .

`` I think that 's one of the greatest things that I appreciate in people , and he 's done that from the very beginning . He understood the dynamic of me being the athlete , of working for me .

`` Agents have much bigger jobs than just everyday life -- booking planes , looking into your agenda -- of course he 's trying to make you money and make you big deals , but at the end of the day , he does everything for me .

`` He has this old-fashioned calendar and just looks at every date . He knows my schedule , exactly when I 'm flying to this tournament , when I 'll be back , when we can fit this in .

`` He knows my training hours so there are some things that I prioritize over others , and there are certainly some shoots creatively that I would like to do and he 's like , ` We just do n't have time for it ' , so I have to ax that out , but we usually agree on many things . ''

`` He 's constantly looking at his BlackBerry ... if you need to get his attention , you should probably send him an email . That 's the way I see our relationship , '' she said .

`` That 's not his forte . His thing is getting on the phone , getting deals done , getting the schedule together . All those business decisions , so there are things that I know I need to bring in other people for . ''

Super agent

From clothing and cosmetics to her latest foray -- a self-funded candy line -- Sharapova has a strong business strategy .

`` If I did n't want to play tennis again , I 'd have enough money to live for the rest of my life but I do respect the money that I 've made because I did n't grow up having a lot of money , '' said Sharapova , whose parents fled their native Belarus soon after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident , just before she was born .

Her father accompanied her to the United States in 1994 , taking low-paying jobs before she enrolled at the $ 35,000-a-year IMG academy on a scholarship , aged nine .

`` I was living a normal , average , everyday life back in Russia and we had a dream and I had a talent and we moved to the U.S.

`` Of course I 'm so lucky and fortunate to have and earn great money but at the end of the day , we did earn it with my parents and their hard work and their sacrifices and all the hours on the court . ''

He 's been there from her early highs , to the lowest of the lows when it seemed a shoulder injury would end her career back in 2008 .

`` It 's pretty hard for me . I know too much information that other people do n't . I know what 's on the line , where we are with different things and what wins would mean , so I get a little nervous . ''

With Li also earning big deals , Eisenbud is akin to football 's `` super agents '' such as Jorge Mendes , who works with Cristiano Ronaldo and Jose Mourinho .

`` Rather than competing against one another , Sharapova and Na actually provide Eisenbud 's business with much greater global coverage , '' British sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN .

`` However , as brands , they are significantly different propositions , which means that they are likely to appeal to different groups of people in different countries around the world . ''

It was last year 's French Open success that really crowned Sharapova 's comeback , having been written off after a long struggle to rebuild her career following that shoulder operation .

`` If I 'm seeing it I 'm sure she 's seeing it , so when she was able to win that -- get on her knees and win that French Open -- that was just a lot of , ` I told you so ' and ` do n't count me out . '

`` Here 's a great champion that had all the money in the world , all the glory , all the titles , but she wanted to come back and win , and it just says a lot about her . ''

`` Everything we 've been doing now for the last couple of years has been thinking about life after tennis . We did n't want her career to end and then all of a sudden start thinking about it .

`` I think Sugarpova will be a huge business for her after tennis . She 'll be getting into a lot of different things -- cosmetics , fragrance , clothing -- so I think it 's just the beginning right now for her . ''
