-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man who roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends escaped prosecution after authorities in New Zealand determined the animal was killed humanely .

`` They had had the dog for a while , but the man told us his wife was getting tired of the dog . He was becoming a pest , '' Halliday said .

The family is from Tonga where eating a dog is not uncommon , Halliday said .

`` He did n't think he was doing anything wrong , '' he said . Is eating dog meat acceptable ? Sound Off below

The man , Halliday said , struck the dog in the head with a hammer , rendering it unconscious . He then slit its throat .

`` That is the normal way -- if one can use that word -- that animals are killed all over the world , '' Halliday said .

And under New Zealand 's Animal Welfare Act , it is legal to kill an animal if it is slaughtered swiftly and painlessly .

Dr Malakai Koloamatangi , a Tongan cultural expert from the University of Canterbury , told CNN affiliate TVNZ that dog meat is a delicacy enjoyed mostly by young men in his homeland .

`` It 's appalling , '' said Gracie Williams of Auckland . `` As an animal lover , I am sickened . The law needs to be changed . ''

Auckland Mayor John Banks , an animal rights activist , told reporters that rather than a new law , what is needed is better education of local customs .

`` We talked to the people . We told them that although it 's not against the law , it is against the general culture of the country to actually kill and eat your own pet dog , '' Halliday said .
