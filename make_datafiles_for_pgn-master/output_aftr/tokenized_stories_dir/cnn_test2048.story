He is challenging Missouri 's decision to use the drug pentobarbital in its lethal injection protocol , arguing it would violate the Constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment .

An intimate discussion with a serial killer

`` Given the irreversible nature of the death penalty and plaintiffs ' medical evidence and allegations , a stay is necessary to ensure that the defendants ' last act against Franklin is not permanent , irremediable cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment , '' Laughrey wrote .

The state is appealing both stays to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .

Defense attorney Jennifer Herndon said that she expects that court will rule within the next day .

The execution warrant window is 24 hours , meaning that if the court rules against the stays , Franklin could still be put to death on Wednesday .

Franklin had been scheduled to be put to death shortly after 12 a.m. Wednesday -LRB- 1 a.m. ET -RRB- at the state prison in Bonne Terre , Missouri , about 60 miles south of St. Louis . But Missouri and other states that conduct executions have had to scramble for new drugs after European-based manufacturers banned American prisons from using their drugs in executions .

Missouri had planned to use propofol , the surgical anaesthetic made infamous by the death of pop star Michael Jackson . But Gov. Jay Nixon reversed that decision after being warned the European Union -- whose members forbid capital punishment -- might halt shipments of the drug , leading to shortages for medical purposes .

In October , the state announced it would use pentobarbital , which would be provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy . Franklin 's lawyers argued that would raise the risk of contamination and a painful death .

Nixon denied clemency for Franklin on Monday , arguing Franklin had committed `` merciless acts of violence , fueled by hate . ''
