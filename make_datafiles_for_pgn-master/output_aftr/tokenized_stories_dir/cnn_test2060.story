-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 1.2 billion usernames and passwords hacked . Is this truly scary or corporate fearmongering ?

My immediate response was : Yeah , so ?

While 1.2 billion is a big number , it appears that many of these credentials could have been obtained from previous large-scale breaches such as Adobe , Sony , LinkedIn , RockYou.com and eBay . The totals from these sites alone adds up to close to half a billion .

We can also assume that many of the 420,000 hacked websites were Mom and Pop blogs , forums and other places where people often consider using a `` throwaway '' password . The concept is that things like your email , social media and bank require secure , unique passwords . But all the other junk in our lives can just use a simple , less secure password .

The criminals do n't have the passwords in most cases . They have cryptographic representations of the passwords known as hashes . These hashes come in a lot of varieties with varying degrees of security associated with them . The purpose of a hash is to slow down an attacker from being able to acquire your password if a password database is stolen .

But the hashes bring out the truth of the matter . The criminals do n't necessarily even have your password . They have a hash that could result in them discovering your password , especially if it is poorly chosen like password123 or qwrtyasdfg .

Many of these stolen hashes may have been obtained some time ago , which means they are less useful to the crooks now . Of course , we do n't know the truth and ca n't analyze what is known because Hold Security is trying to figure out how to monetize the knowledge , leaving even the experts a bit in the dark about how serious a discovery this truly is .

My advice ? Keep calm and carry on . It is always a good practice to use strong passwords and different passwords on the different sites we use and change them if we have reason to believe they might be compromised .

Hold Security 's findings are interesting . If the research community gains access to the information we will all jump in with both feet to determine how it happened , what it means for Internet security going forward and possibly even who is behind the attacks .
