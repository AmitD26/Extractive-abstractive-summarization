-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Dunn will stand trial for the shooting of Jordan Davis -- again .

When a Jacksonville jury failed to reach a verdict on the first-degree murder charge last February , they gave Florida State Attorney Angela Corey the opportunity for a do-over , and she 's taking it .

While the first jury hung on the murder charge involving Davis ' death , they did hand down a guilty verdict on three counts of attempted second-degree murder in the firing of shots at Davis ' companions . The minimum mandatory sentence will be 60 years , which , for a 47-year-old man , is a life sentence . So if Michael Dunn , who had complained about the volume of music coming from Davis ' SUV , is already sentenced to life in prison , why bother with another trial ?

Because it 's the prosecutor 's prerogative . We 've charged prosecutors with the authority to look at cases and to prosecute those they believe can result in a conviction , based upon the facts and the applicable law . We expect prosecutors to move forward with all viable cases , not just the ones they like . In that sense , if Angela Corey feels her case is strong enough to get a conviction , pursuing the case is not just her right ; it 's her obligation .

To a prosecutor , a hung jury could be a signal that a case is still winnable , or that , having put on their best case , they could n't convince a jury of the defendant 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . If the prosecutors have taken the time to polish and focus their witnesses ' testimony , or reframe opening and closing arguments , or adjust the presentation of evidence -LRB- and they will certainly do all of these things -RRB- , then they may get a different result . Perhaps the real message the hung jury sent was `` try harder . ''

Angela Corey , as an elected official , may have other motivations for moving forward with a retrial . The Dunn case unquestionably has social and political overtones as it is one of several recent cases where a young , unarmed black man has been killed . For many , the Dunn case raises civil rights issues -- and some feel a decisive verdict in this case will have broader implications .

And if Corey is politically motivated in retrying the Dunn case , it will not be the first time , in my view . Corey 's decision to waive a grand jury and charge George Zimmerman with second-degree murder during an election year was politically expedient -- especially by a politician who wanted to placate her black constituents . But she promised a conviction she could never deliver .

But the jury -- if it 's a fair and impartial jury -- wo n't concern themselves with the politics of the case . They 'll be asked to render a verdict based upon only the evidence presented in court , and they 'll be asked to set aside other factors , such as the broader social considerations . They will have one job : to determine whether the state proves , beyond a reasonable doubt , that Michael Dunn did not have reasonable fear of imminent great bodily harm when he fired the shots that took Jordan Davis ' life .

Essentially , the trial will be asking the jury to peer into Michael Dunn 's heart and determine if they see hatred or if they see fear . Hatred yields a conviction ; fear justifies an acquittal .

My hope is that , regardless of the verdict in Dunn , and regardless of the result in Ferguson , we can find a way to augment a constructive conversation about the true nature of America 's racial divide , a conversation that gives us the courage and understanding to do something about it together . Fault does not rest solely on one side of the divide or the other ; rather , it is a national problem , and will only be resolved if we face it , and conquer it , as a nation .
