In 1973 , England prepared for a crucial World Cup qualifier against Poland , a team hidden behind the Iron Curtain of communism which had provided little footballing resistance in the recent past .

The East Europeans had n't qualified for an international tournament since before the World War Two . Their players were unknowns , presumed inferior .

England , on the other hand , had won the World Cup on the very same Wembley pitch they were about to play on just seven years earlier . It was a team of stars coached by Sir Alf Ramsay . It was to be a cake walk .

It was a phrase that followed Clough for the rest of his career . In front of 100,000 England fans , Poland held on to a 1-1 draw . `` The Clown '' had the game of his life and England failed to make it to West Germany 1974 .

Euro 2012 : By the numbers

`` I remember every action of the goalkeeper , the anger of the England team that was n't able to win and the spectacular counterattacks . ''

While many consider the 1974 World Cup as the great coronation which announced the arrival of the Dutch and Rinus Michel 's `` Total Football , '' Poland excelled with equal creativity .

While Tomaszewski went from clown to being considered one of the best goalkeepers in Europe , up front the Poles had the legendary Gzegorz Lato . He would go on to score eight goals , winning the Golden Boot along the way .

They went all the way to the semifinals against West Germany . Poland lost that game 1-0 in treacherous conditions before winning the third-place playoff against the holders Brazil .

`` I can remember one game where I 've always maintained we beat a team which was fundamentally better than us . In fact , it was definitely the best team in the competition and still did n't win the World Cup . I mean Poland in 1974 , '' the legendary Real Madrid and Germany defender Paul Breitner told FIFA 's website .

`` They had a better team at that World Cup than Germany , Holland , Brazil , or anyone else for that matter . The Poles had the best team in 1974 . ''

`` It 's a way of kicking the Dutch ! '' laughs Wilson when asked about Breitner 's comments , referencing the fierce footballing rivalry between the Germans and the Dutch .

Heavily influenced by the tactical revolution taking place in the Netherlands and the Soviet Union , he took Poland to the 1972 Olympics and won gold there , nurturing a fast , counterattacking team and bringing through players like Lato , Kazimierz Deyna and Wlodzimierz Lubanski .

`` He seems to have been a very avuncular figure , a real father figure , '' explains Wilson . `` He actually involved them in the decision-making process .

`` Communism needed a vigorous hierarchy , you could n't questions things or speak spontaneously . But Gorski encouraged that , the balance of authority and respecting views . ''

One player who was brought into the Poland team by Gorski was Boniek . It was one of his final acts as coach .

`` He is the symbol of Poland , '' Boniek told CNN . `` He was the first coach that made us believe -LRB- we coul -RRB- -RSB- rise to world levels . He was a hero and now that he 's gone he has become a legend . ''

The 1978 World Cup in Argentina will always be tainted with the accusations of corruption leveled at the ruling Junta . Boniek too felt that Poland 's cause was n't helped by having to play the hosts .

`` The Poland team of 1978 was the greatest Polish team of all time , '' he believes . '' -LRB- But -RRB- we ended up politically in a very difficult ground . Argentina played at home and for that reason it was very protected . ''

After a strong start , topping a group ahead of West Germany , Poland headed into the second pool phase where Argentina thrashed Peru 6-0 .

At the 1978 World Cup , the two top teams in each group contested the final and that controversial result , coupled with losses against the hosts and later Brazil , made it impossible for Poland to qualify .

Yet the team bounced back for the 1982 World Cup in Spain where Boniek made his name , scoring a hat-trick against Belgium . Poland again finished third at what is today regarded as one of the greatest World Cups of all time .

`` Let 's say that the match against Belgium is my business card , '' says Boniek . `` We were compact , a great group . There were n't those champions of '74 and '78 but we played great football . ''

It was more than just football that was changing in Poland .

The late 1970s and early 1980s saw the emergence of Lech Walesa , a Polish dock worker whose Solidarity trade union movement would rise from the Gdansk shipyards on the Baltic Sea and strike the first nail into communism 's coffin .

`` Communism had a great impact on the football , '' explains Michal Zachodny , a Polish football journalist and prominent blogger .

`` Look at each -LRB- local -RRB- club and every single one of them was supported by a factory , local branch -LRB- of the Communist Party -RRB- , police , army . It was very influential . It -LRB- football -RRB- was almost a fight between the authorities . ''

`` The communist regime always wanted to put its face on every sporting success , '' recalls Boniek . `` But we wanted to play football and so we were n't interested in this . ''

They would not make another World Cup for 16 years .

But now Poland is preparing to host its first major international tournament since the fall of communism .

For the Poles , Euro 2012 is something of a coming of age party , a chance to show the world it has moved on from its communist past .

`` Poland is not becoming a leading European nation , '' says Boniek . `` Poland already is a -LRB- leading -RRB- European nation , 100 % . For some aspects it could be a model for other nations . ''
