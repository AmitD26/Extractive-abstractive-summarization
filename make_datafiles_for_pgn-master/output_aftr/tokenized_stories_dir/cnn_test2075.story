-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The national policy that set a minimum legal drinking age of 21 is being questioned by a group of 135 college and university presidents through an effort called the Amethyst Initiative .

In a September 16 commentary on CNN.com , Amethyst Initiative leader John McCardell , a former president of Middlebury College , proposes lowering the drinking age , which he suggests will lead to less drinking and related problems among college students .

In the 1970s when many states reduced their drinking ages , drinking-related deaths among young people increased . When the drinking age of 21 was restored , deaths declined . This effect is not simply a historical artifact explained by advances in safety technology and other policies .

New Zealand recently lowered the drinking age based on many of the same arguments advanced by the Amethyst Initiative . The result was more alcohol-involved traffic crashes and emergency room visits among 15 - to 19-year-olds . New Zealand is now considering raising its drinking age . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that setting the drinking age at 21 saves the lives of 900 young people each year and has saved more than 25,000 lives since 1975 .

It was on the basis of compelling research evidence about its lifesaving benefits that a bipartisan effort created Public Law 98-363 , `` The National Minimum Legal Drinking Age Act '' in the first place . Subsequent research has strengthened the evidence . College students who are underage , for example , binge drink less than students aged 21-23 .

Panels of experts , convened separately by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have studied the evidence on the age-21 law and concluded that it is effective public policy . Rather than lowering the drinking age , they recommended bolstering the law by closing loopholes in state law and strengthening enforcement .

There is a silver lining to the call for reopening discussion on the minimum legal drinking age . While some college presidents have signed on to the Amethyst Initiative , most have not .

These recommendations for college and community leaders included creating systems for reaching individual students with effective interventions , implementing , publicizing and enforcing laws to prevent alcohol-impaired driving and underage drinking , restrictions on alcohol retail outlets , increasing prices and excise taxes on alcoholic beverages , and responsible beverage service policies at on - and off-campus venues . Few colleges and their communities have even begun the steps needed to enact these efforts .

State and local legislators need to pass tougher restrictions and provide resources for enforcement . Lobbying legislators to dismantle the effective drinking age law is a step in the wrong direction .
