During the past 28 days , 36.7 million U.S. fans have engaged with the World Cup 's online properties , a spokesman for the organization said . That 's 11.2 % of the country 's population and has accounted for 23 % of the total activity .

But as the U.S. men 's team played its way out of a tough opening-round group that included Germany , Portugal and Ghana , U.S. Web users spent a total of 847 years and 143 days engaged with FIFA content .

That 's more than soccer-crazy rivals Brazil , Germany , England and France combined .

Part of all that may be American fans working hard to catch up .

A look at the 10 most active states reveals some no-brainers and some surprises .

California and New York rank No. 1 and 2 , respectively , in terms of visits to the World Cup website and time spent there .

But Texas , where American football , from `` Friday Night Lights '' to the Dallas Cowboys , borders on a religious sacrament , has been No. 3 .

It 's worth noting that U.S. team captain Clint Dempsey hails from Nacogdoches , Texas .

Florida , Illinois , New Jersey , Washington , Georgia , Massachusetts and Virginia round out the Top 10 .

This year 's World Cup is already poised to shatter records as the biggest social-media and Internet event ever .
