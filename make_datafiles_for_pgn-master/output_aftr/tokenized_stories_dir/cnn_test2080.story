-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ray Rice is out of a job . An increasing number of critics think National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell , the man in charge of disciplining the star player , should be next .

The commissioner told CBS News on Tuesday that he was sickened by what he saw on a newly released video that showed Rice knocking out his now-wife with a ferocious punch , but insisted that Monday was the first time he or anyone in NFL headquarters had seen the full scope of the February incident .

He also deflected criticism of his handling of Rice 's case and his initial lenient penalty for the Baltimore Ravens running back 's act .

When asked did he really need to see a video of the brutal knockout punch to decide on the length of Rice 's punishment , the commissioner said , `` No . ''

The new footage from inside an Atlantic City hotel elevator prompted Goodell to suspend the veteran player indefinitely .

It also made many sports commentators even angrier about the league 's botched reaction to the incident -- an initial two-game suspension for Rice -- something Goodell has admitted he did n't get right .

`` Mr. Goodell 's ineptitude has not merely rendered this football season meaningless and irrelevant by contrast , it has not only reduced supporting or watching football to a distasteful , even a disrespectful act , but most importantly it has comforted the violent and afflicted the victim , '' Olbermann opined Monday .

`` His push to increase NFL punishment of domestic abusers to roughly that one-third that of repeat pot smokers , his decision today to suspend Rice indefinitely , after the Ravens had fired him , are elements of classic tragedy , wherein the right thing is finally done only after it 's too late to matter . ''

`` Roger Goodell is powerful . He is connected . He has unlimited resources at his disposal . He can make things happen . He did n't do his job . He failed in epic proportions , '' Rosenfels wrote .

In a tweet , the former player wrote of suspending Rice indefinitely : `` Roger Goodell made $ 44 million last year to make really difficult decisions . This was an easy one . ''

The criticism intensified after the new video surfaced Monday .

Goodell told CBS that he was n't going to step down and that criticism was an everyday part of the position .

Did NFL do what it could to see video ?

While the league said it never saw the new video until it was posted online , many question whether the NFL tried hard enough to view it before Monday .

TMZ ran a story Tuesday , citing anonymous sources , saying the NFL never asked the casino for the video , and had it asked , the video would have been handed over .

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that security for Atlantic City casinos is handled by New Jersey State Police .

Coy Wire , a former NFL player-turned-Fox sports analyst , told CNN that he doubted the NFL was unaware of the TMZ video .

The NFL should have done more to find it , he insisted . `` There should have been a way for them to find out , '' he said . `` And if not , well then , they need to hire someone from TMZ to do the investigative services for them because I think that 's absurd .

`` For them to not make a concerted effort to find out what really happened inside the elevator , it baffles me . ''

Former Ravens offensive lineman Wally Williams said that he agrees . `` They -LRB- the NFL -RRB- are just trying to save themselves on this one , '' he said . `` I think they all had an opportunity to see this video . ''

In June , Goodell met with Rice and his wife at the NFL office in New York to hear their versions of what happened . Janay Rice reportedly sat beside her husband as she described what happened .

After hearing that and taking another month to evaluate the evidence the league had gathered , Goodell suspended Rice for two games of a 16-game season . He also was to forfeit a third game 's pay -- reportedly a total of $ 529,411 .

Goodell , however , told CBS it would be possible for Rice to make an NFL comeback if the running back proved he had addressed the domestic violence issue and that he had paid a price for his actions .

Former NFL player London Fletcher 's message of disappointment was retweeted more than 1,800 times .

'' @nflcommish to say you got that wrong is an understatement . Very disappointed in you . Wow ... unbelievable . ''
