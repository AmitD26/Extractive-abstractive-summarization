But for vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan and his wife Janna , political dissimilarities were enough to land them an article in The New York Times .

Of course , the Ryans are n't the first couple to agree to disagree politically in the name of love . Political strategists James Carville and Mary Matalin famously butted heads on the campaign trail , then stunned America when they fell in love , got married and raised a family .

It may surprise those of us who are in agreement with our partners -- or who ca n't imagine dating a Republican or Democrat -- but political differences can actually be a benefit to some relationships .

`` If a couple who does n't share political views has a healthy relationship , then that speaks to other strengths , '' says psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert , author of `` Be Fearless : Change Your Life in 28 Days . ''

`` For example , they may have good communication and conflict resolution skills , a healthy sex life , shared goals , and similar interests -- all of which are possible even if their politics differ . ''

But how does that conflict play out in the bedroom ? Democrats and Republicans may be able to agree to disagree , but their differences appear to continue between the sheets .

`` Orgasm , particularly among women , takes practice and knowing one 's body , '' suggests Justin Garcia , a postdoctoral fellow at The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction and a co-researcher on the study .

`` Conservatives tend to be more traditional and rigid . So , it reasons that this might also manifest in the bedroom -- once they 've found something that works , they stick to it ! ''

For example , the liberal Democrats surveyed placed more importance on sense of humor , independence and equality in a partner , while conservative Republicans were more likely to seek out someone of the same background and political party and were more apt to want to get married .

Overall , such fun facts make for excellent cocktail party fodder , but they may not have much of an impact on real relationships .

`` The interesting message from this survey is that , regardless of political affiliation , almost everyone in America recognizes the importance of love and sex , either in their lives or the world around them , '' Garcia says .

`` Do n't define yourself by your political affiliation . You 're a husband , a wife , a brother , a sister , a daughter , a son , '' he says . `` Use the different opinions to learn something new . With every political view is a possible discussion where you can learn about your partner . Set ground rules about when to argue -- and know when to walk away . ''

The opinions expressed are solely those of Ian Kerner .
