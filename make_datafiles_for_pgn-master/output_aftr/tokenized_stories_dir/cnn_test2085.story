-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Thursday in Tampa , U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel presided over a change of command ceremony during which Adm. William `` Bill '' McRaven handed over the reins of Special Operations Command to his successor , Gen. Joseph Votel .

As McRaven stepped down he observed , `` We are in perilous times . '' He pointed out that U.S. Special Operations Forces are helping to fight the fast-growing Islamic State in Iraq ; the al Qaeda-linked Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines ; the militant group Boko Haram in Nigeria , and al Qaeda and the Taliban in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region .

McRaven also said , `` We are in the golden age of Special Operations '' in which elements of the 67,000 men and women under his command have deployed to 92 countries .

Now , after more than 3Ã‚ 1/2 decades working in the world of special operations , Bill McRaven , 58 , is retiring . In his next incarnation he will become chancellor of the University of Texas .

As Hagel pointed out in his speech on Thursday that celebrated McRaven 's storied career , no one has written McRaven 's full history , but if it ever was to be written it `` would need to be heavily redacted '' because so much of it took place in the `` black '' -LRB- secret -RRB- arena .

Hagel pointed out in his Thursday speech that McRaven also has `` literally written the book on Special Operations . '' Indeed , McRraven 's 1995 book , `` Spec Ops , '' is the standard text on the subject .

For his book , McRaven interviewed many of the key participants in the raids that he examined , and he traveled to the sites of the operations .

After a careful investigation of each raid , he identified six common principles that had made these operations a success : repetition , surprise , security , speed , simplicity and purpose .

-- Security meant confining the knowledge of the operation to a small circle .

-- Speed meant that `` relative superiority '' over the enemy needed to be achieved in the first few minutes of the attack , and that the entire mission should be completed in no more than a half-hour .

-- Purpose meant that the soldiers were completely committed to the mission .

But McRaven 's influence on `` spec ops '' goes far beyond just the book he wrote . McRaven helped establish a curriculum at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California . And after taking up a job in the White House just weeks after 9/11 , he became one of the principal authors of the Bush administration 's counterterrorism strategy .

During the Iraq War , McRaven led the shadowy Task Force 121 , which tracked down Saddam Hussein in December 2003 . Much of the public credit for Saddam 's capture went to conventional army units , but it was , in fact , the Special Operations forces under McRaven 's command who did much of the work to find the Iraqi dictator .

Rescue of Capt. Phillips

The SEALs had taken up positions on the fantail of the Bainbridge and were carefully monitoring Phillips and his captors . One of the pirates had just pointed his AK-47 at the American captain as if he were going to shoot him .

That 's when the SEAL team commander on the Bainbridge ordered his men to take out the pirates . Three U.S Navy SEAL sharpshooters fired simultaneously at the pirates from a distance of 30 yards in heaving seas at nightfall , killing them all .

It is , of course , the raid that killed Osama bin Laden on May 2 , 2011 , that has ensured McRaven 's place in the history books as the architect of the operation .

During the spring of 2011 McRaven formulated the plan for the assault on the compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan where bin Laden was believed to be hiding .

Following extensive realistic rehearsals of the raid in both North Carolina and Nevada that included a full-scale model of the compound bin Laden was believed to be hiding in , McRaven went to the White House to give Obama his assessment of the plausibility of the mission .

When he was outlining to the President and his war cabinet the planned Abbottabad helicopter raid , McRaven said , `` In terms of difficulty , compared to what we 're doing on a nightly basis in Afghanistan , what we 're doing in Iraq , this is not among the most difficult missions technically . The difficult part is the sovereignty issue with Pakistan and flying for a long stretch of time over Pakistani airspace . ''

The night of the raid , when one of the stealth helicopters carrying a SEAL team crashed inside bin Laden 's compound , McRaven -- who was narrating the progress of the operation from his command post in Afghanistan to the White House -- did n't skip a beat , saying without altering his tone : `` We will now be amending the mission . ''

Around 15 minutes after the helicopter had crashed , on his audio feed , McRaven heard a SEAL team member give the code word `` Geronimo . '' Each step of the operation had been labeled with a letter of the alphabet , and G meant that bin Laden was `` secured . ''

So McRaven asked the SEAL ground force commander , `` Is he EKIA -LSB- enemy killed in action -RSB- ? '' A few seconds later , the answer came back : `` Roger , Geronimo EKIA . ''

Then McRaven announced to the White House , `` Geronimo EKIA . '' There were gasps in the situation room , but no whoops or high fives . The President quietly said , `` We got him , we got him . ''

What 's next for special operations

The United States owes a real debt to McRaven and to his wife , Georgeann , who , like many other military spouses , has also served her country stoically as her husband deployed repeatedly to war zones after 9/11 .

Among his other legacies , McRaven has put in place a Global Special Operations Forces network , which in practice mean a small presence of U.S. Special Operations and Special Forces personnel in dozens of countries around the world .
