-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The midterm elections are around the corner . The big question will obviously be what happens to control of the House and Senate . But control of Congress is only one part of the equation . There are a series of issues that will shape the individual races that will tell us a lot about which way American politics is heading .

Can mainstream Republicans take the party back ? There are a number of House and Senate primaries where Republicans , organized through business-backed organizations , are trying to seize back control of their party .

Former Ohio Rep. Steven LaTourette and the Main Street Partnership , a group with strong backing from the corporate world , are trying to counteract the power of the tea party , which they believe is damaging the standing of the GOP . `` We want our party back , '' LaTourette explained to the The New York Times .

Can Democrats take advantage of Republican problems ? Despite the fallout from the rollout of the Affordable Care Act , Democrats are hoping that they can take advantage of the turmoil facing the Republicans over the recent year , as the party 's approval ratings have plummeted in light of the budget battles and the public 's unhappiness with the party 's growing extremism .

Democrats will also be looking for a win in Florida 's 2nd District , where Gwen Graham is trying to defeat Rep. Steve Southerland in a test of whether the South has really softened as conservative territory . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has been pouring resources into the district to paint Southerland as a poster child for the House GOP . `` Congressman Southerland 's reckless plan to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act would mean 614,200 consumers in Florida would be left without health insurance rebates , '' said one party spokesperson .

Which is the more politically potent issue -- opposing Obamacare or supporting the minimum wage ? Both parties are putting forth national issues for candidates to run with in their districts and states . Democrats are honing in on the issue of economic inequality , stressing their campaign to raise the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to over $ 10 by 2015 .

For Democrats , the risk is alienating Democrats from centrist constituencies who believe this will damage the economy . But they hope that the strong support in polls for the minimum wage boosts their candidates . Rep. Steve Israel , chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , predicts that there are at least 12 seats where labor-based campaigns to raise the minimum wage will help Democrats . `` The refusal to increase the minimum wage is just one of the ways House Republicans have inflicted harm on the economy and hurt people 's pocketbooks , '' Israel said .

With each election we have been seeing the cost of campaigning rise and the need for candidates to court donors as more and more urgent . The Kentucky Senate race will probably be the most expensive ever . All of this fuels the power of private money in our political system , undermining trust in government and supporting gridlock .

When the results become clear in November , we will know a lot more about the general tenor of the American electorate . Politicians in both parties will have a better read of the kind of electorate they will be facing as they move into the 2016 presidential election .
