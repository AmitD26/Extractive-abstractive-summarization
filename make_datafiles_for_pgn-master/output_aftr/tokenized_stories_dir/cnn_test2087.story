Founder Reda Stare says she was inspired to start the company by her own experiences of dining in local homes while traveling in India .

One of the most difficult parts of the job has been convincing travelers it 'll be a better alternative to a restaurant .

`` Mostly the challenges are spreading the idea to travelers , that it is really worth it to step a bit from your comfort zone while traveling and try out this new concept of spending a few hours at local homes in Asia . ''

`` One of our home chefs received a lot of praise for her recipes so she decided to write and publish her recipe book while another host who makes excellent sweets started cooking and selling various jams as her part-time job , '' said Stare .
