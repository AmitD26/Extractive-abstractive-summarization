-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Football ca n't do much to help the devastated communities along the Jersey Shore after Hurricane Sandy . But this is what residents in dozens of towns are discovering this month : Football players can .

From Union Beach to Seaside Heights , from Belmar to Bayville , local high school teams are aiding the recovery effort with supplies , with support , and sometimes , with strength .

That was the scene in Point Pleasant Beach last weekend . More than a dozen members of the town 's undefeated high school team went door to door helping their neighbors . They carried out flood-ravaged debris to the curb , from couches to dressers to dining room furniture , and when they finished one house they would walk as a group to the next and start again .

It is not just the beachfront mansions that took a beating here . It is the Cape Cods and single-story ranch homes that are blocks away from the ocean that suffered devastating flooding . Families who never experienced so much as a drop of water in their basements for decades were dealing with several feet of it , sometimes enough to make the houses unlivable .

Families who only lost possessions consider themselves lucky . Quinn Kusma is a linebacker for the Point Pleasant Beach team who lives five houses from the beach in Lavallette , New Jersey . He left his home as the storm hit and still has n't returned -- and probably wo n't for a month .

It could be up to a year before his house is livable again , which means as he finishes his senior year , he 's essentially homeless . The family is living in a hotel in a neighboring town .

`` I figured I 'd be safe and bring enough -LRB- clothes -RRB- for five days , '' Kusma said . `` I was only off by 360 . ''

`` Football and sports have been secondary right now , '' said Mark Ardizzone , who had trouble tracking down his players in Asbury Park because of spotty phone service . `` It 's all about helping each other out and helping the community out . ''

The help extends beyond the high school level , too . Rutgers , the state university in New Jersey , and its athletic teams have gotten involved , planning to sell T-shirts with the state 's outline and the word `` strong '' at its game against Army this weekend to benefit the Hurricane Sandy New Jersey Relief Fund .

`` People down here are hurting , '' he said . `` This is not just Rutgers people who need to help . The whole state of New Jersey needs to help . ''

Professional teams have also contributed , from the $ 500,000 gifts from the Giants and the Yankees to the personal visit to Toms River , another coastal town , from Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez . Eli Manning , the Giants quarterback who had flooding in his own Hoboken , New Jersey , apartment , helped unload supplies in Staten Island .

Games will resume this weekend in some New Jersey towns . In other places , power still has n't returned to schools , leaving some coaches wondering when -- if ever -- their seasons might continue .

But everyone recognizes this : What happens on the field is secondary . What happens off it , from the teenagers carrying seawater-drenched sofas to the curb to the professional teams writing checks , is already making an impact .
