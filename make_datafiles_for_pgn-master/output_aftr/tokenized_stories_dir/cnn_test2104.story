It turns out that Umbridge was inspired by a real person . There was a teacher of Rowling 's whom she `` disliked intensely on sight , '' and it seems the feeling was mutual .

To be clear , this teacher was n't `` the real Dolores Umbridge , '' but her love of childlike accessories definitely inspired the character .

As for Umbridge 's love of kittens , that was inspired by a former officemate of Rowling 's , whose adoration for small furry creatures was in contrast with `` a lack of real warmth or charity . ''
