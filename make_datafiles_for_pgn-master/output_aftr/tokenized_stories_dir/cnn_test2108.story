Russia 's Foreign Ministry published harsh criticism in its active Twitter feed of the recent show of support by the United States , France and Arab states around the Persian Gulf for fighters trying to topple Assad .

Quoting Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , the ministry tweeted : `` If the priority is Assad 's fate , it will be paid for with new casualties in #Syria . Our key priority is to prevent such sacrifices . ''

Lavrov met with the Gulf Cooperation Council in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , on Wednesday . Russia has shown support for its long-standing ally Assad , while the GCC openly backs the opposition . Both sides have been accused of supplying weapons to the conflict parties .

The conflict raged on Thursday in Syria 's perpetual flashpoints with no sign of losing intensity . The killing continues to drive civilians to flee over the country 's borders .

Both organizations support the overthrow of the Syrian government .

The figures in their statistics will continue to rise . Ninety-five people died Thursday , including 46 in Damascus and its suburbs , and 14 in Homs , according to the LCC .
