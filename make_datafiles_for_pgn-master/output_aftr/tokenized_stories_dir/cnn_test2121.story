My answer is always the same : pass a comprehensive background check bill at the federal level . A federal background check bill wo n't end gun violence altogether , but it 's the most meaningful and immediate thing we can do that would save the most lives .

Current federal law only requires background checks when guns are purchased from federally licensed dealers . Undoubtedly , these checks have saved lives . In fact , since its inception 16 years ago , the gun background check system has blocked more than 2 million felons and other dangerous people from buying guns .

The problem is that the same individuals who are blocked from sales at a dealer can simply purchase guns through unlicensed , private sellers at gun shows or from strangers they meet online with no background check at all . This gap in the law allows millions of guns to exchange hands each year without background checks . That has to change and if national politicians wo n't take action , we 'll have to take this fight to the state level .

We also need to make sure that all of the records of those who are already prohibited from owning guns are actually in the system to begin with . Currently , hundreds of thousands of records identifying seriously mentally ill people as prohibited gun purchasers are missing from the federal background check database because of lax reporting by state courts and agencies .

One of those missing records was of the Virginia Tech shooter who killed 32 people and injured 15â € '' including myselfâ € '' before committing suicide . A court had found that he posed an imminent threat and had issued an order that prohibited him from buying or possessing guns , but because the state failed to submit this prohibiting record to the federal background check system , he was able to pass a background check and buy the guns he used in the massacre .

Gun owners themselves understand that a background check system that works is n't about undermining the rights of lawful gun owners . In fact , recent polling has revealed that more than 70 % of gun owners support background checks .

Background checks save lives . It 's time we pass a law requiring them on every sale .
