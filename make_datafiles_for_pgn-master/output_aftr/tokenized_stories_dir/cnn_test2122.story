-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While following their favorite soccer teams in preparation for the 2014 World Cup , fans in Brazil may have glimpsed one of the largest public health campaigns ever organized by the country 's Ministry of Health .

`` Dengue Mata '' or `` Dengue Kills '' is the key message being pushed in print materials and TV commercials . Brazilian health officials hope the campaign will encourage local citizens to clean up areas around their homes to reduce mosquito breeding grounds , and that doing so will reduce the risk of the mosquito-transmitted virus that causes dengue fever .

The 2014 World Cup host country has reported the most cases of dengue in South America over the past 30 years , including four deaths attributable to the disease in January and February .

Could the virus make it back to U.S. soil ? Sharp said it would be a rare event , but the virus could be spread from an infected traveler to any state with a mosquito presence .

Dengue fever is not unheard of in the United States . In 2013 , 137 cases were reported in Florida . Of those cases , 114 involved a person who had traveled to a dengue endemic country -LRB- including Brazil -RRB- in the two weeks before onset , according to the Florida Department of Health .

U.S. hospitalizations for dengue fever tripled in seven years

Dengue symptoms include high fever , severe headaches , pain behind the eyes , muscle and joint pain , nausea , vomiting and swollen glands . It is potentially fatal because of fluid accumulation , respiratory distress , severe bleeding or organ impairment .

Individuals with diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease or asthma have a higher risk of developing a more severe illness if infected . People who are older or have had previous exposure to one of the four dengue viruses are also more at risk .

For protection , the CDC recommends using a bug repellent at dawn and dusk that includes either DEET , picaridin , oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 as the active ingredient . Sunscreen should be applied first and insect-repellent second . Wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants and sleeping in screened or air-conditioned rooms are other strategies for avoiding infection .

Dengue at the World Cup

An analysis published in Lancet Infectious Diseases in May looked at the climate forecast for dengue fever during the 2014 World Cup . Researchers analyzed past behavior of the virus to determine high-risk areas , which include the cities of Recife , Fortaleza and Natal , where many countries , including the United States , have matches .

Even though three of the tournament cities pose a higher risk , according to the Brazilian Federal Government , the World Cup falls during a time of year that typically sees a 74 % reduction in dengue fever cases across the country .

`` The one thing in our favor is that it is winter in Brazil , '' Sharp said .

The risk of infection and outbreak are based on several factors , including the number of mosquitoes -LRB- based on climate and presence of standing water needed for breeding -RRB- and a susceptible population .
