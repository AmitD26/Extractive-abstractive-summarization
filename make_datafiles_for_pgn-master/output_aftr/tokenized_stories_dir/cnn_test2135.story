Under Title IX , a school must ensure that students are not denied or limited in the ability to participate in or benefit from its educational programs or activities on the basis of sex . Penn State , like other postsecondary institutions , must collect and disclose information about certain crimes on and near its campuses under the Clery Act , and compliance is monitored by the Department of Education , according to a statement on the investigation from Jim Bradshaw , spokesman for the department .

`` Our initial review of Penn State 's sexual harassment policy , compounded by a dramatic increase in the number of forcible sex offenses occurring on campus as reported by the university itself , raised legal concerns that compelled us to investigate , '' Catherine Lhamon , the assistant secretary for civil rights , said in a statement on the investigation .

In a news release , Gates also stated the overall increase might be due in part to the additional Clery Act training that 's been provided for 5,000 individuals at Penn State over the last year . This training may have led to greater awareness of how to report these crimes and what resources are available to victims and witnesses , Gates said .

In an op-ed published over the weekend , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan discussed the unprecedented national effort to address the alarming rate of sexual assault on college campuses .

`` No parent should ever fear for a child 's safety when he or she departs for college . But the painful truth is that sexual violence is far too prevalent today on campus , '' Duncan wrote .
