That was the day I had a conversation with a Boston bombing victim who , after three surgeries , ran her first marathon a few weeks ago .

Before that , I worried about `` Mile 20 , '' which is when many runners quit . In most marathon training programs , you do n't run farther than 20 miles before race day . It seems natural to a Woody-Allen brain that Mile 20 should induce panic . How are you supposed to get energy for those extra 6.2 miles , which will take me at least an hour to run ?

Three months after the bombing , Yanni walked without crutches . In September , she ran for the first time since the surgeries , which removed the shrapnel , repaired the bone and grafted skin across the bottom part of her leg , pulling the flesh from her thigh .

Yanni is a physical therapist in Boston , so she knew what she was up against .

`` I know I was n't ready to run , and I said many times that this was the dumbest idea I had ever had , '' she wrote to me , `` but no one argued with me . Guess they were smart . ''

A friend suggested she walk most of the marathon , but Yanni insisted she would run it within the 6 1/2 hour limit . `` I said , ` NO . ' That 's not even an option . It 's not an option not to FINISH . ' ''

`` My dad fought his cancer for six weeks , '' she added , `` and I could suck it up and do whatever it took for 6 or 6 1/2 hours of ` pain . ' He was a fighter , and I knew that it was in me in some form . ''

I believe that now , but only because I 've heard so many stories like Yanni 's . Earlier this year , I traveled to Oklahoma City to watch Sara Hunt finish the marathon she started in Boston but was cut less than a mile short by the bombing . `` Once I hit the point where I stopped in Boston , I was like , ` No more walking . I 'm running this , ' '' she told me . `` This race , this is for Boston . I 'm finishing . ''

There , I also met Gary Woodbridge , whose wife , Ronota Newberry-Woodbridge , was killed in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . He ran his first marathon in her honor . `` She always wanted to run a marathon , and I finally lost enough weight where I thought I could try , '' he told me . He struggled , but he finished . He had to .

She did keep going , of course .

`` My advice would be just take it one step at a time , '' she wrote . `` We are only a select group of people that make that journey and take the time to achieve such an insane goal .

`` Take each mile and savor it . ''

`` I am glad that I can inspire people , '' she added , `` but I just feel like a normal person who loves running and who is wicked stubborn ! ... I was gon na cross that finish line one way or another . ''

After hearing Yanni 's story , I 'm sure I will , too .

We 're running for them .
