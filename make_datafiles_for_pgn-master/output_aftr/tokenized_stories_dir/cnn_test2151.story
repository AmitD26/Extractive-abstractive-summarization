Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al-Shabaab , the al Qaeda-affiliated militant group in Somalia , has recruited more than 40 Muslim-Americans and 20 Canadians , U.S. Rep. Peter King said Wednesday as he opened a third congressional hearing on Muslim-American radicalization .

Wednesday 's hearing of the Committee on Homeland Security will focus on al-Shabaab and the results of a committee investigation into the threat it poses to the United States , said King , a New York Republican , according to a transcript of his opening statement . `` The committee has been briefed by intelligence agencies and we have interviewed dozens of experts on al-Shabaab , '' the transcript said .

`` Three Muslim-Americans became suicide bombers , such as Shirwa Ahmed from Minneapolis -- the first confirmed American suicide bomber in our history , '' the transcript said . Ahmed , 27 , killed himself and 29 others in the fall of 2008 .

Another `` would-be bomber from Minneapolis '' was shot and killed by peacekeepers in Mogadishu before he could detonate his suicide explosives vest , according to King 's transcript .

Three American al-Shabaab fighters were arrested after returning home , he said , and a fourth was apprehended in the Netherlands . Somalia , he noted , `` is now much easier to get to for jihad than Afghanistan , Iraq , Pakistan or Yemen . ''

`` As many as two dozen Muslim-Americans with al-Shabaab -- who in many cases were trained by top al Qaeda leaders -- remain unaccounted for , '' King 's transcript said .

`` With a large group of Muslim-Americans willing to die as ` martyrs ' and a strong operational partnership with al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and in Yemen , al-Shabaab now has more capability than ever to strike the U.S. homeland , '' according to King .
