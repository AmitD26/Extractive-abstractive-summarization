-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Would you feel comfortable flying in a plane with the exit sign missing from above its door ?

Along with dripping water appearing in the cabin shortly after takeoff , a missing exit sign was one of the details that rattled Australian passenger Lisa Kingsberry on a flight from Fiji to Vava'u in Tonga operated by Real Tonga airlines this week .

The flight had originally been delayed two days due a sick pilot and weather conditions .

`` I 've never been on such an anxious flight , '' Kingsberry told Radio Australia . `` Everyone was talking about the safety issues . ''

`` Earlier this year , the New Zealand Government suspended millions of dollars in tourism aid to Tonga and warned travelers of safety concerns over the plane , '' reported Australia Network News . `` New Zealand says the MA60 plane has been involved in a significant number of accidents in the past few years and is not certified to fly in New Zealand , Australia , Europe and the United States . ''

No plans to ground plane

Though he confirmed that the MA60 flap has negatively affected Tonga 's tourism industry and the airline itself , Faletau downplayed the worries .

Faletau explained that the exit sign in question is a detachable , foam piece that fits above the door of the aircraft .

Faletau said the water in the cabin was likely condensation from the aircraft 's air conditioning system , caused in part by Tonga 's intense humidity .

Tonga needs plane

Real Tonga began operations in March 2013 .

`` The domestic air infrastructure has been a problem in Tonga for a number of years , '' Faletau said . `` We 're a small nation , with only about 100,000 population .

`` It 's difficult to mount a sustainable airline operation for this market . The gift of the MA60 from the People 's Republic of China to our government represents stability for Tonga 's air infrastructure for the future . ''
