In the 55-minute video titled `` Flames of War , '' the jihadist switches from classical Arabic to perfect English with a North American accent , and appears to orchestrate a mass execution of Syrian soldiers .

The FBI reached out to the public on its website Tuesday , posting a portion of the video and asking whether anyone has information about the jihadist 's identity .

`` We 're hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information , '' Michael Steinbach , assistant director of the FBI 's counterterrorism division , said Tuesday .

Officials see the killer 's appearance in the video as significant because he comes across , they say , as articulate and persuasive , a person of influence within the terror group .

In the video , there are a number of men digging a ditch behind him . The jihadist , whose face is covered except for his eyes , claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa , and who , after an ISIS attack , were `` digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed . ''

CNN can not independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers , as the propaganda video claims .

The video then shows the speaker and a group of militants executing the men , who fall into the ditch .

`` These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way , and so they come across the propaganda , and they become radicalized on their own , sort of independent study , and they 're also able to equip themselves with training , again , through the Internet , '' Comey told CBS . `` And then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement . ''

A law enforcement official told CNN that former Boston resident and U.S. citizen Ahmad Abousamra could be a key player in the ISIS social media machine that 's become renowned in recent weeks for spewing brutal propaganda online -- messages meant both to terrify and recruit Westerners .

ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe , including from the United States and Western Europe .

A CIA source told CNN last month that more than 15,000 foreign fighters , including 2,000 Westerners , had gone to the civil war in Syria . It was not immediately clear how many had joined ISIS and how many were with other groups opposed to the Syrian government .

The foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries , the CIA source said .

A top State Department official insisted Monday that American efforts to combat ISIS ' powerful online message are working , successfully keeping disaffected youth from joining the extremist group .

`` We have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded , '' Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel told CNN 's Elise Labott on Monday .
