You 've heard of crowdfunding -- raising funds through donations on the internet -- well , get ready for `` like '' funding .

An enterprising new startup in Hong Kong has devised a way of harnessing Facebook `` likes '' as a way of getting valuable donations to worthy causes and , at the same time , boosting the corporate social responsibility profile of the companies that provide the cash .

Called Likefunding.me , the small team in Hong Kong 's Science Park district -- the city 's answer to Silicon Valley -- works to bring good stories and brands together .

Co-founder Kelly Yim -- a former actuary with a major bank -- left her job to devise a system that would benefit charities , creative projects and social enterprise projects .

`` We know creative projects have the capacity to go viral -- just look at the potato salad project . We want to devise a system that allows people with these kind of projects to monetize their media exposure , '' she added .

With corporations donating a purse of a maximum of between $ 1,500 and $ 2,000 , internet users can choose from a menu of projects to `` like . '' Each `` like '' will typically give the project around $ HK2 and each `` like '' will carry the backer 's brand logo .

`` After we match-make them based on their corporate social responsibility objectives , we provide a web link for the creative projects , which is for their supporters to share the story with a different Facebook circle . ''

Using a simple embeddable button on the project , all supporters have to do is click the button to make a mini-donation .

The business model for Likefunding is similar to crowdfunding models where the company takes 10 % of the successful funds raised .

One in particular was a Hong Kong school principal who quit his job to start a charity organization to provide free tutorials to underprivileged children .

`` In a matter of just six hours , he generated 5,000 ` likes ' and 8,000 shares , '' Yim said . `` The result was quite impressive because the media exposure that project created was probably worth more than the exposure he got through Hong Kong 's mainstream press . ''

Other projects include work with abandoned animals and medical projects in China .

Good stories , she says , have the capacity to go viral and can be worth more to corporations than the equivalent in advertising .

Digital media specialist Napoleon Biggs said the model was , as yet , largely untested .
