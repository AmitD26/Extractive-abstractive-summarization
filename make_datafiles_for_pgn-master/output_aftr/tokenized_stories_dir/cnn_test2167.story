U.S. regulators issued a safety advisory on Wednesday night urging freight railroads to avoid using older tank cars when hauling highly volatile crude oil when possible .

`` These accidents have demonstrated the need for emergency action to address unsafe conditions or practices in the shipment of petroleum crude oil by rail , '' the agency said in its notice that included an order for railroads to notify relevant state emergency response offices when planning to ship large amounts of petroleum crude from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota .

Regulators are `` strongly urging '' the use of tank cars with the `` highest level of integrity available in their fleets '' when hauling that product .

The Transportation Department also said it aims to move forward with new regulations on tank car standards .

Accidents cited by regulators included :

Last December , a BNSF train hauling more than 100 cars of petroleum crude hit the derailed car of another train in North Dakota . The locomotive and 21 tank cars left the tracks , dumping 400,000 gallons of oil and triggering a massive fire . Some 1,400 people were evacuated .

Last November , a 90-car petroleum crude oil train operated by Alabama & Gulf Coast Railway derailed in Alabama . Twenty-six cars were involved , triggering a fire .

The worst was last July when an unattended freight train loaded with petroleum crude rolled down a grade in the town of Lac-MÃ©gantic , Quebec . The resulting explosion and fire leveled the small community 's downtown , killing 47 people .

`` These open and transparent communications will continue as railroads do all they can to comply with the Department of Transportation 's emergency order , '' the group said in a statement .

In February , the industry announced steps in conjunction with the Transportation Department that included stepped up track inspections , improved braking procedures , new route analysis , and speed restrictions .

The industry at the time said it would continue to work with regulators on new tank car standards .
