Then came the real surprise for the two men : about 15 masked ISIS gunmen jumped out of three cars and took them captive , beginning a dark tale that eventually led to Abobaker 's release , but ended in Sotloff 's beheading .

In an interview with CNN this week , Abobaker provided a detailed account of how he , Sotloff and three armed guards were abducted in Syria by ISIS fighters in August 2013 , but since then , never once did U.S. officials try to interview Abobaker about his first-hand experience with ISIS and its captivity of Sotloff .

`` No , nobody tried to contact me and I tried to help . Nobody come to me and ask me any questions from the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- government ... . Nobody contact me or ask me about their conditions , '' Abobaker said in occasionally broken English . `` And they can find me . It 's easy . But , no , nobody tried to contact me . ''

A Sotloff family representative who kept contact with Abobaker before and after his captivity reiterated the claims , saying U.S. government or security agencies -- who were made aware of the fixer and his connection to Sotloff -- never talked to Abobaker .

`` That was one of many mistakes , '' Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi told CNN . He declined to comment further .

Abobaker 's assertions that his abductors were ISIS fighters could n't be independently verified by CNN .

FBI officials declined to comment directly on the accusations by Abobaker and Barfi , but asserted they are investigating the Sotloff case .

`` The FBI is actively investigating the savage murder of Steven Sotloff at the hands of terrorists and will not discuss investigative details at this time . We are committed to bringing the murderers of Steven Sotloff to justice , '' said FBI spokesman Paul Bresson .

A survivor 's torment

`` He was nice man and good heart I just wish he can rest in peace now , '' Abobaker added .

Abobaker blamed a guard on the Turkey-Syria border for possibly betraying Sotloff 's whereabouts to an ISIS contact . CNN contacted other journalists who worked with Abobaker , and they said he was an established fixer with a good reputation .

`` I think maybe one guard from the border , they call him on the radio , and he said he 's moved from here , you can wait for him : He has this kind of car , '' Abobaker said . Conscious of security , he did n't use his car that day and instead borrowed one , he said

The moment the journalistic team entered Syria , Abobaker called Barfi to confirm the group was inside Syria .

Barfi was staying in a hotel in Turkey . When asked why he did n't travel with Sotloff into Syria , Barfi told CNN that `` I can not go into details about that . ''

This trip was n't the first time that Abobaker worked as a journalistic `` fixer '' -- or a jack-of-all-trades guide who does translations and arranges interviews . He had 18 months of experience working with at least 100 other journalists , and he was charging Sotloff about $ 80 a day , he said .

When the masked ISIS gunmen confronted Abobaker and his charges , Abobaker pulled out his gun , but he saw he was vastly outnumbered .

How many more Western captives is ISIS holding ?

Knowing all the roads

`` I know all the roads . I know if they turn 500 meters , they turn left , they turn right ... , '' Abobaker said .

As days passed , he wondered whether he would survive the Islamic extremists waging war in Syria and northeastern Iraq in a quest to create a caliphate .

`` Sometimes I say they will kill us all because I work with people from outside , '' Abobaker said .

After 15 days of captivity , Abobaker , his brother and their cousins were freed by their abductors .

Sotloff 's family believes ISIS paid as much as $ 50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered Syria , Barfi said .

Once liberated , Abobaker met Barfi several times to give him details about the abduction , Abobaker said .

He then heard another unsubstantiated account that Sotloff was moved again , this time to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa , he said .

Sotloff -- the journalist and one-time bearer of a birthday gift -- was barbarically killed by an ISIS executioner masked in black .

`` I send message to world to say it 's not really Islam , '' Sotloff said of the ISIS killing . `` They are liar . I say that to all the people . They are not Muslims . ''

Abobaker says he has now moved all of his family from Syria to Turkey . Two months ago , he became a father for the first time .
