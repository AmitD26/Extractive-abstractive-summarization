He began attending `` Fight Club '' - like meetups in the Bay Area where enthusiasts pit the amateur flying machines against each other in bloodless battles of strength and flying technique .

`` We were beginners , so just getting off the ground caused damage , '' Cornblatt said of the dogfights , which were won by whichever drone lasted the longest and got back up in the air fastest .

For many , the word `` drone '' still conjures images of military strikes or a near-future retail fleet delivering packages or pizzas . But while commercial uses of unmanned aerial vehicles are banned while tangled up in federal regulations , a growing number of drone enthusiasts are embracing the still-young technology as a creative new pursuit .

The result is a lively community of hobbyists , entrepreneurs and aerial photographers , some of whom gathered this week for a picnic and flying demonstration in a suburban field south of Napa . The `` drone fly-in '' event was the brainchild of Make magazine , which is celebrating a new all-drone issue .

`` The technology is still very much in the hands of the do-it-yourselfers and the enthusiasts , '' said Mike Senese , Make 's executive editor .

The Maker movement , with its legions of tinkerers , is an ideal community to embrace drones . The DIY drone technology has grown organically from existing popular maker interests , including micro-controllers , robotics and radio-controlled vehicles . Drones combine all those disciplines to create advanced and programmable versions of what look like toy helicopters .

The most practical and popular use for the devices is aerial photography . Lightweight cameras like GoPros can be affixed to drones such as the DJI Phantom quadcopter or the forthcoming $ 750 Iris from 3D Robotics . Specialized drone rigs can even hold larger professional cameras .

Soaring up to several hundred feet above the ground produces some unbeatable angles . But to get a perfect shot , hobbyists program their drones with precise routes and mount the cameras on gimbals , which keep the camera steady and pointed in one direction even as the drone moves about .

`` For us , drones means ` capable of autonomy , ' '' said Chris Anderson , founder of 3D Robotics and the former editor of Wired magazine . Being able to program an exact path for a drone instead of manually steering it is what makes the technology so promising for commercial and photography use , enthusiasts say .

Experimenting and making

A startup called Fighting Walrus is working on a $ 129 accessory -LRB- it bears a slight resemblance to walrus tusks -RRB- that clips onto the end of an iPad and can be used to control standard , mid-range drones over a radio connection . With the app , you can program a route and monitor the device 's flight progress , though full manual controls are coming in a future update .

Many drones are square quadcopters and it can be difficult to tell which way they 're facing at any given time . The FPV live stream clears up any confusion , though sometimes it 's tricky to find a downed drone when you did n't see where it landed .

Flying under the radar

The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to complete standards and rules for commercial drones by late 2015 , though senators and lobbyists are pushing for an earlier deadline . Until the FAA clears drones for flight in general airspace , the devices are only allowed to be flown for recreation and below 400 feet .

Manufacturers of professional drones are stuck on the sidelines for the time being , but this has left the door open for hobbyists to experiment and invent . The consumer-first approach might help pave the way for more widespread acceptance of commercial drones whenever they take to the air .

Drones , called UAVs by large companies and industry groups , are expected to be a $ 89 billion business worldwide in the next decade , according to the Teal Group . For example , agriculture will be a huge market for the devices , which could allow famers to monitor crops autonomously .
