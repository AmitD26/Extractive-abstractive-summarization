King Abdullah issued a decree that the 150-member council be composed of at least 20 % women , the official SPA news agency reported .

Abdullah also ordered that the term of the council members be four years , beginning after the current term ends .

The council will ensure that the women are segregated , entering and exiting through their own doors , having separate offices and sitting and praying separately , it said .

The moves elicited faint praise from some .

`` It 's a step forward but they are appointed , not elected , '' said Eman Al Nafjan , a Saudi writer and blogger who tweets as Saudiwoman . `` I do n't believe we 'll see any substantial change except in the mind-set of conservatives . It 'll be interesting to see how they 'll react to having women on the Shura Council . ''

Wajeha Al-Huwaider , a prominent Saudi women 's rights activist , called the decrees `` a good thing , a step forward . ''

But , she added , `` I think it 's not enough . It 's not going to affect our lives as ordinary women -- our daily life , going to work , finding a job , getting an education . We 're still struggling with the guardianship law . Women are still not allowed to drive . We 'll have representatives on the Shura Council who ca n't even go there without a driver . ''

Still , al-Huwaider said , `` It 's good , though , because you 'll see women doing the same job as men . These women will be role models for the younger generation and maybe in the future we 'll have women who are elected , not just appointed . At the end of the day , we 're happy but we 're still waiting for our basic rights . ''

However , religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers . Such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian .
