It has splendid museums , grand avenues , a famous pointy tower and thousands of cafes where you can order a minuscule coffee for a fairly large amount of money .

In Lyon , a hearty serving of tradition

1 . Wine

Lyon is the gateway to the Beaujolais viticultural region , which fans out immediately to the northwest .

From Lyon , you can explore these whispering vineyards yourself .

Or you can take the easy route and make a few wise purchases in the excellent wine shops around the city .

Cave Chromatique does flavorsome reds and whites , while La Cave des Vins Magnifiques is hardly short on confidence when it comes to the contents of its stock list .

Paris 's Notre Dame Cathedral is an inimitable French icon , especially if you like long lines and pigeons .

3 . Outdoor music

Lyon knows how to put on a summer extravaganza .

The Nuits de Fourviere festival sees 60 or so shows -- rock , classical music , drama -- stretched across the warm evenings of June and July .

Alumni of this wide showcase include Lou Reed , Bjork and Sting . The 2014 lineup includes French pop stalwarts Phoenix and U.S. indie veterans the Pixies .

Better than any band , though , is a setting that Paris ca n't match .

4 . Cinematic history

Paris has been in many movies . `` Moulin Rouge . '' `` Amelie . '' `` Midnight in Paris . ''

But Lyon pretty much invented the movies .

You can pay tribute to their vision at Lyon 's Institut Lumiere , with its museum and cinema .

5 . Food

Paris is very good at cuisine .

It may well be .

Its restaurants include L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges , a fabled temple of Gallic gastronomy which has three Michelin stars .

It 's overseen by French uber-chef Paul Bocuse , who is now 88 , but still a master at his signature truffle soup .

Then there 's La Mere Brazier , which exists under the gaze of Mathieu Viannay .

The restaurant has two Michelin stars , but Viannay is only 46 , so can be excused his shortfall .

Paris does n't have a large central green space -- unless you count the Jardins des Tuileries , which are predominantly surfaced in gravel , and are therefore white .

But Lyon has the Parc de la Tete d'Or , which -- with its 117 hectares of grass and trees -- cozies up to the Rhone in the sixth arrondissement .

In numbers , this is basically a tie .

Julius Caesar stomped his sandals into the fledgling Paris in 52 B.C. ; Lyon had its first date with expansionist toga-wearing proto-Italians when it was founded as Lugdunum a decade later in 43 B.C. .

But Lyon was the more important city under Roman rule -- a teacher 's pet that became Rome 's head boy in ancient Gaul .

This still shows .

Lyon 's Roman structures are almost as impressive today as they were in the days of the gladiators -- especially the remnants of its public baths and the giant amphitheater on Fourviere hill at the Gallo-Roman Museum .

Because the place was ideal for a settlement . West of the Alps , it was a decent stop-off point halfway up France and not too far from the mother city .

So does the Saone .

Paris , by contrast , has just one river , the Seine . Ah , c'est dommage .
