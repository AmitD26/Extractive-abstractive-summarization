Police say Ashley Todd admitted making up the report that she was attacked because of a McCain sticker .

She is scheduled to appear in court again October 30 , when she is expected to enter a plea .

If she posts bail , Todd must be evaluated at a behavioral clinic .

Police said they found `` several inconsistencies '' in Todd 's statement and she was not seen in surveillance videos taken at the ATM . She was asked to take a polygraph test Friday morning , Richard said . The results were not made public .

Later , Todd came to the police station to help work on a composite sketch of the alleged attacker . When she arrived , Todd `` told them she just wanted to tell the truth '' -- that she was not robbed , and there was no attacker , Bryant said .

Todd originally told police a man `` punched her in the back of the head , knocking her to the ground , and he continued to punch and kick her while threatening to teach her a lesson for being a McCain supporter , '' according to a police statement .

Bryant described Todd as `` very cordial , polite , cooperating , '' and said the woman was surprised by all the media attention . Asked whether the false report was politically motivated , Bryant replied , `` It 's difficult to say . ''

However , Todd was the only one in the vehicle , and `` when she saw the ` B ' she thought she must have been the one who did it , '' Bryant said .

`` We 're talking with the district attorney 's office and conferring on just how we 're going to handle it , '' she said . `` It 's been different stories through the night and this morning . ''

Richard said the woman had described her alleged attacker as an African-American , 6 feet 4 inches tall with a medium build and short dark hair , wearing dark clothing and shiny shoes .

Before the revelation that the report was false , McCain spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker said that McCain and running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin `` spoke to the victim and her family after learning about the incident . ''

The Obama campaign also had issued a statement wishing the woman a `` speedy recovery . ''
