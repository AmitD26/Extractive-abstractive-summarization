-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This is Linda DeRegnaucourt 's last summer off . When school starts in August , it will be her last year to think about high school classes , advanced placement tests and calculus .

She does n't want to go . After 13 years of teaching high-level math , she has a tested stable of learning methods that helped all her students pass the AP calculus exam . Her room is a popular place for students to escape the drama of the high school cafeteria . Few jobs can indulge her excitement for linear functions and matrix calculus .

Once she made a budget , she realized she did n't make enough money to cover her expenses and save for her future . Changing careers felt like the only wise financial move , she said .

Attracting the best students to teaching -- and keeping them -- is tough for schools across the country . Average starting teaching salaries are $ 39,000 , and rise with experience to an average of $ 54,000 , according to `` Closing the Talent Gap , '' a 2010 report by McKinsey & Company . Teacher salaries ca n't compete with other careers , the report said , and annual teacher turnover in the United States is 14 % . At `` high-needs '' high schools , it is 20 % .

`` Five years ago , 10 years ago , kids would ask me , should they become teachers ? I was like , ` Oh , God , yes , I love what I do , ' '' she said . `` Now , I tell my kids , ` You 're really , really bright . Why do n't you think about going into -LRB- this or that ? -RRB- ' They have the potential to be doctors , lawyers , nurses , CEOs and scientists . Why would I recommend to my kids , who I absolutely love , to struggle for years ? ''

`` It 's challenging , '' she said , `` but there 's not a whole lot that 's more challenging than doing upper level mathematics . ''

Here 's what DeRegnaucourt had to say about her decision to leave teaching .

CNN : Why did you go into teaching ?

I knew that math was an area where I would never , ever worry about getting a job as a teacher . If you 're in math or physics or chemistry , you can write your own ticket .

DeRegnaucourt : I was not a good student in high school . I really needed a teacher to take me under their wing and go `` Look , you have potential . '' I did n't have that teacher . I missed a lot of school . You ca n't be good at math unless you are present to learn it .

When I went back to school , my first math class was pre-pre-college math ... you did n't even get a grade for it , you just got pass or fail . I remember starting in negative numbers ; I never even knew negative numbers existed , except in my checking account . Whatever I did learn in high school , I had forgotten . I was 29 years old . I had been out of school for 11 years .

I had a teacher for developmental math named Ms. Sifton , and she was amazing . Out of my entire career , she was the best math professor I ever had . I loved math .

CNN : Did that influence how you teach ?

I have always had a very open relationship with my students . I do n't believe I deserve respect because I 'm older . I deserve it because I 've earned it , and you deserve it because you 've earned it .

The best teaching technique I have -- it came from Victor Rodriguez .

CNN : Why did you decide to leave teaching ?

DeRegnaucourt : I have had to learn how to budget . In those thoughts , I came to the realization that the money I make is n't enough . It is n't enough to live alone . That realization was daunting . As educators , we make what we make , nothing more , nothing less . In industry , if I 'm valuable , my company can keep me by making the package they offer me more attractive . In education , the principal 's hands are tied . You just never know what the future holds . I still need to plan for the future .

CNN : How did your students react when they learned this would be your last year teaching ?

DeRegnaucourt : My students were the first ones to know . One student comes to mind : Just the other day , he e-mailed and asked me to call him . He wanted to confirm again I would be there next year . The ones who were leaving , they do n't care . I 've already done for them what I needed to do . My juniors moving up to calculus , they were distraught . They know I know what I 'm doing . They know what it 's like to have a teacher who does n't know what they 're doing . They 've all had bad teachers . We all have .

CNN : What do you hope your students take away from their time in your classes ?

DeRegnaucourt : Kids come into my classroom , and everyone thinks they 're all math geeks . They 're not . I have so many kids who take my class because they want the calculus credit for college , but they 're not the kind of kid who could go to a college calculus class and meet with success . I want them to get a love not of mathematics , just knowledge , just learning . I want them to always remember how anything was possible .

After a successful 13-year teaching career , Linda DeRegnaucourt plans to quit .

@highlight

She earns about $ 38,000 per year -- too little to cover expenses , she says

@highlight

Nationally , attracting the best students to teaching is hard because of low pay .

DeRegnaucourt plans to pursue nursing , which is likely to pay $ 20,000 more per year .
