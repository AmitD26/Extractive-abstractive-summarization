A 31-year-old Bronx woman has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime in the death of a man shoved in front of a subway train , Queens prosecutors said Saturday .

The victim , Sunando Sen , grew up in a Hindu family , his roommate said .

The woman made `` statements implicating herself in the death of Sunando Sen , '' Paul Browne , the New York Police Department 's chief spokesman , said earlier . Security video showed a person running from the scene .

Menendez was identified Saturday afternoon in a lineup , Browne said . She was recognized earlier in the day on a street in Brooklyn by a passer-by who called 911 , the police spokesman said . The caller said she resembled the woman in the video .

`` The defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter 's worst nightmare -- being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train , '' said Brown , the district attorney . `` The victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself . Beyond that , the hateful remarks allegedly made by the defendant and which precipitated the defendant 's actions can never be tolerated by a civilized society . ''

It was not clear Saturday evening whether Menendez had obtained an attorney .

In early December , Ki-Suck Han , 58 , was shoved onto the tracks in a Times Square station as a train approached .
