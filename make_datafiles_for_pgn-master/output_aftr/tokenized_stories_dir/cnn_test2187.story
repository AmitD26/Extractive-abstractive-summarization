Put your dog in a bow tie : weird but cute . Dress your cat in a bear costume : odd , but let the kitty dream . Push your overweight dog in a stroller : ridiculous , but sweet . Give your dog a tattoo covering its entire stomach and pierce its ears with mini barbells : WAIT !

The New York Legislature believes some pet obsessions have gone too far .

A bill banning the piercing and tattooing of companion animals , the most common of which are cats and dogs , was unanimously passed in both chambers on Wednesday . The bill awaits signing by Gov. Andrew Cuomo .

The legislation was initially introduced in 2011 when a groomer , Holly Crawford , of Sweet Valley , Pennsylvania , began marketing `` Gothic kittens '' on eBay .

New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal , who represents Manhattan , introduced the legislation immediately after reading an article about the kittens , said Lauren Schuster , her chief of staff .

The groomer was prosecuted and convicted in Pennsylvania . Court documents showed she was sentenced to six months of electronic home monitoring and a period of probation . Crawford did not return a CNN call seeking comment .

Animal advocates hope people will move to having pets `` microchipped '' instead .

Last year , a North Carolina man came under fire for putting tattoos on his two dogs . Ernesto Rodriguez , a tattoo artist , said he put the intricate tattoos on the bellies of his dogs so they could be easily identified if they were lost , CNN affiliate WGHP-TV reported .

Response from the public and animal rights groups was immediate , said Schuster . `` I think people have a natural knee jerk for something like this , '' she said .

While tattooing in the past has been used as a form of identification , PETA says it prefers the microchip because it is the most effective .

`` Under no circumstance should an animal be pierced , '' said Daphna Nachminovitch , senior vice president of cruelty investigation for PETA .

Nachminovitch calls the bill a `` wonderful thing '' even though this `` should be common sense , '' she says . While many states have animal cruelty statues , this is the only ban she has heard of to legally ban the tattooing and piercing of companion animals .
