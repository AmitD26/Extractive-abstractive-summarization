Snooki .

These celebrity endorsements can certainly make headlines at CES -LRB- witness this article -RRB- . But will they translate into sales ?

In recent years , celebs have a mixed track record when it comes to launching tech gadgets . Musician Dr. Dre has had success with Beats , his popular line of high-performance headphones . But singer Lady Gaga showed up at last year 's CES to unveil a prototype of camera-equipped Polaroid sunglasses that never reached the market .

`` They definitely help attract people to the booth . You see people all crowding around the booth , and they 're not looking at the new Bluetooth headset or whatever , they 're taking pictures of the celebrity , '' said gadget analyst Andrew Eisner of Retrevo , the consumer-electronics site .

`` It 's Vegas -- it 's showtime . But whether it carries any weight -LRB- beyond CES -RRB- , I do n't know . ''

That 's something 50 Cent understands .

The rapper also understands that some star wattage can bring attention to a gadget that might otherwise get lost in the sea of gadgets here .

Back at the iHip booth , Snooki sat at a table and smiled patiently while fans lined up for autographs and photos . She wore a leopard-print top , a short skirt and five-inch heels , and fiddled with her white iPhone between visitors . Sometimes , she sang along to the dance music being spun by the event 's DJ .

`` We built the line around the things that she likes , like animal prints and bling . She designed everything to fit her attitude and her fashion sense , '' Breault said . `` We knew that by having her , we could instantly attract fans , sponsors , press . The response has been tremendous . ''
