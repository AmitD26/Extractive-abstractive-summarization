Good afternoon , everybody .

Our intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons , launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus , and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place . And all of this corroborates what the world can plainly see -- hospitals overflowing with victims ; terrible images of the dead . All told , well over 1,000 people were murdered . Several hundred of them were children -- young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government .

This attack is an assault on human dignity . It also presents a serious danger to our national security . It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons . It endangers our friends and our partners along Syria 's borders , including Israel , Jordan , Turkey , Lebanon and Iraq . It could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons , or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm .

In a world with many dangers , this menace must be confronted .

Now , after careful deliberation , I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets . This would not be an open-ended intervention . We would not put boots on the ground . Instead , our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope . But I 'm confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons , deter this kind of behavior , and degrade their capacity to carry it out .

But having made my decision as Commander-in-Chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests , I 'm also mindful that I 'm the President of the world 's oldest constitutional democracy . I 've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might , but in our example as a government of the people , by the people , and for the people . And that 's why I 've made a second decision : I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people 's representatives in Congress .

Over the last several days , we 've heard from members of Congress who want their voices to be heard . I absolutely agree . So this morning , I spoke with all four congressional leaders , and they 've agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as Congress comes back into session .

I 'm confident in the case our government has made without waiting for U.N. inspectors . I 'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that , so far , has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable . As a consequence , many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress , and undoubtedly , they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal , even as the Prime Minister supported taking action .

Yet , while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective . We should have this debate , because the issues are too big for business as usual . And this morning , John Boehner , Harry Reid , Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell agreed that this is the right thing to do for our democracy .

Make no mistake -- this has implications beyond chemical warfare . If we wo n't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act , what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules ? To governments who would choose to build nuclear arms ? To terrorist who would spread biological weapons ? To armies who carry out genocide ?

I do n't expect every nation to agree with the decision we have made . Privately we 've heard many expressions of support from our friends . But I will ask those who care about the writ of the international community to stand publicly behind our action .

So to all members of Congress of both parties , I ask you to take this vote for our national security . I am looking forward to the debate . And in doing so , I ask you , members of Congress , to consider that some things are more important than partisan differences or the politics of the moment .

Ultimately , this is not about who occupies this office at any given time ; it 's about who we are as a country . I believe that the people 's representatives must be invested in what America does abroad , and now is the time to show the world that America keeps our commitments . We do what we say . And we lead with the belief that right makes might -- not the other way around .

We all know there are no easy options . But I was n't elected to avoid hard decisions . And neither were the members of the House and the Senate . I 've told you what I believe , that our security and our values demand that we can not turn away from the massacre of countless civilians with chemical weapons . And our democracy is stronger when the President and the people 's representatives stand together .

Thanks very much .
