Cityscapes are usually breathtaking , but finding a good vantage point in a new town can be tough .

Once they 're up there , they lean out perilously over edges and free-climb up towers , antenna and cranes , making anyone watching their immensely popular videos , uploaded to video sharing sites Vimeo and YouTube , as well as their own blog , squirm in their shoes as they marvel at the OTR members ' daredevilry .

Their latest stunt , published on YouTube on October 8 but already boasting well over a million views , shows four of them , identified at the end of the short video as Vadim Makhorov , Vitaliy Raskalov , Arseni Khachaturan and Nikolay Zheludovich -LRB- not their real names -RRB- , climb a steel ladder onto the roof of a Hong Kong skyscraper and hijack a huge LED billboard .

Once they 're done with it , the sign flashes `` What 's up Hong Kong ? '' and shows clips of an earlier exploit , Makharov and Raskalov climbing the then-uncompleted 2,073-feet -LRB- 632-meter -RRB- Shanghai Tower .

After successfully taking over the signage , they pose for each other , and for a drone which is circling overhead , shooting the mission . They then rush down the stairs and out of the building , triumphant .

He says they 've climbed thousands of buildings in something like 50 countries . As well as going up , they also go down , trespassing onto subways and exploring the subterranean sides of the places they visit .

He says he does n't worry about being barred from entering countries -- following Chinese media reports on their Shanghai Tower stunt he thought they might get a 20-year ban from entering the country , but nothing transpired and they have since revisited China .

The climbers made headlines last year when they scaled the Great Pyramid at Giza , Egypt -- and later apologized when they were accused of disrespecting the ancient monuments .

He says there 's also some skepticism surrounding the veracity of what they 're doing . It 's not hard to see why ; some of the footage is mind-blowing .

`` Some people say , it 's a nice video , nice action , but some people say it 's a fake . Maybe 30 % of people think it 's a fake . Or a lot of people think the Hong Kong government gave us permission or money , or we do this stuff legally , but its not true . ''

He says there 's a lot of interest in their work , and despite being apolitical , groups like the organizers of Hong Kong 's pro-democracy protest movement have contacted them .

`` People in Hong Kong messaged us about Occupy Central , asking how we could do the same stuff -LRB- as the LED billboard -RRB- with them . They wanted a yellow umbrella up there ! ''

But so far , it 's just the thrill of the climb that keeps him , and his On the Roofs co-conspirators going .

`` We do n't have a message as such , it 's just -LRB- for -RRB- fun . I guess our message is just ` what 's up . ' ''
