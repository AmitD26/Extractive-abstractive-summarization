This wo n't be a mass event , with long lines of travelers waiting for screening . Only about 150 travelers a day will receive the screenings , CDC officials said .

`` No matter how many of these procedures are put into place , we ca n't get the risk to zero , '' Dr. Martin Cetron , director of the CDC 's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine , told reporters Saturday .

`` That will not be the case but this additional layer should add a measure of security to the American public . This entry screening procedure , for example , would not necessarily have caught the patient in Dallas . ''

Cetron was referring to the only case of Ebola so far diagnosed on U.S. soil -- that of Thomas Eric Duncan , who did n't have symptoms at the time he arrived in the United States .

Coast Guard corpsmen and eventually medical workers under contract will take the passengers ' temperature and Customs and Border Protection staffers will ask questions about their health and possible exposure to Ebola .

The five airports , JFK included , receive 94 % of air travelers who come from the afflicted countries , according to the CDC .

`` The expanded screening measures provide this layer of protection to the already established protocols to minimize the risk of another case of Ebola here in the United States , '' said R. Gil Kerlikowske , commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection .

`` More than 36,000 passengers have been screened with this tool the last two months and not a single Ebola case has been detected , '' he said .

Will it help ?

`` I think they offer some margin of , I do n't know , peace of mind for the public , '' said Laurie Garrett , a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and author of `` The Coming Plague . ''

`` So I see this more as something to calm the nerves of the American people , the British people , the French people , '' she said .

Health officials have warned the screenings will likely catch some people with fevers , but not Ebola , and could miss some with Ebola as symptoms can take up to 21 days to appear .

`` No exit or entry screening will supplant the need for state and local health departments , for clinicians and for individuals to be aware and to think Ebola , '' Cetron said .

At least 8,399 people are believed to have contracted the disease as of October 7 , according to the World Health Organization . Of those , 4,033 have died , the agency said .

Among health care workers fighting the outbreak , 416 are believed to have caught the disease and 233 have died , according to WHO .

The numbers were reported from Guinea , Liberia , Nigeria , Senegal , Sierra Leone , Spain and the United States .

Aid workers Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly contracted the disease in Liberia while working with Samaritan 's Purse to care for Ebola patients . They were flown to Emory Hospital in Atlanta , where they were treated and released in August after doctors concluded they were healthy .

A third patient , Dr. Rick Sacra , was flown to Omaha , Nebraska , after contracting the disease while working in Liberia . He was discharged in September .

Mukpo 's condition continues to improve , according to a statement from The Nebraska Medical Center .

`` Mr. Mukpo is still very weak , but his condition has improved since yesterday , '' said Dr. Phil Smith , medical director of the Biocontainment Unit at The Nebraska Medical Center . `` He 's eating some solid food now , so we 're still headed in the right direction . ... The severity and unknown aspects of the disease we 're dealing with always have to be kept in mind . ''

Mukpo has received the experimental drug Brincidofovir , along with a blood transfusion from Brantly , an Ebola survivor , the statement said .

Mukpo was among a team working with Dr. Nancy Snyderman , the news agency 's chief medical correspondent .

`` The NBC crew remains symptom-free , so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community , '' said Donna Leusner , a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health .

In other countries

The Confederation of African Football said the 2015 African Cup of Nations , a soccer competition , will go ahead as scheduled despite fears about Ebola by Morocco . The competition is scheduled to be held in Morocco from January 17 to February 8 .

`` CAF has registered the request and wishes to state that there are no changes of the schedules of its competitions and events , '' the group said in a statement released Saturday . `` It must be noted that since the first edition in 1957 , the Africa Cup of Nations has never witnessed a deferral or a change in schedule . ''

United Kingdom

In London , the UK Department of Health said enhanced screening will be implemented at London 's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Eurostar terminals .

The screenings will involve assessing passengers ' recent travel history , who they have been in contact with and onward travel arrangements , the department said .

English medical professionals , such as doctors and ambulance drivers , participated in a nationwide drill on Saturday on the handling of Ebola cases .

Spain

`` Teresa is conscious and talking , '' a hospital source said .

A special committee created by the Spanish government to tackle the Ebola crisis reported no significant changes in her condition Saturday , according to the Carlos III hospital spokeswoman .

`` There has not been any change worth mentioning relating to those admitted , and they all remain asymptomatic , '' the special committee said .

The nurse admitted to the hospital Friday was told she needs to remain there for 21 days , a man who identified himself as her father said Saturday . The nurse , a friend of Romero , works at the same hospital as the nurse 's assistent , Alcorcon hospital

Another nurse under observation tested negative for the Ebola virus , the committee said Saturday . The nurse has been discharged but will remain under observation outside the hospital until her quarantine ends on October 16 , the committee said .

But experts from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control who visited the hospital over the past three days said in the `` procedure and action '' carried out at the hospital complied with established protocols .

Russia

Russia plans to introduce Ebola vaccines within the next six months , the country 's health minister said , according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti .

Skvortsova also said Russia is working on creating special drugs to be used in preventing and treating Ebola , the news agency reported .
