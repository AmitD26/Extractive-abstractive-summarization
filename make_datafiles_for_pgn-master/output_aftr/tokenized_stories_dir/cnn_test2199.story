Federal authorities accuse a 35-year-old Florida man of hacking into accounts on computers and other devices belonging to more than 50 people , including entertainers Scarlett Johansson , Christina Aguilera , Mila Kunis , Simone Harouche and Renee Olstead , officials announced Wednesday .

Christopher Chaney of Jacksonville , Florida , was indicted on charges of accessing protected computers without authorization , damaging protected computers , wiretapping and aggravated identity theft , officials said .

`` Unfortunately , Mr. Chaney was able to access nude photos of some of the celebrities and some of them were uploaded on the Internet , '' U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said .

A recently circulated nude photo of Johannsson is part of the investigation , he said .

Chaney allegedly `` also took financial information , movie scripts and conversations that the celebrities believed to be private , '' Birotte told reporters .

Chaney allegedly was able to access passwords by monitoring social media and other online sites that the celebrities used , said Steven Martinez , assistant director in charge of the FBI 's Los Angeles field office .

`` You may have selected a password that 's meaningful to you that you may disclose online with friends , '' Martinez said . `` Your pet 's name or whatever . That 's a clue to a hacker , to start there . ''

The suspect used several aliases such as `` trainreqsuckswhat , '' `` anonygrrl , '' and `` jaxjaguars911 , '' authorities said in a news release .

Chaney 's next court appearance will be at 10:30 a.m. Friday for an identity hearing in the same courthouse , Eimiller said .

The FBI 's Los Angeles office said he was arrested as part of `` Operation Hackerazzi , '' which looked into computer intrusions targeting individuals associated with the entertainment industry .

Martinez said authorities have coined a word to describe hackers of celebrities ' e-mail accounts : hackerazzi .

Investigators do n't have a motive for Chaney 's alleged offenses .

In August , rapper Kreayshawn wrote on her blog that her Twitter account was hacked when naked photos of her showed up there .

In March , Vanessa Hudgens of `` High School Musical '' underwent a similar ordeal after photos were reportedly stolen from her Gmail account .

In the wake of the latest celebrity hacking allegations , some have started to assume celebrity photo leaks are the newest front in the so-called `` hacktivist '' wars , waged by big-name hacking rings such as Anonymous and LulzSec . Those groups have claimed responsibility for taking down bank and government websites .

But security experts said connections between celebrity hackers and groups such as Anonymous are thin or nonexistent .
