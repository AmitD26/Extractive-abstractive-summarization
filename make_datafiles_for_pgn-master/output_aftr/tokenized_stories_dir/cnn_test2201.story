With Republican majorities coming in both houses of Congress and a Democrat in the White House , many people in Washington believe nothing will get done . We 'd like to nominate an exception to that expectation : Criminal justice reform .

Newt has talked about the need for `` confidence-building measures '' between the President and Republicans in Congress . The idea is that we should work on easier things first , so that we can work on harder things next .

They recognize that locking up millions of people for very long periods of time at ballooning costs is not a wise response to nonviolent crime . Warehousing nonviolent offenders for years behind bars has been an economic , moral and human catastrophe .

Today in a Florida prison , a 19-year-old man is serving a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug possession . His incarceration will cost taxpayers $ 60,000 a year . He will receive no job training , no education and no drug treatment . He will leave prison beaten down . He 'll carry the stigma and the barriers that come with being a felon , making it difficult for him to find a job and more likely that he will end up back in prison .

As a corrections system , this makes no sense . We must rethink our approach from the ground up . And for federal crimes , we can start by building on bipartisan reforms that are spreading across the country at the state level .

In the true spirit of federalism , states have led the way in passing reforms that protect public safety , more effectively punish and correct nonviolent offenders , save taxpayers money and ensure hardened and violent criminals remain behind bars .

The initiative changed six low-level offenses , including simple drug possession , from felonies to misdemeanors , and will save California hundreds of millions of dollars each year in prison spending that was n't working , reinvesting those savings into mental health and drug treatment , K-12 schools and victim services .

While there is a lot to learn from the policy reforms brought about by Prop 47 , there may be even more to learn from its politics .

If criminal justice reform can happen in places as diverse as Georgia , Texas , California and New Jersey , then it should be possible to bring similar reforms to the federal level in Washington , D.C.

Even more than the current debate in the Senate , however , the approaching 2016 election season offers the opportunity for the American people to make criminal justice reform a priority . Voters should demand of each presidential and gubernatorial candidate a vision for reducing incarceration and cutting prison spending while improving public safety and helping nonviolent offenders live full , productive lives within the law .

In the interest of ensuring criminal justice reform is part of the conversation about who should be our next president , we will convene a national summit on criminal justice reform on March 26 , 2015 , under the banner of #cut50 -- a new bipartisan initiative of Rebuild the Dream , which Van leads , to help cut the prison population in half over the next 10 years .

Our overreliance on prisons has failed America . It is past time for both political parties to come together and fix a bad system of their own making . We believe this moment offers a once-in-a generation opportunity for reforms that will save entire communities and transform the lives of millions of Americans . We must not let it pass .
