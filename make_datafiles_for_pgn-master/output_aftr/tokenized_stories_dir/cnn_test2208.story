It does n't matter if you 're taking on double black diamond trails , gliding cross country through the woods , or staring at the bunny slope with a sense of doom , you can embrace apres ski life .

Much like the 19th hole in golf , apres ski is a chance to reward oneself after a busy day of relaxation .

It might involve meeting friends for a beer , it might mean a couples massage at a Swiss-style spa , or it could just be going out for dinner to see what bison tastes like , but it 's definitely a time meant to be enjoyed .
