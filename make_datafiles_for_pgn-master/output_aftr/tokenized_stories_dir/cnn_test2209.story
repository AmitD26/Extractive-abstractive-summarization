Becoming world champions for the fourth time , defeating the illustrious Brazil 7-1 in their own back yard along the way before returning to the adulation of a million people at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin -- 2014 has been just about the perfect year for Germany 's football stars .

But things did n't quite go to plan on Saturday as Joachim Low 's side was defeated 2-0 by a well organized Poland in Euro 2016 qualifying .

After a goalless first half , Arkadiusz Milik gave the Poles the lead in the 50th minute , rising to nod beyond Germany goalkeeper , Manuel Neuer .

Poland 's star-striker Robert Lewandoski then showed great strength to hold-off former Borussia Dortmund teammate Erik Durm late on before squaring to substitute Sebastian Mila who arrowed a fine strike beyond Neuer to make sure of the win .

`` I ca n't blame my team for much , maybe only that we were too careless with our chances . Poland then made it 1-0 with their very first shot . ''

Low 's frustration was echoed by Neuer who admitted to being caught out for Poland 's first strike .

`` It was an avoidable defeat , '' Neuer said . `` We did n't play badly . If we had scored the first goal , then we would have won . ''

`` I came out bravely for the first goal , but I was too late -- it was a mistake by me . ''

In Saturday 's other Group D fixtures , Robbie Keane scored a hat-trick in the first 18 minutes of the Republic of Ireland 's 7-0 romp against tournament debutants Gibraltar .

Poland now top the group with six points , ahead of Ireland on goal difference .

The Poles have the chance to stretch their lead when they welcome Scotland on Wednesday while Germany will aim to get back on track by defeating the Irish in Gelsenkirchen .

Elsewhere in Euro 2016 qualifying Saturday , Northern Ireland rose to the top of Group F thanks to a 2-0 home victory over minnows the Faroe Islands .

In the group 's other matches , Finland held Greece 1-1 in Helsinki while a stunning free-kick from Balasz Dzsudzsak earned Hungary a 1-1 draw with Romania in Bucharest .
