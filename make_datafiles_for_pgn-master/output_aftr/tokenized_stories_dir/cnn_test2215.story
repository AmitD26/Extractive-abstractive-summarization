NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The crown of the Statue of Liberty will reopen to tourists on July 4 .

The National Park Service closed the attraction amid worries that it would be difficult for visitors to evacuate quickly in the event of an emergency .

Visitors must climb a narrow 168-step double-helix spiral staircase to get to the crown .

The federal government planned to give `` America a special gift '' by re-opening the crown , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in May .

`` We are once again inviting the public to celebrate our great nation and the hope and opportunity it symbolizes by climbing to Lady Liberty 's crown for a unique view of New York Harbor , where the forebears of millions of American families first saw the world , '' he said in a statement .

The measures include raising the handrails on the spiral staircase and stationing rangers throughout the Statue to help visitors .

A gift from France to the United States , the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886 , designated as a National Monument in 1924 and restored for its centennial on July 4 , 1986 .

It stands just across New York Harbor from where the Twin Towers stood .
