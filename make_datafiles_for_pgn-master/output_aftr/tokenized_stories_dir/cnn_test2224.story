Let me acknowledge upfront what I have said several times on CNN : I have a past relationship with the top partners at Bain that is both personal and financial . I have worked with them in support of nonprofit organizations such as City Year . I have given a couple of paid speeches for Bain dinners , as I have for many other groups . I was on the board of a for-profit child care company , Bright Horizons , that was purchased by Bain Capital . It was a transaction with financial benefits for all board members and shareholders , including me .

So , yes , I have a bias . But let me also add how that bias plays out : I have come to admire and like the leaders of Bain Capital because I have learned firsthand that in a private equity industry , where there are obviously some predatory companies , Bain stands out for the respect in which it is generally held and for the generous philanthropy of some of its partners . Nothing I have seen so far has shaken that view .

Are President Barack Obama and his team right to demand close scrutiny of Romney 's leadership at Bain ? Absolutely . Central to Romney 's candidacy is his claim that he will be better at creating jobs and growth than Obama because of his experience at Bain . Just as Republicans have relentlessly questioned Obama 's record -LRB- often to the point of sheer demagoguery -RRB- , it is absolutely fair to question Romney 's .

And given that critics have argued that Bain helped outsource jobs through its investments in the years immediately after Romney 's departure to head the Olympics , it would be a significant revelation if it turned out that in fact he had still played a meaningful role in the company .

-LRB- In another life , I made a similar argument to Bill and Hillary Clinton -- people I enormously respect -- over Whitewater and that went nowhere ; naturally enough , politicians are not inclined to put out documents that may be discomforting , even if they also help clear the air . -RRB-

Donna Brazile : Why Obama 's Bain charges are working

Has Romney basically lied about when he actually departed Bain ? Has he tried to mislead the public or investors ? Here we come to the heart of the recent controversy . I may be wrong but based on what we know so far , I would conclude that we do not have persuasive evidence to show that he has .

Romney has argued for years that after he was called in to rescue the Salt Lake City Olympics in February 1999 , he turned his full attentions there and no longer exercised active management at Bain . The story is a complicated one because Bain was a complex partnership and because the company filed various SEC papers after February 1999 still listing Romney in various key roles , including CEO and chairman . But if one takes time to look behind the SEC filings , what emerges is much more supportive of Romney 's statements .

David Frum : Mitt Romney 's painfully bad week

When the story first broke Thursday in The Boston Globe suggesting that Romney and Bain had fudged , CNN asked if I would do some reporting . I reached two of the top people whom I know in the company and , on background , they told me the same story that Bain sources told CNN 's John King : When the call came from the Olympics that February , Romney met with his partners and said he and wife , Ann , had concluded that they had to do this and as difficult as it would be for the partnership , he had to leave in a matter of several days .

A sloppy mistake ? Yes . An attempt to mislead ? The evidence so far does n't show that . Also of note : At the time , it seemed that he might return from the Olympics to active management , but in any event , he did not . Secondly , I do not know of -LRB- nor is there any controversy suggesting -RRB- his involvement in other companies during that time .

Could these Bain partners now be lying ? Possibly . On a rare occasion in the past , when I was wearing a reporter 's hat , a friend has lied to me for self-protection . But based on relationships over several years , I trust his or her account . Even so , knowing my bias , you may well ask : Is there any corroborating evidence ? As it turns out , there is .

FactCheck.org , a respected website that nails candidates for inaccuracies , earlier investigated the whole issue of Romney 's departure and reached a conclusion that he was telling the truth . Last week , little noticed by Romney 's critics , FactCheck went back , reviewed the evidence again , and based on what we know so far , reaffirmed its earlier conclusion . FactCheck 's recent article was co-written by a man who was once a top investigative journalist for CNN . -LRB- The piece last week also recalled an Associated Press report on the Olympics that said in his early tenure at the Olympics , Romney was working 112-hour weeks to save the Salt Lake City games . Does this sound like a man who was also managing a private equity firm on the East Coast ? -RRB-

But judgments today can only be fairly made on the evidence at hand and the reputations of the people who are coming forward . From my perspective -- yes , with a bias -- the weight comes down on the side that as he has said all along , Romney ended his active management at Bain when he left for the Olympics . Again , there are many other reasons why one might oppose his candidacy , but this does not strike me as a fair one .

As long as fairness is the standard , it would be reassuring if some of the harshest critics of Romney and Bain would acknowledge their own biases . And for goodness sake , will the Obama campaign please withdraw its heavy suggestion that Mitt Romney could well have committed a felony ? That was an injustice to both Romney and the president .
