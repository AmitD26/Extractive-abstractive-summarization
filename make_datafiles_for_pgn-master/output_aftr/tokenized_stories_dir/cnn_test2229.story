The four remaining GOP candidates played to their individual strengths on Thursday and tried to leave a lasting impression in a final , boisterous debate two days before South Carolina 's pivotal primary .

`` To take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question in a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine , '' Gingrich told King , the moderator of the debate .

Gingrich 's response elicited loud applause from the audience .

Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the fourth candidate in the debate .

Hours before the debate , ABC News and The Washington Post released interviews with Marianne Gingrich in which she alleged Gingrich asked for an `` open marriage '' before their divorce .

`` How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people ? '' Marianne Gingrich said in her interview with the Post .

The three other presidential candidates on the stage passed on the chance to criticize Gingrich over the allegations by his ex-wife .

Romney took the steady , cautious route that he has throughout the campaign , responding to his rivals only when attacked .

While Gingrich and Santorum debated their records in Washington and specifically who was more responsible for the Republican Revolution of the 1990s , Romney raised his hand to argue it 's time for a Washington outsider .

`` We need to send to Washington someone who has not lived in Washington , but someone who 's lived in the real streets of America , '' Romney said .

Every candidate onstage said they opposed the anti-Internet piracy bill roiling Congress , and criticized the proposal for being too intrusive . However , both Romney and Santorum said they could support a more narrow law that would help protect intellectual property rights online .

Displaying the off-the-cuff wit he has used to great effect at a series of GOP debates , Gingrich joked he was none too sympathetic to movie and music producers who pushed for the legislation .

`` You 're asking a conservative about the economic interest of Hollywood , '' Gingrich said to laughter in the audience . `` And I 'm weighing it , I 'm weighing it . I 'm not rushing in . ''

Meanwhile Paul touted his libertarian-leaning views , adding he had been an early detractor of the bill . He said as president he would be unique in his ability to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to protect civil liberties .

The former obstetrician and gynecologist forced his way into the conversation on both health care and abortion , two issues he knows a lot about .

`` I thought maybe you were prejudiced against doctors and a doctor that practiced medicine in the military or something , '' Paul told King after a section where the other three candidates answered a question on whether a full repeal of President Obama 's health care reform was truly possible .

Four polls over the last two days show Romney 's long-held lead in South Carolina nearly evaporating into single digits by the time the four took the stage , while Gingrich has surged into a virtual tie . Gingrich on Thursday grabbed a major endorsement when Perry announced he was backing Gingrich as he suspended his campaign .

Santorum 's campaign got a boost on Thursday when the Iowa GOP released the final certified results from its January 3 caucuses , which reversed Romney 's eight-vote victory and instead determined that Santorum had won by 34 votes .
