Ames , Iowa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann won the Ames Straw Poll Saturday , besting eight other Republican candidates in a nonbinding but politically significant vote in the first caucus state of Iowa .

The vote was billed as one that could make or break some campaigns . Six Republican presidential hopefuls on Saturday personally appealed for Iowans ' vote , not including former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin . She drew throngs at the Iowa State Fair on Friday but has yet to officially decide if she 's running .

Paul 's campaign chairman Jesse Benton said the result proved that the congressman is `` a top-tier candidate '' that indicates `` our message is spreading , our support is surging , and people are taking notice . ''

The next closest contenders , in order , are : former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum with 1,657 votes , businessman Herman Cain with 1,456 votes , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney with 567 votes . That was slightly less than the 718 who wrote in the name of Texas Gov. Rick Perry -- who declared his candidacy Saturday and was n't even on the ballot .

The results were announced around 5:30 p.m. CT , capping days of intense politicking and several hours of speeches from candidates and other prominent Republicans .

Nine announced candidates were on the Iowa ballot , although two of them -- Romney and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman -- skipped the contest . Huntsman is avoiding the Iowa caucuses completely , while Romney 's advisers are carefully watching the state and could pounce in the coming months if they see an opening .

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was on the ballot , too , but his cash-strapped campaign did not have a formal presence at the straw poll and he only got 385 votes . Michigan Rep. Thaddeus McCotter shelled out thousands of dollars to reserve campaign space outside the straw poll venue , but -- while he played up the perils of `` big government '' and of ceding `` the 21st century -LRB- to -RRB- Communist China '' -- he was not , as expected , a major factor , securing a mere 35 votes .

Besides playing up her roots in Iowa , where she was raised , the three-term U.S. representative cast herself as a fiscal conservative and `` national security conservative . '' Still , some of the most impassioned parts of her speech dealt with her stances on social issues .

`` We are social conservatives , and we will never be ashamed of being social conservatives , '' Bachmann said . `` We understand that religious liberty is the essence of the foothold of this nation . ''

But these days , political observers and members of the media take his straw poll wins for granted . And these victories have yet to translate to larger ones for the now three-time presidential candidate -- who has n't broken through yet in Republican elections nationally .

Speaking Saturday , Paul called for fewer government regulations and more `` freedom for America . ''

`` Liberty and life does not come from the government , '' he said . `` It comes from our creator . ''

They included Santorum , who acknowledged his underdog status but promised a comeback .

Cain , a businessman and former radio host running on his outsider image , is fading after a strong early start to the campaign . He had tried to manage expectations for the straw poll , but recently told a Des Moines audience that he needs to finish in the top three . Anything less , he said , would compel him to `` evaluate '' his campaign .

Referring to an epiphany he had 12 years ago after his first grandchild was born , `` I had to use my talents , skills and abilities to do something about this nation and get it off the wrong track , '' Cain said . `` This giant has awakened and is not going back to sleep . ''

Pawlenty 's performance in the poll was seen as especially critical . Observers had said he must finish in first or second place and send a message to his supporters -LRB- and the media -RRB- that his campaign can soldier on through the fall and winter .

The former Minnesota governor has a platoon of smart political operatives in his corner and is thought to have the best ground game in the state . But despite planting an early flag in Iowa and improving his performance on the stump in recent weeks , the Midwesterner remains stuck in single-digits in state polls .

On Saturday , he echoed many others in blasting President Barack Obama , claiming he `` has no clue '' and saying `` he is like a manure spreader in a wind storm . ''

Pawlenty also vowed that his ability to get re-elected in Minnesota shows he has the track record to succeed in governing and also win over swing voters .

The results of the Iowa straw poll will be carefully scrutinized by political analysts , helping propel some candidates in their fundraising and campaign efforts elsewhere even as it deflates others .

Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad , a veteran observer of Republican politics in the state , said it is critical that a candidate do well if they are to have any chance , down the line .

Only one Republican has won the straw poll and gone on to occupy the Oval Office : George W. Bush .
