As a brilliant constitutional lawyer deeply devoted to the rule of law , he has nothing but respect for the critical function that judicial review performs in preserving the American system of constitutional government . Efforts to divine a contrary theory in his remarks were strained at the outset and have grown only more untenable .

After the president made that entirely clear Tuesday , some suggested that it would be best for presidents not to comment on cases pending before the Supreme Court even while the rest of the nation continues to debate the underlying constitutional issues .

I was among those who took that view while others suggested that , as the entire nation continues to discuss the constitutionality of a vital economic measure , artificially muzzling the nation 's chief executive ill serves the purposes of open public debate on important issues .

This president knows as well as anyone how utterly implausible it would be to think that the justices might be swayed in their constitutional views by his brief remarks , which did little more than reiterate a core theme of the government 's legal briefs -LRB- namely , the critical importance of strong judicial deference to the elected branches on complex matters of economic regulation like national health care policy -RRB- . This theme has received a full airing in media commentary , congressional hearings , legal scholarship and lower court judicial opinions . Nobody could really believe that the president 's candid expression of a view that everyone already attributed to him would move the judicial calculus even a micrometer .

There was no disrespect in the president 's entirely correct observation that precedent and historical practice alike would lead a suitably cautious court to uphold rather than overturn his signature first-term achievement in providing health insurance to millions of Americans . The fact that health care reform has represented a pressing issue for the nation over the course of a century would indeed make a decision to strike down the law all the more jarring . But the notion that the president 's recognition of that fact somehow crossed the Rubicon in our separation of powers by seeking to diminish the court 's independence is patently absurd .

That said , we have recently witnessed a shocking misuse of power in relation to these events . But it came from the judiciary rather than the president . Judge Jerry Smith of the 5th Circuit responded to the president 's comments by ordering the Department of Justice to submit a three-page , single-spaced memo stating the administration 's position on judicial authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws . Attorney General Eric Holder filed that memo Thursday , reiterating the plain import of the president 's remarks and stating that `` the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute . ''

Smith 's gratuitous order is little more than a thinly concealed insult to the president , the Justice Department and the administration . It constitutes a shocking departure from norms of judicial behavior . While such partisan bickering might be expected from the minority leader of the Senate or from commentators like Rush Limbaugh , who drew upon Obama 's remarks in yet another entry in their relentless attacks on the president , it is hardly to be expected of a federal judge .
