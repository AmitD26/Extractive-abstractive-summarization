Virginia Gov. Timothy Kaine authorized up to 1,000 National Guardsmen to assist in responding to the storm , which dumped more than 20 inches of snow in parts of the state by Saturday evening . Virginia State Police had responded to nearly 3,000 accidents or disabled vehicles since Friday night , the governor 's office said .

CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the storm -- known as a nor'easter -- could rival the Knickerbocker blizzard of 1922 , which dropped between 28 and 33 inches of snow in the D.C. area .

`` I do n't know that it will be a record-breaker , but this is significant , '' she said . `` This is a really bad storm right now . ''

The foul weather prompted an emergency declaration in the nation 's capital , stranded hundreds of motorists , shut down airports , caused power outages , and threatened to keep hordes of Christmas shoppers indoors .

The weather delayed start times for two National Football League games Sunday . The Chicago Bears-Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers-Philadelphia Eagles games will be played at 4:15 p.m. instead of 1 p.m. .

A winter storm warning was in effect for the Washington area until 6 a.m. Sunday . Blizzard warnings were issued for New York 's Long Island and parts of southern New England with forecasters predicting whiteout conditions due to high winds .

Similar warnings were issued by state officials up and down the East Coast .

Parts of U.S. 29 , I-77 and I-81 were closed and hundreds of bus passengers were stranded at a terminal in Washington as nearly 300 routes were canceled from New England to Jacksonville , Florida , Greyhound Bus Lines spokeswoman Maureen Richmond said . Travelers stuck at Greyhound terminals are being made comfortable with assistance from the Red Cross and Salvation Army , Richmond said .

She expected the train to pull into Washington Saturday night . Trains were running 30 to 60 minutes behind schedule early Saturday , and 60 to 90 minutes later in the day .

Meanwhile , more than 400 people hunkered down in 20 shelters across Virginia . A Virginia National Guard spokesman said it is working with other agencies to transport stranded motorists to shelters , and is getting food and water to people stuck in their vehicles .

As snow continued to fall in the mid-Atlantic states , folks in western North Carolina were digging out Saturday from the powerful storm . More than 50,000 were without power in Asheville 's Buncombe County after more than a foot of snow fell in the mountains . Crews were traveling from Kentucky and South Carolina to help restore power , a spokeswoman for Progress Energy told CNN affiliate WLOS .

In Washington , Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is `` perhaps the biggest we 've seen in several years . ''

`` We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the district open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend , '' Fenty said when he announced the snow emergency .

But , he also urged residents to stay in their homes .

`` This snow should end early tomorrow morning with a 24-hour cleanup . We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday . And , hopefully , all of it done between Monday and Wednesday . ''

Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and a city snow plow collided , a D.C. fire official said . The injuries are not considered serious .

The storm also halted above-ground Metrorail operations in the district because of heavy snowfall covering the electrified third rail , the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said .

In West Virginia , Gov. Joe Manchin on Saturday declared a state of emergency and `` authorized the use of the National Guard to assist with snow removal and emergency assistance and operations . ''

Crews were standing by with snow removal equipment and salt , and the city 's emergency homeless shelters will be open `` throughout the day and evening . ''

He said that packages set for Monday delivery were on planes that landed and offloaded Friday night .
