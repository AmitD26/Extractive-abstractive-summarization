Prosecutors say the ideology of Islamic extremists motivated him and that he knew what he was doing when he planted a bomb at the marathon 's crowded finish line in April 2013 .

Then there 's Tsarnaev smiling from the cover of Rolling Stone , a young man who prosecutors say fell under the sway of a manipulative older brother bent on jihad .

Defense attorneys also have said the family 's history played a role in shaping Tsarnaev . They note that the family , of Chechen ethnicity , experienced difficulties dating to World War II , when Josef Stalin deported mass populations to central Asia .

`` Prosecutors appear to have virtually incontrovertible evidence supporting their claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother , Tamerlan , planned and executed the Boston Marathon bombing , '' said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan , a former prosecutor and defense attorney .

Heightening the stakes is how the trial is a capital case , meaning that if a federal jury finds Tsarnaev guilty in the terror attack , he will face a separate proceeding on whether he should be executed . Seventeen of the charges carry the death penalty or a maximum of life in prison .

If Tsarnaev is found guilty , `` then there will be a small , separate mini-trial '' on whether he should receive the death penalty , Toobin added .

If so , Tsarnaev will benefit from one of the most prominent attorneys in high-profile capital cases .

The Boston Marathon bombings were extensively photographed and videotaped . In fact , Tsarnaev 's legal team sought to relocate the trial outside Boston , but the court ruled no .

As it turns out , holding the trial in Massachusetts ' capital city could carry an advantage for Tsarnaev if he faces a death penalty . Boston is a politically liberal city with strong opposition to the death penalty , analysts say .

In contrast to portrayals of Tsarnaev as a manipulated youngster from a troubled family , prosecutors cast him as a deliberate killer inspired by jihadi literature who inflicted terror at the Boston Marathon .

At the time of the attacks , Tsarnaev was a student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth . His dorm room contained evidence on his computer and a backpack of fireworks that had been emptied of their powder , prosecutors allege .

The brothers Tsarnaev began their plot at least two months before the attacks , the indictment says , when the elder sibling bought 48 mortars containing about eight pounds of explosive powder from a fireworks store in Seabrook , New Hampshire , in February 2013 .

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly placed a backpack concealing one pressure cooker bomb in front of the Forum restaurant on Boylston Street . He then called his older brother on a cell phone .

After the bombing , the brothers killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer by shooting him in the head at close range , the indictment alleges .

Writing on the wall

`` We Muslims are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all .

`` Now I do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said -LRB- unintelligible -RRB- it is allowed .

`` I ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished . ''

His older brother was buried in a Muslim cemetery in Doswell , Virginia , after cemeteries in Massachusetts and elsewhere refused to bury him .

Defense attorneys suggest in court documents that their client succumbed to his domineering older brother .

Potential evidence could show the older brother as someone who `` induced or coerced his younger brother to help commit '' the attacks , the defense team says in papers .

The never-proved accusation that Tamerlan Tsarnaev participated in a 2011 triple murder whose victims included a close friend `` would powerfully support the inference that Dzhokhar experienced his older brother as an all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed , '' court papers say .

In making that assertion , the defense attorneys requested access to FBI interview notes with a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev , Ibragim Todashev , who was killed by an FBI agent a month after the bombings . The agent was questioning Todashev about the older Tsarnaev .

The defense attorneys also point to how the family patriarch 's emotional and mental health issues may have adversely affected both brothers .

That includes `` psychological domination of one family member , '' `` evidence of pervasive and longstanding distortions of reality that controlling members of a family impose upon the family unit as a whole '' and `` growing up in a close environment of pretense , suspicion and fear . ''

For example , Tsarnaev 's father , Anzor , `` had been arbitrarily arrested and tortured in the family 's home country of Kyrgyzstan '' and `` had a well-founded fear of further persecution justifying political asylum in the United States , '' the defense states in court papers .

Father 's ` mental and physical afflictions ' on sons

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's immediate family hailed originally from the Russian republic of Chechnya but fled warfare in the 1990s to move to neighboring Russian republics . The family then relocated to the United States .

He rejected the defense motion to compel the discovery of the asylum documents and other materials , but said he would review the FBI files to determine `` what will be produced to the defendant . ''
