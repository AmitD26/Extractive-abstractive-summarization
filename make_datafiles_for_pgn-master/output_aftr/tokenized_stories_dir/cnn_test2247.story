The rules , which were first proposed in February and then open for comment through April , have undergone only minor changes . Chiquita Brooks-LaSure , deputy director for policy and regulations at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , said in a call with reporters that the rules were `` very similar '' to the administration 's original proposal .

`` The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost , '' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a Friday news release . `` Today 's announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage , while helping to ensure that women get the care they need , regardless of where they work . ''

Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010 , administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty .

As part of the new rules , groups that are insured -- such as with student health plans at religious colleges -- would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage .

Because the insurer would be covering the costs , the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it .

Although many religious groups applauded the compromise , not everyone heralded it as a success .

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in February that it does not support the Obama administration 's proposals because they fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom .

`` Because the stakes are so high , we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few , '' Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York , president of the conference , said in a February statement . `` We will continue to stand united with brother bishops , religious institutions , and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary . ''

`` This latest rule shows the administration is tone-deaf to religious freedom , '' said Anna Higgins , director at the Family Research Council . `` Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered , with no copay , by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections . ''

Michael Hash , director of the Office of Health Reform for HHS , said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules .

Houses of worship were exempt immediately , and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations , like universities and hospitals .

The administration had long defended the mandate , saying that it did not violate religious liberties .

The finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer .

Instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show `` religious values as its purpose '' and to `` employ persons who share its religious tenets , '' the proposal followed the Internal Revenue Code 's definition that includes `` churches , other houses of worship , and their affiliated organizations . ''

After an uproar among religious institutions that did n't want to pay for contraceptives , the Obama administration offered several alternatives in March 2012 . These plans are a continuation of those efforts .

In August 2012 , Republican nominee Mitt Romney released a television ad that attacked the Obama administration .

`` President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion , forcing religious institutions to go against their faith , '' the ad said . `` Mitt Romney believes that is wrong . ''

Although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule , a news release that accompanied the ad justified the `` war on religion '' claim using an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News in February about the health care law 's rule on providing contraception .
