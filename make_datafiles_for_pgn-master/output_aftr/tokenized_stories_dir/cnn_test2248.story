Richmond , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell is vowing to keep fighting the bribery accusations that on Tuesday landed him a two-year prison sentence .

McDonnell and his attorneys vowed to appeal the convictions immediately .

His sentencing was the culmination of the dramatic downfall of the Republican governor once heralded as a rising star -- tapped to give the party 's 2010 rebuttal to President Barack Obama 's State of the Union , and a fixture on short lists for national office .

Now , McDonnell has another distinction : He 's the first Virginia governor ever sent to prison for corruption .

McDonnell pled on Tuesday for mercy , saying he is now a `` heartbroken and humbled man . ''

It was n't enough to keep him out of prison entirely .

U.S. District Court Judge James Spencer delivered the sentence on Tuesday . His decision : In addition to 24 months in prison , McDonnell faces two more years of supervised release , as well as $ 1,100 in fines -- $ 100 for each of the 11 felonies for which he was convicted .

McDonnell was ordered to report to prison on Feb. 9 , just before his wife 's Feb. 20 sentencing .

That assessment , Spencer said , is `` dangerously delusional . ''

In his comments to Spencer , McDonnell pled for leniency for his wife . Prosecutors would n't say Tuesday what penalty they 'll seek for her .

But McDonnell 's attorneys convinced Spencer that the loans and gifts the former governor took from Williams were being overvalued , and Spencer knocked the sentencing guidelines down to 6 and a half to 8 years -- and still delivered a punishment short of that .

Spencer , a Ronald Reagan appointee , said he 's spent decades trying to understand why seemingly good people do bad things -- but that McDonnell 's crimes were too serious to ignore .

The courtroom was so packed with McDonnell 's family members , friends , political allies and former staffers that federal officials had to feed video of the proceedings onto televisions set up in another courtroom -- and that one filled up , too .

McDonnell , 60 , was convicted in September of 11 felony public corruption charges . His wife , Maureen , was also found guilty on eight charges .

The charges were a result of the McDonnell family accepting about $ 177,000 in gifts and loans from Richmond businessman Williams . The trial was an emotional ordeal that often pitted McDonnell and other members of his family against his wife , who was portrayed as the driver of the family 's connections with Williams .

The two were convicted of taking bribes from Williams in exchange for government favors as he sought to market a dietary supplement . The gifts included shopping trips with dress purchases in New York , wedding catering for the couple 's daughter , golf outings for their sons , a Rolex watch and more -- the bills for which McDonnell 's attorney , John Brownlee , said the former governor never knew were footed by Williams .

`` We believe that these things were kept from Mr. McDonnell -- at least the source who paid for them , '' he said . Pointing to several of the individual trips and gifts , he argued that McDonnell should be sentenced for having taken $ 69,000 in inappropriate gifts and loans , rather than $ 177,000 .
