At age 16 , Rob McCullough walked into an LA Boxing gym for the first time . The teen had left home , moving from one friend 's couch to another , and now finally felt like he found a place where he belonged .

By the time he reached high school , a new challenge would shape his future .

`` Going to a school with a lot of gangs at one point was kind of one of the things that got me to start and think , ` If I learned how to fight really well , people wo n't want to bother me at all , ' '' he says .

From a childhood with such challenges , McCullough found both a passion and an occupation . `` I found sports . I found mixed martial arts ; it was like therapy , '' he says .

Now McCullough , together with LA Boxing , said he wants other children who face bullying to have the same opportunity . `` I would like to share with other kids that maybe if they are going through issues of being bullied , or they are a bully , it 's a place that they can go to to work that stuff out , '' he says .

He is n't doing it alone . Big names in the martial arts arena , such as Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White and former light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz , have joined in to help stop bullying and promote their sport .

`` We fight for many reasons , but we do n't fight to be bullies . ''

For some of these fighters , the struggle with bullying is personal . `` I have interesting stories from guys that are current active fighters , '' McCullough says . '' I had one guy say , ` I would love to be a part of this campaign because I used to stutter and I got made fun of all through high school . ' ''

McCullough now has another reason to get involved . `` I have a 2-year-old son , and I started to think about it , '' he says . `` What if my kid gets picked on ? ''

Martial arts may not appeal to all the children in the campaign 's assemblies , but McCullough said he is sure the message is true for everyone . `` I think at the end of the day it 's respect , '' he says .
