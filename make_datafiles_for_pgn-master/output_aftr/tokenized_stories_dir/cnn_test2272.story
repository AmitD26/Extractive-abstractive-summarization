But it was that kind of Tuesday .

Asked at the daily press briefing what makes `` The Bold and The Beautiful '' producer Colleen Bell qualified to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary , White House spokesman Josh Earnest did n't exactly have an explanation .

'' -LRB- She 's -RRB- somebody who obviously has succeeded in , you know , in the business world , '' Earnest said .

`` Well , I can tell you that that 's not the reason she was chosen , '' he said .

Just hours before , Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , blasted Bell 's nomination on the Senate floor .

`` We 're about to vote on a totally unqualified individual to be ambassador to a nation which is very important to our national security interests , '' he said .

`` I am not against political appointees ... but here we are , a nation that 's on the verge of seceded its sovereignty to a neo-fascist dictator getting in bed with Vladimir Putin and we 're gon na send the producer of ` The Bold and the Beautiful ' as our ambassador , '' McCain said .

Bell was confirmed to the position Tuesday by a Democrat-led Senate . The chamber also confirmed Noah Mamet , another Democratic fundraiser , as the ambassador to Argentina .
