WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The global financial crisis has increased the worldwide trade in trafficked persons , says a State Department report released Tuesday .

`` This is modern slavery . A crime that spans the globe , providing ruthless employers with endless supply of people to abuse for financial gain , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said as she announced the report . `` With this report , we hope to shine the light brightly on the scope and scale of modern slavery , so all governments can see where progress has been made and where more is needed . ''

`` A striking global demand for labor and a growing supply of workers willing to take ever greater risks for economic opportunities seem a recipe for increased forced labor cases of migrant workers and women in prostitution , '' it says .

Iran , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Syria remain on the blacklist for another year , with the report saying they often become a destination for trafficked persons who are sold into domestic servitude . Other repeat offenders on the list include North Korea , Myanmar and Fiji .

The State Department also put Malaysia in the Tier 3 list , because of its trafficking of Burmese refugees .

The report cites information that Malaysian immigration officials sold refugees to traffickers operating along its border with Thailand . When the victims were unable to pay a ransom demanded by the traffickers , the report says , they were sold for labor and commercial sex exploitation .

The blacklisted countries are subject to U.S. sanctions if they do n't make greater efforts to fight trafficking .

The Philippines , Cambodia , Bangladesh and Pakistan were added to a `` watch list '' because of what the report calls a worsening trafficking record in those countries . The 52 countries on the watch list have failed to to meet the minimum anti-trafficking standards but are making efforts to do so .

For the first time , countries that have been on the watch list for two years -- including China , Russia , India , Sri Lanka and Egypt -- will automatically be moved to the Tier 3 blacklist next year without a presidential waiver if they fail improve their trafficking record , the State Department said .

Clinton invited to Tuesday 's event members of Congress who are active on the issue , as well as global advocates for trafficking victims , in an effort to give the issue a higher profile and shine a spotlight on the need to combat it .

Calling for a renewed worldwide partnership between countries and non-governmental organizations to combat trafficking , Clinton said , `` Trafficking thrives in the shadows , and it can be easy to dismiss it as something that happens to someone else , somewhere else . But that 's not the case .

`` Trafficking is a crime that involves every nation on Earth , and that includes our own , '' she said , calling trafficking a `` grave problem '' in the United States .

For the first time , she said , the United States next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world . She expressed hope that it will be on the Tier 1 list of countries that are making robust efforts .
