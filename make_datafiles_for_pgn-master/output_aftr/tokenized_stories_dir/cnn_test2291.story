Rudy Giuliani says that when he was mayor , he gauged the New York City budget by Wall Street bonuses .

`` If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy , it really will create unemployment , '' he said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' `` It means less spending in restaurants , less spending in department stores , so everything has an impact . ''

President Obama admonished corporate America on Thursday after the New York comptroller reported that Wall Street bankers received $ 18.4 billion in bonuses in 2008 .

These are the same institutions `` teetering on collapse '' and asking taxpayers to bail them out while taxpayers are dealing with their own tumultuous finances , he said .

Last year , Congress passed a $ 700 billion bailout for financial institutions , and an $ 819 billion economic stimulus package is presently making its way through the Senate after garnering House approval Wednesday .

When Giuliani ran for the GOP presidential nomination , pundits said his stances on issues like abortion rights separated him from self-proclaimed Reagan Republicans in the field . Not up for debate is Giuliani 's alignment with the 40th president on `` trickle-down economics , '' the theory that keeping the rich wealthy creates jobs and solvency for the lower classes .

`` Those bonuses , if they are reversed , are going to cause unemployment in New York , '' the self-described fiscal conservative said . `` I remember when I was mayor , one of the ways in which you determine New York City 's budget , tax revenue is Wall Street bonuses .

In announcing the Wall Street bonuses Wednesday , State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said the $ 18.4 billion represented a stark dip from 2007 's bonuses , which totaled $ 32.9 billion

`` A 44 percent decline in the bonus pool will ripple through the regional economy and the state and the city will lose major tax revenues , '' DiNapoli said in a statement . `` The securities industry has already lost tens of thousands of jobs and the industry is still continuing to write off toxic assets . It 's painfully obvious that 2009 will probably be another difficult year for the industry . ''

While city incomes taxes are common in Iowa , Indiana , Maryland , Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania , they are an anomaly in most parts of the country , according to a 2008 report by Tax Foundation , a Washington-based think tank . New York City and Yonkers are the only cities levying income taxes in New York state , the foundation said .

Of those , 46,000 job losses are expected to have come from Wall Street , a particularly devastating blow to the economy because those in the financial community tend to pay double or triple the taxes paid by employees in other industries , he said .

In recent months , the mayor has tried to shore up city finances by raising hotel taxes and pulling back a property tax cut set to expire this summer , the official said .
