-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Country singer Trace Adkins lost his home to fire Saturday , but his three young daughters were saved by following fire safety tips they learned at school , Adkins ' wife said .

Her three young daughters and their dog were inside the home with their nanny when the fire started . Rhonda Adkins was driving a few blocks away when a neighbor called her .

`` She said that the house was on fire and we looked up in the air and we saw the black smoke , '' Adkins said . `` And I said , ` Oh , my God , this is n't happening , this is n't real . ' ''

Brentwood firefighters , the same ones who were inside her home battling the flames , visited her children 's elementary school to teach fire safety earlier this year , she said . One lesson was to place a yellow ribbon where the family should gather if the house caught fire .

With her daughters , their nanny and the family dog safe , Adkins said it was easy for her to be calm and thankful despite the loss of her home . She did have one regret , though .

`` Please , everybody , practice fire safety , and back up all your pictures , '' she said .

`` Trace wishes to express his gratitude for the immediate response of the Brentwood Fire Department and is humbled by the outpouring of concern from friends and fans , '' his spokesman said in a written statement to CNN Sunday .

Coincidentally , Adkins ' newest single , `` Just Fishin , ' '' is being released this week . The video , which features the singer and his youngest child , Trinity , on a father-daughter fishing trip , was released Friday .

Adkins , 49 , was a finalist on NBC 's `` Celebrity Apprentice '' in 2008 , but host Donald Trump chose Piers Morgan , now a CNN talk show host , as the winner .
