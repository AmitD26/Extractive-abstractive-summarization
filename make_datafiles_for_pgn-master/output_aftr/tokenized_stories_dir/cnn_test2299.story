Located in the southwest corner of Lantau , Hong Kong 's largest island , Tai O is connected to the outside world via a narrow mountain road . It has a view contrary to expectations for one of the world 's most crowded cities : There are no skyscrapers , no neon signs or real estate companies . The few shops in village close at 5 p.m. , when the nightlife on Hong Kong Island has yet to spark .

In recent years , tourists have been flocking to Tai O to glimpse this part of Hong Kong 's rapidly disappearing past . But when they arrive , they are greeted by a placard at the bus station decrying : `` Mass development will destroy Tai O. ''

It 's a sign of the times : Even as tourists boost the coffers of a local economy once dependent on fishing , villagers are deeply ambivalent about the hordes of visitors encroaching on their seaside hamlet .

While the redevelopment celebrates Tai O 's seafaring heritage -- in 1960 , villagers caught 30 % of all seafood sold in Hong Kong , according to the book `` Tai O History '' -- it comes in the wake of a 2012 Hong Kong law banning of commercial trawling .

Tai O is separated from the rest of Hong Kong by steep , rocky hills . Before 1990 , the only way to get to Tai O was by boat . Permits to drive on the town 's single road are only granted to villagers and public buses . A sense of isolation still pervades the village 's tight-knit community , which many locals say they are keen to keep to themselves . As visitors are drawn to the Venice-like village with homes largely built on stilts , the pathways are dotted with signs warning `` Private Property '' and `` No Entry . '' To circumvent the signs , tour guides now row tourists on boat down the river and having a look at the houses from the water .

Besides tourism , real estate development could change the fortunes of the town , as Hong Kong has one of the world 's most expensive real estate markets . Yet villagers say they are actively working to keep property among themselves .

`` I ca n't tell you how many people are interested in our house , '' said resident Ines Wong . But villagers do all their real estate business by word of mouth to keep outsiders out of the property market , Wong said .

Wong , 24 , grew up in Tai O , but like many other young people here , was forced to find work in other parts of the city . She eventually moved to Kowloon , which sits across Victoria Harbor from Hong Kong Island , where she started working for a large bank . While she found it hard to leave her home , she said she had little choice .

While Wong decries the impact of tourism , many of her peers who still live in Tai O welcome the government tourism plan .

`` We are one of the oldest communities in Hong Kong . If Tai O has nothing to offer to its young residents , it may become a dead town in a few years , '' said Paul Lieu , 30-year-old local resident .

`` I think Tai O has lost part of its unique character with all the development going on . But that the price we pay to get a better life and to help this community to survive , '' he said .

For Wang , the changes are attacking a way of life .
