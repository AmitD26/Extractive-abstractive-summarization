-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Riot police clashed Friday in suburbs across Bahrain 's capital of Manama with thousands of demonstrators enraged at the government 's denial of responsibility in the death of a 14-year-old boy , a human rights advocate in the Arab nation said .

In response , protesters set up make-shift barricades and threw stones at riot police in an attempt them to stop from going further into residential parts of the suburbs .

`` Security forces raided homes and fired shots into Shiite suburbs as a form of collective punishment , '' said Rajab . `` It is a common tactic they use to stop youth from demonstrating against the regime . ''

Yet such confrontations between demonstrators and authorities are not new in Bahrain , one of several countries embroiled in anti-government protests across the Middle East and North Africa this year .

Bahrain is a close ally of the United States and houses the headquarters of the U.S. Navy 's 5th Fleet . Its rulers blame Shiite-ruled Iran for stirring up trouble among its Shiite majority , but opposition leaders and Iranian officials deny the allegation and many Western powers have dismissed it .

Clashes broke out overnight Wednesday into Thursday between Shiite Muslim protesters and police , after witnesses said they saw the boy -- Ali Jawad al-Sheikh -- collapse after riot police fired a tear-gas round at him and other protesters who were in Sitra , southwest of Manama .

The interior ministry has said no clashes were taking place at the time the boy was injured , claiming that the last reported incident of unrest in the area was around 1:15 a.m. on Wednesday .

And a police chief said Thursday that the hospital officials who informed the police they had received the boy 's body did not give any details about the incident or where the body was found , the state news agency reported .

Blood tests by the forensic laboratory did not show any sign of tear-gas exposure , BNA cited public prosecution chief Osama Al Asfoor as saying .

Unconvinced , thousands of people took to the streets earlier Thursday at the boy 's funeral , according to witnesses . Rajab , who was at the funeral , said the procession remained calm , with no outbreaks of violence .

Speaking ahead of the boy 's burial , Bahraini pro-democracy activist Zainab Alkhawaja , in Sitra , told CNN there was a feeling of anger in the streets , with people chanting slogans calling for the fall of the regime and its leader , King Hamad .

`` People are more upset and angry than I 've seen at -LRB- a -RRB- funeral here before -- I think because he was so young , '' she said .

Protests have lingered for months despite a crackdown by Bahrain 's Sunni monarchy , backed by troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . More than 30 people have been killed the crackdown , in which activists say Bahraini security forces have used live ammunition .

Opposition groups say more than 1,000 people -- mainly Shiites -- have been detained and more than 2,000 have lost their jobs for allegedly taking part in the protests .

CNN 's Mohammed Jamjoom and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report .
