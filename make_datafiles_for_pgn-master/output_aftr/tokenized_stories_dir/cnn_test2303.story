This week President Obama did a swing through some college campuses talking about student loan debt . The immediate issue is the 3.4 % interest rate on federal student loans . It 's set to double July 1 unless Congress acts . Keeping the rate low in this still weak economy is , as the president said , a no-brainer . Even his opponent Mitt Romney has endorsed it . But the larger problem -- mounting college costs and a cumulative $ 1 trillion in student loan debt -- remains untouched .

Some recent polls have shown that support for Obama among young voters , once Obama 's enthusiastic fans , may be waning in this election compared with four years ago . Student loans are seen by some as the president 's chosen key to regaining their hearts . But really , the issue has been raised for him by the Occupy movement , gearing up this May 1 with a new set of actions focusing on the cost of college and the depredations of the student loan industry .

Additionally , almost 700,000 people have signed a petition sponsored by MoveOn.org for student loan forgiveness , started by lawyer and student-loan debtor Robert Applebaum . And the Student Loan Forgiveness Act of 2012 , introduced by U.S. Rep. Hansen Clarke , D-Michigan , last month , is aimed at offering relief .

Unfortunately , the measures proposed so far -- freezing interest rates , income-based repayment and public service loan forgiveness -- have n't gone far enough to improve the lot of students and recent grads . There are indications that the specialized repayment programs , designed to make loans cheaper for low earners and those employed by the government or nonprofits , are undersubscribed because of red tape and a lack of publicity .

Since 1998 , federally subsidized student loans have been non-dischargeable in bankruptcy , except in rare cases involving permanent disability or death . Since 2005 , even private , unsubsidized student loans -- the fastest-growing , highest-cost type of student loan , tantamount to putting college on your credit card -- have been immune to bankruptcy claims , as well . Without bankruptcy , lenders have little interest in negotiating . Falling behind on your loans can spiral into a hellish decades-long nightmare of interest rates and penalties soaring many times beyond the original sum . For federal borrowers , the government can garnish your wages without taking you to court , seize tax refunds and even Social Security .

In the long run , we 'd probably see more innovative low-cost learning alternatives , such as the free online courses being offered by Stanford , Princeton , and MIT professors through the new ventures Udacity , Coursera , and MITx .
