I 've been here 10 days now , and spent last weekend on call at ELWA Hospital , the 55-bed facility that SIM runs just outside Monrovia , Liberia 's capital city .

Many outward changes have been made at ELWA due to the Ebola crisis .

All patients , staff and visitors now enter the hospital compound through a single gate where people must wash their hands with bleach and have their temperatures checked before entry .

Bleach is everywhere throughout the hospital .

Many patients die in the hospital -- this should not be a surprise , right ?

We talk with these patients privately , off the busy ward ; then , along with the hospital 's chaplain , we pray for them if they wish .

The comfort and compassion we offer , along with an honest explanation in plain language , are important hallmarks of the work we do .

Sadly , she died about 30 minutes after arriving .

Thinking about the possibility of Ebola is going to be with us for a long time , maybe forever .

Later , we received a woman in her 40s who had been sick for about six months .

She had lost weight and was so weak she was unable to walk . Examination revealed a mass that seemed most consistent with ovarian cancer . She died during the night . We might not have been able to help her if she had come to a hospital sooner , because of the type of cancer she had , but if she had known her condition , her end of life journey might have been different .

We mourn with these families and others who are losing their loved ones not to Ebola virus , but certainly to the greater impact the epidemic has had on the health care system .

The bright spot for the weekend was doing two cesarean sections on Sunday with Rebecca , a Canadian doctor in her first year out of residency .

Finally , in the middle of the night I was called to go to the hospital to evaluate a woman who had delivered an hour and a half before . She had suddenly become dizzy and weak and then gone into shock .

This was an unusual case -- one minute she was sitting up playing with her new baby and talking with the staff , and just a few minutes later she was gasping .

She most likely had an amniotic fluid embolism , in which amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream and got into her lungs , a rare and catastrophic event which , even in the developed world , has an 85 % mortality rate as patients quickly go into shock .

All through Monday , my heart was heavy from the losses of the weekend .

I think my co-workers felt the same way . But as we sang hymns and prayed during morning devotions on Tuesday , we experienced a sense of unity and a release of our sadness .
