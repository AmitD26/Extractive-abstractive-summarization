Pyongyang denies their existence , despite satellite images and testimony from witnesses . Amnesty claims many prisoners are allegedly being held for nothing more than watching foreign soap operas or holding a particular religious belief , while others are incarcerated simply for having a family member deemed politically undesirable .

Camp 15 , also known as Yodok , is located in the river valleys of central North Korea just 75 miles -LRB- 120 km -RRB- from the capital Pyongyang . In 2011 , Amnesty reported that around 50,000 people were imprisoned there , though it said 39 housing blocks have since been demolished with only six new blocks built . While Amnesty conceded this might indicate a reduction in prisoner numbers , it said significant industrial activity was visible in the area , including logging .

New witnesses

According to Mr. Lee , women were `` disappeared '' after being raped : `` After a night of ` servicing ' the officials , the women had to die because the secret could not get out . This happens at most of the political prison camps . ''

Kim Young-soon , a former detainee in Camp 15 in the 1980s , described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees caught attempting to escape : `` They were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten . The prisoners were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head , chest and feet , '' she recalled .

In September this year , a United Nations inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea highlighted the `` unspeakable '' and `` widespread '' atrocities being carried out in camps that required an international response , including a mother forced to drown her own baby and a prison camp inmate compelled to eat rodents and lizards just to survive .
