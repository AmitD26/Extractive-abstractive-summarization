Kaci Hickox , a nurse placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey , went on CNN on Sunday and criticized the `` knee-jerk reaction by politicians '' to Ebola , saying `` to quarantine someone without a better plan in place , without more forethought , is just preposterous . ''

She described herself as `` physically strong '' but `` emotionally exhausted . ''

`` To put me through this emotional and physical stress is completely unacceptable , '' she said .

She slammed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for describing her as `` obviously ill . ''

In a separate interview with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , Hickox elaborated on what she thought of Christie 's assessment of her medical condition .

`` She 's fine . She 's not sick . ''

Hickox told Crowley that mandatory quarantine is `` not a sound public health decision '' and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to Ebola and public safety .

He said the doctors at the hospital say there 's no medical reason to hold her . The policy Christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad , he said .

`` We need to know what the medical facts are and not rely on politicians who have their own vested interests , '' he said .

In a Sunday evening news conference , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio commented briefly on Hickox 's case , saying that `` what happened to her was inappropriate . ''

`` This hero was treated with disrespect and was not given a clear direction . ''

`` We owe her better than that , and all the people who do this work , better than that , '' he added .

Ebola gets political

` To put me in prison is just inhumane '

Hickox arrived in Newark Liberty Airport on Friday afternoon and after a seven-hour wait at the hospital . She was put in an isolation tent inside University Hospital in Newark . She 's twice tested negative for Ebola , including a test at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta .

Hickox says she has asked repeatedly but has n't been told how long she 'll be held at the hospital .

On Fox News Sunday morning , Christie said he had `` no second thoughts '' about New Jersey 's mandatory quarantine for health care workers .

Christie also told `` Fox News Sunday '' that a voluntary system of quarantine is n't reliable .

`` I do n't believe that when you 're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system ; this is the government 's job . ''

Hickox said she has nothing to recover from . Her temperature is normal , and she feels fine .

`` I just feel like fear is winning right now , and when fear wins , everyone loses . ''

She 's not allowed to have her luggage and was given paper scrubs to wear . Hickox said she has no shower , no flushable toilet and the hospital gave her no television or any reading material . Mostly , she says , she stares at the walls .

On Sunday afternoon , the hospital issued an update saying `` the patient has computer access , use of her cell phone , reading material -LRB- magazines , newspaper -RRB- and requested and has received take-out food and drink . ''

`` While we understand that the required quarantine is an inconvenience , it is our primary goal to make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible . We have given our prompt attention to provide the patient with basic needs and to accommodate additional requests made by the patient , '' said Stacie Newton , spokesperson for University Hospital in Newark .

Hickox said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to West Africa to help quell the Ebola outbreak .

That thought was echoed by Dr. Rick Sacra , an Ebola survivor .

He said he 's afraid some returning healthcare workers will skirt the system and end up not being monitored

Hickox said she would welcome Christie to visit her in the hospital .

`` Maybe he could tell me what ` obviously ill ' means . That would be great , '' she said .

She added that she does n't regret her trip to help Ebola patients in Africa .

`` Someone asked me earlier would I do this again if I knew what would happen , and my answer is categorically yes , '' she said . `` I feel incredibly privileged to be able to do this work . ''

After hearing Hickox 's phone interview with Candy Crowley on Sunday , New Jersey Health officials emailed CNN 's `` State of the Union '' to refute some of the claims made by Hickox .

Leusner also wrote that `` the patient was given a copy of the quarantine order on Friday and is receiving regular updated information . ''
