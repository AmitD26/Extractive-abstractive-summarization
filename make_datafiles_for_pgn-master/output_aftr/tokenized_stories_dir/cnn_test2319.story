Separately , in Gaza , the United Nations said it was `` outraged '' when Palestinian protesters climbed the perimeter of a U.N. compound and damaged it . U.N. officials took Hamas to task for not preventing the incident .

Seven Israeli soldiers were injured , two of them moderately , the IDF said .

It was unknown whether the peacekeeper , 36 , was killed by Israeli or Hezbollah fire . The IDF told CNN it is investigating

UNIFIL said its personnel `` observed six rockets launched toward Israel '' on Wednesday morning , and that the IDF `` returned artillery fire in the same general area . ''

`` UNIFIL Head of Mission and Force Commander Major-General Luciano Portolano was in immediate contact with the parties to help control the situation and prevent further escalation . In the meantime , at around 1:30 p.m. , five rockets were fired from the general area of Kafer Shouba toward Israel . The IDF fired artillery rounds towards the source of fire .

`` UNIFIL has been informed by the IDF that they incurred casualties as a result of fire from the Lebanese side . ''

An Israeli military position on Mount Hermon also came under mortar fire Wednesday , the IDF said .

A day earlier , a rocket attack struck the Golan Heights , and Israel responded with artillery fire .

Overnight , the military launched airstrikes against Syrian targets in response to Hezbollah rocket fire from Syrian bases , IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told CNN . `` We did this to send a message to the Syrian regime that we view it responsible for what occurs on its territory and that there is a price to pay for allowing Hezbollah to use your positions , '' Lerner said .

`` If the Syrians think they are going to open up a new front on the Golan after 40 years , we are not willing to accept that . ''

The Golan Heights were part of Syria until the Six Day War in 1967 . The area has since been under Israeli control .

At a ceremony in the southern Israel city of Sderot , Netanyahu said , `` At this moment , the IDF is responding to events in the north . To everyone who is trying to challenge us at the northern border , I recommend that they look -LRB- at -RRB- what happened not far away from the city of Sderot , in Gaza : Hamas took its hardest hit since its formation . And the IDF is prepared to act strongly on all fronts . ''

He linked the violence to Iran , which supports Hezbollah and the Syrian regime .

`` Iran has been attempting for some time , through Hezbollah , to create an additional terror front against us from the Golan Heights . We are working aggressively and responsibly against this attempt , '' he said . `` The Lebanese government and the Assad regime are both responsible for the implications of the attacks that are originating from their territory against Israel . ''

Netanyahu 's office brought up Iran 's nuclear activities .

U.N. peacekeepers pulled out of the Golan Heights in September after Islamic militants took some peacekeepers hostage and Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing between Israel and Syria in the Syrian town of Quneitra .

Hamas said Wednesday it `` reaffirms Hezbollah 's right to respond to the Israeli aggression , especially following the attack in Quneitra . ''

Hamas , meanwhile , came under criticism Wednesday from the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process , Robert Serry , who said he was `` outraged by the assault '' on a U.N. compound in Gaza .

`` During a pre-announced demonstration , of which Hamas was well aware , a number of protesters climbed the perimeter wall and entered the compound causing damage to United Nations premises and property , '' he said . `` Due to precautionary measures taken , United Nations personnel working in the compound were fortunately unharmed . ''

Hamas controls Gaza . `` Pending a full transfer of security responsibilities to the legitimate Palestinian Authority , we continue to hold Hamas fully responsible for the security and safety of all United Nations personnel and operations in Gaza , '' Serry said .

`` As this serious incident took place in the context of increasing incitement against the United Nations in Gaza , the Special Coordinator is conducting an urgent review of operations in Gaza , '' his statement added .
