It lasted 23 matches and 102 days but Chelsea 's unbeaten run is over .

The English Premier League leaders were handed their first defeat of the season by Newcastle United .

Newcastle held on to a satisfying 2-1 home win despite seeing Stephen Taylor sent off for a second bookable offense and a late header from Chelsea striker Didier Droga .

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho might also be seeing red after his side 's first Premier League defeat in 265 days .

Manchester City ticked off a 1-0 victory over Everton to close to within three points of league leaders Chelsea with 15 matches played .

There was a bitter note to City 's win after the league 's top striker Sergio Aguero left the field in a distressed state with a suspected left knee injury .

Elsewhere in the Premier League there were big wins for QPR , who beat Burnley 2-0 , and Stoke , who shocked Arsenal 3-2 .

Until Saturday 's knockout blow at Newcastle , Chelsea had been included in a select band of European sides to make a flawless start to their league campaigns .

But PSG are the only team who can lay claim to being a true `` European Invincible . ''

Swedish star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice on his return to the side , helping the Parisians eclipse Marseilles at the top of the table .
