Berlin -LRB- CNN -RRB- Fans and film critics battled to be the dominant voice at the international premiere of `` Fifty Shades of Grey '' in Berlin Wednesday night -- and it was the unrestrained exuberance of the fans that won the day .

Some traumatized refugees of these screenings stood alongside me at the red carpet outside Berlin 's swanky Zoo Palast cinema , awaiting the arrival of the stars for the film 's international premiere . Their sense of outrage had not been cooled by the chilly evening air .

`` It was Fifty Shades of sh*t ! '' exclaimed one appalled journalist .

Several hundred fans huddled together for warmth , spurred on by a shared devotion to the books of E.L. James and the anticipation of catching an eyeful of Jamie Dornan , the handsome actor who plays her bondage-loving billionaire , Christian Grey . They had come from Germany , of course , but as far afield as the United States .

A man from Uruguay was in attendance with his wife and daughter . Had he read the book ?

`` I read some of it , '' he told me rather sheepishly , `` but then I gave it back to my wife . She loves it and my daughter does too . ''

Male opinion was relatively hard to find among a crowd in which women outnumbered men by about 20-1 . Some fans had come along as couples , revealing different approaches to `` Fifty Shades . ''

`` I 'm Fifty Shades of sex , '' offered a young German man , to which his girlfriend countered : `` And I am Fifty Shades of romance . ''

Meanwhile , a few hundred miles away in the UK , London firefighters are anticipating an increase in call-outs when the film hits general release in a few days . London Fire Brigade says it is `` concerned '' that the event could lead to a `` spike '' in people being trapped in handcuffs or genital rings .

I was wedged between a sharp piece of camera equipment from a rival broadcaster to my left and my CNN colleague to the right -- and it was he who inadvertently provided the most jarring moment of the evening , catching me full in the face with the back of his camera as he gamely fought to hold the line against a brute on a stepladder . Not journalism 's finest hour , perhaps .

For Dornan and Dakota Johnson , who plays submissive Anastasia Steele to Dornan 's dominant Grey , it 's been a long road from the film 's notorious bondage dungeon , the `` Red Room of Pain , '' to the red carpet .

But it 's not everyone 's idea of pleasure .

Voices have been raised in concern that the film could be seen as glamorizing domestic violence . That was denied by the film-makers on the carpet .

Her leading lady Dakota Johnson agreed . `` Everything that Anastasia does , it 's completely her choice and consensual and no person is abused in the movie and I think it 's kind of a closed-minded outlook -LRB- to say it glamorizes domestic violence -RRB- . ''

Could Taylor-Johnson make those reports official ?

At the box office , first signs indicate that it might indeed do well .

During the screening which followed the red carpet there were several muted expressions of derision but they were more than matched by applause .

A series of kinky clauses are discussed with admirably straight faces as Ana instructs Christian to strike out those concerning some more extreme sexual acts .

Dakota Johnson 's Anastasia may not hold the key to the cuffs but she does hold the key to the relationship and what she may or may not consent to . The sex scenes account for little more than ten minutes in a film approaching two hours and I 'd be surprised if many considered them shocking .

One scene involving the erotic deployment of an ice cube could have been cut straight out of `` 9Â 1/2 Weeks , '' that other notorious S&M movie which starred Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke , whose character would have kicked Christian Grey 's butt .

Sure it has its cheesy moments and its flaws -- but it 's not aimed at winning Best Picture . -LRB- `` American Sniper '' on the other hand won a nomination despite its shockingly obvious fake baby scene -RRB- . Just as the books have been derided for literary inadequacies there 's plenty here to allow critics to take pot-shots .

But if you 're a fan of the books , chances are you may well love it . And when a movie becomes an `` event movie , '' drawing crowds in vast numbers for a fun night out , the cheers of `` Fifty Shades '' fans may effectively pop a gag into the mouth of the most po-faced critic .
