French radio station RTL says that it called the market Friday after authorities say Coulibaly took customers and workers hostage . Coulibaly apparently took the call and then tried to hang up , the station says , but the line remained open .

In a recording of what followed , a man the station identifies as Coulibaly holds a dialogue with others -- apparently hostages -- in which he says he attacked because the French military has attacked Muslims in the Middle East and Mali , including ISIS militants .

Officials say Coulibaly killed four hostages in the grocery store , and he was then shot and killed when police raided the store to free the hostages .

One freed hostage , who gave her name only as Marie , told CNN affiliate BFMTV that the gunman started shooting `` as soon as he got inside . ''

`` I 'm the one is going to go out , '' he recounted telling them . `` I took the elevator and went upstairs . ''

When the doors of the freight elevator opened , he looked both ways . He saw no one , so he ran .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he 'd spoken by phone with a survivor who told him that a young , male Jew was shot after he tried to grab the gunman 's weapon .

`` He was shot , and struggling for his life for 45 minutes , '' Netanyahu said , recounting what the survivor told him .

The four slain victims were identified Saturday by the French Jewish publication JSSNEWS as being Yohan Cohen , 22 , Yoav Hattab , 21 , Philippe Braham and Francois Michel Saada .

Recording : ` Militants are going to come '

Coulibaly was part of the same Islamic jihadist groups as Cherif and Said Kouachi , the brothers who police say committed Wednesday 's massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices in Paris and were killed in a separate standoff north of Paris on Saturday , French police union spokesman Pascal Disant said .

In RTL 's recording , the man purported to be Coulibaly tells the hostages that they are accountable for France 's actions against Muslim militants abroad , in part because the hostages pay taxes and elect the government 's leaders .

Argument with hostages about taxes

`` You pay taxes , so that means you agree '' with France 's actions in Mali and the Middle East , the apparent gunman says in the recording .

`` But we have to pay , '' another voice says .

The response from the apparent gunman appeared incredulous : `` What ? We do n't have to . I do n't pay my taxes ! ''

The man purported to be Coulibaly says : `` Everyone could get together . If they could get together for Charlie Hebdo ... they could do the same thing for us and get together for us . ''

CNN could not independently verify that the speaker was Coulibaly .

Separately , Alexi Delahousee , a journalist with CNN affiliate BFMTV , spoke to Coulibaly on the phone during the hostage situation , BFMTV reported .

Coulibaly said that he belonged to ISIS and had synchronized his attacks with the Kouachi brothers . Paris police say that Coulibaly is suspected in Thursday 's fatal shooting of a police officer in the Montrouge suburb , a day after the Charlie Hebdo massacre of 12 people and a day before the Friday market raid .

But it was n't clear if she was in France . She entered Turkey on January 2 , a Turkish prime ministry source told CNN on Saturday . If that is accurate , it could mean Boumeddiene was not in France at the time of this week 's attacks .
