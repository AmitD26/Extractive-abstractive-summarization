AFCON is still one of the world 's most important football tournaments and a sudden cancellation would have been ridiculous .

The health of a continent is more important than any football tournament , but given the distance from Morocco to where the disease is most prevalent , the risk posed to the North African nation would have been small .

Of course , an AFCON should be played on African soil , but would offering it to Qatar have been a better solution ?

Western officials cite Equatorial Guinea as an example of a resource-rich country that is plagued by kleptocracy problems .

But CAF did n't have a lot of options .

Africa is n't like Europe where you clap your hands and you have 10 countries willing to host a major tournament . As they say , TIA -- `` This is Africa . ''

But CAF could still face problems . Equatorial Guinea has two great stadiums , but the other two are not of international standard .

It will be very difficult to host a tournament with similar conditions for all teams . The government will have to put in a lot of effort just to provide at least a normal playing surface .

Will there be enough hotels and accommodation for the 16 teams , officials and international press ? Participants need to be prepared to improvise , but it will be a big challenge for everybody involved .

Power cuts are a normal part of life in West Africa , so it 's not unusual that stars playing for Europe 's top clubs will have to take a cold shower or spend time in hotels without electricity , walking around with flashlights or candles .

Many international fans wonder why African stars would accept such conditions .

The reason is simple : All Africans are proud to represent their country and are honored to play at AFCON , even if they have to play on a bumpy pitch or are living in a less-than-luxurious hotel .

Do n't expect African players to crumble under any pressure from European clubs asking them not to travel to the tournament because of Ebola .

The players believe that they have to fight this illness by showing some solidarity .

When I have been to Equatorial Guinea you often feel the locals are n't that keen to communicate with foreigners .

The constant presence of military and police armed with rifles creates an uncomfortable atmosphere .

That was one reason why I felt more comfortable in Gabon .

Africans view Equatorial Guinea 's national team somewhat critically , given it has too many naturalized players -- many were born in Spain , Colombia , Ivory Coast and Cameroon .

Equatorial Guinea 's participation also signals a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes , following the team 's suspension from the competition for fielding an ineligible player earlier this year .

A crazy draw -- who are the favorites ?

However , the level , especially in the tactical area , has improved drastically over the last four tournaments .

Ghana is a contender because of the individual class of players like Asamoah Gyan and many others .

It 's a shame that Nigeria -- the current African champions -- did n't qualify for the tournament . Nigerian coach Stephen Keshi always managed to field a team with a good mixture of overseas-based players and local youngsters .

I ca n't see a surprise winner like Zambia in 2012 . It was a once-in-a-lifetime fairytale when a team of unknown players beat sides like Ghana and Ivory Coast against all the odds .

Equatorial Guinea has a decent side but it 's not a team that has the level required to become African champions .

Fans

One of the big differences between the European Championship and AFCON is the attendance and the atmosphere in the stadiums .

Why do you see so many empty seats in the stadiums ?

The travel costs are also very expensive and sometimes connections between African countries are easier with a stopover in Europe .

Likewise , an average African worker would never be able to afford the airfare , while accommodation can be completely overpriced . A very average hotel room during the 2010 AFCON was sometimes more than $ 500 .

Ticket prices at AFCON are also too high for fans . A normal ticket costs many times more than local fans would normally pay for tickets at a domestic league game .

Average African fans just ca n't afford to pay such prices for a football game . Poverty forces people to buy food or medication instead of spending crazy money on a football match .

Every match of the host nation is traditionally a sell-out crowd , and as long as the host is still in the tournament , the attendances are decent .

These days , African fan culture gravitates towards many of them supporting European teams . So much so , that the English Premier League means much more to African fans than AFCON .

African football , therefore , has a real struggle competing against the major European leagues , with Lionel Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar now the true idols of African fans .
