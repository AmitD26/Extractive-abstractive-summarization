Contrary to Israel 's rhetoric , the fear of Iran getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of Israel policy on Iran since the early 1990s . Obviously , Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would be highly undesirable for Israel . But that has not been Israel 's primary concern . Rather , the fear has been that Washington would end up finding a compromise with Iran that on the one hand would close off any Iranian path to a bomb , but on the other hand would lock in a shift in the regional balance of power in Israel 's disfavor .

First , consecutive Israeli governments have been on the forefront of sounding the alarm about Iran , while carefully avoiding making Iran an `` Israeli issue . '' At times , Israel has tried to tone down its rhetoric , both to avoid making the nuclear file an Israeli issue , but also to avoid making Israel shine too bright on the Iranian threat radar .

When Netanyahu was first elected prime minister , he requested an intelligence assessment of Israel 's security environment . The debate was largely on whether Iran or Iraq constituted Israel 's greatest external threat . Netanyahu decided to go with the assessment of the Mossad , presented by Uzi Arad , who argued that Israel could either make itself Iran 's prime enemy by continuing belligerent rhetoric against Tehran , or it could tone things down and let Iran focus on other threats .

`` Until the Netanyahu government , there was a proliferation of Israeli statements trying to deter Iran , warning Iran , the long arm of the Israeli air force etc. . That was stopped , to his credit , by Netanyahu , '' Israeli journalist Ehud Yaari told me in an interview for my book Treacherous Alliance - the Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran and the US .

Ultimately , Israel was successful at turning the world 's focus towards Iran 's nuclear activities . The international community , led by Washington , began regarding Iran 's nuclear issue as a primary threat to international security , imposed U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and the U.S. even openly debated bombing the country .

But over the course of the past 18 months , the Netanyahu government has made Iran all about Israel . While virtually the entire world is eager for a peaceful nuclear deal , Israel stands alone -LRB- bar a few Arab states in the Persian Gulf -RRB- in opposing the talks . While Israel helped shape international consensus about Iran 's nuclear program in the years past , Israel is today decisively outside of that consensus .

Second , while Israel calculated that preventing a U.S.-Iran deal would best serve its interest , it needed to retain the flexibility to shift its position if and when an agreement was likely to be reached . By adopting a more cooperative tone with Washington , Israel 's flexibility would enable it to influence the deal and reduce its potential downsides for Israel .

But this flexibility has been completely abandoned or lost under Netanyahu 's leadership . Ever since Obama took office , Netanyahu has actively sought to first prevent diplomacy , then undermine diplomacy to his current stance of building up opposition to Obama 's prospective deal with Tehran . Netanyahu has taken it to an extreme . He has been so disruptive that the Obama administration has felt compelled to reduce information sharing about the negotiations with his government , lest he would leak it to undercut the talks .

Such is the logic of adopting extremist positions . Rather than depriving the other side of options and maneuverability , Netanyahu has painted Israel in a corner .
