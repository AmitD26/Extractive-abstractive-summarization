Montabaur , Germany -LRB- CNN -RRB- Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz 's voice is n't heard in a recording of the final moments of Germanwings Flight 9525 .

But investigators say he was the one at the controls inside the cockpit , deliberately locking out the plane 's captain and setting the plane on a crash course for the French Alps .

Andreas Lubitz had medical note for day of crash , hid illness , officials say

The only sound the recorder picked up from Lubitz as the Airbus A320 went down , Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said , was the co-pilot 's steady breathing .

Authorities did n't mince words Thursday as they blamed Lubitz for the crash , but questions are still swirling over the 27-year-old 's past .

It seems , Robin said , that Lubitz `` wanted to destroy the aircraft . ''

But why ?

It 's a question police were trying to answer as they searched Lubitz 's apartment in Dusseldorf .

Police spokesman Markus Niesczery said a team of five investigators went `` through the apartment looking for clues as to what the co-pilot 's motivation might have been , if he did indeed bring the plane down . ''

About 85 miles -LRB- 136 km -RRB- away in the town of Montabaur , the house where Lubitz 's parents live was shuttered and guarded by police .

This town in western Germany is where Lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age .

At a club on the outskirts of Montabaur , pilots who knew Lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said .

Between the ages of 14 and 20 , Lubitz was a regular fixture at the gliding club .

'' -LRB- He was -RRB- a very normal young person , full of energy , '' Klaus Radke said . `` What can I say ? He had a bright future . He made his hobby into his job . What more can you hope to achieve ? ''

The authorities ' explanation does n't ring true for Peter Ruecker , another pilot who knew him from the flight club .

A neighbor told Reuters that Lubitz `` was very interested in things which are going on around him . ''

An 8-minute descent to death

Spohr said he could n't give any information about why the co-pilot had stopped and then restarted his training .

If it was for medical reasons , he said , then that information would have been private before the crash , he said , but it will be part of information gathered during the investigation .

He also trained in the United States , spending six months at facility in Arizona as part of a required program to get his license , a Lufthansa spokesperson said .

Spohr said Lufthansa pilots get medical testing but do not undergo regular or routine psychological testing once they are flying . However , the airline does consider an applicant 's psychological state , along with other factors , when hiring pilots , he said .
