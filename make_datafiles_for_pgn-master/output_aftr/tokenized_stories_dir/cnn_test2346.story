-LRB- CNN -RRB- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's speech to the Congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in Tehran as it was in Washington .

The Iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference .

While some of Netanyahu 's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the Iranian state , the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to Netanyahu 's baseless charge that Iran 's vendetta against the Jewish people is an ancient mission .

The hardline Kayhan newspaper , the key official outlet linked to the office of Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , called the speech `` trash talking '' but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction .

Iranian media coverage of Netanyahu 's speech mentioned the controversy in the U.S. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it . As one hardline newspaper , Khorasan , put it , `` although it is undeniable that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran , the -LSB- recent -RSB- remarks of the two -LSB- leaders -RSB- shows that they both seek the same goal . ''

The idea that the U.S. and Israel share the same strategic goal to rein in Iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners ' stance in Tehran .

It is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary Iranians to Netanyahu 's speech . But one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary Iranians outside the corridors of the state : his invocation of festival of Purim , which commemorates the salvation of Jewish people in ancient Persia .

The historic event is recorded in the Book of Esther but Netanyahu 's characterization implied that the Persian people 's history of anti-Semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the Jewish people is an ancient mission . `` Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us , '' Netanyahu said .

They wish Netanyahu had made more effort to distinguish between the Islamist rulers in Tehran -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-Semitic views -- and the people of Iran whose history with the Jewish nation is far more amicable than Netanyahu 's portrayal of history suggests .

For the moderates , the controversy around his speech and the cold-shoulder Netanyahu got from the White House is itself a vindication of President Rouhani 's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to Iran 's 12-year nuclear saga .
