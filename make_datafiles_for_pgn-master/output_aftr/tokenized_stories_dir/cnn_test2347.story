Selma , Alabama -LRB- CNN -RRB- In a passionate speech about racial progress in America , President Barack Obama on Saturday told thousands of people who gathered here to commemorate the 50th anniversary of `` Bloody Sunday '' that `` our march is not yet finished . But we are getting closer . ''

Obama emphasized that a day of commemoration is not enough to repay the debt paid by the marchers who were brutally beaten 50 years ago as they demonstrated for voting rights .

The President said that `` the Americans who crossed this bridge , they were not physically imposing , but they gave courage to millions . They held no elected office . But they led a nation . ''

As events were underway Saturday in Selma , hundreds of people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in New York to symbolize their unity with the Alabama commemoration .

Television coverage of the event in 1965 triggered national outrage and eventually led Congress to pass the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 , which mandated federal oversight over elections in states with histories of discrimination .

50 years later : Memories from ` Bloody Sunday ' nurse

On Saturday , Rep. John Lewis -- one of the demonstrators bloodied by troopers 50 years ago -- and nearly 100 other members of Congress from both parties joined the President at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of Pettus , a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader .

The President called on Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act , first passed in 1965 .

In 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a key provision of the law that required certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to `` pre-clear '' any changes to the law with the federal government before implementing them .

Efforts to revive key provisions of the act have stalled in Congress .

John Lewis 's memories of the march

Many black residents of Selma say they still live in a divisive society and still feel the sting of racism , with true change yet to come .

Geraldine Martin , 59 , has lived in Selma all her life . She was 9 years old on `` Bloody Sunday '' and with her mother had just welcomed a little sister , Belinda , to the world on that day . The two sisters grew up in Selma less than a decade apart .

They graduated from Selma High School and both had to make decisions about whether to stay in their hometown when few opportunities existed for young people .

Opinion : Selma 's historic bridge deserves a better name

Belinda shook her head . She left Selma after high school and now lives in Atlanta . Her view of Selma has changed over the years -- looking in from the outside .

`` I want to ask white people : ` So why are you so angry at us ? Is it really the color of my skin or something deeper ? ' ''

Maybe , she said , the attention on Selma this weekend will help spark a relevant dialogue .
