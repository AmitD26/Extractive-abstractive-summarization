Islamabad -LRB- CNN -RRB- Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old .

Shafqat Hussain , 24 , was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday , but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours .

`` We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours , '' said Shahab Siddiqui , Hussain 's lawyer . `` We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need . ''

Hussain 's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners , who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police .

His family says Hussain , at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004 . Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer , whom , according to human rights groups , failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile .

This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court .

`` I ca n't tell you what kind of night my family has had . I close my eyes and I want to forget . I ca n't express the agony we have gone through , waiting and not knowing . ''

Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19 , but under international pressure , Pakistan 's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order .

Two months later , another death warrant was issued for Hussain , with an execution date set for March 19 .

Since then Hussain 's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president 's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest .

Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar , which left at least 145 teachers and students dead . It was the deadliest act of terror in the country 's history .

`` It 's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves , '' Zohra Yusuf , the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN . `` Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society . ''
