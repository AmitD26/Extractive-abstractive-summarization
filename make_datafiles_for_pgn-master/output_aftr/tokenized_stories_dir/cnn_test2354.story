-LRB- CNN -RRB- Tuesday , April 14 , is Equal Pay Day .

`` Today in America , women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn . And the gap is even greater for women of color . That 's unconscionable . As president , my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100 % of the population is paid 100 % of what they 're worth . And so , I 'm announcing that if elected president , I will take a 23 % pay cut , equivalent to the current gender wage gap , to stand in solidarity with working women in America . And I wo n't take a raise until every woman in America gets a raise , too . ''

April 14 was n't just chosen at random as Equal Pay Day . It 's based on a calculation : For women to make the same amount of money that men made in 2014 , they 'd have to work until April 14 , 2015 .

A woman on average loses $ 431,000 in pay over the course of a 40-year career . Merely closing the gender wage gap would pull half of working single moms out of poverty . And at a time where Republicans are still , bizarrely , trumpeting more tax breaks for business and the rich to stimulate the economy , closing the pay gap would put money in the pockets of working people who would actually spend and stimulate real growth .

So here 's the perfect opportunity for Hillary Clinton to put her money where her mouth is , literally . In her campaign launch and personal rebrand , Clinton is clearly trying to portray herself as a woman of the people , a populist fighter for the middle class . `` Everyday Americans need a champion , '' Clinton said in her campaign launch video , `` and I want to be that champion . ''

Opinion : The myth of Equal Pay Day

With her video , Clinton has signaled a clear desire to ground herself and her candidacy in the soil of populism . But can a wealthy white woman who once sat on the board of Walmart , has already lived in the White House , collects six-figure speaking fees and does n't seem to own a pair of jeans really inhabit the portrait of a populist fighter ?

Let 's call a spade a spade . Hillary Clinton is a very rich person . While she 's certainly not the first rich person to run for president , her wealth -- and the related perception of being out of touch with ordinary Americans -- is an obstacle in her candidacy .

The difference between the current standard presidential salary of $ 400,000 a year and the 77 cents-on-the-dollar version of that salary , or $ 308,000 , is probably a drop in the bucket in Clinton 's bank account at this point . And yet the symbolic power is profound .

Thanks to the hacked Sony emails , we saw that even top female stars and executives in Hollywood are paid less than their male counterparts . What more powerful message could the potential first female president send than literally signifying that nationwide inequity in her own salary ? Clinton would n't just be saying she stands with the working women of America , she 'd be showing it .

The truth is that stunts and theatrics are now part and parcel of politics , as they are in our culture in general . That does n't mean they ca n't also serve a noble purpose , in highlighting important problems and inspiring solutions .

Hillary Clinton ca n't change who she is , the baggage attached to her by both the right and the left , rightly or wrongly . But she can change what she does going forward , how she shows up and signifies herself as a voice not for the status quo and the establishment -- but for ordinary Americans who need change .

If Clinton wins , her presidency will indeed be symbolic and historic . And it will be significant if she does something to change the lives of the 158 million women in America .
