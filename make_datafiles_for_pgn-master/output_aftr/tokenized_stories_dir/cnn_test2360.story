-LRB- InStyle.com -RRB- -- How many closets does it take to make a `` Desperate Housewife '' happy ? Just one , if it 's anything like Parker 's . We got a guided tour -- and learned a lot more about the fashion-savvy star than her taste in shoes .

Best dress

Treasured keepsake

A necklace designed by Monique Lhuillier . `` It 's his Spurs number . I love it . ''

Loves , but does n't know what to do with

Fashion faux pas

`` One time , my mom and aunt Didi were helping me clean out my closet . Aunt Didi had taken off her jacket . I grabbed it and was like , ` What is this ? Who would give me this ugly thing ? ' And she was like , ` That 's mine ! ' ''

Go-to outfit

`` A thermal top , a scarf , and I 'm not just saying this because she 's my friend , but I love my Victoria Beckham DVB jeans . She sent me three pairs -- they 're perfect . ''

`` Christian Louboutin espadrille wedges . They 're so high ! I have them in every color . I 've sprained my ankle walking on the cobblestones in Paris wearing them . They 're a beautiful pain . ''

Cool freebie

`` Richard Tyler mules . I did a photo shoot and they said I could keep them . I simply could not believe someone would give me a $ 300 pair of shoes . I was fascinated ! ''
