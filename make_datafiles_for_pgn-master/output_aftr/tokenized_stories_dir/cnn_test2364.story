Bill and Hillary Clinton campaign in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , on Monday .

The article , by Vanity Fair magazine 's national editor Todd Purdum , suggested that Bill Clinton 's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said that there were reports of Clinton `` seeing a lot of women on the road . ''

Clinton said he had not read the article but that he was told that `` there 's five or six just blatant lies in there . But he 's a real slimy guy . '' Watch Larry King panel debate Bill Clinton 's response ''

Calling Purdum a `` scumbag , '' Clinton said `` he 's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about Whitewater for Kenneth Starr . He 's just a dishonest guy -- ca n't help it . ''

Purdum `` did n't use a single name , he did n't cite a single source in all those things he said , '' said the former president , who added that the article was `` part of the national media 's attempt to nail Hillary for -LSB- Barack -RSB- Obama . ''

He said readers should be wary of news accounts that rely on unnamed sources .

`` Anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes , it ought to make the bells go off in your head , '' he said .

Late Monday , Jay Carson , a spokesman for Hillary Clinton 's campaign , said that `` President Clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article , but the language today was inappropriate and he wishes he had not used it . ''

In his article , Purdum quotes a Johns Hopkins cardiologist -- who was not involved in Clinton 's health care -- who says that the former president 's bypass surgery could have affected his mood , perhaps even causing depression .

And on CNN , Purdum quoted `` some people who work for him '' saying that Clinton `` seems to be angry all the time . ''

Purdum added he himself believes there 's evidence the former president is acting in a different manner .

`` I do n't suggest that anyone can say -- except perhaps his own doctors over time -- with certainty that -LSB- the surgery -RSB- has affected President Clinton , '' he said . `` But again , this article involves reporting with a whole bunch of people who have worked for Bill Clinton over many years . And this is one of the things they raised with me . I did n't go raising this . ''

Clinton 's office issued a rebuttal of Purdum 's article that decried his use of `` one doctor who has never examined President Clinton . ''

`` This theory is false and is flatly rejected by President Clinton 's doctors who say he is in excellent shape and point to his vigorous schedule as evidence of his exceptional recovery , '' the rebuttal said . Watch analyst James Carville 's take on the article ''

`` A tawdry , anonymous quote-filled attack piece , published in this month 's Vanity Fair magazine regarding former President Bill Clinton repeats many past attacks on him , ignores much prior positive coverage , includes numerous errors , and ultimately breaks no new ground , '' he said .
