WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States ambassador to Afghanistan , William Wood , said Friday that changes in communications with Afghan military forces have been made in the aftermath of a disputed U.S. air raid on an Afghan village .

And despite Afghanistan 's outrage over the loss of life , he said , the incident has not undermined the nations ' relationship .

The Afghanistan government has said that as many as 90 civilians -- including many children -- were killed in the August 22 air attack on a village in the Shindand district of Western Afghanistan . The United States had said that only seven civilians died , along with dozens of insurgents .

A number of investigations into the incident are under way , including a `` senior level '' review by the United States .

`` People who are reviewing our findings have been in Afghanistan for a while , and I do n't know when they will complete their review , '' Wood said at the State Department late Friday .

`` There is no American involved who does n't feel a personal sense of pain and regret any time any civilian casualty occurs , '' he said . `` Speaking as an official of the American government , I can say there is no one who works harder than the United States does to minimize such casualties .

`` I think there is no question there has been what one Afghan official referred to as ` sort of a bumpy time ' over this issue in the last few weeks . I think that it has never threatened the underlying relationship of confidence between our two countries and between our peoples or between our military and the people of Afghanistan .

`` Steps are already not simply under way but have been taken to improve coordination , '' he said .

`` The United States delegation expressed regret over the loss of any innocent civilian lives incurred during security operations , '' the statement said . `` In response to concerns expressed by the government of Afghanistan , the United States is conducting a senior level review and assessment of the August 22 Shindand operation . In addition , both sides recognize the need for establishing a mutually agreed-upon framework and mechanism to minimize civilian casualties and to maintain the strong support of the Afghan people in fighting terrorism .
