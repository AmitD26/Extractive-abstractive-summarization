NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two years after Hurricane Katrina devastated coastal areas of Louisiana and Mississippi , residents say much of America has forgotten their plight .

President Bush and first lady Laura Bush pause for a moment of silence Wednesday at a New Orleans school .

But President Bush said Wednesday the federal government has been persistent in pushing recovery efforts .

`` I would like them to know that we still need all the help and caring and volunteers . We need it bad . People do n't realize . They just do n't realize , '' Bay St. Louis , Mississippi , resident Linda Fallon said .

Two years later , one-third of Bay St. Louis residents have n't returned . Business has moved inland . Watch the struggle to rebuild in Mississippi ''

A longtime resident , Diane Bourgeois , has moved 15 miles inland to an apartment and said she doubts she will rebuild . Her home was razed .

When she asked why , she said , `` I do n't know , the memories . It will just never be the same . Ca n't risk it all again . ''

`` I hope people understand we 're still paying attention . We understand , '' Bush said .

`` We 're still engaged , '' Bush said of federal agencies .

But he alluded to the challenges faced across the region , citing teachers who commuted 30 miles to teach at the school .

`` This town is better today than it was yesterday , '' Bush said in praising the Gulf Coast rebuilding effort . But he said it would be even better tomorrow .

He urged people across the country to pitch in to help the recovery , whether through donations or volunteer efforts or even moving to the area and joining its work force .

On Wednesday , Nagin participated in the groundbreaking for a memorial to storm victims .

`` We ring the bells for a city that is in recovery ; we ring the bells for hope that the promise that was made at Jackson Square will become a reality and will restore confidence in government at all levels , '' Nagin said , referring to the scene of Bush 's vow in 2005 that the government would help the city and region recover .

Katrina first made landfall on August 25 in South Florida as a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of near 81 mph . At one point , after moving west into the Gulf of Mexico , it reached Category 5 status , with maximum sustained winds of nearly 173 mph before making landfall on the Gulf Coast .

Four days after its initial landfall , Katrina came ashore near Buras , Louisiana , as a Category 3 storm , with winds near 127 mph . Initial reports put the wind speed higher , but the National Weather Service later revised its statistics .

Water breached two levees in New Orleans at the 17th Street and Industrial Canals , flooding 80 percent of the historic city .

More than 1,800 people died in five states -- 1,577 of them in Louisiana .
