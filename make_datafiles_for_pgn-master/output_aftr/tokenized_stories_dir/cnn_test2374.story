-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Top Democratic lawmakers called Tuesday for high taxes on the controversial AIG bonuses , as new details emerged on who got those bonuses .

`` My colleagues and I are sending a letter to -LSB- AIG CEO Edward -RSB- Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell the employees that are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily return them , '' Sen. Charles Schumer said on the Senate floor . `` Because if they do n't , we plan to tax virtually all of -LSB- the money -RSB- ... so it is returned to its rightful owners , the taxpayers . ''

Schumer 's comments came the same day New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed in a letter to Congress that AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $ 1 million each .

Cuomo also wrote that 11 of the employees no longer work for the company . The largest bonus paid was $ 6.4 million ; seven other people also received more than $ 4 million each .

AIG has been under fire for awarding seven-figure bonuses to employees while being kept afloat by more than $ 170 billion from the U.S. government 's financial bailout .

The company insists the payouts are needed to keep talented executives on the payroll , but public anger over the moves has prompted Congress and the Obama administration to seek some ways to reclaim the money . Watch Sen. Schumer vow to recoup the bonuses ''

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor Tuesday that the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee will pursue a legislative fix in such a way that the `` recipients of those bonuses will not be able to keep all their money -- and that 's an understatement . ''

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D-Montana , will propose a special tax within the next 24 hours , Reid said .

`` I do n't think those bonuses should be paid , '' Baucus said Tuesday .

President Obama on Monday expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG .

`` This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed , '' Obama told politicians and reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House , where he and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner were unveiling a package to aid the nation 's small businesses .

Obama said he will attempt to block bonuses for AIG , payments he described as an `` outrage . '' See a snapshot of facts , attitudes and analysis on the recession ''

But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics . `` It 's about our fundamental values , '' he said . iReport.com : Sound off on AIG

Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or `` retention payments '' -- by at least 30 percent . That has done little to temper outrage over the initial plan , however .

The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses , which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September , according to the committee aide .

Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets .
