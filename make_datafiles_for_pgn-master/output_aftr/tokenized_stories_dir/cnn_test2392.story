Do n't call him that anymore , because the superstar who blended funk , rock , soul and psychedelic sounds in the 1960s and '70s before disappearing from the scene in the '80s is not in hiding , his youngest daughter said .

`` It 's not like he was n't making music , '' said Novena Carmel , his 27-year-old daughter . `` He was enjoying his life and riding motorcycles , one of his passions . ''

`` She is the force that keeps him straight , '' said Anthony Valadez , a disc jockey with Los Angeles public radio station KCRW . `` I think it 's her energy and their bond that is so sacred that keeps him in line . That 's what brings Sly out . ''

The Sly and the Family Stone founder gave a rare interview to KCRW 's `` Morning Becomes Eclectic . '' Though it airs Monday , the interview was taped days ahead -- given Stone 's 40-year reputation for not showing up for concerts and interviews .

Sly Stone -- who was Sylvester Stewart before changing his name as a radio DJ -- did n't reminisce in the interview about past troubles . Guest host Chris Douridas kept the conversation about the music .

He said he was a child , performing in his family 's gospel group , The Stewart Four , when he first realized the power music has over people . It happened as he sang `` On the Battlefield '' during a Sam Cooke show at the Oakland Auditorium when he was 4 .

`` Towards the end of the song , people starting running down the aisle and I did n't know what was going on , '' he said . `` I did n't know what was going on . I did n't know they were just happy . So , I turned around and ran , and I 've been running ever since . ''

Stone now says he did n't know then where he was heading .

The songs appealed to white and blacks equally and regularly topped both the pop and R&B charts .

Stone 's lyrics often carried dual meanings .

Stone set the stage for other superstars to follow , but the band dissolved after one hot decade and success became as elusive as Stone .

Novena may understand her dad better than anyone these days . She 's lured him back to the stage for several performances , which she avoids calling concerts . With those , `` people expect certain things , '' such as wanting performers to be what they were 30 years ago , she said .

Instead , it 's the `` Sly Stone Variety Show , '' which allows her father `` to do whatever he wants to do in the moment . ''

`` It 's very wild , in the sense that they have the Sly Stone trivia game onstage with diehard fans , '' said Anthony Valadez , who has been to several .

Novena also knows to not plan too far ahead with her dad , so he does n't have time to back out .

`` My dad would be like , ` I wan na do a show as soon as possible , ' '' she said . That gives her just about a week to get the show together and promote it .

P-funk architect George Clinton and actor-comedian Eddie Murphy showed up for the last one , which was a sold-out celebration of Stone 's 66th birthday .

One indication that Stone has changed his no-show habit , which marred his reputation in younger days , is he actually arrives for shows early , Valadez said .

`` Coming early to these gigs , you watch Sly and his affection for his daughter and it 's evidence he would do anything for her , '' he said .
