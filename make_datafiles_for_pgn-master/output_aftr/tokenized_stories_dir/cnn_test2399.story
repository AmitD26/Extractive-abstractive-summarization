UNITED NATIONS -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rift between Russia and Western powers over Georgia burst back into full view on the U.N. Security Council when Russia vetoed a resolution that would have extended the U.N. observer mission in Georgia .

`` The U.N. mission 's previous mandate has actually ceased to exist in the wake of Georgia 's aggression against South Ossetia last August , '' said Vitaly Churkin , Russia 's U.N. ambassador , who said it was `` unacceptable '' to extend the mission .

After the veto Monday night , a statement from the office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the U.N. would `` take all measures required to cease the operations of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia effective 16 June . ''

Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war last August over the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- the first time Russia sent troops abroad in anger since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 . Both sides blame the other for starting the conflict .

The crux of the controversy remains Georgia 's territorial integrity . As a result of last year 's war , Russia now considers South Ossetia and Abkhazia sovereign nations independent from Georgia . Russia has no international support for that position aside from the nation of Nicaragua .

The Georgian ambassador to the United Nations , Kakha Lomaia , addressed the Security Council following the vote , saying his nation deeply regrets the apparent end of the mission . He called Russia 's position `` unconstructive . ''
