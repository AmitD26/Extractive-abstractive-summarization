ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Pakistan 's combustible Swat Valley , some girls refuse to wear uniforms so they can make it to school without being harmed .

Many girls remain banned from schools . Dozens of their schools have been bombed , and militants have burned books .

A new program has taken 26 girls out of the battle-scarred region to Islamabad for a 10-day retreat , where they can learn in safer surroundings .

A group of college students of Pakistani background is helping the girls . Among them are Shiza Shahid , 20 , from California 's Stanford University , who organized the program called Shajar-e-llm , or Tree of Knowledge .

Though well-intentioned , the program sometimes seems disorganized .

The lessons are simple enough -- confidence-building exercises , critical-thinking lessons -- all framed in the context of Islamic values .

The girls -- ages 11 to 14 -- spoke about their dreams . One wants to meet a poet ; another wants to learn calligraphy . Another wants to grow up to lead Pakistan .

`` I want to become president and rule this country in a good way , '' said 12-year-old Malila .

Free speech seemed to end with the song , however . The girls could not risk talking about Taliban harassment , because the militants ' version of Islamic law lingers . Such Islamic law , or shariah , also keeps females from going to school or going outside without their husbands .

The United Nations estimates that 375,000 Swat Valley residents fled their homes during fighting that started in April . In all , 2.5 million Pakistanis were displaced in what was said to be one of the largest human migrations in recent history .

Many residents have returned to their homes , but peace has not been completely restored to the region .

And soon , the girls at the learning retreat will return home to the Swat Valley as well .

Organizers said they hope the girls will carry a new love for education .
