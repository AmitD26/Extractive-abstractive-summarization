It 's the next stop that sets Reed apart from other women . Three weeks a month , she heads to the infusion center at the Emory Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta , Georgia , for chemotherapy treatments .

Reed , 40 , has breast cancer ; not just any form of the disease , but a rare , aggressive and difficult to treat version called triple negative .

Like Reed , the majority of triple negative patients will be young African-American women .

Reed did take care of it . For eight months during 2006 , she endured chemotherapy and radiation treatments . She thought the cancer was in remission , but it returned last November . This time , it had spread to her liver , lungs and chest wall .

`` Triple negative cancers do tend to be aggressive in their natural histories , so they have a very high rate of recurrence or relapsing , '' explained Dr. Ruth O'Regan , Reed 's oncologist at the Winship Institute .

She said what makes it different from other types of breast cancer is that women with the disease lack three hormone receptors known to fuel most breast cancer tumors : estrogen , progesterone and HER2 . Health Minute : More on triple negative breast cancer ''

`` When you have triple negative , it means that we can not use hormone therapy . ... The only way we can treat that type of breast cancer is to use chemotherapy , '' Olopade said .

Tamoxifen and Herceptin , two of the most effective medications for treating breast cancer , do n't work for triple negative breast cancer patients .

`` The challenge we have is when the cancer comes back , '' she added . `` Right now , we do n't have any effective way to treat it , and that 's why when it comes back , it tends to be deadly . ''

Olopade is hoping better drugs will be available in the next two to five years that will help eradicate triple negative cancer cells .

In the meantime , she stressed , early detection is the key to recovery , especially for women at highest risk .

`` We know that women with a family history of breast cancer who have a BRCA1 mutation are most at risk , '' she said .

BRCA1 is a major breast cancer-causing gene that was identified 14 years ago . Olopade said women born with the defective gene have a higher chance of getting breast cancer and at a younger age .

She worried that in general , `` African-Americans are not likely to breastfeed , as they are getting in the work force and returning to work soon after childbirth . ''

Even with several clues , Olopade acknowledged that researchers still do n't know a lot about triple negative breast cancer and more study is needed .

`` We begin screening as early at 25 , '' Olopade said . `` Many of the women are surviving . They are beating the odds of dying because they know they can do preventive approaches to reduce their risk of dying . ''

Reed is trying to increase her chances of survival by getting experimental treatment in the clinical trial . She seems to be responding well , but she 's realistic .

`` There 's always the possibility that once this is done , it could be two years and I 'm back in treatment again , '' she said . `` It really is a part of my life now . ... I 'm a survivor . ''
