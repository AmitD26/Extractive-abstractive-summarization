-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Philippine House of Representatives and Senate were meeting Monday to debate the imposition of martial law in the country 's south by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the aftermath of last month 's massacre of 57 civilians .

`` Lawless elements have taken up arms and committed public uprising against the duly constituted government and against the people of Maguindanao , '' Arroyo said in a 20-page letter to the leaders of the House and Senate .

Martial law went into effect Friday night , allowing arrests without a warrant . Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said it was necessary to impose peace following what has been called a politically motivated massacre . He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days .

The House and Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president 's report , House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday , according to the Philippine News Agency .

The debate began as elite forces of the Philippine National Police clashed in the town of Datu Unsay with suspected followers of the politically powerful Ampatuan family , which has been implicated in the massacre , the Philippine News Agency reported Monday .

Reports said the armed men offered stiff resistance on Sunday against government security forces in a 10-minute firefight , withdrawing after government reinforcements arrived . No casualties were reported on either side .

At least six members of the Ampatuan family have been arrested , including Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr. , according to ABS-CBN . Ampatuan , whose father is governor of Maguindanao , has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder .

Over the weekend , authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family . They confiscated firearms , ammunition and vehicles , Maj. Randolph Cabangbang , deputy of operations for the eastern Mindinao command , told CNN .

`` But it is taking long to build a case , so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects , and allowed us to search , even without warrant . So we really need this declaration of state of martial law . ''

Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country . The Maguindanao massacre , however , is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history , according to state media .
