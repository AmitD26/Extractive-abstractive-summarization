-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the head of the World Health Organization says a new virus is her `` greatest concern right now , '' people worldwide may wonder whether they should be concerned .

This new coronavirus , which experts recently named MERS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus , first surfaced in Saudi Arabia in spring 2012 .

It 's in the same family of viruses as SARS -LRB- severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus -RRB- as well as the common cold -- but the new virus is not SARS .

`` There 's not the same level of concern as there was in Hong Kong or Toronto during the SARS epidemic , '' says Dr. Mark Denison , a professor of pediatrics and longtime coronavirus researcher at Vanderbilt University .

Should I be concerned about MERS-CoV ?

Cases have been reported in three European countries -LRB- United Kingdom , Germany , France -RRB- and Tunisia . But those cases had either traveled from the Middle East or in a few instances were infected through close contact with someone who recently returned from one of the above countries .

What researchers do n't know is how many people may have had mild symptoms and never were reported . The more information scientists have , the more can be done to try to combat the disease .

I recently returned from the Middle East . What signs should I look for ?

If you 've traveled to the countries above and have cold-like symptoms which are getting worse , and you 're having increasing difficulty breathing and a fever , you may want to see a doctor . It 's important to tell your physician where you have been , so you can be tested for regular flu and other illnesses that can cause these symptoms as well as MERS-CoV .

The WHO describes the common symptoms as acute , serious respiratory illness with fever , cough , shortness of breath and breathing difficulties . According to Hartl , the real worry is that patients will develop pneumonia -- most , although not all , of the cases have . Many have also had gastrointestinal problems including diarrhea .

New virus takes more lives , spreads

What should I avoid ?

The original source of the infection is still a mystery , so health officials can not tell you what to avoid to prevent getting this coronavirus .

Researchers have n't identified any animal that may be carrying the virus . Early on in the SARS outbreak , an animal called the civet cat was implicated -- maybe unfairly , because bats were later implicated too .

If you 've recently returned from Middle East and are n't feeling well , stay home and avoid contact with babies and people who may already be sick . Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze -LRB- tissue , sleeve or elbow , not your hands -RRB- and wash your hands frequently .
