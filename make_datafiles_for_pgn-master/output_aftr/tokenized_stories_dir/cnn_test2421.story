CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 17-year-old said Tuesday he is `` blessed '' that prosecutors dropped a murder charge against him in the beating death last month of a Chicago honors student .

`` I 'm just happy to be out , '' Eugene Bailey said , a day after authorities announced they were dismissing the charge against him in the September 24 death of Derrion Albert .

Police said Albert , a 16-year-old honors student , was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School . His beating death was captured on video , which shows him being hit by a person wielding a piece of a railroad tie .

`` I 'm just blessed to have my freedom , '' he said , adding that what happened to Albert `` should n't happen to anyone . ''

Cook County prosecutors issued a statement Monday saying , `` While the charge against Bailey was brought in good faith based on witness accounts and identifications , additional information has developed during the ongoing investigation that warranted dismissal of the murder charge against Bailey at this time . ''

`` I was kind of overwhelmed , '' said Bailey 's mother , Ava Greyer . `` They would n't listen to me . ''

`` I did n't raise no murderer , '' she said . `` He did n't murder nobody . ''

`` We all talk about what is what out here and point fingers at one another . ... These kids need something to do , '' Greyer said . `` It 's not gang-related . They get out of school -- once they 're in school it 's cool . Once they get out of school , the school says ` Forget 'em . ' That 's wrong . Get them some after-schooling programs , some recreation centers 20 hours a week . ''

After being knocked out for a brief period , Albert regained consciousness and tried to move from the fight , but was then attacked by members of the opposing faction , Simonton said . He was pronounced dead at a hospital .

Albert 's death remains under investigation , prosecutors said Monday .

`` We should n't have to worry about walking down the streets , '' Bailey said . `` We all live amongst each other . ''
