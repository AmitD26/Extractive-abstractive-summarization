WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Beginning Saturday , many air travelers will be asked their birth dates and genders when making airline reservations .

The new travel rules are the latest `` visible '' expansion of the Secure Flight program .

It 's the latest `` publicly visible '' expansion of Secure Flight , a program that transfers responsibility for checking air passengers ' identities from the airlines to the federal government , the Transportation Security Administration said .

In May , the federal government began the first public phase of `` Secure Flight '' when four small airlines began asking passengers to provide their names , as the names appeared on the government-issued IDs they would be traveling with , when making reservations .

If passengers are not asked for this addition information , they should not be concerned , as it will not affect their travel , the agency said .

`` Secure Flight is a key tool in confirming that someone identified as a ` No Fly ' does not receive a boarding pass , '' TSA acting Administrator Gale Rossides said in a statement Wednesday . `` Secure Flight will make travel safer and easier for passengers . ''

The TSA says it plans to vet 100 percent of passengers on all domestic commercial flights by early next year and 100 percent of passengers on all international commercial flights by the end of 2010 .
