-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A suspect has been arrested in the slaying of a 19-year-old Puerto Rican man found Friday decapitated , dismembered and partially burned , police said Tuesday .

Authorities are investigating whether the killing involved sex , Guayama police Commander Hector Agosto Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WLII TV .

Guayama prosecutor Jose Bermudez identified the suspect as Juan A. Martinez , 26 . Police had earlier described him as a 27-year-old man from the interior Puerto Rican town of Cayey .

Martinez was scheduled to attend a court hearing Tuesday night at which charges would be lodged , said Luis Bernier , a spokesman for the Guayama police district , which has jurisdiction in the case . The hearing was postponed several times throughout the day . Officials were waiting for a prosecutor from a nearby district , causing the delay , Bernier said .

The FBI was not directly involved in the investigation Monday , said FBI Agent Harry Rodriguez of the San Juan office .

Puerto Rican authorities may ask for help with forensics or other advanced investigative tools the FBI could provide , Rodriguez said .

`` It 's at a very preliminary stage , '' said Lymarie Llovet , a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney 's office in San Juan , Puerto Rico 's capital .

Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory , which means federal agencies have jurisdiction .

Lopez Mercado 's body was found on Puerto Rico Road 184 in another part of town , Barrio Guavate de Cayey , police said .

The slaying has reverberated throughout the gay and lesbian community in the United States , where supporters started a Facebook page called `` Justice for Jorge Steven Lopez -- End Hate Crimes . '' The group demands an investigation by Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno and prosecution of the slaying under the Federal Hate Crimes Law .

Gay activist Serrano said he does not believe anti-gay sentiment is any stronger in Puerto Rico 's Latin culture than anywhere else .

`` That 's the kind of rhetoric that incites violence against gays , '' Serrano said .

Equality Forum , an international gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender rights organization , asked for a federal investigation .

`` Equality Forum calls on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to have the FBI investigate , '' said former federal prosecutor Malcolm Lazin , the group 's executive director . `` The Matthew Shepard Amendment empowers and requires the federal government to prosecute this horrific murder . ''

Serrano said Lopez Mercado was a `` very , very dear friend '' he had met through a mutual acquaintance .

Lopez Mercado often volunteered for gay causes , Serrano said .

The teen 's family is coping , considering the circumstances .
