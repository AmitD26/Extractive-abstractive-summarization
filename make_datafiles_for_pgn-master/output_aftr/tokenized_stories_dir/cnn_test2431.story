OAKLEY , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The black box sat inside a cabinet . Philip Garrido had given it to a friend for safekeeping , and that 's where the friend kept it .

`` He was a whack job , but he was a whack job who sounded like he had a really good heart , '' the friend added .

Garrido and his wife , Nancy , were arrested last month and charged on more than two dozen counts , including kidnapping and rape .

A few days before his arrest , Garrido delivered some documents touting the device to the FBI .

The black box is simple , with a handle , a metal switch and jacks for plugging in headphones . But it provides some insight into the mind of 58-year-old Garrido .

Garrido told his friend and customers of his printing business that the box allowed him to communicate without speaking .

`` He would move his lips and not speak ... and you would be able to hear his voice through the headphones , '' the friend said .

`` People believe in things . I did n't think it was my place to shoot him down , '' Allen said .

Garrido so believed in the power of his invention that he wanted to have the device patented , so he solicited the help of a private investigator last year .

Hernandez said he agreed to help Garrido verify the testimonials that the product actually worked , but he never saw the box . Garrido told him it would be best if he did n't , the investigator said .

`` This was like the last part before he would take whatever he had had to a lawyer to prepare for patenting , '' Hernandez said .

Documents obtained by CNN include a news release that Garrido produced :

`` I can only guess that he knew something bad was going to happen , '' he said .

Meanwhile , investigators will begin excavating part of the Garridos ' California property Monday afternoon after two sheriff 's dogs trained to find human remains alerted authorities of possible buried bones , officials said .

The search is in the same area as a canine alert last week , said Lt. Chris Orrey of the Hayward , California , police department . Ground-penetrating radar also found an `` anomaly '' in that area , Orrey said Monday .
