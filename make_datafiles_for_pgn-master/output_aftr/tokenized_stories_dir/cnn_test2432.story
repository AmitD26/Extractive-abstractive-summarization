London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The British government has apologized and offered compensation to hundreds of people who suffered the effects of thalidomide , a drug once prescribed to pregnant women that later was linked to major birth defects .

Thalidomide sufferers and campaigners hailed the move and said it was long overdue .

Doctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960 , and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year . By then , it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan , though most of the cases were in Germany , where the drug had been available over the counter .

There are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb . Most of them have two or four limbs missing , and some also ca n't see or hear , according to the trust .

One of them is Louise Medus-Mansell , who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs .

`` It is a bonus , something that we did n't think would ever happen , '' she told CNN about the government 's apology . `` There 's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die . ''

Health Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a Â£ 20 million -LRB- $ 32.5 million -RRB- fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims , who are between 45 and 51 years old . The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust , he said , and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older .

`` The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961 , '' O'Brien said in the House of Commons .

The problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing , testing , and regulation of drugs , O'Brien said . That included the enactment of the Medicines Act 1968 , which introduced more testing for medicines prior to licensing to make sure they meet safety standards .
