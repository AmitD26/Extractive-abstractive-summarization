Jon Gosselin appears on `` Larry King Live '' Thursday . He said he does n't want his kids to continue with TV show .

Jon and Kate Gosselin announced their separation and divorce filing -- after 10 years of marriage -- on a special one-hour episode in June . They agreed to share custody of their 5-year-old sextuplets and 8-year-old twins .

`` I had an epiphany one day , '' Gosselin told King . `` I just looked in the mirror and I said , ` I do n't want to be this person anymore . ' I made mistakes . I know I messed up . I do regret a lot of things . But I have to learn from those mistakes and move forward . '' Watch Jon Gosselin talk with Larry King ''

He blamed some of his mistakes on his not having a lawyer when he and his wife signed the show contract four years ago .

`` He had no manager , he had no lawyer , he had no idea what he was signing , '' said Mark J. Heller , the lawyer recently hired by Jon Gosselin .

`` Now I have a sense of empowerment , '' Gosselin said . `` Before , I did n't have any representation . I take blame for not being an initiator . I was an avoider . I was passive . ''

Kate Gosselin said she was `` saddened and confused by Jon 's public media statements . ''

TLC announced Tuesday that it was retitling the show `` Kate Plus 8 '' because of `` recent changes in the family dynamics . ''

Jon Gosselin 's lawyer said the network only fired him `` before he fired the show . ''

The state labor department is investigating whether TLC violated child labor laws by not properly paying the children or getting permits for the past four seasons , Heller said .

`` These kids have been working without compensation for four years , '' Heller said .

The network said Jon Gosselin 's `` latest comments are grossly inaccurate , without merit and are clearly opportunistic , '' noting he and the family were taping as recently as last Friday .

`` Despite Jon Gosselin 's repeated self-destructive and unprofessional actions , he remains under an exclusive contract with TLC , '' the network said .

TLC gave King a written statement insisting the changes were allowed by the contract .

The new show will take `` a deeper focus on Kate 's role in the family and her journey as a single mother building the next chapter in her life , '' TLC said Tuesday . Jon Gosselin will still appear , `` but on a less regular basis , '' it said .

Kate Gosselin 's divorce lawyers told King that Jon Gosselin does not have the legal right to stop the children from appearing on the reality show because of the separation agreement the couple signed .

`` He signed an agreement that party with physical custody will decide if they will be on taping , '' Mark Momjian said . `` He must go to court to change that . ''

Jon Gosselin said his relationship with TLC began to deteriorate at the beginning of the year when network executives began calling him , warning him that he was in breach of his contract .

`` They put me on house arrest '' with bodyguards watching him around the clock , he said .
