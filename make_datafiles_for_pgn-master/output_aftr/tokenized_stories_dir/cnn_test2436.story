Japan is in the midst of an unprecedented recession , so corporations are being asked to work toward fixing another major problem : the country 's low birthrate . Tell us what you think

At 1.34 , the birthrate is well below the 2.0 needed to maintain Japan 's population , according to the country 's Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare .

Keidanren , Japan 's largest business group , with 1,300 major international corporations as members , has issued a plea to its members to let workers go home early to spend time with their families and help Japan with its pressing social problem . Watch more on this story

One reason for the low birth rate is the 12-hour workday . But there are several other factors compounding the problem -- among them , the high cost of living , and social rigidity toward women and parenting .

`` It 's great that we can go home early and not feel ashamed , '' said employee Miwa Iwasaki .
