LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ailing `` Great Train Robber '' Ronnie Biggs -- one of the most notorious British criminals of the 20th century -- was formally released from prison to his death bed Friday after being granted his freedom on compassionate grounds .

Biggs is unable to walk , barely able to communicate and no longer able to eat or drink , Michael Biggs said , adding that the family was `` very hopeful that my father will be able to survive the next few days . ''

Biggs and 14 other professional criminals made off with more than £ 2.5 million -LRB- $ 4.2 million -RRB- in used bank notes -- the equivalent of around £ 40 million -LRB- $ 67 million -RRB- today -- after holding up a mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of the morning . In the course of the robbery the train driver was badly beaten with an iron bar .

Most of the gang , including Biggs , were soon picked up in a massive manhunt after police discovered fingerprints at a farmhouse hideout where the robbers had holed up to split their spoils .

Biggs was sentenced to 30 years in prison but escaped over the wall of a London prison after serving just 15 months -- and spent most of the rest of his life as a celebrity fugitive .

Five years later , Biggs was traced once more by a newspaper reporter . Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Jack Slipper , who had led police efforts to bring the train robbers to justice , flew out to Rio de Janeiro to arrest Biggs , allegedly greeting him at a beachside hotel : `` Long time no see , Ronnie . ''

But efforts to bring Biggs home were frustrated because by then he had fathered a Brazilian-born son -- Michael Biggs -- and authorities rejected British requests for his extradition .

Biggs continued to live openly in Rio , trading on his notoriety by entertaining tourists , selling t-shirts and even recording with the Sex Pistols .

In 1981 he was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers and smuggled to Barbados . But legal efforts to have Biggs brought back to the UK once again stalled and he was allowed to return to Brazil .

By the late 1990s Biggs was in poor health following a series of strokes and running out of cash . In 2001 he flew back to the UK on a private jet laid on by the Sun newspaper . He was promptly locked up in a high security prison but then moved to a facility for elderly prisoners .

Since his return Biggs and his family have campaigned for his parole on compassionate grounds -- an appeal until now rejected by successive justice ministers on the grounds that Biggs had never shown any remorse for his actions .

Michael Biggs said his father had expressed regret for the robbery -- but not for the life he had led in the years since the crime .
