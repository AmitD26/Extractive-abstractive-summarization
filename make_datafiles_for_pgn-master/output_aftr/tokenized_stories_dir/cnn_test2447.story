Elizabeth Smart , now 21 and in college , testified that Brian Mitchell raped her daily .

In fact , her father said , she wanted the man who allegedly kept her tethered to a tree in the Utah woods muzzled and forced to listen to her testimony .

Mitchell was in court Thursday for a competency hearing , but Smart never saw him because U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ordered him removed from the court when he ignored requests to stop singing and disrupting the proceedings . He watched via a closed-circuit camera from another room .

Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart from the bedroom of her Salt Lake City , Utah , home in June 2002 . She testified that she was kept captive in Utah and California until March 2003 , when she was found walking down a street in Sandy , Utah , with Mitchell and his wife , Wanda Barzee .

Public defender Robert Steele says Mitchell is mentally ill , but Tolman said he believes that Mitchell `` has attempted to fool or to deceive the system . ''

Smart 's testimony began with details of how she was abducted at knife point while she slept next to her sister . She was 14 at the time .

She said Mitchell took her to a wooded area not far from her home , performed a marriage ceremony and began raping her . Mitchell often sang about his intentions , she testified : `` He would come up the mountainside , yelling , ` I 'm going to -LSB- expletive -RSB- your eyes out . ' ''

Mitchell also threatened to kill her if she tried to escape , Smart said .

`` He let me lie face-down in my vomit for the entire night until I woke up the next day , '' she told the court . `` He said that was showing my true state , that I was laying face-down in my vomit . ''

`` He said that first I had to be humbled and to sink below all things before arising above all things , '' she recalled . `` You have to experience the lowest form of humanity to experience the highest . ''

Smart , now a Brigham Young University student and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , described Mitchell as `` evil , wicked , manipulative , sneaky , slimy , selfish , greedy , not spiritual , not religious , not close to God . ''

During her nine months in captivity , Mitchell kept her in Utah until the winter approached , at which point he transported her to San Diego , California , she said .

It 's unclear when they returned to Utah , but Elizabeth Smart testified that she convinced Mitchell that they should hitchhike back to Salt Lake City . She told the court her ulterior motive was to return to an area where she more easily could be recognized and rescued .

`` He had a big cable bolted onto my leg , which was strung between two trees , and there was a lock that would slide between the two trees , '' she said . `` He had the key around his neck the entire time . ''

After the hearing , Ed Smart said he was `` amazed at her strength '' and `` I do n't know how she could have done a better job . '' Asked about his daughter 's reaction following her testimony , he said , `` Phew , it 's over . ''

He bordered on tears when asked whether he had learned anything Thursday about his daughter 's abduction .

`` There were certainly a lot of things that I had never heard before , and I had no idea what she had gone through -- so much out there , '' he said .

Prosecutor Tolman said Smart 's `` powerful '' testimony demonstrated that Mitchell was manipulative and inclined to be deceptive , but defense attorney Steele said Mitchell 's guile did not negate his mental illness .

`` Those things can exist side by side : manipulativeness and mental illness , '' he said .

The prosecution plans to call dozens of witnesses when the competency hearing continues at the end of November , Tolman said . Included are people who have been incarcerated with Mitchell , he said .

Asked whether he would be willing to accept a plea bargain , Tolman said there was no indication that one was imminent .

`` We 're inclined to prosecute this case vigorously and present it to a jury , '' he said .
