-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an incontestable verdict on the conduct of the major cigarette companies over four decades : They are racketeers who carried out a conspiracy to deceive the public and target children with their deadly and addictive products .

The court on Monday declined to accept appeals from either side in the massive case that began when the Department of Justice filed suit against the tobacco companies in 1999 .

The Supreme Court 's decision puts the responsibility squarely on elected officials to eliminate the tobacco industry 's harmful influence and take effective action to protect the nation 's health .

The case stemmed from U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler 's landmark 2006 decision that found the cigarette makers guilty of violating civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB- .

The companies , Kessler concluded , `` have marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal , with deception , with a single-minded focus on their financial success , and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted . ''

In short , they perpetrated the deadliest consumer fraud in history . And , Kessler found , they continue their deceptions to this day . The tobacco industry spends nearly $ 13 billion annually -- $ 35 million every single day -- to market its deadly and addictive products , often in ways that appeal to kids .

Even as the FDA begins to exercise its new authority over tobacco products , the industry concocts new schemes to thwart the regulations .

Each time state and local governments consider smoke-free workplace laws , the tobacco industry recycles baseless arguments against these measures , which are proved to protect health .

These continuing actions make it urgent for the trial court to impose the remedies first ordered in 2006 .

They include requiring the tobacco companies to make corrective statements about the health risks of smoking and secondhand smoke and their deceptive practices . These statements must appear in newspaper and television advertising , on the companies ' Web sites and on cigarette packaging .

The trial court also ordered the tobacco companies to report marketing data annually to the government , demanded public disclosure of more internal documents and prohibited the companies from committing acts of racketeering or making false , misleading or deceptive statements about cigarettes and their health risks .

Tobacco use is the nation 's leading cause of preventable death , claiming more than 400,000 lives and costing $ 96 billion in health-care expenditures each year . Elected leaders can no longer stand idly by while the tobacco companies continue to engage in unlawful activity and harm public health .
