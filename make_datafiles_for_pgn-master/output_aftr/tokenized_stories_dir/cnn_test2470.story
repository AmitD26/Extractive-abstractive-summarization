New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the first two days back from his Martha 's Vineyard family vacation , President Obama gave two speeches on two important subjects .

We all come back a little rusty , and hopefully relaxed , from our vacations , and certainly the president and his family are entitled to theirs . But this speech offered nothing new on the most important subject of concern to voters , who in two months may alter the political makeup of the Congress and change the way this president can do things for the remainder of his term .

The president slammed the Republicans one more time . This is his campaign theme , and obviously it is n't working . Besides , the more he blames the Republicans , the more difficult it will be to work with them in January , when they may have a majority or at least a lot more clout in the Congress .

It may not matter if the administration proposes any new measures on the economy , especially if they would require a vote in Congress .

The second speech was given from the newly decorated Oval Office on Tuesday night in prime time . It was to celebrate the `` Campaign Promise Kept '' : the withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq .

I could n't quite figure out what the speech was about . Our combat troops moved out of the cities of Iraq last summer and have n't been in real combat since the success of the surge much earlier . There still is n't a functioning government there and may not be for months to come .

Mr. President , you need to fill in the blanks about what you meant when you said , `` Our combat mission is ending , but our commitment to Iraq 's future is not . ''

It was appropriate to thank our troops and military leadership . It was a nice gesture to tell the country that George W. Bush supported our troops and loved our country , and obviously was committed to our national security .

It would have been an accurate statement to remind people that we were withdrawing our troops because of a Status of Forces agreement signed in December 2008 by Bush and Iraq President Nuri al-Maliki to do so -- and not because Obama had promised this in his campaign .

If not , the president has another tough decision to make . We signed an armistice in Korea in July 1953 -- and we still have nearly 30,000 troops there . Let 's hope that 's not the outcome here .

But , as in his speech on the economy , he raised several issues that will need to be clarified `` in the days and weeks ahead . ''

He gave the clear impression that now that we are finished with the `` bad war '' in Iraq , his term we can focus on the good war , Afghanistan .

I am sure that the more than 100,000 troops fully engaged under the leadership of Gen. David Petraeus already think they are on the offense and did n't realize they were being bogged down by Iraq .

But the president could n't leave it there . He had to return to politics , because every speech will be political between now and November 2 . He went on to say :

`` As we wind down the war in Iraq , we must tackle those challenges at home -LSB- jobs , deficits , energy independence and education -RSB- with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad . ''

In a few short weeks , we Americans get to exercise our voice and vote for a new Congress .
