A Mexican soldier guards the entrance at a Cancún police station where the military is investigating a murder .

Cancún Mayor Gregorio Sanchez Martinez said the move was made `` to facilitate all types of investigations into the triple murder that happened last week , '' the Diario de Yucatan newspaper said .

Salvador Rocha Vargas , the secretary for public security for the state of Quintana Roo , will lead the police force . He said he will take all the pertinent measures `` to clean up the Cancún police , '' the Excelsior newspaper reported Tuesday .

Retired Gen. Mauro Enrique Tello Quinonez 's bullet-riddled body was found a week ago on a road outside Cancún . Authorities said he had been tortured before being shot 11 times .

Quintana Roo state prosecutor Bello Melchor Rodriguez y Carrillo said last week there was no doubt Tello and the others were victims of organized crime .

`` The general was the most mistreated , '' Rodriguez y Carrillo said at a news conference . `` He had burns on his skin and bones in his hands and wrists were broken . ''

Tello had been appointed less than 24 hours earlier as a special drug-fighting consultant for Gregorio Sanchez Martinez , the mayor of the Benito Juarez municipality , which includes the city of Cancún . Tello , who retired from the army in January at the mandatory age of 63 , had moved to the resort area three weeks ago .

Mexico is undergoing an unprecedented wave of violence that some have likened to a civil war . The government is battling drug cartels as the traffickers fight each other for control of the lucrative illicit market .

The latest killings come as Mexico grapples with the highest violent-death rate in its history . Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora reported in December there had been around 5,400 slayings in 2008 , more than double the 2,477 tallied in 2007 .
