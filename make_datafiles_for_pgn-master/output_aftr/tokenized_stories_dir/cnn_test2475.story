It was Roberto Mancini 's first defeat of the season but his team should have escaped with at least a point after a glaring miss by Argentina striker Carlos Tevez .

City dominated the early stages but when Yaya Toure powered into the penalty area and pulled the ball back for Tevez , the striker somehow managed to miss an open goal .

Mignolet was again forced into action in the closing stages by striker Emmanuel Adebayor , as he made a superb reaction save .

At Anfield , a Fernando Torres goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win over newly-promoted West Brom as they bounced back from their thrashing at City last Monday .

The Spain striker volleyed home the winner just after the hour mark after good work down the left from Dirk Kuyt to hand new coach Roy Hodgson his first league win .

Defender Luke Young grabbed the only goal of the game in the ninth minute as he fired home from Ashley Young 's pass .

Everton dominated the game after they went behind but could n't find a way past veteran American goalkeeper Brad Friedel , who made a string of excellent saves .

Alex McLeish 's side took an early lead when defender Roger Johnson stabbed home Lee Bowyer 's left wing cross after just four minutes .

Birmingham went further ahead when striker Cameron Jerome nodded a cross into the path of Craig Gardner and the midfielder poked home at the second attempt .

Their comeback was completed by Robbie Blake 's spectacular free kick in the 81st minute and though Jerome had a late chance to win the game , substitute keeper Adam Bogdan ensured Bolton escaped with a point .
