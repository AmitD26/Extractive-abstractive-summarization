She would not identify the doctor referred to the medical board for consideration of administrative action or the others who were cleared .

Dr. Conrad Murray , who was Jackson 's personal physician when he died a year ago , was not part of the probe , Gasparac said . Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter earlier this year in the entertainer 's death .

The Los Angeles Police Department asked the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement to investigate the prescription practices of seven doctors and a nurse , Gasparac said .

`` After reviewing hundreds of pages of records and documents obtained from the medical practitioners , the attorney general 's office has referred one doctor , who wrote prescriptions to an alias known to have been used by Jackson , to the California medical board for further review , '' she said .

Agents spent several hours inside the Mickey Fine Pharmacy just below the Beverly Hills practice of Dr. Arnold Klein , Jackson 's dermatologist .

Investigators also visited Klein 's office , where Jackson was seen several times in the weeks before his June 25 , 2009 death .

Klein told CNN last year that he never prescribed dangerous drugs to the singer .

Searches of Jackson 's rented mansion revealed a long list of prescription drugs in his bedroom after his death , according to court documents and the autopsy report .

A consultant 's report included in the autopsy said the level of lorazepam , a powerful anti-anxiety agent found in Jackson 's body `` would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol . ''
