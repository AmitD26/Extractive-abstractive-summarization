Department of Homeland Security -LRB- DHS -RRB- Secretary Janet Napolitano and Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate detailed how , courtesy of the federal disaster recovery fund established under the Stafford Act , seven projects in Louisiana will receive more than $ 26.8 million to contribute to the rebuilding process . In a statement released later Tuesday by the DHS , a grant of more than $ 1.6 million to a Mississippi project was added to the list .

The latest projects are in addition to about $ 2.5 billion in funds the Obama administration has given to the region for renewal since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009 , Napolitano said .

According to the statement , the new projects include :

In Orleans Parish , Louisiana :

In St. Tammany Parish , Louisiana :

-- more than $ 1.4 million to rebuild the Salmen High School athletic department facilities

-- $ 3 million for a recreational center and gymnasium

In Jefferson Parish , Louisiana :

-- roughly $ 1.1 million to reconstruct 12 properties so they meet building codes regarding base elevation and flood safety

In Hancock County , Mississippi :

-- More than $ 1.6 million to upgrade Hancock North Central Elementary

Fugate said the Jefferson Parish funding was related to damage from Hurricane Rita , rather than Katrina .

Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Louisiana coast on August 29 , 2005 . It was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes to ever strike the United States , according to the National Hurricane Center . `` Considering the scope of its impacts , Katrina was one of the most devastating natural disasters in United States history , '' the hurricane center says .
