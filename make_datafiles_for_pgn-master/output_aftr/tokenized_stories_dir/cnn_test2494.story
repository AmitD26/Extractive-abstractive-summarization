-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A United Nations representative has condemned sexual violence in the Ivory Coast as the White House met with leaders urging the nation 's incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo to give up power .

`` Following reports of rapes in Cote d'Ivoire , I condemn in the strongest possible terms the employment of sexual violence as a means to political ends , '' said Margot Wallstrom , a special U.N. representative on sexual violence in conflict .

`` From preliminary information , it seems that the assaults follow carefully selected political targeting , '' she said in a statement Wednesday .

The West African delegation met with Tom Donilon , the national security adviser .

`` Mr. Donilon and the ECOWAS delegation reaffirmed their shared commitment to see that the winner of the recent elections , Alassane Ouattara , takes his rightful role as President of Cote d'Ivoire , and their shared resolve to see former President Laurent Gbagbo cede power , '' the statement said .

Human Rights Watch has accused Gbagbo of carrying out a `` reign of terror '' against his people .

`` An in-depth investigation into violations in the commercial capital , Abidjan , revealed an often-organized campaign of violence targeting members of opposition political parties , ethnic groups from northern Cote d'Ivoire , Muslims and immigrants from neighboring West African countries , '' Human Rights Watch said .

`` The security situation for women and girls unfortunately has deteriorated in the western parts of the country , '' since last year , she said .

`` I call for urgent steps to be taken to avert the risk of increased sexual violence and to ensure the protection of civilians , especially women and girls , '' Wallstrom said . `` I would also like to recall that the Security Council last December reiterated their readiness to consider patterns of sexual violence when imposing sanctions against parties .
