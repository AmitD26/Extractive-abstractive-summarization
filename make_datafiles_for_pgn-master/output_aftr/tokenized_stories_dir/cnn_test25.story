-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A possible constitutional crisis loomed in Malawi following the reported death of President Bingu wa Mutharika , once hailed as a positive steward for the southern African country .

Mutharika , 78 , died of a heart attack on Thursday and his body was flown to South Africa , according to government sources .

Banda formed her own party , but remained vice president .

A government spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of the president 's death but declared that the vice president can not take over the presidency .

`` The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency , '' said Patricia Kaliati , who serves as information and civic education minister .

While declining to comment on the president 's condition , Kaliati appealed to Malawi residents to remain calm and only listen to information coming from official government sources .

`` We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power . We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly , '' said Johnnie Carson , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs .

During her news conference , Banda , along with former President Bakili Muluzi , called on Malawians to adhere to the constitution regarding the issue of succession .

Mutharika , a former World Bank economist who studied in the United States and other countries , was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an `` economic engineer . '' He won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014 .

He implemented a subsidy program for agricultural products that was credited with boosting the economy of the largely agrarian nation . Malawians welcomed his focus on reducing reliance on food aid and attaining self-sufficiency .

Anti-government groups accused Mutharika of dragging Malawi back into a dictatorship , citing the passage of bills they say infringe on citizen rights .

Critics also accused Mutharika of jeopardizing international relations and risking foreign aid that benefits the nation 's poor .

At the time , London said it was halting `` all general budget support '' to the nation .

Last month , the United States announced it was suspending $ 350 million allocated to Malawi because of concerns about its democratic governance .
