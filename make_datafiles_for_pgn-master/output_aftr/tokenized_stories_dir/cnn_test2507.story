Berlin -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 48-year-old German man admitted being the father of his stepdaughter 's eight children Tuesday , but denied he had sexually abused her , a German court official said .

The man , identified only as Detlef S. , is on trial in Koblenz , Germany , charged with the sexual abuse of dependents and facilitating the sexual abuse of minors .

He is accused of hundreds of incidents of sexual abuse of his daughter , his stepdaughter and his stepson between autumn 1987 and summer 2010 .

The first allegations of abuse came more than a decade ago , in 1998 , but there was no medical evidence to support the claims then , Germany 's youth welfare office said in a statement Tuesday after the trial opened .

It would not be against the law for the defendant to have a consensual sexual relationship with his stepdaughter , the office added .

DNA test results introduced in court gave a `` 99.999 % '' certainty that the defendant is the father of her children , he said , and Detlef S. admitted Tuesday he was the father . But he denied the charges of sexual abuse , Walter said .

Seven of the stepdaughter 's eight children survived infancy , he said . He did not know the cause of death of the eighth .

The sexual assaults took place in the defendant 's home , in woods nearby and in various apartments near where the family lived , prosecutors charge .

The case is due to run through February 25 , he said .

One of the men accused of paying for sex with the children is due to go on trial March 18 , he added .
