The 5-3 loss denied Venezuela the chance to reach the final of the Latin American tournament for the first time .

The match itself was largely disappointing and finished goal-less , a far cry from the 3-3 thriller played out in the group stages by the same two sides -- Venezuela had come back from 3-1 down .

Uruguay books place in final

`` I do n't want to do them down -- but Paraguay were incredibly lucky , '' he said , in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse . `` But we go home with our heads held high .

`` They chalked off a goal for us , we hit the woodwork three times and created more chances . We should have won but it did n't work out for us . This is how things go with football and I can not reproach my players . ''

`` It 's not that we have been practicing penalties -- we 've been rather lucky , '' he told AFP .

Venezuela will now play Peru , who lost to Uruguay in the other semi-final , for 3rd place .
