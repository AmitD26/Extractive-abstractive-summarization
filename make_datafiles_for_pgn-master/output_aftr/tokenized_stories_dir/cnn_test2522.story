Minot , North Dakota -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With record water levels poised to inundate the North Dakota town of Minot , the mayor and the state 's governor congratulated citizens on an organized and efficient evacuation

Residents were given until Wednesday evening to evacuate because of what state emergency services spokeswoman Cecily Fong called `` historic proportions of water . '' There are also concerns the Souris River may be rising more rapidly than expected , Fong said .

The National Weather Service predicted record flooding as heavy rains and dam releases cause the river to swell at Minot .

Minot got some support from a hometown hero who was halfway around the world .

Actor Josh Duhamel , in Moscow for the `` Transformers : Dark of the Moon '' premiere , asked for donations to the local Red Cross . `` My heart goes out to all the incredible people of Minot & surrounding areas , '' Duhamel said on his Twitter account .

The Souris River , which locals call `` The Mouse '' after the French translation of its name , flows through the center of town , and there are several homes and businesses along its low-lying banks .

Not everyone , however , was planning to evacuate .

Troy Erickson , 44 , lives across the street from the perimeter of the evacuation zone and said he plans to ride out the flood .

He said he is `` a little bit '' frightened because he 's never been in this situation , though he was a toddler during the flood of 1969 .

Minot , in the north central part of the state , is the fourth-largest city in North Dakota . The evacuation order covers a third of its population , Fong said . Residents have until 6 p.m. Wednesday to leave .

The river at Minot , which currently stands at close to 1,555 feet above sea level , is forecast to rise to 1,559 feet on Friday or Saturday -- which would be a record . The river hit 1,558 feet above sea level in 1881 .

CNN 's Richard Benson contributed to this report .
