The case drew national attention when Rep. Judy Chu of California , the aunt of the Marine who killed himself , told a congressional committee about it in September .

`` Lance Corporal Lew was beaten , berated and forced to perform rigorous exercise , '' she said then . `` He was forced to do push-ups and leg lifts wearing full body armor , and sand was poured in his mouth . He was forced to dig a hole for hours . He was kicked , punched and stomped on . And it did not stop until 3:20 a.m. ''

Minutes later , she said , Lew `` climbed into the foxhole that he just dug and shot himself and committed suicide . ''

A military investigation report obtained by the Marine Corps Times said Lew killed himself with a two - or three-round burst from an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon in the early hours of April 3 .

According to the Marine Corps Times story on the report , a message found on Lew 's arm , believed to be a suicide note , said : `` May hate me now , but in the long run this was the right choice I 'm sorry my mom deserves the truth . ''

The incident at Patrol Base Gowragi , in Nawa district , began with Lew failing to respond to radio calls late on the night of April 2 , the report said . A sergeant who found him sleeping told others that `` peers should correct peers , '' it said , as reported by the Marine Corps Times .

The report detailed how two lance corporals , whose names were redacted , berated Lew and ordered him to do exercises in body armor for four hours , with one of them stomping on Lew 's legs at times .

One Marine kicked and punched Lew until being stopped by another , the report said . Less than an hour later , it said , Lew killed himself .

`` At 0343 on 3 April 2011 , while crouching down in the fighting position he had just dug , LCpl Lew leaned over his M249 Squad Automatic Weapon as it pointed to the sky , placed the muzzle in his mouth , pulled the trigger , and intentionally killed himself , '' the report said , according to the Marine Corps Times .
