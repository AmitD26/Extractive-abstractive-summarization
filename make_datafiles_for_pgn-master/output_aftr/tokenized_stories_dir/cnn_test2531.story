Sheen 's representative blamed an `` adverse allergic reaction '' to a medication for the hospitalization .

`` Charlie Sheen has been discharged from a hospital in New York and is returning to Los Angeles today , '' Sheen representative Stan Rodenfield said Tuesday afternoon . `` Everything else is speculation . ''

A woman was in Sheen 's hotel room when police arrived , the source said . The source would not identify the woman .

An ambulance carried him from the hotel to New York Downtown Hospital at 1:30 a.m. , a New York Police Department spokesman said .

A Colorado judge allowed the actor to count his time at Promises of Malibu toward a 30-day jail sentence after he entered a guilty plea in August to a charge in Aspen , Colorado . The plea deal reduced the charges from felony domestic violence charges to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count .

The case stemmed from Sheen 's arrest on Christmas Day after his wife , Brooke Mueller , told Aspen police he threatened her with a knife at their holiday home .

Sheen 's three months of unsupervised probation ends on November 2 , according to an Aspen court official . Since police did not file charges relating to Tuesday 's New York incident , it has no bearing on the Colorado case , the official said .
