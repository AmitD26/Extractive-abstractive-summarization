-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Polish court has ordered the detention of a man accused of holding his daughter captive for six years and repeatedly raping her , ultimately fathering two children with her .

The accusations recall the case of Josef Fritzl , who kept his daughter captive for 24 years and fathered seven children .

The man , whose name was not released , was arrested Monday , Polish national police said in a statement . The court on Tuesday ordered him jailed for three months pending a trial .

The charges against him were not immediately known .

Police said they arrested the man at the train station in Siedlce , a town between Warsaw and the border with Belarus . Police said they believed he was trying to escape abroad .

She described living through a `` hell '' that involved rape , beatings , and being kept as a slave , police said .

In 2005 , the woman said , she gave birth to a boy at a hospital in Wroclaw , in southwestern Poland , police said . Two years later , in 2007 , she gave birth to a boy at a hospital in Siemiatycze , in eastern Poland , also near the border with Belarus , police said .

Both times , the woman told police , she left the baby in the hospital , a common practice in Poland when the mother wants to give her children up for adoption , police said .

The case has drawn comparisons to the shocking incest case in Austria in which Josef Fritzl is accused of holding his daughter captive in an underground network of tiny rooms for 24 years .

CNN 's Diana Magnay in Berlin and Antonia Mortensen in London contributed to this report .
