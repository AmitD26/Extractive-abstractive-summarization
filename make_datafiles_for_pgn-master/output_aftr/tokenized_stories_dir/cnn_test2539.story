Jurado was being held at the West Valley Detention Center and was expected to be arraigned Wednesday or Thursday .

Jurado is accused of shooting Army Spc. Christopher Sullivan on Friday night at a homecoming party in Sullivan 's native San Bernardino . Sullivan was there celebrating his recent return to California from Kentucky , where he was stationed while recovering from wounds sustained in a suicide bombing a year ago in Afghanistan .

Sullivan narrowly survived the attack , which killed five members of his unit and left him with a cracked collar bone and brain damage , according to the San Bernardino County Sun . Sullivan was awarded the Purple Heart after the incident .

He was shot at the party after an `` argument and physical confrontation '' with Jurado , San Bernardino Police Department Sgt. Pete Higgins told CNN .

Accompanied by an attorney , Jurado turned himself in to authorities in Chino Hills early Monday afternoon , said Lt. Gwendolyn Waters .

The fight at the party broke out after Jurado and Sullivan 's younger brother began arguing about football , the brothers ' mother , Suzanne Sullivan , told CNN .

Jurado `` pulled out a gun and shot him twice , '' she said .

Higgins said Jurado fled the scene after the shooting .

`` Right now , my son is hanging in physically , '' Suzanne Sullivan told CNN . `` He 's on 100 % life support . He can move his head and he responds through nodding and blinking to us . His eyes are n't always open , but we try to encourage him to do so as often as possible . ''

She said her son tried to ask what happened to him at the hospital and when they told him he wanted to know , `` Why ? ''

She said she was told that the suspect and her son might have gone to school and played football together . She also said she could n't believe what had happened to her son , who she said joined the Army to try and help her out .

Tears rolled down Christopher Sullivan 's face when he saw the flag of the Screaming Eagles , the nickname for the division , his mother said .

`` He once told me that if defending this country takes his life , so be it , '' she said . `` But to see he survived that , and now for this to happen to him , just breaks my heart . ''

`` We just want justice to be done , '' she said .
