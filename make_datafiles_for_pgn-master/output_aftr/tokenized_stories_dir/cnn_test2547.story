Moscow -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin blamed the United States Thursday for encouraging opposition protests that have broken out since parliamentary elections Sunday .

His accusation followed comments by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this week on Russia 's election in which she called for a `` full investigation '' of apparent irregularities .

The United States had `` serious concerns about the conduct of the election , '' she said , at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation -LRB- OSCE -RRB- in Europe Tuesday .

Speaking on state TV , Putin said Clinton had criticized the elections as `` neither fair not free -- even before receiving reports from international observers . ''

Demonstrators have been protesting against what they describe as electoral fraud in Sunday 's national vote , which kept Putin 's United Russia party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in Parliament .

More than 20,000 people have signed up via Facebook for a protest in Moscow called `` Saturday in Revolution Square . '' If it goes ahead as foreseen , it would be one of the largest opposition protests in the Russian capital in years .

In his remarks , Putin said that `` if people are acting within law , they should be given a right to express their opinion , '' but he said the authorities should take action `` by legal means '' if they do breach the rules .

Speaking in Europe Thursday , Clinton stood by her comments , while recognizing the value the United States places on its relationship with Russia and the `` real progress '' made in a number of areas .

But , she added : `` At the same time , the U.S. and others have a strong commitment to democracy and human rights , it 's part of who we are , our values , and we expressed concerns we thought were well-founded about the conduct of the elections and we are supportive of the rights of the Russian people to realize a better future for themselves . ''

A draft report by the organization 's election-observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes , manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors . The group , which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights , cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media .

There was also `` undue interference of state authorities '' in the vote , the 56-nation organization said in a statement .

She also voiced concern about the detention of hundreds of protesters following the election and `` reports of police violence against activists , journalists and bystanders . ''

Criticism of the electoral process has also come from within Russia .

Spokesman Pavel Palezhchenko told CNN Gorbachev was `` very concerned about how the situation in Russia is developing '' and that the Russian people did not believe their will was reflected in the results .

While she considers Putin 's accusation of U.S. interference to be rhetoric , there is a widespread fear of Western interference in elections . This dates back to the so-called `` color revolutions '' in Georgia and Ukraine , when Russia believed Western non-government organizations and governments were behind opposition protests , she said .

The election outcome may have given Putin a `` great fright '' ahead of the presidential election in March 2012 , she said , but at the same time there is no other credible candidate to challenge him , so the chances of him losing , even without falsification of the results , is very small .

Many democratic nations are governed by parties , like United Russia , who have won a plurality of the vote , rather than an absolute majority , she added .

Opponents of Putin have vowed to continue protesting the parliamentary election results despite the arrests of at least 250 demonstrators Tuesday .

A planned opposition rally in Moscow failed to materialize Wednesday , however , with a heavy security presence in the square where thousands of demonstrators were expected to march , but no visible protesters .

As simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over , Putin has promised to make changes , including reshuffling his Cabinet .
