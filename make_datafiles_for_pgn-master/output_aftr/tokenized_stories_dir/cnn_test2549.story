-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Crashes had whittled the expected field from 22 to five , with wreckage from at least a dozen aircraft at one point strewn about the French airfield .

That account , from the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission , was from 1909 . More than 100 years later , air shows -- which may include air races -- continue to draw millions . In the process , they generate $ 110 million annually in the U.S. and Canada alone , according to John Cudahy , president of the International Council of Air Shows .

`` It 's exciting , it 's incredibly moving to see these airplanes do what they do and handle the way they are , '' said aviation analyst Jim Tilmon , himself a former pilot in the U.S. military and with American Airlines , who then compared it to its risks and thrills with auto racing and other sports .

Such danger was apparent Friday , when pilot Jimmy Leeward 's P-51 aircraft plunged into spectators during a qualifying run at the National Championship Air Races and Air Show outside Reno , Nevada . Nine people -- including the pilot -- were killed , with many more injured .

A day later , U.S. Air National Guard Lt. Nate Nueller said an aircraft crashed at a show in Martinsburg , West Virginia , killing the pilot . Cudahy noted there had been at least 13 deaths at U.S. air shows this year -- after none for 2009 and 2010 .

Still , he said it would not deter him from continuing to participate . Nor would he hesitate to bring family members , as he has done often in the past , to watch planes race .

Air races are sometimes a part of , but distinct from , `` air shows , '' which generally are exhibitions in which pilots demonstrate aerobatics and other aerial moves .

And the fledgling Sky Challenge racing circuit is a head-to-head race that melds the two concepts while adding various safety measures . CEO Peter Newport said he is currently criss-crossing the globe for meetings to set up future events .

Whatever the air race form , Newport said the common challenge is balancing the desire to maximize both excitement and safety . The latter becomes a bigger challenge than with conventional aircraft , since the pilots -- however well-trained -- are trying to push their planes to the limits .

And the Federal Aviation Administration notes that its employees closely examine a race course , monitor pilots ' practice runs , examine their and their planes ' safety records and observe the races themselves . This is all in addition to pre-race inspections of the aircraft .

`` An air race is a very , very high-speed race close to the ground with aircraft that have been modified to fly much faster than were originally designed to fly , '' Tilmon said . `` You can call this an extreme sport -LRB- because the plane and pilot -RRB- are being pushed to the absolute edge . ''

Newport , for one , believes that new technology can make such events safer without losing any of the sport 's luster -- something , he said , is needed to encourage more young people to go into aviation . And he thinks that , once the safety questions are answered , air racing should grow even more popular and take its place among conventional sports like baseball , soccer , golf and the like .
