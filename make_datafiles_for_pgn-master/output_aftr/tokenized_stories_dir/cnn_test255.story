-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He spends most of his time playing golf courses all over the world , but Sergio Garcia 's thoughts are never too far away from what 's happening on a football pitch much closer to home .

For the past seven years , Garcia has been president and part-time player at CF Borriol , his hometown club in the province of Castellon on Spain 's east coast .

`` As any good Spaniard will tell you , we love football . Sport in general in Spain has been great for the last 10 years or so , but football has been great with the Euro Cups -LRB- wins in 2008 & 2012 -RRB- and the World Cup -LRB- in 2010 -RRB- . ''

The 33-year-old is a long-term supporter of Real Madrid , but his domestic allegiances have always been divided between the Bernabeu and Borriol 's more modest 1,000-seater stadium , where his attachment is not only emotional but financial .

Three years later , Garcia was installed as club president of the club , which plays in group six of Spain 's third division and now has more than 150 members .

`` Sergio has done a tremendous job in the past seven years to create a football academy for Borriol 's young boys and girls .

Spain 's dominance of international football and Barcelona 's European Champions League success in recent years has been attributed to strong grassroots support for the game .

Borriol captain Raul Caballero says Garcia 's assistance has been key to the club 's prosperity .

`` It is very exciting and refreshing to see Sergio and his team support and work for the team . It is just a group of friends who love football and they have a common goal to see the team succeed , '' Caballero said .

Swapping golf shoes for football boots is something he does whenever his schedule permits , as it helps him to relax .

Garcia will be looking to rejoin his golfing teammates at next year 's Ryder Cup in Gleneagles , Scotland where , if selected , he will make a seventh appearance for Europe in the biennial match against the U.S. .

But at least the Spaniard has ended the season on a high , lifting his first trophy of the year with a win at the Thailand Golf Championship earlier this month -- a result that took Garcia back into the world 's top 10 .

As golfers around the world take a break for Christmas , Garcia will be keen to recharge his golfing batteries in the way he knows best -- indulging his other sporting passions .

`` I would probably get tired of it quickly . I obviously play football , tennis , paddle tennis and I love watching Formula One on TV and obviously watching football too .

`` I love my sports and try to keep as busy as I can with them . ''
