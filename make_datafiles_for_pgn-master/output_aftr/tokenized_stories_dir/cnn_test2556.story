-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the nation and the world 's attention turned to the impending execution of Hank Skinner in Texas before a late stay by a Texas court , one question seemed paramount : `` Why the rush ? '' The answer to that question is buried deep inside the psychology of prosecutors and the culture of Texas .

Skinner was scheduled for execution on Wednesday for the 1993 killing of his girlfriend , Twila Busby , and her two sons , until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals -LRB- the top criminal court in that state -RRB- issued a stay late on Monday .

While Skinner was found hiding in another house after the murders and some tests showed the blood of the victims on his clothes , he has maintained his innocence . He claims he was in the house at the time of the killing , but was too incapacitated by alcohol and codeine to have hurt anyone .

Even the foreperson of the convicting jury has now stepped forward to ask that the tests be conducted . However , the prosecutors have steadfastly refused to allow such testing , and Skinner 's attorneys have failed -LRB- thus far -RRB- to get a court order requiring those tests .

Academics such as Susan Bandes and Ellen Yaroshefsky have studied the emotional overcommitment of prosecutors , and explain it in part by looking to peer groups . Throughout the post-conviction process , prosecutors are usually surrounded by people -LRB- such as supervisors and investigators -RRB- who share their commitment to a conviction . At the same time , ethical rules keep them away from the person with the highest stake in the game , the defendant , who may want to challenge the outcome .

Among those complaining about the rush to execution has been the government of France . Here 's a news flash : Texans really do n't care much what the French think .

That emotion , enough to tear your own shirt , is the kind of commitment that is in the heart of prosecutors . It is a passion born of good intentions , but one that can turn against the good . Caiaphas was not a hero , and Texans of all people should understand that . The commitment of prosecutors is too rooted in emotion to be a deciding factor in a case such as this , and the objectivity of courts must bring to bear what is right .
