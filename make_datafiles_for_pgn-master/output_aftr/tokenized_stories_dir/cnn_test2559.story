Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brooke Mueller , the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen , will undergo drug rehab at home while caring for her young twins , her spokesman said Monday .

`` Recognizing past attempts at treatment have not been successful , Brooke has decided to take a different approach to deal with her addiction , '' spokesman Steve Honig said .

Mueller will take part in a rehab program during the day , but she will be `` under expert supervision 24 hours a day , seven days a week , '' Honig said . `` In addition , Brooke has requested to be tested on a daily basis for cocaine and other illegal substances so there is no doubt as to her commitment . ''

The 2-year-old sons she shares with Sheen will stay in Mueller 's custody and will `` be cared for by Brooke and their longtime nanny , '' Honig said . `` Charlie and Brooke 's family are all fully supportive of this decision and recognize the importance of maintaining the children 's normal routine . ''

Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar , Escobar , police said . She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute , which is a felony , and third-degree assault , which is a misdemeanor .

The boys and Mueller were part of Sheen 's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network 's `` Two and Half Men . ''

The actor called the allegation `` colorful '' and described the quote attributed to him as fabricated in an interview with NBC 's `` Today Show . ''

Last December , her attorney , Yale Galanter , said that she entered a sober living facility . Earlier , in April 2010 , Mueller had checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a `` return to old problems , '' her representative said .

She was in substance abuse rehab earlier in 2010 `` to get her health in order , '' Galanter said at the time .
