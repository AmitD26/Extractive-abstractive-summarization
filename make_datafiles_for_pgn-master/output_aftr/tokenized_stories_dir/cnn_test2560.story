-LRB- Wired -RRB- -- High-tech sensors are everywhere . They alert us to spoiled food . They monitor our stress levels . And they 're blowing up in the health and fitness space , too , helping us track our key sleep and activity metrics .

And now we have the Philips ErgoSensor Monitor , a desktop display that keeps an eye on one 's posture .

The 24-inch LCD monitor uses a built-in CMOS sensor to determine your distance from the screen and your neck angle while sitting . The monitor works with software made by DigitalOptics Corporation , and , like a worried mother , will remind you to straighten your back , keep your distance from the display , and take breaks from sitting at the computer .

The system can also sense if your neck is inclined at a poor ergonomic angle , and will give you corrective feedback showing you the ideal angle position . And if you 've been sitting for too long , the built-in software will remind you to get up to take a break .

This is an important feature to include in the monitor , Rempel says : `` We know that if a monitor is set too high or too low , and a person has to work with their head in extension , it can lead to neck pain . '' Rempel advises people to set their monitors so that it is at a 10 - to 20-degree angle below the horizon of their eyes .

The eco-concsious can rest easy with this monitor , too . When you walk away from the screen , it will automatically detect that you 're no longer present and power itself down .

The device is also made out of 65 % recycled plastics , and comes with a 0-watt hard switch that lets you cut power completely off from the monitor for zero power consumption .
