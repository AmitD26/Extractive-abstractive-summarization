These meetings began as forums for scientists to meet and discuss findings and generate ideas . They offer opportunities for physicians to learn about new studies and possible new treatments , and for those interested in medicine , the meetings are fascinating and enjoyable .

But over the past several decades , these gatherings have more and more become venues for drug companies and medical device manufacturers to tell physicians about their drugs and medical hardware . Today , much of the presented research is sponsored by industry , and these medical meetings are increasingly an opportunity for companies to make a name for themselves by promoting their products .

Doctors find themselves asking when promotion of a product or a company stops being education and becomes a naked attempt at advertising . Companies have found that the investors watch these meetings like a hawk , looking for the earliest bit of data that may show promising results for a new drug .

Meanwhile , to bolster readership or numbers of viewers , the media reward reporters whose stories can lead to the most eye-grabbing headline . These reporters are well-meaning , but if they do not understand medicine and the scientific process , these articles can truly harm public health . And , in my experience , that is happening more and more often .

And even more important : Reporters must understand that the motivation of every scientific report must be questioned as part of routine due diligence . The caveats from each report must also be clearly detailed in each story . From where I sit , all too often , that is not happening .

I was motivated to write this after reading articles in reputable newspapers in the United States and Europe that a cure for breast cancer was on the horizon and a blood test was coming to market that could detect lung cancer early and save lives .

Unfortunately , by the time measured voices put these stories into perspective , the media have moved on to a new story . The end result of all this is very harmful . The nonscientific public gets misled , and some of those folks who have an interest in a specific disease get their hopes up , only to be disappointed . I was taught by a wise physician that the worst thing we in medicine can do is deceive our patients .

This decline of the professional medical and science writer is a threat to the public health as important as the latest scare story in the headlines -- perhaps even more so . Unfortunately , this is one health threat that has received little attention . Maybe it 's time to change that .
