BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Abu Ahmed says he was there : An Iraqi held prisoner at Abu Ghraib by the American military when inmates were abused .

Abu Ahmed says he and other inmates were held naked and forced to stand in their cells .

He says he was kept naked and saw other naked inmates stacked onto a pile while photos were taken , photos that would become public and bring shame to the United States .

`` They made us stand in the corner of the cell . We were not allowed to sit down . We were not even allowed to talk . '' See the photos of the abuse ''

That treatment went on and on , Abu Ahmed said . `` For 32 days I was without clothes , even if we wanted to pray , we had to pray naked . ''

Abu Ahmed says he saw more abuse from his cell , including one of the incidents captured in one of the infamous photos .

`` One day , they brought three or four detainees , maybe more . They were about 40 years old or older . They took off their clothes , forced them to climb on top of each other and start taking pictures ... I saw it with my own eyes , '' he said .

`` Those detainees , I found out , were former Iraqi officers -- they brought them after a fight inside the camps , they brought them because they were very well respected inside the camp , so they humiliated them and returned them to the camp as a message to the others . ''

The U.S. military fully admits that the treatment of Iraqis inside Abu Ghraib at that time was unacceptable by its own standards , and that detention centers in Iraq today are run on very different lines .

President George W. Bush declared that the `` abhorrent '' acts were `` a stain on our country 's honor and our country 's reputation . '' They made Americans `` sick to our stomachs , '' he said in May 2004 , soon after the photos became public .

Abu Ahmed spent a total of 20 months in U.S. custody , between Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca , outside Basra in southern Iraq .

He says his treatment inside Iraqi facilities was even worse than what he faced at the hands of the U.S. military . His Iraqi captors , Abu Ahmed says , beat him with cables and pipes ; he even had a cement block hung from his genitals .

He does not want any restitution and now works with the Iraqi government , trying to rebuild his life .
