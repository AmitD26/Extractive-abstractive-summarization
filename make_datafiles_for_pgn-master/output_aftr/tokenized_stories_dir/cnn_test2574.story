-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lynette `` Squeaky '' Fromme was released from federal custody Friday , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said .

Lynnette `` Squeaky '' Fromme , left , appears in court in Los Angeles , California , in December 1969 .

Fromme was convicted in 1975 of pointing a gun at then-President Gerald Ford in Sacramento , California .

In a 1987 interview with CNN affiliate WCHS , Fromme , then housed in West Virginia , recalled that the president `` had his hands out and was waving ... and he looked like cardboard to me . But at the same time , I had ejected the bullet in my apartment and I used the gun as it was . ''

She said it never occurred to her that she could wind up in prison .

Asked whether she had any regrets , Fromme said , `` No . No , I do n't . I feel it was fate . '' However , she said that she thought her incarceration was `` unnecessary '' and that she could n't see herself repeating her offense .

Fromme was sentenced to life in prison , and parole was an option at the time , although the federal system later abolished it , Ponce said . Inmates do receive `` good time '' -- for every year and one day they serve , Ponce said , 54 days are lopped off their sentence .
