Michael Taylor -LRB- `` Battlestar Galactica '' -RRB- and Jeff Vintar -LRB- `` I , Robot '' -RRB- will pen the `` Dragon '' script , with Taylor and Bill Haber as executive producers .

`` Dragon '' is a rarity among King 's early works : A stand-alone novel that has n't been previously adapted into a live-action feature . In fact , among King 's pre-1990 books that were first published under his own name , only his fantasy titles -LRB- `` Eyes of the Dragon , '' `` The Talisman '' and the `` Dark Tower '' books -RRB- have n't yet been adapted , though all have been in development at one point or another . And given HBO 's success with its fantasy hit `` Game of Thrones , '' the timing for `` Dragon '' could n't be better .

`` Dragon '' takes place in fictional realm of Delain and follows a teenage prince who is falsely accused of murdering his father , the king . Imprisoned in a high tower , the prince must figure out a way to escape , clear his name , and confront the devious and powerful wizard who is responsible for his father 's death .

Another movie/mini project in the works at Syfy is `` Darkfall , '' from Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris -LRB- `` Kung Fu Panda , '' `` Sleeper Cell '' -RRB- . Logline : `` When , without warning , modern forms of power and technology become a thing of the past , Los Angeles , and the world at large , becomes a place where magic rules and life as we know it is turned upside down . '' Jim Henson Company and Universal Cable Productions will produce .

Syfy is also developing a movie called `` One Mile Straight Down . '' Logline : `` When a powerful earthquake hits California and opens up a chasm bigger than the Grand Canyon , it reveals an enormous hidden ocean lying deep beneath the earth 's crust . Billionaire adventurer James Exeter works with the government to take an advanced nuclear submarine down to explore it and discovers more than he ever could have imagined . '' Skip Woods -LRB- `` X-Men Origins : Wolverine '' -RRB- , Naren Shankar -LRB- `` CSI : Crime Scene Investigation '' -RRB- and Deran Sarafian -LRB- `` CSI : NY '' -RRB- will write and executive produce this one from Universal Cable Productions .
