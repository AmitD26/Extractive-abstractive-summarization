-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iranian authorities have moved imprisoned American Saeed Abedini to a more dangerous prison and are now prohibiting visits from the family of the Christian pastor , according to the public interest law firm representing Abedini 's family in the United States .

He converted to Christianity from Islam . In the Islamic Republic of Iran , a Muslim who converts to another faith can face the death penalty . Abedini was arrested in June 2012 during a visit to his native country .

In a news release , the American Center for Law and Justice -LRB- ACLJ -RRB- said that one of Abedini 's Iranian family members went to visit him at Evin Prison in Tehran on Sunday and was told that Abedini had been moved the previous day to Rajai Shahr Prison near Karaj . The family member then made the hour-and-a-half drive to Karaj and was told that Abedini was not permitted to receive visitors .

Appearing on CNN 's `` The Lead with Jake Tapper , '' on September 24 , near the one year anniversary of his imprisonment , Abedini 's wife , Naghmeah , said , `` His charge was undermining the Iranian government , the basis for the charge was Christian gatherings . ''

She said that at the time of Abedini 's arrest , he was in Iran with that government 's permission to build a nonsectarian orphanage on his parent 's property . She said that he had worked with house churches on visits prior to the one during which he was arrested .

U.S. President Barack Obama also has called for Abedini 's release .

On September 27 , Obama spoke by phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani when Rouhani was in the United States for a speech at the United Nations . The call was the first time presidents from the two nations have spoken directly since the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Iran following the Islamic Revolution and the seizing of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran .

He said prisoners regularly do not receive needed medical care , and some have staged hunger strikes in an effort to receive more humane treatment .

`` Iran 's judiciary should immediately free Abedini and others like him , and allow Iran 's Christian community , and particularly members of the country 's besieged home church movement , to practice their faith free from government interference . ''
