-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His journey started in Nigeria , a taunted teenager with large tumors on his face , driven into deep despair .

Eleven years later , Victor Chukwueke has undergone numerous surgeries and is a step closer to achieving his dream of becoming a doctor .

In a rare act , the United States Congress passed a private bill last week granting Chukwueke permanent residency after years of his living in Michigan on an expired visa . The bill is awaiting President Barack Obama 's signature .

Private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- seldom pass .

His is the only private bill to pass in Congress in two years .

Before coming to the United States at age 15 , Chukwueke lived in the southeastern Nigeria town of Ovim .

Treated as an outcast because of his deformed face , he was depressed and humiliated , he says . His family abandoned him at an orphanage .

He says he considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors .

`` Without them , I would not have met the nun , left Nigeria , arrived in the U.S. and had the miracle to attend medical school , '' he says .

Despite the obstacles , he remains committed to getting an education .

He finished his GED -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college .

A benefactor later helped him attend Wayne State University , where he graduated with a bachelor 's degree in biochemistry and chemical biology last year . He had a 3.82 GPA and gave the university 's commencement speech .

Soon after his graduation , the University of Toledo in Ohio admitted him to medical school . The only hurdle : The program requires him to have permanent residency status , also known as a green card .

Though he qualifies for the DREAM Act , which gives immigrants who came to the United States as minors temporary residency , the measure would not give him the permanent status mandated by the university , according to his attorney .

And so began Chukwueke 's journey to get legalized , a quest that has seen strangers rally to his help .

`` Victor 's story is remarkable , '' says Ragland , who is based in Washington D.C. `` Here is this kid who comes from Nigeria , he was taunted and teased for his diseases , and he comes to this country and excels , despite so many surgeries . It is a testament of not letting anything get in the way . ''

If Obama signs the bill , the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians .

That signature , Chukwueke says , will be his favorite holiday gift .
