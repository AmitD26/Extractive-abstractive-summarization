-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Liangqiao , a small collection of huts and farms in southern China , is known as a cancer village .

It is where Hu Xiaoping , a husband and father and a farmer , died an agonizing death at age 30 one year after being diagnosed with colon cancer .

`` The doctor in the hospital told us not to live here , '' she told CNN through an interpreter . `` He said do n't eat the rice and do n't drink the water . ''

Residents of Liangqiao say their river is polluted because of the iron-ore mine about 35 miles away , which is run by a nationally owned company .

Mining for iron-ore exposes naturally occurring heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium , which are both carcinogens . Without proper water treatment facilities , water contaminated with high levels of these metals is hazardous and can possibly cause cancer .

Jingjing Zhang , an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government , said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades .

`` I always had a dream to live in a place where there 's a clean river I can swim in , but this dream seems very difficult to achieve in China now , '' she said .

The Chinese ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country .

China , along with the United States , is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases , which experts say can contribute to global warming . In terms of total emissions , China is projected by the International Energy Association to become the world 's leading greenhouse gas producing country this year .

CNN talked to the mine 's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine , but said it was n't a problem that could be solved overnight . He said some of the smaller , privately owned mines should share blame for the problems .

The mine has given the villagers some compensation . About 1,700 Yuan -LRB- $ 200 -RRB- for the whole village , Zhang told CNN .

Zhang continues to build her case against the mine , trying to win compensation for medical testing , health care and damage to the village 's rice crops . She hopes to go to trial next year .

China is trying to address its pollution problem . In September , the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration shut down 400 companies for water-pollution violations and suspended 249 other businesses , according to China Daily . And last week China announced a joint campaign with the European Union to clean up China 's two largest river basins . The government hopes to have a dramatically cleaner country by August , when it will be host to the Olympics .

It is too late for Zhu 's husband . She said that after he got cancer he was unable to work and he reluctantly went for medical treatment .

`` He did n't want to go to the hospital because he worried we did n't have enough money to bring up our daughter , '' she said .

Zhu told CNN she does n't have time to be sad . All she worries about is caring for daughter and her small plot of land .
