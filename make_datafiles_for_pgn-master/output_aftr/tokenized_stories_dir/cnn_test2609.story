In December , Dookhan was indicted in Suffolk County in Boston on charges relating to alleged mishandling of evidence and obstruction .

Massachusetts authorities are reviewing the sentences of 1,140 people who are in prison after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan .

In October , police arrested the former chemist on accusations that she had lied about drug evidence she handled while working at a state police lab and pretended to hold a master 's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts .

She allegedly `` lied about the integrity of drug evidence that she analyzed , '' the attorney general said in a statement last year .

The former chemist has admitted to wrongdoing during her nine-year employment with the Department of Public Health .

A preliminary investigation looked into every case Dookhan may have touched from 2003 until she left last March , and it is possible she touched 60,000 samples that were involved in 34,000 drug cases .

`` There will be designated court sessions in each county to hear the cases , '' Chief Justice Robert Mulligan said last October in a statement . `` The Trial Court is fully cooperating with the prosecutors and defense counsel who are responding to these issues . ''

At the time , state police were taking over what had previously been a Department of Public Health drug laboratory , which certified random drug tests for the police departments in Norfolk , Suffolk , Middlesex and Bristol Counties , as well as for Cape Cod and the nearby islands .

During the takeover , authorities learned from employees how they were afraid to verify the work of Dookhan , said a spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security .

Dookhan worked as a chemist in the Hinton State Lab 's drug analysis unit -- which tested drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies across the state -- from 2003 until last March , when she resigned , according to a statement last month by Massachusetts attorney general 's office .

Her work was `` consistently the highest in the lab among her co-workers '' until June 2011 , when an evidence officer discovered that 90 samples of drugs had been improperly `` scanned out of the drug safe '' and that Dookhan 's name appeared on the control card as the primary chemist , the attorney general 's office said .

Dookhan denied writing the initials at first , but she `` later confessed to investigators '' that she forged them `` to cover up her misconduct , '' the statement said .

Last July , Massachusetts State Police investigators interviewed lab employees . On August 28 , Dookhan `` admitted to ` dry labbing ' some of the samples , '' the statement said .
