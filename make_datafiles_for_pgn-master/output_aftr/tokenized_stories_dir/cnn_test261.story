-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A dramatic confrontation in Hong Kong between Michael Bay 's film crew and men who wanted money might be better set in a Jackie Chan movie .

The street vendors allegedly became violent when Bay refused to quadruple the payment they would get for the disruption caused by filming for the fourth installment in his `` Transformers '' film franchise .

`` Yes , some drugged up guys were being belligerent asses to my crew for hours in the morning of our first shoot day in Hong Kong , '' Bay said in a posting on his website Thursday . `` One guy rolled metal carts into some of my actors trying to shake us down for thousands of dollars to not play his loud music or hit us with bricks . ''

Bay , 48 , is in Hong Kong filming `` Transformers : Age of Extinction '' starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz , which is due in theaters next June .

`` Every vendor where we shot got paid a fair price for our inconvenience , but he wanted four times that amount , '' Bay wrote . `` I personally told this man and his friends to forget it . We were not going to let him extort us . He did n't like that answer . ''

Police officers providing security for the production `` jumped on him , '' Bay said . `` But it took seven big guys to subdue him . It was like a zombie in Brad Pitt 's movie ` World War Z. ' He lifted seven guys up and tried to bite them . He actually bit into one of the guard 's Nike shoe . Insane . Thank god it was an Air Max , the bubble popped , but the toe was saved . ''

The younger Mak brother , who was charged with blackmail and assault on a police officer , was taken by ambulance to a hospital for treatment of his injuries , the spokeswoman said . The older bother , who complained that he was not feeling well , was arrested on a charge of common assault and assaulting a police officer , she said .

Three police officers suffered minor injuries , the spokeswoman said .

`` After that , we had a great day shooting here in Hong Kong , '' Bay said .
