It is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years . Weeks before the November elections , his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term .

`` Just watch , '' they said to me , in effect , `` he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the Republicans , insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy . Right on the edge of the fiscal cliff , he thinks Republicans will cave . ''

Obama 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue : gun control . No president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation 's gun culture . Once again , he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front .

In his coming State of the Union address , and perhaps in his inaugural , the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system . Leading GOP leaders on the issue -- Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Florida , for example -- would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan . Obama wants to go for broke in a single package , and on a central issue -- providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents -- he is uncompromising .

After losing out on getting Susan Rice as his next secretary of state , Obama has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments . Rice went down after Democratic as well as Republican senators indicated a preference for Sen. John Kerry . But when Republicans also tried to kill the nomination of Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense , Obama was unyielding -- an `` in-your-face appointment , '' Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , called it , echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues .

Republicans would have preferred someone other than Jack Lew at Treasury , but Obama brushed them off . Hagel and Lew -- both substantial men -- will be confirmed , absent an unexpected bombshell , and Obama will rack up two more victories over Republicans .

Strikingly , Obama has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon Vice President Joe Biden . During much of the campaign , Biden appeared to be kept under wraps . But in the transition , he has been invaluable to Obama in negotiating a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package . Biden was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures .

Avlon : GOP 's surprising edge on diversity

Ultimately , to resolve major issues like deficits , immigration , guns and energy , the president and Congress need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term . Over the past two years , Republicans were clearly more recalcitrant than Democrats , practically declaring war on Obama , and the White House has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections .

But a growing number of Republicans concluded after they had their heads handed to them in November that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center-right position , more open to working out compromises with Obama . It 's not that they suddenly wanted Obama to succeed ; they did n't want their party to fail .

One senses that the hope , small as it was , to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away .

Zelizer : Second-term Obama will play defense

While a majority of Americans now approve of Obama 's job performance , conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness , he is going overboard , trying to run over them . They do n't see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate ; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up . News that Obama is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that sense . And it frustrates them that he is winning : At their retreat , House Republicans learned that their disapproval has risen to 64 % .

Conceivably , Obama 's tactics could pressure Republicans into capitulation on several fronts . More likely , they will be spoiling for more fights . Chances for a `` grand bargain '' appear to be hanging by a thread .
