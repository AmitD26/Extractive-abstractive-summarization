-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- American teenager Sloane Stephens stunned her compatriot Serena Williams on Wednesday , beating the 15-time grand slam winner 3-6 7-5 6-4 to reach the Australian Open semifinals .

Despite Williams ' fitness problems , few had given Stephens a chance of beating the five-time Melbourne champion .

`` You just fight and just get every ball back , run every ball down , and just get a lot of balls in play , '' said Stephens , explaining her strategy after the loss of that first set .

For Williams , it marked the end of a campaign which had pushed her body to the limit .

`` I 'm almost relieved that it 's over because there 's only so much I felt I could do , '' said the 31-year-old . `` It 's been a little difficult . I 've been thrown a lot of balls these two weeks . ''

When one journalist asked Williams if she had considered retiring hurt during the match , it caused some confusion in the press room .

`` Are you kidding me ? I 'm not retiring , '' responded Williams , believing the reporter was asking if she was considering ending her career .

`` Oh , you mean , retiring in the match ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought you meant my career . You 're crazy .

`` I thought about it like for a nanosecond . It 's a quarterfinal of a grand slam . Even if I have to take off in a wheeler before I retire . ''

Defending champion Azarenka had to battle through a tough 77-minute first set against Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova , before winning 7-5 6-1 .

The second semifinal , also due to take place on Thursday , sees sixth seed Li Na take on No. 2 seed Maria Sharapova -- who is yet to drop at set at the tournament .
