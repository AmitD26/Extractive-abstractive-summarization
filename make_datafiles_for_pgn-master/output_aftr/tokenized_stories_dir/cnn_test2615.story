London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Passengers struggling to get away for the holiday season faced further frustration and delays Tuesday , as the EU 's top travel official slammed snow disruptions across the region as `` unacceptable . ''

Heavy snow caused severe disruption to train and plane schedules in a number of major cities days before Christmas , forcing thousands of people to sleep in terminals while they waited for information on their onward journey .

Kylie Deegennars said she had been sleeping on the terminal floor since arriving at Heathrow late on Saturday .

`` We got told on that evening that if we wanted until 6 a.m. the next morning we 'd get more information . We did not get a blanket or a bottle of water until 1.30 a.m. in the morning , '' she said .

Conditions had n't improved since then and Monday night she was still waiting for confirmation of a flight . `` We 're younger , we 've got resistance , but there are babies , there are elderly people , and they 're getting no extra treatment than anyone else . It 's disgusting , '' she said .

On Tuesday afternoon , British Airways announced that it was considering transporting passengers stranded at Heathrow by bus to other UK airports . Terminal five , it said , had been closed as staff worked to clear the backlog of people crowding the main concourse .

London Heathrow is to remain open for the next 24 hours , British Airways said , adding that it was considering bringing planes back overnight to clear the load . The airline said London 's Gatwick terminal was `` congested but not unmanageable . ''

Colleagues Sharon and Cathy were trying to get back to Phoenix , Arizona after suffering a two-day delay to their flights from Munich , Germany . They have been stranded at Heathrow airport since Monday .

Defending the government , UK Transport Secretary Philip Hammond said , `` Nobody foresaw the really extreme temperatures that we 've had . ''

`` This is as a result of extreme weather conditions and also to be frank of a bad call on Saturday by the airport operator who was , as it turned out , over-optimistic about their ability to leave the airport open , '' he said .

The government had offered military manpower to help clear runways which had been rejected , Hammond said . He added that the government was working with authorities to ensure the smooth supply of de-icing equipment and other materials to keep the airport operating .

British transport expert David Quarmby , author of an independent audit on the resilience of England 's transport system , said that the country could not be expected to be able to cope as well as other cities that regularly experience heavy snowfall .

`` It 's very difficult to justify investing in the resources that you find in airports and rail systems and highways in countries elsewhere which always have winters that are as severe as the one that we 've got at the moment . ''

The travel disruption was not limited to airports . Long queues snaked around St. Pancras International railway station in London Tuesday as Eurostar canceled 10 trains , or about 20 percent its normal service between London and Paris .

`` Due to the continuing bad weather , speed restrictions are in place on our high speed lines , adding up to two hours to journey times . As a result we can not operate as many trains as planned , '' said Eurostar spokeswoman Mary Walsh .

Passengers ignored advice to turn up at the station one hour before departure . Some queued for as long as four hours in the London drizzle before stepping foot inside the terminal . During the wait , they were offered pizza , curry , coffee and tea , according to CNN 's Jim Boulden .

Earlier , hundreds of passengers camped at Paris train stations , including Eurostar 's Paris terminal , Monday night while they waited news of the next train , French transport minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told French radio Tuesday .

A message on the Paris airports website said air traffic was `` slowly resuming '' after severe snow disruptions . Passengers were advised to check whether their flights had been cancelled before traveling to the airport .

Heavy snowfall halted all plane travel at Frankfurt airport in Germany for a short time Tuesday , said Thomas Uber , an airport spokesman .

German Transport Minster Peter Ramsauer has asked German state authorities to allow night flights on a case-by-case basis to ease travel chaos at airports .

Major German airports have restrictions on night flights usually from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. and only allow night flights on a very limited basis or in cases of emergencies .

On Tuesday afternoon Belgian authorities had started putting passengers whose flights had been diverted from Heathrow Airport to Brussels on coaches and boats to London .

In a statement posted on its website , the airport advised passengers bound for Frankfurt on Lufthansa flights to make their way independently by train or car .

`` We have seen in recent years that snow in Western Europe is not such an exceptional circumstance . Better preparedness , in line with what is done in Northern Europe is not an optional extra , it must be planned for and with the necessary investment , particularly on the side of the airports , '' he said .
