Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An American-born Israeli man , described by police as a `` Jewish terrorist , '' is mentally unstable and in need of psychiatric help , his attorney told CNN Monday .

Israeli authorities Sunday announced the arrest of Yaakov `` Jack '' Teitel , 37 , a West Bank settler who was arrested last month .

Israeli police and security forces say he has been charged in connection with a string of attacks and murder plots over the past 12 years against Arabs , homosexuals , leftists , messianic Jews and police forces .

Teitel 's attorney Adi Keidar said his client has admitted to the 1997 shooting of a Palestinian man and laying explosive devices -- in addition to other crimes that he was not involved in , particularly the August shooting attack on a Tel Aviv gay youth club that killed two people .

Police said that Teitel initially claimed responsibility for the attack , but they are still unsure about the identity of the shooter .

Teitel , 37 , was arrested last month in Jerusalem after hanging posters in support of the Tel Aviv attack .

According to police , the long series of attacks began in 1997 , when Teitel entered Israel as a tourist and managed to smuggle a handgun on board a British Airways flight to Tel Aviv .

Teitel moved to Israel in 2000 , into the West Bank settlement of Shvut Rachel , married and has four young children . According to Shin Bet , Israel 's security agency , Teitel 's father , who now lives in Israel as well , served as a dentist in the U.S. Marines during the Vietnam War . It is believed Teitel was first introduced to weapons and explosives during his time living on American military bases .

Shin Bet described Teitel as a lone wolf who did not confess his acts to anyone and carefully calculated his moves in order not to get caught . He did not learn the Hebrew language in all his years in Israel , they said .
