Anderson Cooper : What was it about Carolyn 's efforts that first sparked your interest ?

There was something about how hard of a sell it is ; anytime you are talking about inmates or people in prison , people automatically -- there 's some pushback . But with Carolyn 's brand of philanthropy , I just found myself intrigued , and I had to help her out .

Read the 2008 story : Ex-con 's videos keep inmates , kids in touch

Cooper : How does the Messages Project work ?

Something so simple you would think would n't be a big deal , but to a child who 's lost their parent to incarceration , they watch these videos over and over again . It has a really positive effect on them . So many times , a lot of these children end up in prisons themselves , and this is something that might be able to stop that chain .

I think about watching my father 's video . My father 's been deceased for many years . When he was at my wedding , he just said , `` I love you . '' I watch it over and over and over again , and it just lifts me up . To these children , these are not hardened criminals . Oftentimes they are just looked at as Mommy or Daddy . So , it 's very important that the children know it 's not their fault and that they know they 're loved .

Cooper : How did you get involved with the program ?

Peete : I met Carolyn in 2008 and we 've been trying to get together . ... The Messages Project is now in Oklahoma , in Nebraska , in Virginia .

Cooper : It 's an incredibly intimate act , the making of these videos .

Peete : Even being there and watching some of these men , I was moved to tears because I saw how gut-wrenching it was for them to say , `` I 'm sorry . This is not your fault . Daddy loves you and I just want you to be the best person you can be . '' Those little anecdotal things sound very clichÃ © . We take it for granted if we 've got a parent in the home , but hearing that for a child can make all the difference in the world .

I felt like I was doing something not necessarily for the inmates , but for their children . I was impacted by it for the rest of the day , and still am .

Cooper : You were recognized by a couple of the prisoners . What was that like ?

Peete : We walked into the cell block , and ... two gentlemen that came out looked at me . One of them said , `` Hey , Holly . What 's going on ? Remember you met me in Vancouver , and it was 1980 . You were shooting '21 Jump Street . ' '' He said , `` I 've been trying to get a script to your agent . '' ... -LRB- laughs -RRB- Even in jail somebody has a script for you , Anderson . ...

I was just very blown away at his resourcefulness , because sure enough , three days later my agent said , `` Did you meet a screenwriter in jail ? ''

Cooper : What is it about the CNN Heroes project that really caught your interest ?

Peete : I 'm a CNN Heroes groupie . ... The Heroes just use whatever it is that is at their disposal , and I 'm always blown away by what they are able to accomplish with so little . And for no other reason than it is their calling , it is something they are drawn to .
