-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After a decade at the helm of one of the world 's biggest football clubs David Gill will step down as Manchester United chief executive officer in June .

`` It has been the greatest privilege to serve Manchester United for 16 wonderful years -- the last 10 of which as its chief executive , '' said Gill , who joined United as finance director in 1997 .

`` However , I have always been conscious of the fact that , as a member of staff , I was always just a temporary custodian of this marvelous institution , '' added Gill , who will remain a director at the club .

United co-chairman Joel Glazer said : `` David has played a significant role in the success of Manchester United in his 10 years as chief executive and he can take great satisfaction in all that has been achieved on his watch , both on and off the field . ''

Since Gill became CEO in 2003 , United have won four English Premier League titles , the 2004 FA Cup and the European Champions League in 2008 .

`` I have been at United for over 26 years and for 23 of those years my boss has been one of only two men : Martin Edwards , who brought me to the club , and David Gill . I have enjoyed working with both , '' said Ferguson .

`` David has been a magnificent chief executive . Of course , we have had a million arguments , but I have always enjoyed them because I know that David has two great qualities : he is straight and he always puts Manchester United first .

The list compiled by Deloitte does not consider debt , and it was debt which caused many fans to rail against the Glazer 's takeover of United .

By way of protest , a number of fans began wearing green and yellow scarves to the team 's home games , the colors of the Newton Heath club from which Manchester United was formed .

United currently lead the Premier League table by 12 points from cross-city neighbors Manchester City with just 12 matches of the season remaining .

Ferguson 's team are also still in the Champions League and are level at 1-1 with Real Madrid ahead of the second leg of their second-round tie on March 5 .
