Tottenham have strong links with London 's Jewish community and it is alleged West Ham 's supporters sang songs about Adolf Hitler and referred to an incident last week which saw several Spurs fans stabbed in Rome .

West Ham confirmed two of their fans had been cautioned by police for `` racially aggravated gesturing '' on their official website .

`` One of those fans has since been identified as a season ticket holder and has , this afternoon , been sent a letter containing a banning order from the club , '' they said . `` Any other individuals identified can expect a similar swift and robust response . ''

Last week Chelsea 's complaint of racist language towards one of their players from Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg was dismissed by the FA due to a lack of evidence .

A statement on the FA 's website read : `` The FA Governance Department has this morning contacted both clubs and will continue to make enquiries into the matter in the coming days .

`` We note the statement issued by West Ham United FC and encourage clubs to identify and ban for life any individuals involved in incidents of abusive chanting .

Ahead of Tottenham 's Europa League clash with Lazio in Rome last week , a group of their supporters were attacked while drinking in a bar in the city center .

Tottenham 's close association with the Jewish community has led to some of their fans to identifying themselves as `` Yids '' , a term which at different times throughout history has been used by Jews and also to abuse them .

A portion of the Spurs ' support have attempted to `` reclaim '' the word , using terms like `` Yiddo '' and calling themselves the `` Yid Army . ''

Peter Herbert , chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers , who referred Chelsea 's complaint over Clattenburg to the police , said they were prepared to do the same for this incident .

He told CNN : `` We 're in discussions with the Metropolitan Police , I understand the FA have already reported it which they should do with such incidents .

`` There has to be zero tolerance , if these people can be identified they should be prosecuted and banned from football .

`` We 've been in conversation with the Met Police this morning and we 're waiting for a few more complaints to come in from the Jewish community and we 'll make the formal complaint that this should be investigated as a racial incident . ''

West Ham vowed to track down and ban any more of their supporters who were at fault during Sunday 's match .

`` West Ham United are in contact with Tottenham Hotspur to assist them with their investigation into the conduct of a small number of supporters and alleged inappropriate chanting during yesterday 's match at White Hart Lane , '' a statement read .

`` West Ham United will take the strongest possible action against any of their supporters , including enforcing life bans from the club , that are found guilty of behavior which is categorically not condoned by West Ham United . ''
