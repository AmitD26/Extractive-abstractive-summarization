-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 61-year-old man was sentenced Monday to 15 years in federal prison for helping engineer a $ 14.2 million Medicare fraud , including hiring parishioners at the church he co-lead to help with the scheme , the federal government said .

Christopher Iruke was convicted in August -- along with his wife , Connie Ikpoh , and one of their employees , Aura Marroquin -- of conspiracy and health care fraud .

He and Ikpoh were charged in October 2009 with bilking Medicare by fraudulently billing the government for electric wheelchairs and other expensive medical equipment .

At the time , the two were both pastors at a now-defunct Los Angeles church , the Arms of Grace Christian Church . Ikpoh also worked as a nurse at Southern California hospitals .

At last year 's trial , jurors heard evidence that Iruke bought fraudulent prescriptions and documents that the three used to bill Medicare for equipment that were either `` medically unnecessary or never provided , '' the Justice Department said . For instance , they billed Medicare about $ 6,000 for a power wheelchair that actually costs closer to $ 900 .

During the trial , witnesses said that `` they and others paid cash kickbacks to street-level marketers to offer Medicare beneficiaries free -LRB- devices and equipment -RRB- in exchange for the beneficiaries ' Medicare card numbers and personal information . '' This data was used to make fraudulent prescriptions and medical documents , which they then sold to Iruke and others .

Iruke told two of his employees , including Marroquin , to lie to state and federal inspectors and also urged them to talk on cell phones in hopes of evading law enforcement , witnesses said at the trial .
