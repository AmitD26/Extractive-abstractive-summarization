Last year also marked the 36th consecutive year with a global temperature above the 20th century average , the federal agency said Tuesday .

`` All 12 years to date in the 21st century -LRB- 2001 to 2012 -RRB- rank among the 14 warmest in the 133-year period of record -LRB- keeping -RRB- . Only one year during the -LRB- 20th -RRB- century â € '' 1998 â € '' was warmer than 2012 , '' the center said .

The year 's average temperature of 55.3 degrees Fahrenheit across the Lower 48 was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century , NOAA reported earlier this month .

Every state in the contiguous United States saw above-average temperatures in 2012 , with 19 of them setting annual records of their own , NOAA said this month . Meanwhile , the country faced 11 weather disasters that topped $ 1 billion in losses each , including a lingering drought that covered 61 % of the country at one point .

That drought shriveled crops across the American farm belt , which is expected to cause a rise in food prices in 2013 , according to the U.S. Agriculture Department . It also turned forests of the mountain West into stands of tinder that exploded into catastrophic wildfires over the summer , scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes .

The John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon and Mid-Distance Races were rescheduled to March 10 from January 27 because of scant snow .

`` We recently had a big rain storm . Rain , but no snow , which messed up the trails . Lots of people -LSB- in the sled dog racing community -RSB- are doing what we 're doing . There was a race scheduled for last weekend and this weekend , and both of those races were forced to be rescheduled due to lack of snow , '' Olson said .

One musher cited global warming -- disputed by some analysts and politicians -- as an explanation .

`` Last year all but one sled dog race was canceled in Minnesota , '' said Peter McClelland , a sled dog marathon racer and operator of a sled tour business in Minnesota . `` Over the past five years , we 've lost a month of snowy weather on either side of the typical winter season . That 's a big deal , to lose a month when your season is only four months out of the year .

Last year , the Beargrease races were canceled because of `` lack of snow and poor trail conditions , '' the race 's board of directors said .

CNN 's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report .
