`` Hopefully we can find them as soon as possible , '' Andina reported Minister Wilfredo Pedraza as saying . `` All we know is that one of them tried to swim to the coast . The search will continue , even at night , until they are rescued . ''

Workers are scouring the area with the help of helicopters , fishing boats and jet skis .

Pedraza stressed the immediate priority is on finding the missing men but that there will be an investigation into what went wrong .
