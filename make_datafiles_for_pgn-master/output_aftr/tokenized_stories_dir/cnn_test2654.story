So , what 's behind all these headline-grabbing plot twists in comic books these days ?

We have asked some of the creators over the years . Scott Snyder , who writes `` Batman , '' including the most recent `` Death of the Family '' story arc , said he writes stories as if this was his one chance to write about a certain character : `` It 's not so much to make the books as dramatic as possible or to be shocking , but to try to tell the best story you can that feels organic . It 's not been a marching order -LRB- from editors -RRB- . ''

When the Human Torch died in a 2010 issue of `` Fantastic Four '' -LRB- only to return a year later -RRB- , Marvel editor Tom Brevoort spoke to CNN about deaths in comics , `` It 's very easy to develop cynicism about the stories we tell . The only way to combat and conquer it is to have a story that touches on the humanness of people that has emotional resonance and truth to it . The fact of death is something every human being can relate to . I would argue that a well-told story of a character 's demise is not necessarily undone by them coming back later . ''

We recently spoke with three comic book experts , who gave us their thoughts on this phenomenon :

Travis Langley , psychology professor/expert in the comic arts : Declining sales have been scaring publishers for a long time . Not just comic book publishers . Almost 30 years have passed since Egon Spengler told us , `` Print is dead . '' These publishers have to do something to keep this medium alive , and we want them to survive . We want them to thrive !

Andrea Letamendi , clinical psychologist , scientist , comic convention speaker : I do n't necessarily see an increase in incidence with regards to these comic book events in recent years , but perhaps we 're more likely to notice them now . These events have been going on for as long as I 've been reading comics . And that 's been a long time . The comic book industry should n't be faulted for having an equivalent to television 's `` sweeps week . '' When you need a hit , you create an event that will bring in the readers .

Kistler : `` The Death of Captain America . '' That story actually had people mourn and move on from the event ; there was no rush to bring Steve -LRB- Rogers -RRB- back . For a few years , we really got to explore what a new Captain America would be and how the world would be different . When Steve did come back , surprise , he needed to process the whole experience rather than rush into his old role .

Letamendi : I strongly believe that The New 52 's `` Batgirl '' can be seen as a great example of a major plot shift or re-imagining of a story that required readers to let go of a long-loved character -LRB- Oracle -RRB- and begin to believe in Batgirl as a new character , one who 's recovered from a life-threatening attack . The character essentially presented the determination , resilience and psychological strength that she needed to put the cape back on after a severe injury , just as readers were challenging her ability to represent a strong rebooted character . It 's as if we could relate to the weight on her shoulders , because we were a part of that process .

Langley : The same-sex weddings . Northstar 's wedding -LRB- in `` Astonishing X-Men '' -RRB- made sense . These characters , in their fictional worlds , are celebrities . Given how many celebrities made news by marrying their same-sex partners in our world once they legally could , it would have been weird for Marvel 's Earth-616 not to have had a same-sex superhero wedding . Kevin Keller 's wedding in `` Life with Archie '' is important for the opposite reason , because it 's a down-to-earth relationship . Both of those weddings reflect our times and say these characters live in worlds that remain relevant to us .

CNN : Do you see even more of these plot twists on the horizon , or the possibility of comic companies trying to top each other ?

Langley : Competition has value , of course . DC and Marvel are working really hard to find creative new ways to outdo each other , and it 's interesting to watch . Marvel 's growth in the 1960s challenged DC and inspired them to tell new kinds of stories . It 's an exciting time , really . The comic book industry will change , but I 'm actually a lot more optimistic about its future now than I was at the start of this millennium . Everything feels so much more alive .

Letamendi : I think risk-taking comes with a price , and readers of comics are particularly savvy when it comes to storytelling . But competition makes us stronger . These companies -- and not just the big ones , but smaller publishers , as well -- want to be known as the best . And that 's in the storytelling . So with amazing arcs and events , inevitably come happy readers .
