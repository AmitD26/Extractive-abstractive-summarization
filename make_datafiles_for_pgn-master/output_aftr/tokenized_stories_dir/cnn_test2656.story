The museum , Bait al Banaat , or House of Women , in Dubai was officially opened at the end of 2012 by Dubai 's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , showcasing the contribution of women to the country 's history .

`` Women here were not in the media , but they were economically engaged and running businesses . ''

The museum is the culmination of five years ' work for Ghubash , who financed the museum with $ 3 million of her own money .

Ghubash said her grandmothers ' generation contributed far more to the politics , economy , education and literature of the region than has been recognized .

Arianna Huffington tells women : ` Less stress , more living '

She grew up in Dubai in a family where she was encouraged to study .

`` I came from a family where both parents made sure there were books available in the house , '' she said . `` I had freedom to read and to think for myself . ''

Ghubash trained as a doctor at the University of Cairo and for a PhD in London , before returning to the United Arab Emirates as an assistant professor of psychiatry .

In 2001 , she became president of the Arabian Gulf University in Bahrain , a post she retained until 2009 .

She also founded the Arab Network of Women in Science and Technology , and served as its president for four years .

`` My journey in life is very interesting , '' she said . `` I was focusing on becoming a doctor and practicing as a psychiatrist .

`` Recently , I found myself attracted to something different : history and culture . ''

Having achieved her goal in opening the museum , Ghubash is not content to rest and revel in the glory . She is already working on her next project to compile an encyclopaedia of women of the United Arab Emirates .
