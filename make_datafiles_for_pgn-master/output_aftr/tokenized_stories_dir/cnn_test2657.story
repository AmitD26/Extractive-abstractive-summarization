-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Count by count , Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales on Wednesday admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan .

Bales pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges , including 16 premeditated murder counts , in a hearing before a military judge . He admitted to slipping away from his outpost in southern Afghanistan and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012 , a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies .

The move spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings . But he was unable to offer the judge , Col. Jeffery Nance , an explanation for his actions .

`` I 've asked that question a million times since then . There 's not a good reason in the world for the horrible things I did , '' Bales replied , according to Drew Mikkelson of CNN affilliate KING , who was tweeting from the courtroom .

Wednesday 's hearing was held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord , near Tacoma , Washington . Both Nance and Lt. Gen. Robert Brown , commander of the Army 's I Corps , have approved the plea agreement , said Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield , a spokesman for the installation .

In the penalty hearings , Scanlan said the defense also will argue that Bales ' problems were also fueled by drugs and alcohol provided by Special Operations troops at his outpost before the killings .

But Scanlan added , `` There 's no justification '' for the massacre . `` He does n't have one , and neither do we . ''

More than 2,200 Americans and nearly 1,100 allied troops have been killed since the war began in October 2001 . Nearly 15,000 civilians have died since 2007 , the United Nations reported in February .

The United States plans to remove combat troops from the country by the end of 2014 .

CNN 's Barbara Starr and Devon Sayers contributed to this report .
