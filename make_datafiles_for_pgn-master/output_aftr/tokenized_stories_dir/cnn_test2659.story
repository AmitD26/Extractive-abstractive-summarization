-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Look guys , sometimes box office articles just need four headlines !

In this case , the under-performance of `` The Five-Year Engagement '' was n't the only big story this weekend . `` Think Like A Man '' notched a very strong sophomore frame , `` The Hunger Games '' reached a truly remarkable milestone , and `` The Avengers '' flexed their muscles internationally . Oh , and `` Safe '' and `` The Raven '' also entered theaters . We 've got a lot to talk about ! Here 's how the box office shook out :

`` Think Like A Man '' maintained a robust per theater average of $ 8,933 , which was over twice as much as the average for any other film in the Top 20 . After ten days , Think has earned $ 60.9 million , and it now seems headed for a finish near $ 90 million . Not too shabby for a film that cost Sony just $ 12 million to produce !

There 's another Sony title in second place . Aardman Animation 's `` The Pirates ! Band of Misfits '' earned $ 11.4 million over its first three days . The $ 55 million stop-motion animation has already earned $ 63.7 million overseas , so it did n't need a gigantic debut Stateside to sail to profitability .

The film , which earned a `` B '' CinemaScore grade benefited greatly from the lack of other family films at the box office . 76 percent of `` Pirates ' '' audience were children under 12 -LRB- 49 percent -RRB- and parents -LRB- 27 percent -RRB- , and it 's big Friday-to-Saturday jump from $ 2.8 million to $ 5.1 million -LRB- 85 percent -RRB- is indicative of family playability . Interestingly , despite the beardy cast and swashbuckling storyline , only 46 percent of the audience was male , though , which means that women made up the predominant audience for the Top 5 films at the box office this weekend .

Two thrillers failed to ignite much excitement at the box office this weekend . Jason Statham 's latest , `` Safe , '' notched a weak $ 7.7 million -- a low start even for Statham -- while John Cusack 's Edgar Allen Poe-themed effort `` The Raven '' could n't escape its sepulcher down by the sea . It found only $ 7.3 million . Audiences gave `` Safe '' a `` B + '' CinemaScore grade and `` The Raven '' a `` B. ''

Overseas , the big story is Marvel 's `` The Avengers , '' which broke the opening weekend record in 12 countries , including Mexico -LRB- $ 15.9 million -RRB- and Brazil -LRB- $ 11.3 million -RRB- . The Disney-distributed superhero title has now grossed a stunning $ 178.4 million in just five days -- and it still has n't hit powerhouse markets China , Russia , or Japan . This bodes very well for `` The Avengers ' '' U.S. debut next weekend . Will it break the opening weekend record ?

2 . The Pirates ! Band of Misfits -- $ 11.4 million

3 . The Lucky One -- $ 11.3 million

5 . The Five-Year Engagement -- $ 11.2 million
