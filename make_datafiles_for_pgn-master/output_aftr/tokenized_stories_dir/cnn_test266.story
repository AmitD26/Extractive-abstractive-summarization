Zimmerman spoke moments before a Florida judge set a $ 150,000 bond that will let him get out of jail while he awaits trial .

`` I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son , '' Zimmerman said in an unusual appeal directly to Martin 's family before he testified in the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford . `` I thought he was a little bit younger than I was , and I did not know if he was armed or not . ''

Zimmerman 's attorney , Mark O'Mara , said after the hearing that his client was responding to an interview in which Martin 's mother , Sybrina Fulton , said she wanted to hear from the man who shot her son .

Attorneys for Martin 's family , however , called the apology a self-serving act by a man facing a life prison sentence if convicted of the second-degree murder charge against him .

Prosecutors had asked that Zimmerman remain in jail without bond or that Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. set bond at $ 1 million -- an amount O'Mara said the family would be unable to handle .

Lester , however , described the incidents as `` run of the mill '' and `` somewhat mild '' in approving O'Mara 's request for bond .

He will likely remain in jail for at least a couple of days while his attorneys and authorities work out terms of his release , which also include electronic monitoring and other restrictions , O'Mara said .

De la Rionda said no decision has been made on whether to allow Zimmerman to leave the state .

The decision to grant Zimmerman bond followed a hearing in which his wife and parents testified that he was a caring , nonviolent man .

`` I know that he is very protective of people , very protective of homeless people and also of children , '' Gladys Zimmerman testified by telephone .

He also ventured into a dangerous Orlando neighborhood twice a week to mentor a 14-year-old African-American boy , his mother said . She testified that she begged him not to go because of the danger .

`` He said , ` Mom , if I do n't go , they do n't have nobody , ' '' she said .

Zimmerman 's father , Robert Zimmerman Sr. , testified that his son is not a violent man despite previous incidents discussed by de la Rionda during the hearing , including a scuffle with a police officer and a dispute with a woman .

`` I 've never known him to be violent at all unless he was provoked , and then he would turn the other cheek , '' Robert Zimmerman testified .

Zimmerman 's father testified Friday that when he saw his son the day after Martin 's shooting , he was wearing a protective cover over his nose , his face was swollen , and he had two vertical gashes on his head . He also reportedly suffered a broken nose .

Timeline of case

Martin 's family and the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case have rejected that argument , saying they believe Zimmerman disobeyed the instructions of a police dispatcher to stop following Martin , racially profiled him and unjustly killed him .

Zimmerman had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood , according to authorities .

In the call , Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run , prompting the dispatcher to tell him , `` We do n't need you to do that . '' Zimmerman pursued Martin anyway .

After briefly losing track of the teen , Zimmerman told authorities the teen approached him and the two exchanged words . Zimmerman said he reached for his cell phone , then Martin punched him in the nose . Zimmerman said Martin pinned him down and began slamming his head onto the sidewalk , leading to the shooting .

Police have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he had acted in self-defense . A police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head .

Martin was shot once in the chest at close range , Gilbreath said .

De la Rionda declined to comment on most of Friday 's proceedings , including Zimmerman 's testimony . But he said there 's more to come when the case comes to trial .

`` We obviously have evidence we feel we can go forward with , '' he said . `` We did not put our entire case on today . ''

`` They pray that his freedom is only temporary , because the pain he has caused this family is going to be permanent , '' Crump said .
