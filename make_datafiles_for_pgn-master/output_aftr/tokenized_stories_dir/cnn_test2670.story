Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A plan to allow presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. to spend more time away from his government mental hospital and eventually to become a permanent outpatient `` lacks specificity , '' a psychiatrist who has closely followed Hinckley 's case for over a decade said Tuesday .

Phillips said the Virginia mental facility that agreed to provide outpatient programs for Hinckley has not received records from St Elizabeths about Hinckley 's condition it needs in order to construct a program for him .

Hinckley , 56 , was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shootings of President Ronald Reagan , press secretary James Brady , Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and D.C. Police Officer Thomas Delahanty . The four men survived the attack , but Brady was shot in the head and left permanently disabled , and Delahanty 's wound forced him to retire shortly afterward .

The psychiatrist , who is acting as an expert medical witness for the government , testified for the second day on Tuesday in proceedings on Hinckley 's future freedoms .

Witnesses have testified Hinckley has been taking Zoloft for several years after complaining of anxiety . Phillips said he thinks the drug is also meant to help with depression .

Hinckley 's defense attorney , Barry Levine , took issue with Phillips . Levine ticked off a list of symptoms for major depressive disorder from a psychiatry publication that said a patient would need to have five of those symptoms to be suffering from the disorder . Phillips acknowledged that Hinckley does not appear to have five of the symptoms but persisted in his view that Hinckley is experiencing some level of depression .

The hearing will resume next week . Hinckley has the right to testify , but his lawyer said he does not expect to call him .
