-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roger Ebert 's death , coming so soon after he announced he was curtailing his movie-reviewing schedule because of recurring cancer , is being greetedâ € '' especially across the Internet -- with widespread shock , and the kind of grief one feels when one loses a longtime neighbor , a trusted friend , a beloved teacher whose lessons may not have had an immediate impact but became more meaningful with time .

Who could have imagined the American people would ever feel that way about a critic , any critic ?

Opinion : Ebert 's sheer love of life

In fact , it 's only natural the blogosphere should feel the pain of Ebert 's leaving . One could say that blogs of all shapes , sizes and subjects owe their existence in part to the examples set by Siskel and Ebert .

Siskel and Ebert knew about those movies , but they knew many more things those mythical assailants of reputation could not . The broad perspective they brought to movies also widened the public 's view of critics . They were bright Midwestern guys who were , yes , erudite enough to know their European classics as well as the comparative merits of animated Disney musicals . They also were capable of squirting venom on things they did n't like with conspicuous panache .

But their warm manner , open-ended aesthetics and companionable personalities helped viewers understand that criticism was n't always about being , well , critical . It was a way of seeing the world , of thinking your way through something you otherwise took for granted . Their approach made criticism not only less threatening and formidable , but it also made critical thinking seem accessible , even , well , friendly .

Siskel accurately rated Ebert the better prose stylist of the pair . Certainly , he was the more celebrated writer , having been the first movie reviewer to win a Pulitzer Prize for criticism , in 1975 . As idiosyncratic as his style could be -LRB- rakish and puckish when he felt mischievous ; oracular and didactic when he felt messianic -RRB- , he was never conspicuously out for blood the way Simon Cowell , the serpentine , post-millennial , popular prototype of a critic , often seemed to be when assessing talent on TV .

He was never shy about showing off his knowledge of movie history , but he also never made it seem like a closed shop , open only to a favored few . He wanted more readers to like better movies . And he carried out his mission through a website that became as much a trendsetter for other Internet venues as the Siskel-and-Ebert model became for point-counterpoint TV panel shows .

One sensed Ebert 's enjoyment at being a role model for movie geeks who wanted to get their own aesthetic values aired on the Web . As with his late partner , Ebert worked at putting on no airs . He seemed less like a snooty aesthete than a regular guy who just happened to know a little more about movies than anyone else in the neighborhood and set up a little corner stand to talk about them . If , as is often remarked , everybody 's a critic , then Roger Ebert was one of the crucial forces responsible for empowering everybody to believe they 're critics .

Remembering Roger Ebert

This may annoy those who remain averse to the idea of criticism itself . But Ebert , who also used his blog for occasional political or social commentary , would probably reply by saying that , if anything , there are n't enough people engaging in critical thinking when it comes to matters affecting their own lives .
