And it is parental responsibility that has piqued the eight-time NBA all star 's interest in soccer .

`` So this season I 'm really diving into soccer , learning the rules of the game . With Zion , and also my lady , they both love soccer , so I got to get into it . ''

Dwyane Wade 's best advice

Wade is yet to pick a football team to support , but the 30-year-old is keen to sample the atmosphere of the planet 's favorite sport .

It is football 's global appeal that has prompted the NBA to make a strategic marketing push in targeting key markets like China , Africa and the Middle East .

That campaign has been boosted by the success of players like China 's Yao Ming , whose nine-year stint with the Houston Rockets raised the profile of the league in Asia .

`` We take some pride in that . But we got a lot of work to do over here , because they keep getting better and better around the world because of this game . We 're just happy to be the guys that are able to take this game globally . ''

Of all the overseas arrivals that have made their mark in the NBA , Wade singled out for special mention Germany 's Dirk Nowitzki , who was named NBA finals MVP as the Dallas Mavericks beat the Heat to the 2011 championship .

`` Obviously they beat us in the finals and winning the championship really put him up there in his place where he should be in our time . But there are other players that have been there before I played that could be named as well . ''

Despite the NBA 's growth , it has some way to go before it can rival football 's worldwide appeal given the last soccer World Cup final saw global television audience figures peak at 530.9 million .
