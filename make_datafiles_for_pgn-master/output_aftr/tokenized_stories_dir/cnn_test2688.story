When the California native learned of the `` teachNOLA '' program , which sends educators to New Orleans to teach in impoverished areas , she packed her bags and headed to Louisiana .

`` I always wanted to be a teacher , and what better place to teach than New Orleans , where passionate teachers are needed most ? '' she said in a 2011 video .

`` There 's total emptiness in my life right now . I miss my daughter so , so much , no one can hardly believe the impact that she has had on our family , '' said Monette 's mother , Toni Enclade .

`` She 's a beautiful person . She walks in the room , she lights up with her beautiful smile . I ca n't imagine anyone that would take her away from us . ''

Hundreds of volunteers and police have scoured New Orleans , but are no closer to finding Monette .

She left no clues behind .

A night of celebration

New Orleans police said she was last seen on March 2 at Parlay 's , a bar in the Lakeview area of the city .

Monette told her friends she was going to sleep in her car before driving home because she had been drinking , police said .

Authorities said that man has been interviewed and is not considered a suspect in the disappearance .

Jefferson Parish sheriff 's deputies even used magnets and grappling hooks to search a local bayou between the bar and Monette 's home , but found no sign of her missing 2012 black Honda Accord .

On Wednesday , search workers found a vehicle in the waters of Bayou St. John , but it was determined not to be Monette 's car , police said .

The vehicle was discovered by Equusearch , an independent search and rescue team out of Texas that has volunteered to help police comb the lagoons and waterways of New Orleans City Park .

Equusearch found additional vehicles , the group said Thursday , but none fit the description of Monette 's car .

A star teacher

In her first year of teaching second grade at Woodland West Elementary School , Monette turned one of the lowest-performing classes into one of the highest achieving .

But in her 2011 video , Monette said she had no qualms about starting her teaching career in New Orleans .

`` I absolutely do not regret my decision to move out here . Becoming a teacher in New Orleans is one of the best decisions I 've ever made in my entire life . ''
