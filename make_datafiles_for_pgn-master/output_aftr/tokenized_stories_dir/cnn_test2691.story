These men and women joined nearly a quarter of a million others from across the country to take part in the March on Washington on August 28 , 1963 , a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement . Some even had chance encounters with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. .

The most famous moment of the march was King 's `` I Have a Dream '' speech , which he delivered from a podium at the Lincoln Memorial to a crowd of an estimated 210,000 people .

Bernice King 's difficult journey

Patricia Worthy

Patricia Worthy was a college student just looking for a summer job when she got hired as the receptionist at the March on Washington planning office .

`` I do n't think I had a title , '' Worthy recalled . `` I answered the phones . ''

`` I recall one day I 'll never forget , I heard someone say , ` Where is this young lady who handles the phone ? ' And finally I looked up , and there he was -- Dr. King -- and he said , ` I want to meet this young lady . She has put me on the hold twice , and hung up on me once , and I want to know who she is . ' ''

After a career practicing law -- including a case involving the government 's wiretapping of King -- Worthy has been a law professor at Howard University since 2004 .

Lessons from successful movements

At 23 years old , John Lewis was the youngest speaker at the March on Washington and probably the most controversial . He had just been elected to lead the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee .

Lewis ' father was a sharecropper in rural Alabama , where he grew up and went to segregated schools . According to his biography , Lewis `` was inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , which he heard on radio broadcasts . ''

That did n't sit well with his fellow civil rights leaders .

`` On the night of August 27 , 1963 , I received a note under my door from -LRB- march organizer -RRB- Bayard Rustin saying , in effect , that there was some concern about my speech , '' Lewis said . `` My speech was pretty strong . ''

Another march organizer , A. Philip Randolph , also asked Lewis to edit his speech .

Today , Lewis , 73 , is the only surviving speaker . He has represented Georgia in the U.S. Congress for 14 consecutive terms .

Some days , he still walks down to the Lincoln Memorial to stand where they all once stood .

Avery still lives with burn scars from a cattle prod .

Months later , Avery and two of his friends were determined to get to Washington for the March on Washington . They could n't afford to make the trip via traditional means , so they decided to hitchhike the 700 miles between Gadsden and the nation 's capital .

The three youths were put to work making signs for the march at the local headquarters .

Today , Avery continues to serve as a city councilman in Gadsden , a position he has held since 1986 .

The only class MLK taught

Harry Belafonte

Harry Belafonte , a popular actor and Grammy Award-winning singer in the 1960s , used his star power to help bring other celebrities to the March on Washington .

He was successful . The Hollywood list of attendees that day read like a who 's who of A-listers : Marlon Brando , Sidney Poitier , Lena Horne , Sammy Davis Jr. , Charlton Heston and Burt Lancaster , who also gave a speech .

But having the Hollywood stars there was n't just for show or for increased media attention . It also helped calm President John F. Kennedy 's nerves about the march .

`` I believe that their presence did a lot to assuage people who are preoccupied with the fact there could be violence , '' Belafonte said .

`` People would be looking at the occasion in a far more festive way . ''

Belafonte continued his acting and singing career , and today , at 86 , he is still an activist for human rights causes .

Rachelle Horowitz

Rachelle Horowitz took a break from her job at the Worker 's Defense League in 1963 to be in charge of March on Washington transportation -- despite the fact she could n't even drive .

`` And I was totally horrified and frightened about this notion , '' she said . `` And I said something that also in retrospect seems fairly silly . ` How can I be the transportation director ? I ca n't drive , ' which I could n't . I was a New Yorker . And also I had lost my bus on every previous march . ''

Horowitz went on to be Rustin 's assistant and eventually served as the political director for the American Federation of Teachers .
