American troops are scheduled to depart from Iraq at year 's end under a bilateral agreement between the Iraqi government and the United States .

But if violence increases and instability persists in Iraq , it is possible both countries could agree to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq , which now has about 47,000 American soldiers . The figure is down from a high of 171,000 in 2003 .

That prospect of American troops staying in Iraq disturbs many citizens , including the thousands who support al-Sadr , a cleric with grassroots appeal in Iraq 's Shiite cities and neighborhoods .

`` If they decide to stay in our country , then we have to do two things : first is to escalate armed resistance and lift the freeze on Mehdi Army , '' al-Obaidi said .

He was referring to the August 2007 suspension of the activities of the Mehdi Army , al-Sadr 's militia .

U.S. military commanders have cited that move as a major reason for a decline in violence across Iraq , where Al-Sadr 's forces fought American troops during the height of the war .

Emotions on the street were fueled by the remarks of U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who made an unannounced visit this week to Iraq and discussed American troop presence with top officials , including Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki .

`` It obviously would be a presence that 's a fraction of the size of the one we have here now but it 's really up to the Iraqis at this point . ''

That was a change of theme in recent weeks when demonstrators in Iraq have rallied over the same bread-and-butter issues that have prompted street protests across the Arab world .

Protesters in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya called for the release of detainees and compensation for `` the victims of the occupation . ''

`` Some of the protesters shouted , ` No to occupation , no to foreign troops , ' '' witnesses said .

In Baghdad 's Tahrir Square , nearly 300 protesters carrying banners and Iraqi flags , shouted , `` We will not accept life in an occupied country anymore . ''

One of the banners read , `` No to American and Iranian occupation ! '' That includes a reference to Iran 's influence with the Shiite masses and the Iraqi government .

Women carried pictures of their sons and husbands who are missing or were killed during the war .

`` During this war , so many women lost sons and many others became widows , not only Iraqi women but also American women . We are the ones who paid the price of this war , '' said Shima Kareem , who was among the protesters .

Hundreds also turned out in Falluja , in the largely Sunni Anbar province in the west and in Samarra , in Salaheddin province in the north to demand the release of detainees , compensation for victims ' families , and the departure of American troops .
