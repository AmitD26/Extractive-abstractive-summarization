-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the United States is `` lacking of initiative '' on Syria and suggested that could be because of the upcoming U.S. election .

During a wide-ranging interview in Istanbul with CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , Erdogan discussed the 18-month crisis in Syria and touched on a number of other topics , including Iran 's suspected nuclear program .

Erdogan has been prime minister since 2003 . The leader of a political movement with Islamist roots , he established himself as an influential voice and a power broker across the region . He has gained popularity in the Arab world , as well as in Turkey , for his criticism of Israel 's actions in the Palestinian territory of Gaza .

He has taken a strong stand against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's regime , hosting opposition leaders and refugees from Syria . Erdogan has called on the U.N. Security Council to declare a no-fly zone along the Turkey-Syria border .

So far , about 80,000 Syrian refugees have sought sanctuary in Turkey . Ankara has also hosted groups opposed to al-Assad , and is a vital transport route for opposition fighters and weapons into Syria .

`` Well , the biggest danger , not only for Turkey but for the entire region and the world is ... the employment of weapons of mass destruction and chemical ones , of course . If a slightest suggestion of such an attempt should emerge , not only in Turkey , but the attitude of the entire globe is going to change forever , '' he said .

The statement drew harsh condemnation from world leaders , including U.S. President Barack Obama , who said the Syrian government would risk crossing a `` red line '' and invite U.S. military intervention if it uses chemical weapons . Obama is running for re-election in November .

`` I do not believe Israel will attack Iran in the fashion that you described in your question . It 's a very null probability . Otherwise -LRB- that -RRB- would have caused an apocalypse in the entire region , '' Erdogan said . `` But I 'm sure that I do n't want to see anything like that happening in the region because in this day and age , that region needs peace and prosperity and stability .
