World No. 53 Viktor Troicki was suspended by the International Tennis Federation -LRB- ITF -RRB- Thursday after being found guilty of failing to provide a blood sample in a drugs test during April 's Monte Carlo Masters .

`` Now I 'm being charged for refusing to undergo a blood test without justification . This is a real nightmare .

The 27-year-old Troicki confirmed that he underwent a test the following day by the same doping control officer with the result coming back negative .

He also revealed that he had never previously missed a test and had undergone several blood and urine examinations during his career .

But the ITF has taken a different stance on the story , insisting that the doping control officer had told Troicki that `` she could not advise him as to whether his reason for not providing a blood sample was valid , and that no such assurances were given by her . ''

`` I feel like I 'm being treated like a criminal , '' added Troicki as he contemplated the 18-month ban .

`` This enormous sanction makes me speechless . It feels like the world that I help building day-by-day has let me down . It is the worst feeling you can imagine . ''

Troicki reached a career high of 12 in 2011 and has won $ 4.5 million in prize money during his career .

He is the third tennis player to be hit with a ban for drug violations in 2013 .

In February , Barbora Zahlavova Strycova of the Czech Republic was banned for six months after testing positive for sibutramine , a substance which is often found in weight-loss products .

Each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use .

The scheme was welcomed by the world 's top players with Roger Federer telling CNN that it was `` naive '' to think tennis was free of players who use drugs to enhance their performance .

But Troicki believes he was simply misled and insists he has no problem with the current drug regulations .

`` The doping rules are strict and they must remain strict . But this was a clear mistake from the on-site doping control officer who was also a doctor and the person in charge to decide , '' added the Serbian .

`` I am destroyed and exhausted . The whole period I have been thinking about this issue and it 's not over , so I ca n't really describe it .

`` I am not even angry with the doctor . I believe that maybe she was told her organization that she made a big mistake letting me go . She backed up and tried to save her job .
