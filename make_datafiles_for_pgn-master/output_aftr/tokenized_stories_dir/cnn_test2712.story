Philadelphia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Scott Charles walks briskly across a hospital lobby toward a group of high school students waiting to meet him .

Hands spring up into the air from roughly half of the more than 20 students . Without flinching , Charles continues his introduction .

`` What we 're going to do today is take you behind the scenes , pull back the curtain and let you see what we do in treating gunshot patients , '' he said .

It 's all part of the Cradle To Grave program that Charles helped create to reduce violence in what is supposed to be the City of Brotherly Love .

Inside Temple University Hospital 's trauma center , these high school students will relive the final minutes of life of a teenager who was killed by gun violence .

Among America 's largest cities , Philadelphia 's homicide rate is the worst . Guns are the weapons of choice , with more than 80 % of homicides committed with a firearm , according to the most recent police statistics . African-Americans make up 85 % of the victims

`` The tragedy of the parents is n't greater in Newtown than that of a parent of someone who was shot elsewhere , '' Charles said , expressing sadness for the lives lost in the school shooting . `` At the end of the day , their kids are n't coming home , and there 's no way to compare that anguish .

Despite emotions , little happens legislatively after mass shootings

` White noise '

`` That young boy stood over Lamont and fired 10 more shots into him , '' he said , the sound of gunshots playing in the background .

A few students gasp , while others stand stoically with hard-to-read expressions , as Charles leads them into the trauma bay .

One by one , he places 24 red stickers on the body of a student volunteer lying on a gurney . `` He had a bullet wound here ... Lamont had a bullet wound right here ... Lamont had a bullet wound right here , '' Charles says , as he places each sticker on the student .

That number includes 173 preschoolers , nearly double the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty during the same time .

Obama exploring executive orders to combat gun violence

Among those serving on the vice president 's task force is Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey , whose city had a bloody start to the New Year with five homicides in the first 48 hours .

Philadelphia has seen a slow uptick in its homicide rate . Last year , 331 people were the victims of homicides , up from 324 in 2011 and 306 the year before that .

But last year 's toll marks a 15 % drop compared to 2007 , when the city earned the nickname `` Kill-adelphia '' after suffering more than one murder a day .

So where 's the nation 's outrage ?

Daily , inner-city gun violence has become `` white noise , '' said Chuck Williams , founding director of Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence at Drexel University .

`` At this point it 's like , ` Oh , another six people got shot and killed over a week in a poor black community . Business as usual , ' '' he said , shrugging his shoulders . `` So America says , if the urban communities do n't care enough about it , then why should we ? ''

`` If this -LRB- Newtown -RRB- is not enough for all of us to come together and say that something needs to be done , I do n't know what is , '' he said . `` Our kids are dying and they 're leaving us way too soon , and we have the power to do something about that if we so choose . ''

` I hurt the same way '

Bocanegra , who spent 14 years in prison for murder , is now on a mission to save lives . He is featured in the documentary `` The Interrupters , '' which follows the lives of three community activists fighting to interrupt the fervent violence in Chicago .

The shooting in Newtown spurred the nation to respond , from prayer vigils and donations to around-the-clock news coverage of the event . Although moving , the reaction was also sobering , Bocanegra said .

`` A kid growing up in the ` hood has different expectations than a kid growing up in Newtown , '' said Bocanegra , who works with ex-offenders at the faith-based nonprofit Community Renewal Society in Chicago . `` We have worldwide attention on this tragic event in Connecticut , but it shows us how we value life , and it 's a shame murder is n't treated the same across the board . ''

`` Every time there is a loss of life , we have to remind ourselves that these are often children . And we have to ask ourselves where have we failed to protect this child ? '' said John Rich , director of the Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice at Drexel University .

`` We 're using shorthand and stereotypes to draw a conclusion , '' Rich said . `` There 's something undeniably different when we have this scale of horrible in Connecticut . And there 's something undeniably horrible about a killing a day . ''

Both Rich and Corbin want to explain the cycle of violence , not excuse it .

Back at Temple University Hospital , the students head from the trauma bay to a classroom for a discussion before they visit the hospital 's morgue , Lamont 's last stop .

More than 7,000 students have come through the Cradle To Grave program . Amy Goldberg , the hospital 's chief trauma surgeon and a co-founder of the program , said she and Charles are committed because the cost of violence is too high .
