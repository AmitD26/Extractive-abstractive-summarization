The kingpin 's death is arguably the Mexican government 's biggest takedown since President Felipe Calderon launched an offensive six years ago , but the record is mixed on the impact of such successes .

Another Zetas leader arrested in Falcon Lake killing

In a twist , a group of armed men stole Lazcano 's body from a funeral home , though authorities had already taken fingerprints and photographs to confirm his identity .

Lazcano 's death `` certainly weakens dramatically the Zetas , '' said George Grayson , professor of government at the College of William & Mary and author of a book on the cartel . The death is the latest in a string of blows against its leadership , he said .

Other analysts said it was unclear how Lazcano 's death would affect the Zetas .

`` Even though the head falls , there is immediately a substitute , '' said Anabel Hernandez , a Mexican journalist who has investigated the country 's cartels .

Praising the navy 's efforts Tuesday , Calderon described Lazcano as `` one of the most important and most dangerous '' people on Mexico 's list of most wanted criminals .

The organization he led , Calderon said , is behind `` countless high-impact crimes and extreme violence that many communities in the country have suffered . ''

The name of the cartel conjures up some of the most violent images of the drug war : a casino fire that killed 52 people , the deaths of 72 migrants , and tortured bodies hanging from bridges .

7 bodies found in western Mexico

The marines who killed Lazcano had responded Sunday to reports of an armed group in the town of Progreso , in the northern state of Coahuila , the navy said .

They were attacked with grenades thrown from a moving vehicle and a firefight ensued , it said .

Authorities at the scene recovered two assault rifles , a grenade launcher and 12 grenades , as well as a rocket launcher and two rockets .

Another reputed Zetas leader , Ivan Velazquez Caballero , alias `` El Taliban , '' was captured last month .

In ensuing years , the Zetas split into a major drug trafficking organization and have since branched out into extortion , kidnapping and human smuggling .

The cartel is in the midst of a bloody turf war with its former employer , the Gulf cartel , and also with the Sinaloa cartel . The fight for access to lucrative smuggling routes in northern and central Mexico has left thousands of civilians dead .

The violence is particularly acute in three northeastern states that are some of the Zetas ' strongest-held territory : Coahuila , Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas .

The cartel also is blamed for setting a fire at a casino in Monterrey that killed 52 people .

In May , authorities found 49 decapitated and dismembered bodies along a highway in Nuevo Leon . The orders to commit the grisly crime allegedly came from Lazcano , who originally wanted the bodies to be left in a town 's central square . In banners purportedly hung by the cartel , the group denied involvement .

45 days of intel work led to drug lord 's capture in Venezuela

CNN 's Ben Brumfield , Lonzo Cook and Nelson Quinones in Atlanta , and journalist Victor Badillo in Coahuila state , Mexico , contributed to this report .
