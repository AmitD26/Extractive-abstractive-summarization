Official : Russia invites head of Syrian opposition for talks

`` From the outset , the Russian Federation was not an exclusive ally of Syria or President Assad , '' Medvedev said . `` We used to have good relations with him and his father , but he had much closer allies among the Europeans . ''

Russia has `` never said that our goal was to preserve the current political regime , or making sure that President Assad stays in power , '' he added . `` That decision has to be made by the Syrian people . ''

Opinion : Why Russia protects Syria 's Assad

It 's the latest in a series of grim assessments of al-Assad 's chances from Russia , which has been Syria 's leading arms supplier since the days of the Cold War . President Vladimir Putin said in December that Moscow wo n't support al-Assad `` at any cost , '' and Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov noted a few days earlier that the Kremlin `` ca n't exclude a victory by the opposition .

Russia has criticized Western powers , including the United States , that have recognized the opposition as Syria 's rightful leadership . Russia and China have blocked U.N. Security Council attempts to take action to end the conflict and force al-Assad to step down .

But Medvedev warned that if al-Assad 's rule is `` swept away '' by the revolt , the result could be a conflict among its successors that could last `` for decades . '' Asked about concerns that jihadists could use a successful campaign in Syria to spread into southern Russia , where Islamic militant groups have been battling Moscow for more than a decade , he said that prospect should alarm the West as well .

`` They can travel to Europe . They tried to . And in the U.S. , '' Medvedev said . `` So it is alarming for all of us . It does not mean , though , that we should bring to power radical opposition leaders . It should be a difficult process , led by civil society . ''
