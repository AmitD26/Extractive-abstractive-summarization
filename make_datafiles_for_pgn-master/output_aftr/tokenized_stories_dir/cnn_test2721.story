Once the geeks climb aboard the StartupBus , the clock begins ticking .

By compressing the time from concept to prototype , the StartupBus becomes a pedal-to-the-metal business incubator , a rolling microcosm of what participants will encounter when they hit SXSW 's packed panels and parties , March 11 to 20 .

In fact , the StartupBus itself could be considered a meta startup : Organizers this year are developing an online game , the StartupBus Stock Exchange , in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they 're built on the buses .

Players can upgrade their firms and win badges for accomplishments , all while real-world actions by the startup teams affect their standing .

From San Francisco to Austin

When the buses arrive in Austin , development stops . After the mental and physical brutality , teams present their hurried masterpieces to a panel of expert judges during the interactive portion of this year 's SXSW festival .

Because of the networking opportunities , the publicity from last year 's contest and the sheer challenge of the undertaking , StartupBus founder Elias Bizannes was flooded with applications this year from prospective buspreneurs . In 2010 , 50 people applied and 25 were selected .

`` We 've had better applicants with more impressive pitches than the ones we 've seen in the job openings at the places we work , '' says Bizannes , who is a financial manager at search engine Vast.com and a scout for the AngelList group of investors .

Two teams won last year : DormDorm , a startup designed to rent colleges ' vacant dorm rooms to travelers during the summer , and DateBrowsr , a Hot or Not for dating profiles the service pulled from several sites .

`` I 've made at least a few very close friends in the experience , '' says Huckestein , now one of this year 's San Francisco bus conductors , who does double duty as an IT worker during the beat-the-clock coding marathon . `` I believe this is largely due to the incredible constraints . ''

The San Francisco teams drained a keg of Spaten Monday night at the offices of startup networking site YouNoodle . The meet-and-greet gave the buspreneurs a chance to sniff out potential teammates and competitors . And to exchange quips .

`` You look like an Android user , '' said Volly founder and CEO Max Mullen to Ghost Nest founder Reid Evans , who is , in fact , an iPhone user .

The exact prizes for this year 's StartupBus competition are still being decided -LRB- iPads and incubator access have been mentioned -RRB- , but perhaps the most important rewards for participants are the networking opportunities and the potential for publicity .
