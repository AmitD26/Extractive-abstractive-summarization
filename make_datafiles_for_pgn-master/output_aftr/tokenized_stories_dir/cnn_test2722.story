-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last month at Zaatari , the second-largest refugee camp in the world , I met an accountant who carried his 6-day-old baby across the Jordanian border from Syria , and a mother who can not find her 20-year-old son -- and knows all too well what has likely happened to him . I saw parents too frightened to let their children out of their sight , even to go to school .

First and foremost is the question of how to keep borders open for refugees . More than 2 million Syrian refugees have now fled their country . The hospitality of Syria 's neighboring states towards these refugees has been breathtaking .

While the Jordanian border remains officially open , over the summer UN officials reported `` artificially low '' arrivals , suggesting that would-be refugees may be encountering obstacles to their escape . Hurdles are also emerging for Syrians wishing to cross the Lebanese border . As the crisis escalates , redoubled international support is needed to ensure Syria 's neighbors can accept new arrivals . This support must benefit not only the refugees but also the communities that are hosting them .

A second , related question is how to get Syrian refugee children into school . Last month -- it really was a hellish month -- marked what the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees called a `` shameful milestone '' : The number of Syrian refugee children reached 1 million . Many of these children are not in school -LRB- by some estimates , 75 % of children in Zaatari are not in school -RRB- and have already missed months if not years of schooling inside Syria before fleeing abroad .

Deprived of educational opportunities , these children are at risk of future unemployment , social marginalization and frustration , potentially prompting them to turn to extremist causes . More attention and assistance is needed inside and outside the camps to overcome the barriers that are keeping refugee children out of class .

Equally important is the question of how to do more to assist the estimated 5.1 million Syrians who are displaced within their own country . Two million of these are minors , and many are at risk of physical violence and forced recruitment . The internally displaced are much more difficult for humanitarian groups to reach , and are out of the media spotlight , which is trained on refugee camps and settlements in neighboring states . But we need to be asking what new and creative ways can be found to improve protection and support for this population .

Last , but certainly not least , is the question of how to strengthen Syria 's democratic opposition . This is not just a matter of access to weapons and military training , but the development of civil society organizations . Many Syrian refugees have already banded together to support others inside and outside Syria , including through the provision of medical assistance . We need to be asking what more can be done to strengthen and scale up such laudable initiatives .
