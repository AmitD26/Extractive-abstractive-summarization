London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Its windows are boarded up , the red-painted exterior is peeling and the roof could do with re-tiling -- but this derelict house in a village in the Borinage region of Belgium was once the home of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh .

The house and surrounding industrial area , in the village of Petit Wasmes , might not look too impressive , but it was here that Van Gogh decided to become an artist .

An exhibition covering Van Gogh 's time in the region is planned for the Mons Museum of Fine Arts , while a documentary exploring the artist 's life as an evangelical preacher among the mining community there is also in the works , with the house sure to feature .

The municipality plans to fully restore the house , so that it will eventually look as it did when Van Gogh lived there .

`` We are a very poor region and it 's really amazing to know that someone as celebrated as Vincent van Gogh stayed there , '' he said .

According to Teio Meedendorp , an expert on Van Gogh at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam , local people in the Borinage still `` have a lot of sympathy for Vincent himself , because he had an eye for their needs and troubles . ''

But it was when he was discharged from his job as a preacher that he made the decision , on the advice of his brother , to become an artist .

In a letter to his brother in 1880 , Van Gogh said of the drawing : `` I have made a hasty scribble of miners and haulers -LRB- both boys and girls -RRB- going to the shaft in the morning through the snow , by a path along a thorn hedge ; passing shadows , dimly visible in the twilight . ''

According to Meedendorp , there is very little evidence left of Van Gogh 's time in the Borinage , which is why the house is so important .

`` I have a lot of sympathy for that region , '' said Meedendorp .

`` From the tourist point of view -LSB- the house -RSB- would help the region get some attention , '' he said .

And for those who ca n't wait , an exhibition entitled `` Van Gogh Up Close '' opens at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in February , while the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is currently focusing on Van Gogh 's studio practice .
