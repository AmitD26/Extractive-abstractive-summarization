The man suspected of killing Sarai Sierra , an American tourist who went missing on January 22 , was caught in the border province of Hatay , according to a statement by the Hatay governorate .

Turkish television showed video of police marching Ziya to an armored personnel carrier . After he was apprehended in Hatay , he was flown to Istanbul for processing late Sunday .

In a strange twist to a mystery that has been front-page news for weeks in Turkey , it appears the suspect fled to neighboring Syria in an attempt to escape Turkish authorities .

It is not clear whether the confession can be legally admitted as evidence in court , because it is possible the suspect made the video under pressure or threats from his captors in Syria .

`` I lost myself . I ca n't really remember how it happened , '' Ziya said in the video .

`` I must have hit her on the head with a heavy object , '' he said , adding that he was under the influence of an `` extreme amount '' of paint thinner .

`` When I came to , she was dead . I covered her up , '' he said .

In the video , the suspect said he first fled to Karabuk , his hometown in the Black Sea region of Turkey , then to the border and into Syria .

The delivery of suspects in Syria wanted by Turkish authorities twice in less than two weeks suggests armed groups inside Syria are cooperating closely with Turkish security forces .
