The Tiananmen Square crash -- which took place Monday in the politically sensitive heart of the Chinese capital underneath a giant portrait of Mao Zedong -- would be the most high-profile attack in recent years .

Five suspects arrested

But details on the group 's activities and capacity are scarce .

And they identified the three people inside the vehicle , which plowed through crowds of people before hitting the rail of a pedestrian bridge in front of the Forbidden City and bursting into flames , as members of the same family with Uyghur-sounding names .

Questions over transparency

The World Uyghur Congress , a diaspora group , has urged caution about the Chinese government 's account of the Tiananmen crash .

`` The Chinese government will not hesitate to concoct a version of the incident in Beijing , so as to further impose repressive measures on the Uyghur people , '' it said in a statement earlier this week , citing a lack of transparency over the investigation .

State media inside China have given relatively limited coverage to the story . Images posted immediately after the incident on Weibo , China 's version of Twitter , which showed black smoke and a vehicle engulfed in flames , were largely deleted .

Simmering tensions

Tensions have run high in Xinjiang between Uyghurs and the millions of Han Chinese people who have migrated to the large , resource-rich region over the past several decades .

Uyghurs complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces , despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony . Activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the Uyghurs ' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the Uyghur language .

Beijing exaggerates the threat from Uyghur separatist groups , Sean Roberts , an associate professor at the Elliott School for International Affairs at George Washington University , said this week . Little of the violence that has occurred inside Xinjiang should be considered terrorism , according to Roberts .

`` Most of it looks like spontaneous civil unrest or isolated revenge violence carried out by individuals or small groups of local citizens , rather than by an organized militant group , '' he said .

However , Uyghur groups claimed responsibility for bus bombs in Shanghai and Yunnan prior to the Beijing Olympics in 2008 . The Chinese government blamed an attempted hijacking of a flight in 2012 on Uyghurs .
