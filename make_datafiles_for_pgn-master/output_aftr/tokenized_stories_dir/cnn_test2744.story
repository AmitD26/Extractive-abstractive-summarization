The Washington-based American Center for Law and Justice argued in a federal district court filing that the organizations ' First Amendment free speech rights and Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated , among other things . The group also contends that the IRS violated its own regulations .

The filing by the ACLJ -- founded by televangelist Pat Robertson -- asks the court to rule that Treasury Secretary Jack Lew , former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller , IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner , and IRS official Holly Paz all acted unlawfully .

It asks the court to force the immediate granting of tax-exempt status to several groups still waiting for the IRS to act on their applications .

`` The overreach by the Internal Revenue Service is not only extremely disturbing but it is unconstitutional as well , '' ACLJ Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow said .

`` An out-of-control IRS is problematic on a number of fronts , but this ongoing scheme to target conservative organizations is unlawful and represents a serious breach of trust for the American people , '' he added .

`` The federal lawsuit is significant and is intended to bring an end to this ploy of intimidation and hold those responsible inside the Obama administration accountable . ''

The Justice Department has also launched an investigation of whether laws were broken by IRS workers using a list of criteria including names such as `` tea party '' to determine levels of scrutiny for groups seeking tax-exempt status .
