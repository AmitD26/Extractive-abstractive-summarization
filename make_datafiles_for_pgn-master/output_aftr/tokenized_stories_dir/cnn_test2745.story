Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The State Department 's former point man on security in Libya told a congressional hearing Wednesday that his superiors worked against him as he tried to get more help for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi in the months before it was overrun in a deadly terror attack .

`` I said , ` Jim , you know what makes it most frustrating about this assignment ? It 's not the hardships . It 's not the gunfire . It 's not the threats . It 's dealing and fighting against the people , programs , and personnel who are supposed to be supporting me , '' Nordstrom said .

He also told the State Department officer , '' ` For me , the Taliban is on the inside of the building . ''

What we know about the Libya attack

`` We regularly assess risk and resource allocation , a process involving the considered judgments of experienced professionals on the ground and in Washington , using the best available information , '' Kennedy said .

The assault on the U.S. compound was `` an unprecedented attack by dozens of heavily armed men , '' Kennedy said .

His colleague , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Programs Charlene Lamb , added that the State Department `` had the correct number of assets in Benghazi at the time , '' drawing a sharp rebuke from committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa , R-California .

`` To start off by saying you had the correct number , and our ambassador and three other individuals are dead , and people are in the hospital recovering because it only took moments to breach that facility somehow does n't seem to ring true to the American people , '' Issa said .

Various communications dating back nearly a year asked for anywhere from three to five diplomatic security special agents .

`` His response to that was , ` You 're asking for the sun , moon , and the stars , ' '' Nordstrom said .

Five special agents were in Benghazi at the time of the attack , Issa said .

Two of them only happened to be there only because they had traveled with Stevens from Tripoli , Lamb said .

`` The post had agreed that three was a sufficient number to have on the ground . '' Lamb said .

State Department officials also responded to allegations by Republicans that the Obama administration intentionally misled the public about the cause of the attack .

Critics accuse the administration of trying to cover up or play down the attack through initial statements that described it as a spontaneous act stemming from protests over an anti-Muslim film rather than a planned terrorist assault .

While congressmen from both parties agreed that security at overseas U.S. diplomatic posts is crucial , and they expressed hope for a bipartisan solution , several times during the hearing the dialogue devolved into rancorous comments back and forth .

Kennedy said the fullest picture of proper security and procedures will not be fully clear until a review board appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and including former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen is completed .

State Department officials : Benghazi attack ` unprecedented '

Democrats had accused Issa of planning a partisan , election-year hearing , a similar allegation leveled against the panel for its past investigations of the botched `` Fast and Furious '' gun-running program and the failed Solyndra clean energy company that received government loan guarantees .

The officials , who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified by name , said there was `` nothing unusual '' throughout the day of the attack .

Asked whether the attack was a spontaneous assault taking advantage of a demonstration , as originally asserted by Obama administration officials , one senior official said , `` That was not our conclusion . ''

The two senior officials offered riveting detail of the attack by what one of them described as `` dozens of armed men '' who marauded from building to building and later fired mortars on a U.S. annex less than a mile away .

In the havoc at the four-building compound , Stevens and two of his security personnel took refuge in a fortified room that the attackers were able to penetrate , one official said .

The attackers doused the building with diesel fuel and set it ablaze and the three men decided to leave the safe haven and move to a bathroom to be able to breathe , according to the official . Stevens became separated from the security personnel in the chaos and smoke , and eventually turned up at a Benghazi hospital , where he was declared dead .
