Baghdad -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Casualties from Wednesday 's wave of attacks across Iraq rose to 93 people dead and 312 wounded , the Interior Ministry said Thursday , making it the deadliest day in the country since the United States withdrew its troops in December .

The attacks were mostly aimed at Shiite pilgrims trekking and driving to a shrine in Baghdad .

The scale of violence left some stunned .

Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki met with Tony Blinken , U.S. Vice President Joe Biden 's national security adviser , in Baghdad on Thursday . The two men discussed U.S.-Iraqi relations , but it is unclear whether they talked about the attacks .

En route from across the country , including the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq , pilgrims have been headed to the Imam Kadhim shrine in the Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad . The event culminates Saturday when the faithful commemorate the death of Imam Moussa al-Kadhim , one of 12 revered imams in Shiite Islam .

The violence sparks fears of a renewal of the fighting between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq in the last decade , a longtime animosity intensified by the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime .

Shiites gained the upper hand politically after Hussein was overthrown by a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 . Sunnis felt disenfranchised amid that political backdrop , and many backed insurgent actions against the government .

As a result , Sunni-Shiite violence exploded in the 2000s . The violence eventually ebbed as the war wound down , but ever since , there have been spurts of high-profile attacks .

But Wednesday 's violence eclipses that day and is reminiscent of last decade 's sectarian strife .

More than 100 people died in three separate actions as recently as 2009 .

A string of suicide bombs in December of 2009 left 127 people dead . And two car bombs outside Baghdad 's province building and the Justice Ministry in October of that year killed 160 people . In August , two truck bombings and three other blasts left at least 100 people dead .
