For those who do n't avidly follow the complicated machinations of the globe 's top terror group , this could be confusing .

Has n't the line for years from the U.S. government and its allies been that al Qaeda is on the run , that its fiercest fighting ability has been weakened by U.S. strikes ?

A stake in Yemen

While al Qaeda suffered significant setbacks after Navy SEALs shot and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 , and drone strikes have taken out top terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border , the terror group and its close allies have rebounded in Yemen , the Sinai region of Egypt , Libya , Iraq , and parts of east and west Africa , among other places .

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , or AQAP , headquartered in Yemen , is particularly concerning .

CNN has learned of recent intercepts of messages among senior al Qaeda operatives in Yemen , but the messages do n't name specific targets . One source told CNN that the chatter suggested `` active plotting . ''

`` There are multiple indications that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is plotting attacks both within Yemen , against U.S. and Western structures and overseas , '' said Seth Jones , an analyst at Rand Corp. . The Yemeni group is already notorious for sending an operative on board a flight into the United States on Christmas day in 2009 with explosives in his underwear .

Al Qaeda in Yemen `` are still capable of conducting attacks '' and particularly adept at `` taking down aircraft , '' Jones said .

Al Qaeda-linked militants have established a formidable foothold in the complicated civil war in Syria .

There are up to 11,000 foreign fighters from 74 nations in the conflict that has raged since April 2011 , according to the December report from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalism -LRB- ICSR -RRB- .

The majority have traveled from other Arab countries , creating a significant risk of blowback when these fighters return home .

An increasing number of them are from Europe -- approaching two thousand , according to the ICSR , an unprecedented number , according to experts .

The United States and its allies fear that those fighters will be able to more easily launch attacks in their homelands or against Western targets , said Cruickshank .

`` Syria is now the fuel for the jihadist movement and some of the most experienced operatives from Pakistan and Iraq have relocated there , '' he said . `` Syria has helped al Qaeda rebuild its operations in the Arab world , which has always been its intention anyway . ''

Flashpoint partners , a U.S outfit that tracks jihadist websites , provided the terror analyst with an al Qaeda video that emerged on Christmas day . It features the Boston bombing and also the slaying of a London soldier in May of this year .

It calls for al Qaeda sympathizers to take things into their own hands and launch attacks in the West .

Both attacks are called models for the future .

An elusive peace in Iraq

Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein , Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites , who represent a majority of Iraqis , have emerged with more power . That has led to sectarian violence -- constant bombings and various smaller attacks . Al Qaeda is targeting Shiites in an attempt to plunge the country into another civil war and hopes to carve out a larger zone of territory under their control on either side of the Syria-Iraq border , Cruickshank says .

Smaller bursts of violence are the hallmark of al Qaeda 's new approach to terrorism , according to the chairs of the Senate and House intelligence committees who appeared on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' in early December .

At least for the moment , `` these al Qaeda groups in Syria and Iraq are completely focused on overthrowing the Assad regime -LRB- in Syria -RRB- or attacking what they regard as the Shia-dominated government of Iraq . And , at least so far , these groups have shown no ability to attack in Europe , let alone in the United States , '' he said in a column published on CNN.com .

The new Al Qaeda

What motivates al Qaeda 's newest members ?

Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Crowley she thought there is still a pervasive belief among extremists that a caliphate -- an Islamic state governed strictly by Sharia , or Islamic , law -- is possible and should be fought for .

`` I think there is a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist , jihadist , Islamic community , '' she said . `` And that is that the west is responsible for everything that goes wrong ... I see more groups , more fundamentalists , more jihadists more determined to kill to get to where they want to get . ''

-LRB- Al Qaeda is still mostly comprised of younger men , though women are taking backseat support roles , he added . -RRB-

In 2011 , tens of thousands of protesters staged a revolution in Egypt that unseated longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak . Mohamed Morsy , then a Muslim Brotherhood leader , was elected president in the country 's first democratic election in 2012 . He was deposed by the military last summer .

This week Egypt 's military-backed government declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group . On Thursday , dozens of members of the Islamist party were arrested and their property seized , authorities said .

`` They see the Egyptian and Syrian government as tarred with the same brush . They see those governments as blocking the true flourishing of Islam . ''

CNN 's Barbara Starr contributed to this report .
