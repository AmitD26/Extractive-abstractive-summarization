Smoke swirled over the derailment scene in the small town of Tiskilwa as the National Transportation Safety Board formed a six-person team to investigate .

The 126-car train was hauling ethanol alcohol when some of the cars derailed around 2:20 a.m. , the Bureau County Sheriff 's Office said .

The Red Cross opened a shelter at the high school in nearby Princeton and were providing services for more than 25 , agency spokeswoman Kasey Kelly said .

Several fire departments responded , including the Ottawa Fire Department about an hour from the scene .

Ottawa Fire Capt. Steve Haywood told CNN officials were worried about expanding liquid vapor explosions .

`` It 's something you are concerned with all the time , '' he said .

`` My guess is they 'll probably just let it burn . '' he said .

`` They ca n't rule out that it 's an accident at this time or that it was criminal , '' he was quoted as saying .
