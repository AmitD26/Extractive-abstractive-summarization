Venezuela is still hungover from its own presidential election and in this fervently political country -- mostly thanks to Chavez 's ubiquity , strength of personality and polarizing policies -- the U.S. election campaign offers some light relief after a trying few months .

The self-styled socialist leader 's supporters see Obama taking a leaf out of Chavez 's book . `` Obama is working for the people just like Chavez , '' said Gomez Darwin , 42 , stood under a huge Che Guevara mural in a primarily Chavez-supporting Caracas barrio .

However , it is the contenders ' world views which really matter here . Gloria Torres helped organize prayer vigils for Chavez as he suffered cancer last year . `` Obama 's policies towards Latin America have n't been aggressive , '' she said , offering her support for the U.S. incumbent before adding : `` The other guy does n't seem to have any friendly intentions towards us ! ''

Venezuela has come up a number of times in Republican rhetoric during the U.S. race . Mitt Romney branded the Venezuelan government a `` threat to national security '' earlier this year , adding that Chavez had spread `` dictatorships and tyranny throughout Latin America . ''

Romney 's running mate , Paul Ryan , added : `` In a Mitt Romney administration , we will not keep practicing this policy of appeasement ... We will be tough on -LSB- Cuban President Raúl -RSB- Castro , tough on Chavez . It 's because we know that 's the right policy for our country . ''

This antagonism from the Romney camp towards Chavez -- compared to Obama 's softer approach -- has attracted some of Venezuela 's more wealthy hard-line opposition .

`` Romney named Chavez in his manifesto ; Obama did n't , '' said Aixa Armas , eating breakfast at one of Caracas ' high-end hotels . `` Obama has closed his eyes to the problem , a regional problem , and he is too friendly with Chavez . ''

The lubricant between Caracas and Washington is the world 's highest oil reserves on which Chavez sits . It is that wealth that has kept Venezuela 's economy from collapsing -- despite epic mismanagement which has led to the region 's highest inflation rate and a severe shortage of U.S. dollars . America is Venezuela 's biggest oil market and the Latin American country is among the top five exporters to the U.S. .
