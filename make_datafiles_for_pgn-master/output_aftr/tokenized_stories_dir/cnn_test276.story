-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran has received the first part of its $ 4.2 billion in oil funds that had been frozen overseas due to sanctions , the country 's state-run Press TV reported .

In November , Iran and six world powers reached an interim deal under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions .

The six world powers , called the P5 +1 , include the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States , Britain , China , Russia and France -- as well as Germany

CNN was trying to reach representatives of the P5 +1 countries for confirmation Sunday .

As part of the temporary , six-month deal reached in November , world powers agreed to suspend sanctions on items such as gold and petrochemical exports . That suspension would provide Iran with about $ 1.5 billion in revenue , according to the U.S. White House .

The Iranian regime has insisted it is using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes only .

But many countries have been skeptical , and Canada has decided to keep its sanctions against Iran in pace .

But because the deal is temporary , it remains unclear what the world powers might offer -- and demand of -- Iran in the future .
