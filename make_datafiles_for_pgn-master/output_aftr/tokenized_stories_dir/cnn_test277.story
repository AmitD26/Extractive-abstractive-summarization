CNN 's new series i-List takes you to a different country each month . In May , we visit Macedonia focusing on changes shaping the country 's economy , culture and its social fabric .

Demir Kapija , Macedonia -- Jordan Trajkov was a successful banker studying for an MBA when he visited Napa Valley in California .

The visit inspired him to go back to his roots and start a winery in his native Macedonia . Trajkov 's father had owned a vineyard , but when Macedonia was part of socialist Yugoslavia he was not allowed to produce his own wine .

`` There were just a few big wineries and my father had to sell his grapes to them . '' Trajkov told CNN . `` But my grandfather had his own winery before socialism and that inspired me .

`` From an early age I had worked on my father 's vineyard , but I had never had the opportunity to make my own wine . ''

Trajkov , now 41 , worked in banking for seven years in Macedonia , London and New York . He was studying for an MBA in Phoenix , Arizona , when he took the holiday in Napa Valley that was to change his career .

He planted his first grapes in 2005 and began selling wine from his Popova Kula winery the following year .

Popova Kula produces 23 varieties of wine , but Trajkov 's favorites are those native to Macedonia .

Alongside his better-known grapes , Trajkov produces Vranec and Stanushina , and has won international medals for several of his wines .

To increase sales further , Trajkov knows he must work hard on promoting his wines more widely .
