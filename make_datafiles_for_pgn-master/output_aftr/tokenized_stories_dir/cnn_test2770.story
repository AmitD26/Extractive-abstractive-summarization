-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sitting inside the quaint tasting room of Chateau O'Brien , an award-winning French-style winery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia , co-owner Debbie O'Brien pours some of the best red wine in the region .

The original structure for Chateau O'Brien was an old French farmhouse that Howard O'Brien , Debbie 's husband , transformed into a first-class winery known for its large copper doors , wrap-around sundeck and rich aged wines that include a medium-bodied Malbec , a full-bodied Cabernet Franc , an elegant Petit Verdot , and the fast-selling Tannat Limited Reserve and Late Harvest Tannat .

The secret to Chateau O'Brien 's success : `` We grow our own grapes , '' said Howard O'Brien , who owns three sprawling Virginia vineyards .

Chateau O'Brien is one of about 230 wineries in the state , many of them small , boutique operations that specialize in regional wines . Virginia is relatively new to the wine-making industry by European standards , but it 's quickly gaining notoriety among wine enthusiasts from across the country . Virginia ranks fifth in the nation for number of wineries and for wine grape production .

As evidence of the emerging quality of Virginia wines , the U.S. Treasury Department designated Middleburg , Virginia , as the newest American Viticulture Area .

Take Delaplane Cellars , a family winery owned by Jim and Betsy Dolphin that boasts panoramic views of the Northern Virginia mountains in a spacious , contemporary setting . At Delaplane , the wine is tasty and the amenities do n't stop at the views : The homemade sausage is excellent and the Dolphins also serve generous portions of olive oil and freshly ground pepper for dipping . On weekends , Delaplane pairs tastings with live jazz .

Wines at Delaplane Cellars include crisp whites like Chardonnay and Viognier and complex red wines that include Melange Rouge , William 's Gap Reserve , and Cabernet Franc .

`` All of our wines are made from authentic Virginia grapes , '' according to Delaplane 's website . `` Our goal is to craft delicious single vineyard wines . ''

On a recent visit to Delaplane Cellars , the large tasting room was crowded and every table overlooking the mountains was filled . I overheard several people talking about how much they enjoyed the wine , and a couple next to me bought six bottles immediately after their tasting . Do n't leave without trying the Cabernet Franc with the homemade sausage ; it 's a real treat .

If you want to bring the kids along , consider Barrel Oak Winery , a family-friendly operation where you can take your own picnic lunch . The winery also offers complimentary juice boxes for children .

For red wines only , visit Boxwood Wineries in Middleburg , Virginia , a picturesque property owned by John Kent Cooke , the former owner of the NFL 's Washington Redskins . The winery features Merlot , Malbec , Cabernet Franc , Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon . Boxwood has received three Decanter Magazine World Wine Awards and has been featured in The Washington Post and Washingtonian Magazine .

Howard , a passionate wine expert from New York , and Debbie , a charming businesswoman from Alabama , both enjoy conversing with customers and keeping them smiling .

Since Chateau O'Brien opened in 2006 , the O'Briens are fast becoming known for their Tannat , a grape traditionally grown in Southern France and Uruguay . Since the Tannat flourishes in humid climates , Virginia is the perfect region to harvest the grape . O'Brien 's Tannat has won awards in New York and internationally .

`` We wait for the grapes to become ripe , not when it 's convenient to serve the wine , '' O'Brien said . `` It 's all about the fruit -- and patience . ''

Here 's a tip : Spend a few extra bucks -LRB- $ 35 per person -RRB- for the private tasting in Howard 's stone-covered cellar where he regales guests with stories from long ago summers and serves fine wine only sold in the private cellar . You wo n't regret it .
