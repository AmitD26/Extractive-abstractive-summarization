Within less than 10 years , they could be touching down at an island airport in the middle of the river itself .

A futuristic-looking , six-runway airport on an artificial island has been proposed at a location off the Isle of Sheppey , around 80 kilometers from the center of the city .

The plan from a consortium formed by the mayor of London , Boris Johnson , has been projected to cost Â £ 47 billion -LRB- $ 76 billion -RRB- and to take seven years .

The mid-river location is intended to avoid adding to the aviation noise pollution already bedeviling London -- the source of long-running campaigns from residents beneath that approach into Heathrow that passengers so enjoy .

Passenger numbers to all London 's airports are expected to more than double by 2031 , to 300 million from 127 million a year in 2010 , according to the Greater London Authority .
