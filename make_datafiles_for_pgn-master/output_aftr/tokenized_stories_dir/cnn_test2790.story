-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Many people in Mingo County , West Virginia , likely know Rosie Crum the way that Frances Crawford does .

The two women , both active in local politics , are friendly . They stop to talk when they see each other .

But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum , who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county 's commissioners .

`` She 's a good person , '' Crawford said about Crum . `` She 's always seemed like a strong person too . ''

According to County Commissioner David Baisden , Crum was born and raised in Mingo County . She met her husband , Eugene Crum , when she was 14 , and they married in 1975 .

The Crums have two children -- a son and a daughter , both grown -- and grandchildren .

`` They have been a pillar in the community and done everything that they felt was the right thing to do , and we feel this is the right thing for us to do , '' Baisden said about Crum 's appointment .

Crum has prior no law enforcement experience , but she will have `` plenty of help , '' Baisden said .

Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel will `` manage the law enforcement end '' of the sheriff 's department , he explained .

John Mark Hubbard , president of the Mingo County Commission , said Crum 's appointment is like an extension of her husband 's legacy . The commission voted unanimously .

` She lost everything '

She did not speak , but she hugged 22 deputies who came to the ceremony , Hubbard said .

Baisden said he met with Crum earlier in the day , and that she was understandably emotional . He explained another part of the rationale behind her appointment .

`` Everyone here in the community knows her . It 's small town U.S.A. , and it will help us overcome the void that 's in our hearts , '' he said .
