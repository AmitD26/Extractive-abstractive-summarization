Bigend -LRB- pronounced Bayh-jhan -RRB- is the morally ambiguous mastermind behind a global marketing operation , the Google of trend forecasting . He 's a `` cool hunter , '' reminiscent of Charles Foster Kane with an Andy Warhol eye for spotting emerging underground trends .

The London-based caper also involves paramilitary contractors , computer hackers , base-jumping spies , black market jeans dealers and something called the Festo AirPenguin .

It 's a long way from Gibson 's 1984 award-winning debut novel , `` Neuromancer , '' a classic which helped launch the `` cyberpunk '' genre . He 's been called a sci-fi prophet , and is credited with coining the term , `` cyberspace '' when the Internet was still largely unknown .

More recently , Gibson is n't writing so much science fiction but what he calls , `` speculative fiction of the very recent past . '' Instead of an imagined future , in `` Zero History '' Gibson examines the present-day impact of new technologies , the current tension between the cutting edge and the mainstream and how all of it is branded , marketed and manipulated for profit .

CNN recently spoke with the author ; the following is an edited transcript .

CNN : `` Zero History '' seems like it could take place in the very near future or an amplified present . Does the rapid pace at which the world is changing make your job more difficult or just more interesting ?

CNN : Hubertus Bigend is one of your most memorable characters . For new readers , give us a little background on who he is and what role he plays in `` Zero History . ''

Gibson : Bigend is the founding genius behind Blue Ant , a global PR/ad firm . I originally assumed he was just a standard walk-on evil figurehead , but the other characters started falling into a weird kind of love-hate with him , and I suppose I did , too . I do n't always believe his explanation of our world , and I doubt he does either , but he 's definitely been a delight to work with .

CNN : You 're a frequent user of Twitter , how does it or other social media influence you as a writer or as a culture consumer ?

Gibson : I only know Twitter . The others seem too socially engineered . Too mall-like . I see Twitter as a virtual extension of `` the street . '' You can run into anybody . And it makes breaking news more fun . Hugely more fun .

CNN : Anything you 're reading , watching or listening to you 'd care to recommend ?

Gibson : I 've already entered my pre-book stage , in which I quit reading fiction . If I could magically see anything I want , today , it would be `` Juan of the Dead , '' Cuba 's first feature horror film . Zombie plague in Havana , deadpan Cuban comedy . Google the trailer . I recently saw Terry Gilliam 's brilliant staging of Berlioz 's `` The Damnation of Faust , '' in London . I imagine that was my cultural high point for the year .

CNN : What 's next for you ?

Gibson : I 'm edging into a new book , not a Bigend one , and my collected nonfiction , `` Distrust That Particular Flavor '' should be out fairly soon .

William Gibson is the award-winning author of nine previous best-selling novels . His latest `` Zero History '' comes out in paperback on Tuesday .
