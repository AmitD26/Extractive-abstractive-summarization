-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama should use the breathing space provided by the fiscal-cliff compromise to address some of the issues that he shelved during his last term . One of the most urgent is child farm labor . Perhaps the least protected , underpaid work force in American labor , children are often the go-to workers for farms looking to cut costs .

It 's easy to see why . The Department of Labor permits farms to pay employees under 20 as little as $ 4.25 per hour . -LRB- By comparison , the federal minimum wage is $ 7.25 . -RRB- And unlike their counterparts in retail and service , child farm laborers can legally work unlimited hours at any hour of day or night .

The numbers are hard to estimate , but between direct hiring , hiring through labor contractors , and off-the-books work beside parents or for cash , perhaps 400,000 children , some as young as 6 , weed and harvest for commercial farms . A Human Rights Watch 2010 study shows that children laboring for hire on farms routinely work more than 10 hours per day .

As if this were not bad enough , few labor safety regulations apply . Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents ' consent , if they do not miss school . Children 12 and older can too , as long as their parents agree . Unlike teen retail and service workers , agricultural laborers 16 and older are permitted to operate hazardous machinery and to work even during school hours .

In addition , Human Rights Watch reports that child farm laborers are exposed to dangerous pesticides ; have inadequate access to water and bathrooms ; fall ill from heat stroke ; suffer sexual harassment ; experience repetitive-motion injuries ; rarely receive protective equipment like gloves and boots ; and usually earn less than the minimum wage . Sometimes they earn nothing .

The United States has a long tradition of training children in the craft of farming on family farms . At least 500,000 children help to work their families ' farms today .

We have a responsibility for their safety . As one of the first acts of his new term , Obama should reopen the child agricultural labor proposal he shelved in spring of 2012 . Surely , farm labor standards for children can be strengthened without killing off 4-H or Future Farmers of America .

Second , the Department of Labor must institute age , wage , hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules . Children in agriculture should not be exposed to more risks , longer hours , and lower wages at younger ages than children in other jobs .

Finally , the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must allocate the funds necessary for meaningful enforcement of child labor violations . Unenforced rules wo n't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms .

Agriculture is a great American tradition . Let 's make sure it 's not one our children have to die for .
