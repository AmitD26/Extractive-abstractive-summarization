-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A United States Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon completes a triple roll in the sky above the largest aerospace and defense show in Asia .

It 's followed with an aerial demonstration by the U.S. MV-22B Osprey -- the world 's first production tilt-rotor aircraft . It can take off and land like a helicopter , but flies with the range , airspeed and payload of a fixed-wing airplane .

`` A lot of the bells and whistles , new avionics , and the 21st century equipment -- it all started as industry and showcasing their work , '' says Col. Marc Caudill , mission commander for the U.S. military forces supporting the airshow .

China 's approach

In the same exhibition hall , there 's a different approach from China .

Defense experts say any discussion of China 's military capabilities needs to be centered around what 's not on display , rather than what is .

Couple that with regional disputes escalating in Asia , including China 's controversial declaration of an air defense identification zone -LRB- ADIZ -RRB- in the East China Sea -- and its increased assertiveness in the South China Sea -- and the country is increasingly seen as a major force .

Generals , ministers , bureaucrats

The state-owned China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation -LRB- CATIC -RRB- has one of the show 's largest stands out of the Chinese exhibitors .

CATIC 's core business is aviation defense -- models on display here include the L-15 advanced jet trainer , the FC-1 / JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft , an attack helicopter , and an unmanned combat aerial vehicle , the Wing Loong .

China is working hard to sell its aircraft overseas , says Wendell Minnick , Asia bureau chief for Defense News .

But Minnick says China 's models on display pale in comparison with those of the U.S.

Acrobatic displays

At the airshow , the U.S. is displaying a mock-up of its fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , but the development of its Chinese equivalents , the J-20 and J-31 stealth fighters , is shrouded in secrecy .

`` The U.S. is extremely transparent , and the West tends to regard military capability as something you slowly develop and then you deploy . And if it comes to it , you use it .

Vision of warfare

`` China 's deployment of prototypes speaks to a vision of warfare that 's completely different from the West . ''

Richard Bitzinger , senior fellow from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and global expert on the Chinese military , agrees .

`` I think China has been able to think creatively about how they use what they do have . That 's why we 're worried about things like their cyber war capabilities or new types of weapons systems like an anti-ship ballistic missile , '' Bitzinger says .

`` It does n't have to be particularly cutting edge , high-tech , 22nd century stuff , but the fact that -LSB- the Chinese -RSB- have it , and how they use it , are things that change the rules of the road . ''

Military power is about how your equipment stacks up against your likely competitor , he adds .
