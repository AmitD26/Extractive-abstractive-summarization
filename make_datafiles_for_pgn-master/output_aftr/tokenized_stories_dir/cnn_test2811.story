-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Facebook 's decision to allow the uploading and sharing of extreme/graphic content -- including beheadings -- makes no sense in a conventional media setting .

Most western media outlets operate under regulatory codes that make the screening or publishing of such material unthinkable -- not least because their audience might include children .

Inevitably the `` protection of children '' argument will be rehearsed in response to Facebook 's decision , which seems almost designed to court negative commentary .

The decision may also offer the genuinely weird and definitively 21st century prospect of UK and U.S. security services using Facebook to track global viewing patterns of beheading videos .

Is it only that brutal violence is part of life and we have the right to make the obvious comments about that fact . As Facebook 's statement says :

`` People share videos of these events on Facebook to condemn them . If they were being celebrated , or the actions in them encouraged , our approach would be different . ''

Apart from an increased volume of utterly banal denunciations of the act -LRB- only the `` right '' kinds of statements will be allowed -RRB- what could the screening of such events lead to ?

People who feel that violence is wrong will say so , people who make risquÃ © or bad-taste jokes will make them , and so the chatter will go on .

In 2003 , the U.S. military clamped-down on active service personnel 's trading of explicit smart-phone images of the aftermath of suicide bombings in Iraq .

So , the potential cultural power of such images can be recognised by liberals , conservatives , and bodies such as the Family Online Safety Institute alike -- even if they fundamentally disagree about what that power is .

Equally , it 's not safe to accept the treatment of such footage as a set of taboo `` magic objects , '' which can never be seen because they are inherently so dangerous in their ability to corrupt the majority and the minors .

Facebook sees it as a legitimate service to allow its audience to see a woman being brutally killed and then host discussion of that content , but will not allow its users to see exposed breasts -- for fear of causing offense .

So , the re-showing of such footage on Facebook is actively collusive with those actions . It disseminates the fear and intimidation intended in the act .

Asserting that Facebook users can respond to footage of a woman 's brutal murder by decrying it , sidesteps that issue . Users could just as well decry violence against women without seeing this act . But fewer of them may do so .

If Facebook really was interested in public debate , it would have established a real and carefully constructed , open forum in which this decision could be debated -- as well as other issues about its policies , operation and inconsistent stances .

What Facebook is interested in , is generating more traffic through its platform and it is doing so from within a pretty inconsistent , narrowly male and conservative image of the world and of what should be discussed within it .

How different is that from many traditional media organizations of the 19th and 20th centuries ?
