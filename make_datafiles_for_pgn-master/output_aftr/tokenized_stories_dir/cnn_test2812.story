The president asked legislators to grant him the authority to merge agencies that perform similar functions . If that power is granted , Congress would be required to hold an up-or-down vote on the president 's streamlining plan within 90 days of its submission .

Under the move , the Commerce Department as currently constituted would be eliminated . Some of its responsibilities would be shifted to a new department yet to be named , while other functions would be shifted elsewhere .

Obama noted Friday that presidents starting in the midst of the Great Depression were authorized to submit federal reorganization plans to Congress for a guaranteed up-or-down vote . That authority , however , expired in 1984 .

`` When this process was left to follow the usual Congressional pace , not surprisingly , it slowed down , '' Obama said . `` Congressional committees fought to protect their turf . Lobbyists fought to keep things unchanged because they 're the only ones who can navigate the bureaucracy . And because it 's always easier to add than to subtract in Washington , inertia prevented any real reform from happening . ''

Obama 's plan -- building on a promise made in last year 's State of the Union address to streamline government -- could help to place the president in a more centrist position heading into the election , political analysts note . It could also put congressional Republicans in a politically awkward position by forcing them to either accept the plan -- thereby handing Obama a political win -- or reject it and risk ceding a core conservative issue to the president .

`` President Obama is trying to counter the perception that he is a big-government liberal , '' said Keating Holland , CNN polling director . `` If he gets his way and can brag about reorganizing the government , that may help him in the fall . ''

On the other hand , Holland noted , `` when then-Vice President Al Gore was put in charge of a ` Reinventing Government ' initiative under Bill Clinton , it did n't seem to affect views of Gore in that regard , possibly because few Americans really noticed . ''

Skeptical Republicans questioned both the merit and the timing of Obama 's announcement .

`` Given the president 's record of growing government , we 're interested to learn whether this proposal represents actual relief for American businesses or just the appearance of it , '' said Brendan Buck , a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . `` American small businesses are more concerned about this administration 's policies than from which building in Washington they originate . We hope the president is n't simply proposing new packaging for the same burdensome approach . ''

Don Stewart , a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , said that `` after presiding over one of the largest expansions of government in history , and a year after raising the issue ... it 's interesting to see the president finally acknowledge that Washington is out of control . ''

Issa noted a letter sent last March from several congressmen to the White House seeking `` a tentative timeline for development and implementation of -LRB- a -RRB- reorganization proposal . ''
