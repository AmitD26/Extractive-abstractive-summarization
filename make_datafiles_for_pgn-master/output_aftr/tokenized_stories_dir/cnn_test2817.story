Sarah Palin ripped Barack Obama and said she 's ready for the `` challenge of a tough fight . ''

`` Lipstick , '' the Republican vice presidential nominee said .

She promptly went on to prove the point , tearing into Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama as two-faced , inexperienced and intoxicated by the sound of his own voice .

She slammed Obama for `` saying one thing in Scranton and another in San Francisco , '' argued that he had written two memoirs but never authored a major piece of legislation and asked what he would do `` when those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot , '' a reference to the stage where Obama gave his acceptance speech last week .

Thousands of delegates at the party conference roared their approval at Palin 's speech , bursting into chants of `` Sarah ! Sarah ! '' and `` Zero ! Zero , '' the amount of executive experience Republicans say Obama has accumulated . iReport.com : Palin was phenomenal

Conventioneers waved banners reading `` Palin Power '' and `` Hockey moms for Palin . '' Delegates from her home state of Alaska were spotted wearing buttons calling her `` the hottest VP from the coolest state . ''

Palin began with a lengthy , minutes-long standing ovation as she accepted the Republican Party 's nomination for vice president . It marked the first time in history that a woman has taken the stage as the GOP vice presidential pick .

Bush aide Matthew Scully was largely responsible for the speech .

Palin 's opposite number , Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden , praised her speech as `` incredibly well crafted and delivered , '' but said Palin 's rhetoric lacked substance .

`` I did n't hear the phrase ` middle class . ' I did n't hear a single word about health care . I did n't hear a single word about helping people get to college , '' Biden , a U.S. senator from Delaware , told CNN 's `` American Morning '' on Thursday .

`` They do n't have a single answer -LSB- for -RSB- how to dig us out of the hole we 've been dug into the last eight years , '' Biden added .

Palin , whose son is to deploy to Iraq soon , praised her running mate John McCain as a man who has met grave challenges and `` knows how tough fights are won . '' She criticized Obama 's stance on Iraq , saying he `` wants to forfeit '' while victory is `` finally in sight . '' Watch Palin say McCain has fought for change his entire life ''

Throughout the speech , it was clear the first-term governor of Alaska had won over the hearts of the crowd .

`` What exactly is our opponent 's plan ? What does he actually seek to accomplish after he 's done turning back the waters and healing the planet ? The answer is to make the government bigger and take more of your money . ''

She insisted that the United States seek `` energy independence , '' including through more drilling , in the face of threats as diverse as hurricanes in the Gulf and Russian military power in the Caucasus . iReport.com : A ` free for all ' on Obama

And Palin dismissed criticism about her that have appeared in the media . `` Here 's a little news flash for all those reporters and commentators : I 'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion . I 'm going to Washington to serve the people of this country . '' CNN 's political team analyzes Palin 's speech ''

Palin , whose youngest child has Down syndrome , also promised that families of special needs children will have `` a friend and advocate in the White House . ''

At the end of the speech , McCain came on stage amid raucous cheers and said , `` Do n't you think we made the right choice for the next vice president of the United States ? '' Watch McCain take stage , get crowd fired up ''

`` He 's never had to lead people in crisis , '' Giuliani said . `` This is not a personal attack ; it 's a statement of fact . Barack Obama has never led anything . Nothing . Nada . ''

`` The choice in this election comes down to substance over style . John McCain has been tested . Barack Obama has not . Tough times require strong leadership , and this is no time for on-the-job training . ''

His speech was the third of the evening by former GOP presidential candidates who pumped up the Republican faithful ahead of Palin .

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee got the crowd cheering when he ripped Obama for looking to Europe for ways to change America .

`` Barack Obama 's excellent adventure to Europe took his campaign for change to hundreds of thousands of people who do n't even vote or pay taxes here , '' he said .

`` The fact is , most Americans do n't want more government ; they want a lot less . ''

Huckabee took a jab at the `` elite media '' for `` unifying the Republican Party and all of America '' in support of McCain and Palin .

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney blasted `` liberal Washington , '' saying McCain is a `` prescription for every American who wants change in Washington . ''

`` Throw out the big-government liberals and elect John McCain , '' Romney said . `` We need change , all right : change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington . ''

He also threw his support behind Palin , saying the McCain-Palin ticket `` will keep America as it has always been : the hope of the world . ''

`` We will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism , '' Romney said .
