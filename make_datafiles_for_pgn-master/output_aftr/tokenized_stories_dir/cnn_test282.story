-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eight years after troops in Afghanistan were outfitted with new uniforms , the Army is shopping for a different camouflage for its fatigues and equipment .

Cole says the Army probably knew at the time that the universal pattern would n't be perfect for every environment , but did n't realize how much of a compromise it would have to make .

Testing began in 2009 and the Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center -LRB- NSRDEC -RRB- found that the universal pattern ranked `` in the bottom 10 '' compared to the four backgrounds it was tested against .

Despite the positive results of the MultiCam pattern , the Army thought it could do even better , Cole says .

When most people look at a military uniform , they probably see a bit of green here , some tan there and a splash of gray to finish it off -- basically , a mixture of colors with no obvious thought to placement or shape . But that perception could n't be further from the reality of the science behind an advanced camouflage pattern .

Although most detail of what goes into making a successful camouflage pattern is proprietary , Guy Cramer says he uses a mathematical equation , or fractal , to trick the eye into thinking it is seeing something else .

`` The brain will pick up shapes and it basically categorizes anything it sees , '' Cramer says . `` It says that 's a tree . I know what it is and ignore it . The brain does this in milliseconds . So we insert these fractal patterns into the camouflage so that the brain recognizes it and does n't think what it 's seeing is an anomaly . It basically sees the fractal as background noise . Something that belongs in the environment but does n't need any extra attention . ''

But camouflage as a science was n't always so evolved , having started only about 100 years ago . Even during World War I , some units began the conflict in brightly colored uniforms , making them easy targets for the enemy .

`` It started as naturalistic observation , looking at zebra stripes and leopard prints in the wild and trying to figure out what their purpose was , '' says Dr. Timothy O'Neill , a camouflage expert advising the Army on the technical aspects of their search . `` Very gradually over the years the focus shifted in military camouflage to how the human visual system works . ''

Industry bids for the Army uniform project have been submitted and will be put to the test against current Defense Department camouflage patterns such as those already used by the Marines and the Navy .

Cole says that , after extensive testing , his office should be able to present Army leadership with a recommendation by September 2012 .

Research is expected to cost less than $ 10 million and is covered under the existing budget , according to Cole .

But he could not estimate how much developing the new uniforms would cost , saying it would depend on how quickly the new uniforms were given out .
