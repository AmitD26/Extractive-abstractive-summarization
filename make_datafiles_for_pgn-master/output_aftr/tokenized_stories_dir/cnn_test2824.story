Yet in 2005 , a freestyle chess tournament featured teams of humans partnering with computers in various combinations . Shockingly , two amateurs using three fairly weak laptops emerged victorious , beating grand masters and supercomputers in turn .

This contrast is fittingly emblematic of two great visionaries of computer science , Marvin Minsky and J.C.R. Licklider . Minsky wrote canonical theories of self-replicating artificial intelligence and co-founded MIT 's A.I. lab .

Watch Shyam Sankar 's TED Talk

It 's easy to argue that life and death decisions should never be left to machines , but Licklider 's vision was much broader , recognizing technology as an enabler for many human capacities . Since Kasparov and Deep Blue squared off , we have seen numerous examples of man-computer symbiosis , while A.I. relying solely on computers as Minsky theorized it remains tantalizing , yet distant .

In terms of catalyzing human potential , the triumph of the chess amateurs in 2005 was just one glimpse of the future . Foldit , an online video game , allows nontechnical , nonbiologist players to visually `` fold '' protein structures , while computers calculate the chemical interactions corresponding to each arrangement .

In 2011 , Foldit players needed only 10 days to produce an accurate 3-D model of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus , a protease whose structure had stumped scientists for 15 years .

It was an astonishing triumph of human visual-spatial reasoning , and one of the first major scientific advances to come from playing a video game -LRB- though plenty of software engineers I know would argue that video games activate much more creativity than we care to acknowledge -RRB- .

The tension between the Minsky and Licklider visions has certainly been amplified in the age of so-called big data . Now , consider that most of what we think of as `` big data '' is created by deliberate human action : phone calls , Web logs , credit card transactions , etc. . When we hear about big data `` solutions , '' they tend to focus on computational approaches -- storage , search and processing -- with human intuition largely absent . Yet the unraveling of big data into meaningful insight may depend just as heavily on the human side of the equation .

Yet even the nimblest fugitives leave clues , even patterns -- they 're just buried in an expanding universe of data , a challenge that intensifies as we seek still more data , hoping it will yield more insight .

Adaptive adversaries require adaptive responses , and this begins with asking questions rooted in human intuition . While technology can certainly be a force multiplier for good or evil , it 's difficult to imagine a pure A.I. approach reverse-engineering the machinations of a terrorist mastermind .

When U.S. intelligence tracked down Osama bin Laden , it was a function of brilliant , resourceful people asking questions and testing hypotheses using a variety of technologies .

Cybercriminals , as explored in my first TED talk , tend to target the allegedly weakest links in the network : people . Yet how weak is something that can learn in ways even the most robust automated systems ca n't ?

Cyber security might always be an uphill , defensive struggle as techniques and technologies raise the stakes on both sides . Remember , though , that cyberwarfare is ultimately a human endeavor . Bot-nets , scripts and other automated tools play key roles , but they do n't exist in a vacuum . This cuts both ways : Sooner or later , everyone makes mistakes , even evil genius types . That said , the enemy may well be two amateurs with a few weak laptops .

Aspiring good guys must be absolutely relentless in refining the intersection of brainpower and computing power , each of which is vulnerable in isolation .

Soon , as help poured in , the focus shifted to tracking projects , allocating manpower , and coordinating more than 10,000 volunteers in real time . Through rapid iteration , a group of determined people using low-friction technology had created a vast , self-regulating system . Each discrete data point was simple enough -- the status of a project , levels of need , locations of assets -- but in aggregate , the effect was transformative .

A more realistic approach is to envision computers aided by human intelligence , he says
