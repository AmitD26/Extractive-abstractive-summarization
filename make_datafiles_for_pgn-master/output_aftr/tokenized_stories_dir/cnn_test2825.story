Amanda Cox said , `` There is court-authorized law enforcement activity '' at the home in Cambridge , Massachusetts , that Tsarnaev shared with his wife and young daughter .

Workers in white hazmat suits were at the apartment , CNN affiliate WCVB reported .

It has turned up in at least three places , the source said : the kitchen table , the kitchen sink and the bathtub .

On Sunday , Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's body remained at a funeral home , where his uncle said he was trying to deal with the logistics of readying the body for burial .

Tsarni said he was the only family member at the funeral home and had not had contact with Katherine Russell , Tamerlan 's widow .

Three cemeteries that Stefan contacted said they feared reprisals , but the funeral home owner said you ca n't pick and choose when it comes to a burial .

Tsarnaev 's death certificate has yet to be filed with the Boston city clerk , and there is no burial plot , according to the funeral home .

The city manager of Cambridge said Sunday he would not allow Tsarnaev to be buried in the city if requested by the funeral director or Tsarnaev 's family .

A few days earlier -- April 15 -- he and his younger brother allegedly bombed the Boston Marathon , killing three and wounding more than 260 .

The document notes that Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over and dragged by a car . It lists the manner of death as homicide and notes that he was `` DOA , '' or dead on arrival .

Authorities have said his younger brother may have run him over as they resisted arrest days after the marathon attacks .

Separately , 12 people remained hospitalized with bombing-related injuries on Saturday , according to a count by CNN . None was in serious condition .

`` How many Bostonians wished they had a gun two weeks ago ? '' he asked .

`` Boston proves it . When brave law enforcement officers did their job in that city so courageously , good guys with guns stopped terrorists with guns , '' he said .

Tsarni had decried the bomb suspects as `` losers '' after the attacks .

Their parents in Dagestan have said they will not fly his body back to Russia for burial , spokeswoman Heda Saratova said .

`` Everyone deserves to be buried , '' Stefan said .

The marathon bombings

Authorities say the brothers carried out the Boston Marathon bombings using explosive devices made with pressure cookers .

He is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head , neck , legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother 's death .

But the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated , and a day or two before the Boston Marathon , they changed their plans , the officials said .

They spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media .

One key question involves whether intelligence , law enforcement and homeland security agencies could have done more in their investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in recent years before the attack and whether they shared information effectively enough . An independent government review is under way .

In an interview with Univision published on its website on Saturday , President Barack Obama said that cooperation among agencies can always get better . But he again defended U.S. efforts .

`` I think we can continue to improve and refine how we 're engaging and countering terrorist activity , '' Obama said . `` I do n't think it 's fair to say though that law enforcement dropped the ball . ''

It is very difficult to prevent attacks when dealing with individuals who are self-radicalized and not part of a massive conspiracy or network , he said about the current belief of investigators looking at the origins of the Boston bombing .

Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's widow , Russell , has remained largely out of view since her husband 's death , staying in her parents ' Rhode Island home .

Her attorney , Amato DeLuca , says the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race , and reports of her husband 's involvement came as an `` absolute shock '' to Russell and her family .

Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev , both from Kazakhstan , were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's dorm room . Robel Phillipos , a U.S. citizen , was charged with making false statements to investigators .

All three are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev 's dorm room after the bombings . According to FBI affidavits released this week , they left with the backpack and Vaseline -- which Tazhayakov believed could be used to make bombs -- and Tsarnaev 's laptop .

Investigators found the backpack , fireworks and Vaseline in a landfill last week after a two-day search .

The laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19 , the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov , Kadyrbayev 's attorney Robert Stahl said .

Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups , including groups overseas .

CNN 's Chelsea J. Carter , Susan Candiotti , Eric Feigel , Carol Cratty , Marina Carver and Deborah Feyerick contributed to this report .
