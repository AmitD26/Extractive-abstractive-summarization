FORT MYERS , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three men were charged Saturday with felony first-degree murder in the shooting death of NFL player Sean Taylor , a death police say was unplanned .

Eric Rivera Jr. , 17 ; Venjah K. Hunte , 20 ; and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow , 18 , each faces charges of felony first-degree murder , burglary with a firearm and home invasion robbery while armed , according to court documents .

The charge of felony first-degree murder can be applied if someone is killed , even accidentally , during certain violent felony crimes .

Rivera appeared in a courtroom in Fort Myers , Florida , while Hunte and Wardlow appeared via video phone from jail .

The four suspects could be moved to Miami -- where the charges are based -- as soon as Sunday for a first-appearance hearing , said John Evans , Wardlow 's lawyer .

Police have more than one confession in the case , according to Robert Parker , director of the Miami-Dade Police Department .

Rivera 's attorney , Wilbur Smith , said Saturday he `` had been led to believe '' that his client confessed , but was n't sure after speaking to Rivera .

Asked about news reports alleging Rivera was the shooter , Smith said that he was aware of the stories , but that he had `` not talked enough to Eric to find that out . ''

`` The brief probable cause statement that we received did not indicate who was the shooter , '' he said .

The four men were expecting to find an unoccupied home , `` so murder or shooting someone was not their initial motive , '' Parker said .

`` The key to solving this case was citizens ' tips , '' he said .

The men knew Taylor lived at the house , said Parker , who added that additional arrests were possible .

At 1:45 a.m. Monday , Taylor 's girlfriend , Jackie Garcia , called 911 and said someone had been shot .

Authorities have said she told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack .

Police said that Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room , and that Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door . The door was kicked in and two shots were fired , one striking Taylor in the leg .

Taylor was a first-round pick in the 2004 draft , according to his team 's Web site .

He was regarded as one of the hardest-hitting players in the league . During his brief career , Taylor recorded 306 tackles -LRB- 248 solo -RRB- , two sacks and 12 interceptions . E-mail to a friend
