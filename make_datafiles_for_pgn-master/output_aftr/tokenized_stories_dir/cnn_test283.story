-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lionel Messi is not for sale .

That was the defiant message from Barcelona 's new president , who is adamant that the club 's all-time leading goalscorer is going nowhere amid reports French club Paris St Germain want to sign the Argentine .

Messi arrived at Barca in 2000 , graduating through the club 's youth system before going on to establish himself as the best player on the planet .

The club 's determination to keep hold of Messi will be sweet relief to Barca fans after a turbulent few weeks .

Former president Rosell stepped down after a Spanish judge 's decision to investigate the deal which saw Neymar move to Catalonia from Brazilian team Santos last June .

The club initially announced the deal was worth $ 78 million , but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed .

A Barcelona member launched a case against Rosell for not disclosing the full details and the club was asked by Spanish authorities to hand over documentation , as well as accounts for the past three years .
