Moorland , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Like a modern-day King Canute , Sam Notaro is determined not to let rising waters flood his home .

Streets have turned into rivers , cars are submerged up to their windshields , and homes have been abandoned .

But Notaro is a lone holdout .

He 's created his own flood defense barrier , using a digger to raise a soil embankment topped with heavy clay to act as a seal .

So far , it has kept the worst of the waters out of his home , with the help of pumps -- but the question is how long it will hold .

`` Like I say , if it rises a meter , I do n't know if it will be enough . I do n't know , '' he said .

He may be the only one left , but he 's not without help in his struggle against the elements .

Marines -- part of a hundreds-strong military deployment by the UK government -- waded through the waist-high water Tuesday to help bolster his makeshift flood defenses .

Notaro appeared stubbornly resolved to continue his battle despite the losing odds . `` We were backed into a corner . It was low so we pushed some soil up , and then you 've got to keep going , have n't you ? '' he said .

In the low-lying Somerset Levels , where some homes have been underwater for weeks , many will know his sense of powerlessness .

Dead birds litter beaches

Exceptionally strong winds in western England and Wales on Wednesday may add to people 's woes .

After the wettest January in England since 1766 , even if the heavy rain stops , ground water levels are so high that it could be weeks before life returns to normal .

And Britain is not the only place facing wild weather .

Ireland 's western Munster province and the town of Wexford could be buffeted by gusts up to 105 mph Wednesday , the national weather service said .

Winter flood warnings have also been issued in parts of Brittany in northwest France .

Meanwhile , the beaches of France 's Atlantic coast are littered with dead birds , casualties of exhaustion after days of battling relentless wind and rain .

Some 5,800 properties have flooded in England since the beginning of December .

Sandbags lined the entrances to small businesses and homes in Datchet menaced by the river 's murky brown waters .

Agency : More flooding to come

More than 1,100 homes have flooded along the Thames Valley in the past two weeks , the Environment Agency said .

`` Significant flooding '' of homes and businesses is expected , it said , with the Thames expected to rise in places to its highest level in more than 60 years .

The Thames Barrier , which is deployed to prevent the tidal river flooding central London with devastating consequences , has been repeatedly pressed into action in recent weeks .

`` The barrier is working very , very hard , '' said Toby Willison , regional director for the Environment Agency . The agency operates the defense system -- which works by stopping high tides coming in when the river level is already high .

`` At the moment it 's operated 29 times since the beginning of December ... which when you consider it was completed in 1982 and has only opened 154 times since 1982 -- it is operating much more frequently at the moment than it ever has done in the past , '' he said .
