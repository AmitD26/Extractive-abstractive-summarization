-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite the progress made toward gender equality , there remains this fact : Women still hold fewer leadership positions in government and industry , and men still face a social stigma if they stay home , as Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg writes in her much-discussed book , `` Lean In : Women , Work and the Will to Lead . ''

We wanted to know what `` leaning in '' looks like in practice . CNN invited families to share their successes and struggles at balancing work and family . Can women -- or for that matter , anyone -- be high-fliers at home and work ? And if so , how does it work ?

While arrangements differed , there was a common refrain : You ca n't go it alone , there 's no right path and we need to stop judging each other 's choices .

` It boils down to removing the stereotypes '

`` In our household , there are no traditional roles , '' wrote Aisha Houser , a human resources specialist and mother of three in Huber Heights , Ohio . She and her husband both work full-time , and he also goes to school at night .

Working women , know your value

Above all , she said , `` husbands need to understand that they will have to clean , wash clothes , cook , dress the kids or whatever needs to be done . ... It boils down to removing the stereotypes of the traditional family . ''

He stays home with their three children , ages 6 , 3 and 1 . Trained as a lawyer , he has never found a job that earned enough to support their family . As much as he wants to work , he does n't want to do it `` if it means paying someone else to raise our kids , '' Moening said .

Professionally , `` I am a better agent because he stays home . I could n't do this job full time as a mother to three little ones , if he did n't handle everything else , '' Moening said .

Moening 's own parents both worked and her mother was the primary breadwinner . They raised her to associate happiness with a great job , not motherhood . Yet as proud as she feels about being a special agent , Moening would quit her job and retire at 35 if her husband found a job that paid as much as hers .

`` Deep down , no matter how much opportunity is afforded me , I 'm a mom through and through , '' she said . `` I have a fantastic job , no doubt . But I truly feel I would be more personally satisfied by not missing a moment of my kids ' childhoods . ''

` Life is a team effort '

One of 10 children , David J. Hopper was raised in a traditional household . His father worked as a meat cutter and never washed a dish . Every night he sat in his place at the end of the table and was always served first .

Things came to a head when Hopper 's son was diagnosed with a developmental delay and needed extra care . Dawn was pregnant at the time , and it was too much for her to handle everything . He decided to quit his job and build his own practice .

Looking back , it was a `` slow change . '' But he realizes now Dawn `` would n't be very happy without a career , and I would n't be very happy without that wife . In a way I 'm married to her career , too . ''

`` Parenting is hard , and it DOES take a village . Sometimes a village and a neighboring village , '' wrote Amy Lawson , a divorced mom of two boys in Gainesville , Florida .

She works as an administrator in an OB/GYN office and maintains blogs about motherhood and social media marketing .

Though technically she is a single mom , Lawson often feels the need to add the disclaimer that her ex-husband is very involved with their children , of whom they share custody .

She said too many women have bought into the notion they need to `` bring home the bacon , fry it up in a pan , and never let their man forget he 's their man , '' to paraphrase the song used in the 1980s commercial for Enjoli , `` the 8-hour perfume . ''

`` There are times I ruminate on why I 'm not the kind of mom that can stay home and make homemade hummus with organically grown crinkle cut cucumbers , then I stop thinking about that because there is laundry to be done , hugs to give , dinner to cook , homework to check and inevitably something to pull out of the dog 's mouth , '' she wrote .

` It is hardly ever perfect '

`` I used to be ashamed of the number of before - and after-care providers I employed , '' wrote Rebecca Giannelli , a mother of three and a registration coordinator for a large physician group in Illinois . Her husband has a job in the local public works department .

They have three children , ages 2 , 4 and 9 . The traditional male and female roles are `` out the window '' in her house , she said . Her husband picks up the kids in the afternoon , gives them a snack , cleans up , starts the laundry and gets dinner going . They share homework and bath time . She schedules medical appointments , pays the bills and organizes the birthday parties .

Though it often feels like they 're getting through the day `` by the skin of our teeth , '' she said she looks to her children for guidance .

` I choose sanity '

Web developer Janice Gervais was n't expecting to actually want to stay home with her two daughters .

At work , she said , `` leaning in '' to bigger opportunities -- as Facebook 's Sandberg advises women -- does n't feel realistic , either .

She said she gets through each day by `` choosing sanity '' and not comparing herself to other families .

`` My house is a war zone and guests know to call before they come over . Pursuing a higher career is on hold so the spare time I do get is spent with my kids . Their clothes are stained , their hair is a mess , their outfits do n't match , but my sanity is still mostly intact . I just feel fortunate that I have the things I have , because so many others have far less . ''
