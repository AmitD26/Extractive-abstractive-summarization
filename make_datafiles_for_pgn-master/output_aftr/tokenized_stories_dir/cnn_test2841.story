When the recession hit , the Arizona couple 's income plummeted . They tried everything they could think of to hold on to their house : They drained their savings account , sold their 401 -LRB- k -RRB- , changed jobs .

The Kollars thought they had one last hope : the Making Home Affordable program , which should have reduced their monthly mortgage to affordable payments . In theory , it 'd be a win-win : The Kollars and their two children keep their home , and the nation avoids one more foreclosure .

The problem ? The bank has n't been playing along , and the Kollars have no place to turn .

A CNN investigation revealed that the Kollars are far from alone . Housing counselors , homeowners and consumer advocates tell endless stories of banks giving homeowners the runaround : declining apparently eligible applicants ; pressuring them into loans they ca n't afford ; placing homes in foreclosure while the owners are being considered for a modified loan ; lenders telling homeowners to waive their legal rights , even though the program prohibits it ; or banks telling homeowners that they have to be in default to qualify , which is n't true . Watch more about how the program has worked so far ''

According to the Treasury Department 's most recent report , only 230,000 of the up to 4 million eligible homeowners have new mortgages under the program .

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has told bankers that he 's not happy with the pace . Banks say that it took 90 days to get the program 's rules and procedures and that they 're still training staff members to handle it .

Mark Kollar can testify to that .

In return for billions of dollars from the government to help banks recover from bad loans , the banks are supposed to help homeowners make their mortgage payments more affordable . As President Obama said unveiling the program in March , helping `` responsible folks who have been making their payments '' because it will `` leave money in their pockets and leave them more secure in their homes . ''

Under the Making Home Affordable formula , the Kollars ' payment should have been reduced to 31 percent of their $ 3,000-a-month income .

The bank 's offer ? A payment of $ 2,892 a month , or 96 percent of their income .

Bank of America spokesman Rick Simon said it 's difficult to determine what the Kollars should pay because Mark Kollar recently started a commission-based job , and his monthly income fluctuates .

By one measure , the Kollars are more fortunate than others in the same predicament ; the bank has n't sold their house out from under them . Beth Goodell , a lawyer with the nonprofit Community Legal Services of Philadelphia , says she 's seen that happen .

She says the only outlet for these homeowners is the courts .

An official with the Treasury Department said that `` in all identified instances where loans have been denied to eligible borrowers , the administration has worked with servicers to correct the problem and provide modifications . ''

And Michael Barr , the Treasury Department 's assistant secretary for financial institutions , says the program is `` off to a strong start . '' He admits that `` servicer performance has been uneven '' but believes that the lenders are on track to make improvements . And he vows that the administration `` will hold these institutions accountable for their progress . ''

Frustrated with the bank , Angela Baca-Kollar called the Obama administration 's helpline , 1-888-995-HOPE , but the representative told her that the hot line `` ca n't strong-arm the bank '' and urged her to call a government-approved housing counselor .

The Kollars had been working with such a counselor for months .

`` There is nowhere to go , '' Angela Baca-Kollar said .
