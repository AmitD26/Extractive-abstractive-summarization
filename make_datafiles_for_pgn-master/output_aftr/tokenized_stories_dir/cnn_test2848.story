The video was publicized this week by the Middle East Media Research Institute , a Washington-based organization that studies and translates news accounts and social-media postings .

The FBI 's Joint Terrorism Task Forces is investigating the video .

`` The JTTF is aware of the video and is investigating to determine any potential threat to Americans or to U.S. interests , '' FBI spokeswoman Ari Dekofsky said in a statement . `` We are not in a position to provide further comment at this time . ''

Wino uploaded the video and photographs to his Facebook page , where he is identified as `` Wino Ayee Peeyakan '' and by his real name , Nerses Kilajyan , according to MEMRI . The video was also posted to YouTube .

Although media accounts and MEMRI explained that Kilajyan 's Facebook page contained several photos and comments earlier this week , his page was taken down as of Wednesday .

That man in the video calls himself `` Creeper '' and says he 's a member of the Sun Valley GW-13 gang . In the slang of a Latino gang-banger , Creeper often sprinkles his fluent English with Spanish words .

In the two videos , the two men appear to be addressing gang members back in the Los Angeles area while they fire their rifles .

Creeper : `` We 're in Syria still gang-banging . '' Later he adds : `` Tell the homies : in the ... Middle East , still gang-banging . ''

Wino : `` We 're in Syria , homie . We 're in Syria , homie . ... We 're on the ... front line . ''

In the video , Creeper cites rappers Mr. Capone-E , Mr. Criminal and Crazy Loco , but those rappers distanced themselves from the video .

`` I 'm by no means a political person and will not be speaking on the subject of Syria , on which I 'm wholly uninformed , '' the rapper said .
