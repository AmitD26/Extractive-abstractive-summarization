-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In less than a week , Turkey will hold its first direct presidential election , yet the mood about the country can hardly be described as electric .

Erdogan understands power and pursues it like no other politician in Turkey 's modern history .

This is how he has survived massive anti-government protests , a damaging feud with former Islamist allies and a high profile corruption scandal , an appallingly mismanaged industrial disaster and successive foreign policy debacles -- latest being the abduction of 49 Turkish diplomats and consulate workers in Mosul by ISIS militants , whose rise some critics attribute in part to the AKP government 's open border policy for jihadis fighting in Syria -- all in the space of a year .

But the lull should not overshadow the critical importance of the election .

To be sure , an Erdogan victory would amount to no less than regime change for Turkey .

One would be mistaken to think of the presidency , under Turkey 's existing parliamentary system , as a ceremonial post that would deprive its occupant of the executive powers of a prime minister . Turkey has had ambitious presidents , such as Turgut Ozal -LRB- 1989 -- 1993 -RRB- and Ahmet Necdet Sezer -LRB- 2000 -- 2007 -RRB- , whose influence was checked by hostile lawmakers or meddlesome generals . A President Erdogan would n't face these obstacles : his party controls the parliament and the military has been tamed through EU-backed reforms and two highly politicized court cases .

But in defeat , there might be a valuable and necessary lesson . The two main opposition parties -- the secular republican CHP and the nationalist MHP -- have formed an informal coalition for the sole purpose of posing a numerical challenge to the AKP 's relative majority , with anti-Erdoganism being their chief unifying cause .

Party leaders have handpicked candidates and determined election strategies with minimum public consultation . Only a handful of people were involved in the selection of Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , the former secretary-general of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation , as the two parties ' joint candidate for presidency .

Predictably , this uninspiring , ultra-pragmatic , top-down tactic came short in the local elections -LRB- even when one takes into account the allegations of voting fraud , the AKP remains the clear overall winner -RRB- and risks failing in the presidential one . More importantly , this style of politics is inimical to the grassroots , democratic and pluralistic vision that the `` Gezi spirit '' has aspired to capture .

Success in local politics paves the way for success in national politics , as Turkey 's political Islamists have shown time and again over the past two decades . But a true democratic transformation also requires devolution of political authority .

Since its foundation as a republic 91 years ago , Turkey 's excessively centralized political architecture has allowed those who attain control of the state to force their will on the entire population .

The machinery that repressed ethnic minorities and pious Muslims in the past is now alienating non-practicing Muslims , Alevis , LGBTI members and other social and political minority groups who do not fit in with Erdogan 's vision of an overtly religious neo-liberal Turkey .
