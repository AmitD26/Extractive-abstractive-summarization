Kwok brothers arrested in raid

In a city where property is king , the sight of local royalty being taken into the ICAC headquarters riveted Hong Kong media , and comes at a time where the city 's reputation for transparency has been tainted by a number of scandals , most recently accusations against Chief Executive Donald Tsang that he got a sweetheart deal on an apartment and accepted private jet and yacht trips from businessmen .

The arrests `` strengthen the perception that government and business is too close , especially now it involves a former number two Hong Kong -LRB- politician -RRB- , '' said David Webb , a corporate governance activist . `` It 's part of an overall pattern of increasingly suspicious behavior that is deeply upsetting to residents . ''

Who are the Kwoks ?

The Kwok brothers and their family are the 27th richest in the world , with an estimated wealth of $ 18.3 billion , according to Forbes magazine . The family has controlling interest of Sun Hung Kai Properties , the world 's second largest property developer by market capitalization .

The family wealth has grown as Hong Kong property values , fed by increased investment from mainland China , have skyrocketed . The company has developed properties in Mainland China and Singapore , and interests in telecommunications and bus companies in Hong Kong

The Kwoks have been embroiled in a family dispute since 2008 , when they led a fight to oust brother Walter Kwok as chairman and chief executive . Thomas and Raymond became chairman and chief executive , respectively , while Walter Kwok remained a non-voting member of the board .

The Kwoks developments include the International Commerce Center , International Finance Center and Central Plaza , which are the tallest buildings in Hong Kong and among the highest skyscrapers in the world .

Besides their property empire , Thomas is known for his evangelical Christian views . The family was instrumental in the building of a theme park with a life-sized replica of Noah 's Ark -- a $ 103 million project funded by the Hong Kong government but run by Sun Hung Kai .

Sun Hung Kai property Central Plaza also has a church in its 75th floor atrium .

Hong Kong and corruption

This latest scandal comes just weeks after Hong Kong newspapers reported that outgoing Chief Executive , Donald Tsang , allegedly received a sweetheart deal on a Shenzhen apartment from a mainland businessman , as well as taking private jet and yacht trips with other Chinese tycoons . Tsang has admitted taking some trips , but said he had paid his own way , and he received no break on the Shenzhen apartment .

The arrests of the Tsang 's former second in command and the Kwok brothers is `` an earthquake '' for Hong Kong 's business community , said Steve Vickers , a security expert and former head of the Hong Kong police Criminal Intelligence Bureau .
