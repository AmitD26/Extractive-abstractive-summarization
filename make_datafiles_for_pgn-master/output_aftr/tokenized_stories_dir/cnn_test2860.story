London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- London 's inaugural Technology Week is underway , as the United Kingdom 's capital promotes its tech stars and shows it can compete with Silicon Valley . Here are five companies to watch , as they pitch to make it big .

Big data is a huge topic at London Technology Week , with focus on how we can use it to empower us . One company taking that big data memo and maximizing it is Squawka . It 's a real-time football data company that is already delivering tons of data on football matches every week , allowing its users to become champions in their Fantasy Football leagues . But the bigger picture is all about empowering clubs , coaches , and pundits to understand what is happening with the real game .

Chances are you might not have heard about Seene , but earlier this year the company won the Smart UK award for UK 's Most Innovative Mobile Company . It creates 3D imaging on the iPhone by just using the phone processing . Imagine women being able to take a picture of a dress they like and send it to others to look at in 3D -- or 360 degree images to share . With the 3D imaging space heating up , this is certainly one to watch .
