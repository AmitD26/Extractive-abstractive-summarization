-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Here 's a real shocker : Teens are better than their parents at using the Internet , and are likely to hide some of their online behaviors from them .

That news comes from a 2,017-person survey funded by the online security software maker McAfee , which is pushing a product that helps parents monitor their kids online .

McAfee said parents are often unaware of these behaviors .

`` Parents , you must stay in-the-know , '' McAfee 's Robert Siciliano wrote in a blog post . `` Since your teens have grown up in an online world , they may be more online savvy than their parents , but you ca n't give up . You must challenge yourselves to become familiar with the complexities of the teen online universe and stay educated on the various devices your teens are using to go online .

Nearly half of parents install some sort of online controls , the survey said . Forty-four percent know their teens ' passwords , and one in 10 uses a location-monitoring device .

`` We do n't think it 's a good idea for parents to spy on their kids surreptitiously , because eventually they 're going to find something they have to confront them about , and it 's going to destroy the other lines of communication , '' Justin Patchin , a criminal justice professor and co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center , told CNN in 2010 .

In the report , McAfee also encourages parents to be upfront with their children if they decide to monitor their behaviors .

`` Half of teens say they would think twice about their online activities if they knew parents were watching , '' the report said .

The McAfee-funded report , which was carried out by the research company TRU , surveyed 1,013 parents and 1,004 teens between the ages of 13 and 17 . The interviews were conducted online in May .

The report , titled `` The digital divide : How the online behavior of teens is getting past parents '' -LRB- PDF -RRB- , also includes a list of the `` top 10 ways teens are fooling their parents . ''

Here 's the list , with the percentage of teens who said they engaged in these behaviors , according to the survey results :

3 . Hide or delete IMs or videos -LRB- 34 % -RRB-

5 . Use a computer your parents do n't check -LRB- 23 % -RRB-

6 . Use an Internet-enabled mobile device -LRB- 21 % -RRB-
