The runaway had made the 24-hour Walmart in Corsicana , Texas , his getaway hideout .

For what may have been more than two days in July , he roamed the store unnoticed . When he was tired , he 'd lie down in his hidden cubby and sleep while shoppers were unaware the runaway was back there .

`` Our concern was getting the child to safety , '' he added .

CNN affiliate KTVT obtained pictures of the child 's hideaways , one showing a makeshift bed between stacks of boxes . The station reported the youth appeared to have changed clothes several times , stashed away supplies and had even taken a fish from the pet department .

Police said the boy 's mother told them he had run away several times before . In those cases , he had fled to abandoned houses , other businesses or creeks .
