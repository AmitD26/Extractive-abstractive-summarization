Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. Rep. Gary Condit 's semen was found on underwear belonging to Chandra Levy , according to an FBI biologist testifying Wednesday in the trial of Ingmar Guandique , who is accused of murdering the Washington intern in 2001 .

The panties were retrieved in May 2001 by investigators searching Levy 's apartment in the days after her parents reported her missing . Her body was found over a year later in Washington 's Rock Creek Park .

Condit , who testified in the trial on November 1 , has refused to address the question of whether he had sex with Levy .

The disappearance of Levy , then an intern for the federal Bureau of Prisons , drew national attention after her parents discovered a connection with Condit . The congressman was never a suspect in the case , but was questioned intensively for details as to Levy 's whereabouts .

Prosecutors believe Guandique , a reputed member of the Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha , attacked Levy while she was jogging and then killed her when she began to scream .

Partly as a result , prosecutors on Wednesday asked the trial judge to drop two of the six counts against Guandique , including a count of first degree sexual assault . He is still , however , facing first degree murder , kidnapping , and robbery charges .

The judge rejected a defense motion to acquit Guandique on the remaining counts .
