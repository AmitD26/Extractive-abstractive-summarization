`` You have n't admitted guilt . You have n't admitted responsibility , and you did n't this morning even express remorse that Vashti 's no longer on this earth , '' Solomon said . `` One of the victim 's family asked me to show you no mercy , and I do n't intend to show you any mercy . You did n't show Vashti any mercy on April 30 , 2011 . ''

Under the judge 's sentence -- the maximum allowable under Kansas law -- Seacat must spend 31 years and three months behind bars before he 's eligible for parole .

At Monday 's hearing , Vashti Seacat 's family members asked the judge to give the maximum sentence and condemned the man who murdered her .

`` I teach about crimes , '' Seacat said . `` I know what covers up crimes and what does n't . I know that a bullet hole has never been covered up by a fire . I know that a murder has never been concealed by means of fire . I would n't have lit a fire to try to cover this up . ''

His attorneys said they planned to appeal the judge 's decision .

In June , a jury deliberated for six hours before deciding Seacat 's fate .

Throughout the trial , Seacat maintained his innocence . Defense attorney Roger Falk said that Vashti Seacat killed herself because she was depressed due to a side effect of her medication .

At Monday 's sentencing , Solomon said Seacat 's guilt was `` overwhelming . ''
