Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. says neither he nor any emissaries offered favors in exchange for a Senate appointment .

Jackson , the son of famed civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and a six-term Democratic congressman from Chicago , had publicly sought to succeed President-elect Barack Obama in the U.S. Senate .

Jackson said he had fought corruption `` since day one '' but said he could not serve as Illinois senator until his name was cleared in the public eye .

`` While I would be honored to serve the people of this state , it is clear to me that I am in no capacity to serve them if there is a cloud over my head that seems to suggest that I am involved in some unscrupulous scheme to be a United States senator or anything else , '' Jackson told CNN 's Don Lemon .

Prosecutors accuse Blagojevich of selling the Senate seat in exchange for campaign contributions and other favors . However , they did not accuse Jackson or any of the other candidates referred to in the complaint of wrongdoing .

Jackson said he does not understand why Blagojevich believed he would trade favors in exchange for an appointment to the Senate , saying he had `` nothing to offer but my record of public service . ''

`` When the facts become clear ... I think the American people will recognize that the governor of our state is a little different , '' he said . Watch Jackson question the governor 's mental capacity ''

`` I think that there is a disconnect between public service and private sacrifice . ... If for one moment you think that public service is also private gain , then you are trampling on very , very unsteady ground that is likely to force you and good people with good names in a very different process , '' he said .

CNN 's Scott J. Anderson contributed to this report .
