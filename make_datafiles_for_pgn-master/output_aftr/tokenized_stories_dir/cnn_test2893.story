The scientists had found that a particular gene , named TEM1 , is over-expressed , or present in abnormally high levels , in the blood vessels feeding some ovarian tumors . `` When a patient has a higher level of this gene , it always correlates with decreased survival , '' lead researcher Chungseng Li , Ph.D. told CNN . `` We were looking for -LSB- a way -RSB- to identify those patients and looking into a therapy against this gene . ''

Li , a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania 's Ovarian Cancer Research Center , presented his findings Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research 's annual meeting in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

`` I think it 's very exciting that people are starting to get closer to a test that might be able to be used for screening , '' says Barbara Goff , M.D. , director of gynecologic oncology at the University of Washington School of Medicine . Goff is not connected to Li 's study .

`` I do n't think we 're there yet , but I think we can be cautiously optimistic , '' she says . Goff notes that , like Li 's group , other researchers have identified different markers that may be predictive of ovarian cancer , but so far , no prospective studies have been done in humans . Still , she calls the finding `` promising . ''

Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the United States because it is so hard to detect in its early stage , when it is still treatable . It 's diagnosed in approximately 20,000 American women each year . The overall five-year survival rate is 46 percent , but jumps up to 93 percent if caught before it has spread ; however , only one in five women 's cancer is diagnosed at this early stage .

Currently , there is no test to detect ovarian cancer early . `` Nothing , except CA-125 ; it 's the only serum marker we have , '' says Coukos , referring to a blood test that detects a protein often found in high concentrations in tumors . `` But it does n't perform very well : it is not sensitive and not very specific either , so it performs very poorly in terms of early diagnosis of ovarian cancer . ''

Li and Coukos hope that their TEM1 findings can be used for detection and treatment of other cancers as well . `` TEM1 is over-expressed in a variety of tumors , '' says Coukos , including breast cancer , colon cancer and glioblastoma .

`` I think the biggest problem for screening for ovarian cancer is that it is not a very common disease , only about one out of every 2,500 women gets it , '' explains Goff . `` So it 's important , if you have to screen 2,500 women to detect every case of ovarian cancer , that you have a test that is incredibly sensitive and incredibly specific and incredibly inexpensive . Bringing all three of those things together is the real challenge . '' Read one ovarian cancer patient 's blog

Goff developed a `` symptom index '' -- a set of questions that doctors can ask women -LRB- or women ask themselves -RRB- to determine who would benefit from having further tests , including a CA-125 test and a trans-vaginal ultrasound .

Goff says that if ovarian cancer is suspected , it is important is to get to the right doctor .
