-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia 's seizure of Crimea last month may have unfolded with a lightning quickness , but Vladimir Putin and the West are now engaged in a much slower match of wits on a chessboard stretching across most of eastern Ukraine .

Rather than going for checkmate , both sides now seem content to wait for the other to make a mistake . Putin made a strong first move by placing 40,000 troops on the border -- and separatists , who are not officially linked to Russia , on the ground in Ukraine .

On the other side of the board are U.S. President Barack Obama , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Ukraine 's fledgling government . The biggest challenge for Obama and his German counterpart is to keep a united Western front . They need to uphold a credible threat of massive economic sanctions that could undercut the Kremlin 's funding if it does n't toe the line .

Obama , on the other hand , is much more inclined to put the squeeze on the Kremlin . Washington is used to confrontation with Russia -- and with Putin , specifically -- and America is much less economically-connected with its old Cold War rival .

American leaders are n't motivated solely by their concern over eastern Europe and Russia reasserting itself as a more aggressive and expansionist power . The U.S. also wants to assert key norms of international order -- namely territorial integrity and the principle to change borders only with the consent of all parties .

Ukraine is also a welcome opportunity to signal to allies and rivals alike that America is not retrenching from its global engagements . The impact of the Ukraine crisis on China and the various territorial conflicts with its neighbors will also loom very large on the minds of policy makers in Washington .

The West also needs to make sure that Kiev 's interim government does n't lose its nerve . As hard as it is for leaders to watch pro-Russian separatists take over their buildings , any large-scale operation in eastern Ukraine could give Putin the opportunity he may be waiting for : invasion with some kind of dubious pseudo-legal cover .

It is difficult to say who is in a better position . Putin is a master tactician . Since his years as a KGB agent in Dresden in the 1980s , he has gained much expertise in finding and exploiting the West 's weak spots . And he seems to have broad support at home for his confrontational brand of politics .

The West has no appetite to confront Russia . But if Putin 's tanks roll into eastern Ukraine out of the blue , without any pretense of legitimacy , he will turn Western opinion even further against him . This could give Merkel and Obama the necessary backing for tough sanctions .

A full-scale crackdown by the Ukrainian government on separatists would give Moscow the cover to move some Russian troops as `` peacekeepers '' into eastern Ukraine . Once inside the country , another `` frozen conflict '' could be created which would destabilize the country and prevent Western attempts to help Ukraine to get on its feet . This would keep Putin 's longer-term ambition -- to bring Ukraine into a Moscow-led alliance or federation -- very much alive .

But if the U.S. and EU demonstrate that they are truly ready to use economic warfare to counter the Russian military machine , the West may yet be able to deter Putin from going much further . Something has to give soon .
