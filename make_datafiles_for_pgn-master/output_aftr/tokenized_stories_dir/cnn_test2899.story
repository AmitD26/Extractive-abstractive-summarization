-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The New Zealand political party founded by German Internet tycoon Kim Dotcom has joined forces with a firebrand Maori activist , in what is being described as one of the world 's most unlikely political marriages of convenience .

The Internet-Mana Party alliance between Dotcom 's Internet Party and the left-wing , indigenous-focused Mana Party was announced by Mana 's leader , the controversial Maori nationalist MP Hone Harawira .

`` It 's completely new ground , but politics is about the art of the possible and I 'm looking forward to what we can achieve , '' Harawira , seated next to the Internet Party 's chief executive Vikram Kumar , told reporters .

The wealthy Web entrepreneur , who is battling extradition to the U.S. on criminal digital piracy charges , launched his party in January , with a pledge to focus on Internet privacy and government surveillance , and to make politics exciting .

Critics , including New Zealand Prime Minister John Key , have described Dotcom 's political activities as part of an attempt to protect himself against U.S. extradition efforts .

Bryce said the alliance represented an attempt by the two political minnows `` to game the electoral system and help each other get their politicians into parliament '' at the general elections in September .

Edwards said he tipped the buzz around the alliance could see it fare well in the September vote . `` New Zealanders like to see outsiders having a go , '' he said . `` The sum of the whole is going to be greater than the two parts . ''

The two parties make strange bedfellows , apparently sharing little common ground beyond their opposition to the current center-right National government .

Harawira , the son of a veteran Maori radical , has a long history of strident Maori activism and is seen as a figure of the far-left .

He has been a polarizing presence in parliament since he was elected in a seat reserved for Maori voters in 2005 , criticized for remarks perceived as racist against white New Zealanders , and for calling for an opposition leader to be shot .

He eventually split with the Maori Party in 2011 over their support of the government . His new party , Mana , was established primarily as a vehicle to represent the interests of indigenous New Zealanders but also attracted support from non-Maori left-wing activists .

` Big mistake '

One of the Mana Party 's founding members , the left-wing activist and former lawmaker Sue Bradford , quit the party over the move , which she labeled a `` big mistake . ''

`` Sucking up to a German millionaire is not in my future , '' she told reporters . `` There 's no way I can continue to be in a party where we are all really just the political plaything of a millionaire Internet mogul . ''
