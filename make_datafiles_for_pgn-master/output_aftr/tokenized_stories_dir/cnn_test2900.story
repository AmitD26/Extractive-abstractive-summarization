Whether you 're looking for over-the-top pup pampering or just ca n't envision a family vacation without including your clan 's four-legged friend , we 've got destination ideas for you .

Outer Banks , North Carolina

Let your Fido-friendly trip begin with a run on the sandy beaches of Corolla , home of wild ponies descended from Spanish Mustangs . Then head south to Nags Head to splurge on treats at Salty Paws , makers of all-natural , human-grade biscuits baked daily , where even pups on special diets can indulge on diabetic , low-fat and allergy-friendly varieties . Next it 's time to get your own treat fix at Fatboyz Ice Cream and Grill . Eat your burger followed by homemade ice cream at an outdoor table where your dog can join you .

After a continental breakfast , explore Jockey 's Ridge State Park -- site of the tallest natural sand dunes on the East Coast -- which , in addition to hiking , ecology tours and hang-gliding , features a 400-foot-long boardwalk with a spectacular view of the towering dune ridgeline .

Las Vegas , Nevada

Though you ca n't bring Sparky onto the casino floor , there are plenty of dog-friendly locales in Vegas , from the high-end shops along the strip that will welcome your pocket poodle to restaurants like Sammy 's L.A. Pastrami & Burgers , lauded not only for their homemade lemonade , crispy fries , and `` mean '' Philly cheesesteak , but also for the water and snacks they provide to four-footed patrons .

Kick-start your day at It 's a Grind Coffee House , which welcomes your pooch inside and is right across from a dog park . Then venture to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area , less than 30 minutes from the strip , with its unique Mojave Desert geologic features , plants and animals . The 13-mile scenic drive and more than 30 miles of hiking trails are Fido-friendly , but due to extreme temperatures , make sure to bring plenty of water .

If you ca n't resist the glitz and the promise of the slots , drop off your pooch at PetSmart 's Doggie Day Camp . Your pup will enjoy hours of play with other carefully screened and vaccinated dogs while you rake in the gambling loot . Then reunite for a relaxing evening at the Westin Las Vegas Hotel , Casino and Spa where a pet bed , food bowl and mat are provided , as well as an official `` Dog in Room '' sign . Rooms start at $ 99 , and the hotel charges a per-pet , per-stay fee of $ 35 , plus a refundable deposit of $ 150 .

Dog-friendly activities abound in Half Moon Bay . You 're welcome to bring your pup on a Coastal Elegance Tours hike along the bay or to the lighthouse . And Half Moon Bay Kayak Company provides canine life jackets and double and triple kayaks so water-loving dogs can accompany their human companions on nature and wildlife paddles .

Many local hotels are pet friendly , but the Half Moon Bay Inn offers special accommodations for four-legged guests , including a dog bed , feeding dish and treats , as well as waste bags . Rooms start at $ 130 , and the inn charges per-stay fees of $ 25 for one pet or $ 35 for two .

Lake Placid , New York

While you 're out on the town , pick up some goodies at Jake Placid Doghouse , which offers premium treats , organic foods and unique toys and apparel . Then stop by the Bluesberry Bakery for some human treats like a spinach and feta croissant or the chocolate torte . Spot is welcome to join you at the outdoor table . To work off those snacks , head to Mirror Lake for a 2.7-mile walk around the lake , and if the weather 's right , take a dip at the dog-friendly sandy beach .
