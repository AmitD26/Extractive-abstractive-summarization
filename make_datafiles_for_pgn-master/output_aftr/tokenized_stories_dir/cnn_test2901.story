For all of the joking and laughing that Costa Rica would simply turn up in Brazil to make up the numbers , there were those who knew the reality would be different .

And the Colombian practices what he preaches -- qualification from the group stage was always going to be achieved if you speak to those within the Costa Rican camp .

Bravado ? A fool 's hope ? No , this is a side which plays with a belief that comes straight from the very top and trickles through the veins of its players .

With the game having reached penalty kicks following a 1-1 draw inside 120 minutes , both sets of players had already given everything they had .

Costa Rica 's players , who had already suffered the ignominy of having victory snatched away from them , appeared to be running through treacle as they dragged their tired limbs down the field , stretching every muscle and sinew .

But having survived to make it through to penalties , those same players found the strength and skill to write yet another chapter in this incredible tale .

All seven players had scored and , with his side trailing at 3-4 in the shootout , Theofanis Gekas strode towards the penalty spot .

Perhaps Navas had noticed , perhaps he had n't . It mattered little . For when Gekas stepped forward and placed the ball to the goalkeeper 's right , Navas flew across to palm the ball away .

History beckoned .

Forward came Michael Umana -- a 31-year-old defender who plays in his home country with Deportivo Saprissa .

He drew a breath . There was no shimmy , no stutter , no hesitation . As the ball hit the back of the net , those in white shirts forgot the aches and pains which had left their limbs in agony .

In the end this proved to be a rather exciting contest -- a world away from what was served up in the opening 45 minutes .

It was Greece that produced the only real opportunity eight minutes before the interval when Dimitris Salpingidis forced Navas into a fine reflex save from close range .

At least the second half was better -- both sides dispensing with their cautious approaches and attempting to take the advantage .

Giorgios Samaras tested Navas with a powerful header as Greece , which qualified following a dramatic late victory over the Ivory Coast , began to move forward with purpose .

But just as it appeared that Greece was ready to take control , Costa Rica pounced .

That strike sparked scenes of jubilation on the touchline with Pinto , animated at the best of times , celebrating his team 's latest success .

Having only conceded once in three previous games , Costa Rica 's defense looked more than comfortable as Greece attempted a fightback .

But with 24 minutes remaining , disaster struck for Los Ticos .

As referee Ben Williams held the red card aloft , Duarte left the pitch almost inconsolable , leaving behind his 10 teammates to try to hang on .

But just as its players began to dream of the quarterfinals , Greece , one of the most belligerent teams in international football , proved why it remains so difficult to beat .

While the Costa Ricans fell to their knees , those in blue continued the onslaught knowing its opponent had been wounded .

As Costa Rica began to tire , it was Greece which took control and Mitroglou was denied a dramatic late winner by Navas when the striker looked certain to score .

That ensured the tie would be decided on penalties and when Gekas had his effort saved , Umana stood up to rewrite history .

A tie with the Netherlands in Salvador next Saturday is the reward for this Costa Rican team -- a game in which no doubt it will be written off once again .

They 'll `` think big . ''
