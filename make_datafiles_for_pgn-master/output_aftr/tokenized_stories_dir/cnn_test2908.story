He was the subject of vilification from both cycling fans and officials -- not to mention from a man who had become a global sporting icon .

`` I loved it . I thought ` This was journalism , this was what our game was about ' -- asking questions that people did n't want to answer was actually the life blood of journalism for me at that time . ''

It was Walsh 's finest hour and he even gained an apology from Armstrong during the course of the Texan 's televised interview with Oprah Winfrey earlier this year .

No elation

But the 58-year-old Irishman did not feel any sense of real elation -- only the satisfaction of a job well done .

`` We were told this is a clean Tour , but it was the fastest in history -- completely illogical ! ''

Armstrong 's treatment of the French rider Christophe Bassons , who was renowned for his anti-doping stance , only served to further raise Walsh 's suspicions .

Bullying tactics

`` I mean , Armstrong bullied him , most of the peloton bullied him and I thought : ` If you were anti-doping , that 's not how you would treat somebody who clearly was riding clean . ' ''

It was the start of a crusade to uncover the truth , though at first nobody wanted to listen .

Walsh was determined to publish his version of events and when LA -LRB- Lance Armstrong -RRB- Confidential hit the bookshelves in 2004 and a story based on it was published in the Sunday Times , the libel suits and the threats intensified .

Singled out

Armstrong said : `` Well as the esteemed author is here , I will answer this .

`` And then he said ` Extraordinary allegations , no , extraordinary accusations must be followed by extraordinary proof . ' Everybody thought that was a great one-liner . ''

But back in 2004 , with Armstrong at the peak of his fame , it was inevitable he would challenge such damaging revelations to protect his reputation .

Libel action

The Sunday Times stood by their man and his story , but when libel action in the UK courts was commenced by the litigious Armstrong , they knew the outcome would probably be in the American 's favor .

Walsh recognized the seriousness of the situation , but admitted his judgment became clouded .

`` And I was n't seeing reason to be honest . I would have been a bit of a nightmare from the legal department 's point of view and they were right .

`` It did cost the Sunday Times a million pounds , but the newspaper were tremendously supportive as was my sports editor , '' added Walsh , referring to the out-of-court settlement reached with Armstrong in 2006 .

By then the Texan had retired from the sport for the first time , though the rumors would not go away .

Ultimate responsibility

Walsh believes that cycling 's governing body -- the International Cycling Union -- bears a heavy responsibility for not cleaning up its own sport in the face of overwhelming evidence of doping , not just by Armstrong but other leading riders .

He is heavily critical of its chiefs past and present , Hein Vergruggen , who resigned in 2005 to be replaced by Pat McQuaid .

`` Hindsight is an exact science and hindsight is 20-20 vision , '' McQuaid told CNN as part of the Changing Gear series . `` Of course you would do things differently but that does n't mean that I regret anything that I did .

McQuaid is being challenged for the top job at the UCI by British Cycling 's Brian Cookson , and Walsh , while not specifically backing any candidate , is convinced a change is urgently needed .

`` I have been saying this since the whole controversy unfolded -- the people who were in charge during this fiasco , should n't still be there .

`` If cycling could find a credible candidate within its own ranks to take over from Pat , it would immediately change the perception of the UCI and people would say ` You know what ? Let 's give this new guy a chance .

Ringleader

Armstrong came out of retirement in 2009 to ride for the Astana team and finished third in that year 's Tour de France . He raced two more years with Team RadioShack with diminishing success before quitting in early 2011 .

By then he was the subject of a U.S. federal investigation into doping allegations and more former teammates , notably Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis , came forward to specifically implicate the Texan as the ringleader .

Once again , Walsh had been ahead of the game , having published From Lance to Landis : Inside the American Doping Controversy at the Tour de France in 2007 .

The federal case against Armstrong was eventually dropped , but the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency persisted in its investigations .

For the first time since 2004 , Walsh will cover the Tour de France after Britain 's Team Sky Cycling team , who won the Tour last year with Bradley Wiggins , gave the journalist exclusive behind the scenes access to the 2013 race .

`` I 'm really looking forward to it , but I 'm looking forward to it because I feel that the Armstrong era has been dealt with and we can start again , '' said the Irishman .

`` We can start tentatively believing in some of what we see , and that 's why I 'm back . ''

Not that Walsh believes the doping culture in cycling has been completely eradicated and points to last year 's race where Luxembourg 's Frank Schleck fell foul of the testers .

`` The one certainty is that Frank Schleck was n't the only guy who doped in last year 's Tour de France , '' said Walsh . `` That 's absolutely certain .

`` Nobody of sane mind would believe that the people who get caught are the only people who dope . ''

`` They say they 're clean . I 've seen nothing to make me suspicious that they 're telling a lie when they say they 're clean , though that does n't mean that things could n't be happening behind my back .
