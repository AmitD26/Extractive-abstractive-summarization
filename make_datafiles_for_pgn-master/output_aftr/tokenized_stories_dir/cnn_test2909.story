The fact that Susie -- a 4-year-old Maltipoo -- survived in the first place is nothing short of `` a miracle , '' according the emergency vet who treated her . Dr. Spencer L. Ratnoff said Susie suffered no internal bleeding or broken bones , `` another miracle , '' he said .

Susie 's fall occurred Friday evening when she and owner Elaine Caralis were visiting a neighbor on the 16th floor of her Fort Lauderdale high-rise .

Timothy Heiser of Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue said responders `` cut holes above and below the second floor to try to get -LRB- to her -RRB- . ''

He said a fire crew `` eventually managed to get close enough to the pup to remove her from the shaft before she could fall any further . ''

Caralis called rescuers ' efforts over the three harrowing hours `` heroic . ''

An ambulance rushed Susie to Oakland Park Animal Hospital , where a waiting Ratnoff feared the worst .

But Ratnoff said Susie was alert and conscious upon arrival , and despite some serious bruising , is expected to make a full recovery .

Her shaken owner echoed the doctor 's assessment . `` It 's a miracle , '' Caralis said Saturday .
