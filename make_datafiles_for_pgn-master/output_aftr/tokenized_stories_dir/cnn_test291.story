-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Dunn will have to wait another day -- at least -- to learn his fate .

He is charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis , one of four black teenagers who were in an SUV shot by Dunn -- who is white -- in violence that flared from an argument over loud music .

With that , Judge Russell Healey gave them the OK to head back to their hotel so that they could return for deliberations around 9 a.m. Saturday .

`` This is one admirable group , '' Healey told the court shortly before dismissing the jury . `` They are clearly taking this thing as seriously as they should . And I could n't be more proud of them for how hard they are working . ''

This announcement capped a relatively uneventful day Friday , after what had been an emotional and eventful trial .

The closest thing to news came shortly before 5 p.m. , when Judge Healey answered a question from the jury : Is it possible to not reach a verdict on one count and reach a verdict on other counts ?

To which Healey responded : Yes .

Prosecutors contend that Dunn 's firing into the SUV equates to an act of murder . In addition to that count , Dunn also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder . If found guilty , he faces up to life in prison .

Trial draws comparisons to another Florida case

The Dunn case has drawn parallels to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin , which like the current trial had racial overtones and claims of self-defense .

Dunn defense attorney Cory Strolla told CNN 's Chris Cuomo on Friday that the Zimmerman and Dunn cases are n't so similar in his mind .

`` My client did not wait to become that victim ; my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger , '' he said .

Unlike the Zimmerman case , police rushed to charge Dunn with murder , the defense attorney said .

Even though a weapon was never found , Strolla maintains the youths could have had one . Dunn felt threatened and acted to defend himself , he said .

`` Now , does it sound irrational ? Of course it sounds irrational . But have you ever been in that situation ? '' Strolla said .

Jurors on Thursday asked to see surveillance video from the gas station where Dunn shot Davis .

In closing arguments Wednesday , prosecutors said inconsistencies between Dunn 's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot the teen .

His attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty . He pleaded with jurors to find Dunn not guilty .

` There was no gun '

She noted that Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV , three of them while the car was fleeing .

He never took cover -- but instead opened his car door -- even though he would later tell detectives he had seen a weapon , she said .

`` There was no gun , '' Wolfson told jurors .

In addition , she said , he did not tell his fiancee , Rhonda Rouer , that he had seen a weapon until more than a month later .

And he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911 , Wolfson said .

` Rap crap '

In the parking lot , as the music blared , `` his blood started to boil ; he did n't like the music that was coming out of the car next to him ; he got angrier and angrier , '' Wolfson said .

Dunn rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down , which they did , but then turned it back up , Wolfson said .

Dunn testified Tuesday that he saw Davis reach down and pick something up , and that he saw about `` 4 inches of a barrel '' from a 12 - or 20-gauge shotgun above the window .

He muttered aloud to himself , '' ` You 're not going to kill me , you son of a bitch , ' '' as he opened the glove compartment , grabbed his pistol , dropped the holster at his feet , chambered a round and began firing , he said .

Detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting , he said .

The court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors , fearing they could be the subject of threats , but a court document shows the jury is made up of four white females , two black females , four white males , an Asian female and a Hispanic male , plus four alternates .
