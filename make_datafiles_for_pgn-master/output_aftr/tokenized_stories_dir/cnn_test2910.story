It 's scenes like this one , which opens Adam Shankman 's new film `` Rock of Ages , '' based on the rock opera of the same name , that have audiences split on movie musicals . Formerly a surefire moneymaker , the genre has become more accustomed to sporadic success in recent years .

Still , studios recreate such musicals , hoping for `` Mamma Mia 's '' box office numbers and `` Chicago 's '' critical acclaim .

Boasting names like Tom Cruise and Catherine Zeta-Jones , nostalgic rock anthems and '80s flair , `` Rock of Ages '' will prevail if audiences are in on the joke , said Robert Viagas , the founding editor of Playbill.com .

Director Shankman appears to agree with Viagas .

`` At a certain point , people lost the ability to ... imagine a realistic story being told through music and dance , '' Viagas said , noting theatrical underachievers like 1967 's `` Doctor Dolittle , '' 1968 's `` Star ! '' and 1969 's `` Hello , Dolly ! ''

`` Movies have become so literal , '' he added . Some people respond better to `` things that are sort of in quotes . It has to have an element of reality . ''

But the director said he was comforted by Cruise 's enthusiasm and hard work as rock star Stacee Jaxx .

Cruise has said he spent about five hours a day training for the role , and it 's a good thing , because Jeffrey Simonoff , a New York University Stern professor of statistics , said the `` Mission : Impossible '' actor 's performance could potentially be a big draw .

People will be intrigued to see a star in this role who is n't usually associated with singing and dancing , said Simonoff , who co-wrote a recent study titled `` Broadway Show Survival . '' Then there 's Zeta-Jones , who won an Academy Award for her role as Velma Kelly in `` Chicago . ''

If a Broadway show that costs $ 350 for a family of four in New York can be successful , Simonoff reasoned , why would n't a movie version , that costs about $ 45 for that same family , do well ?

That said , `` You get less of the spectacular aspect in the movies than you do in the theater , '' he said . `` Music is playing , dancing is going on , and you really feel it a lot more than you do on the movie screen . ... Movie musicals do get hurt by that . ''

Most of the musicals that have done well at the box office of late have used a mix of dialogue and music to move a story along , much like `` Rock of Ages . '' So it will be interesting to see how `` Les MisÃ © rables , '' a fully sung musical , performs at the box office when it opens in December , Viagas added .

The `` Rock of Ages '' movie soundtrack , which debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 , and No. 1 on the Soundtrack chart , will likely have a better week after the film opens , said Phil Gallo , a senior correspondent at Billboard .

'' ` Rock of Ages ' is filled with 11 o'clock numbers , '' Gallo said .
