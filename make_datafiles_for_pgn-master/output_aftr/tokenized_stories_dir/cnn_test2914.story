Congressional leaders call for halt to ` cascade of leaks '

The issue of leaking classified information has been thrust into the national spotlight this week .

Several leading members of Congress argue that the Obama administration has not done enough to prevent leaks about a puported cyberwarfare program against Iran , the administration 's efforts to expand its drone program and Obama 's personal involvement in `` kill lists '' of militants in Yemen and Pakistan .

The fact that the Obama administration has aggressively used the Espionage Act surprised people such as Steven Aftergood , director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists . He said the uptick in prosecutions was `` not what anybody expected . ''

He said he believes there are several reasons why `` there 's something new and different going on . ''

An additional factor is political pressure on the administration from Congress to stop the leaks , he said .

Analysts : ` The ship of state always leaks '

`` Nobody is saying , ` You 're overreacting . Back off . There are too many prosecutions . ' That is not the message coming from Congress , '' Aftergood said . `` Instead , congressional leaders of both parties are saying , ` We want more prosecutions and fewer leaks . ' ''

`` That is not my position , '' he said . `` I think Espionage Act prosecutions are , in most cases , inappropriate responses to the disclosures . ''

`` There are a couple of other lesser statutes that sometimes are invoked , such as misappropriating government property , that are more of a stretch , but there is no law that says you may not disclose any classified information under any circumstances , '' he said .

`` And the Espionage Act is the closest fit . It does n't mean they are being accused of espionage , but this statute is being applied to fit the facts of these cases . And the courts have said , when challenged that that 's permissible . ''

`` If that seems like a contradiction , it 's only on the surface , '' he said . `` The administration never pledged not to enforce classification rules or to invite defiance of limits on disclosure of classified information . ''

It is true , however , that the law has only been used recently to prosecute low - and mid-level employees .

`` That 's one of the problems with leak prosecution in general , '' Toobin said . `` High government officials feel no compunction about leaking , and the rare times anyone is prosecuted , it 's usually someone at a low level . ''

`` And also , I react to this as a journalist -- an interchange of information and ideas between government and the news media is indispensable to a functioning democracy , and if you start scaring sources with the possibility of years in prison , the loser is not going to be the news media -- it 's going to be the public , '' he said .

White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Obama `` has demonstrated his commitment to transparency through the variety of steps he has taken , unprecedented in American presidential administration history .

`` Is it only the Army privates and the mid-level bureaucrats who are leaking ? Is it never White House officials or senior agency officials ? Judging by the government 's prosecution record , you 'd think that senior officials never leak , because they 're never being prosecuted , and we know that 's not true , '' he said . `` What appears to be a pattern of selective prosecution is another aspect of the unfairness of the way these statutes are being enforced . ''

`` A felony prosecution for disclosure of information to the media ought to be the response in only the most egregious and damning cases , '' Aftergood said . `` Instead , it seems to be the first response , even in the mildest or most questionable cases , like that of Thomas Drake . ''

Drake , a former National Security Agency official , was indicted in 2010 on 10 counts of willful retention of national defense information , obstruction of justice and making false statements . Prosecutors accused him of leaking information to a reporter .

Drake 's attorneys said the case did not involve `` the handling or mishandling of classified information . Rather , it relates to Mr. Drake 's decision to communicate with a Baltimore Sun reporter about his belief that NSA was engaged in waste , fraud and abuse . ''

Also , there 's Shamai Leibowitz , a former FBI contract linguist who pleaded guilty to providing classified documents to the host of an Internet blog , who then published information on the blog . Leibowitz was sentenced to 20 months in prison in 2010 .

`` There 's too much passion at work here , too much zeal and not enough judgment , '' he said .
