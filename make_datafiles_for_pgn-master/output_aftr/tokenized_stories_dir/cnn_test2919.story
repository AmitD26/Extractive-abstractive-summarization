London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Barclays bank chief executive Bob Diamond will voluntarily give up bonuses worth $ 31 million after he resigned in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal , the bank said Tuesday .

It is twice as much as he is entitled to under his contract , which has a six-month notice period , bank chairman Marcus Agius said .

Barclays will also pay Diamond 's legal bills if he faces criminal investigation , a source close to the bank told CNN Tuesday . The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information .

In a statement , Agius said the board deeply regretted the circumstances that led to Diamond resigning from Barclays .

`` Despite having no personal culpability , he recognizes more than anyone the negative attention that they have generated and has taken characteristically strong action to address that , '' Agius said .

Barclays ' reputation has been hammered by a scandal over the rates at which banks lend each other money .

The rate , known as the London interbank offered rate , or Libor , is is set every morning by banks posting the rate at which they are willing to borrow with the British Bankers ' Association .

Agius ' evidence follows that of Bank of England 's deputy governor Paul Tucker Monday , in which he denied being pressured by politicians to ensure Libor rates were lowered . He also denied pressuring Barclays to lower its rates .

Diamond last week said he was `` sorry , I 'm disappointed and I 'm angry '' about the rate-fixing . `` This was wrong and I 'm not happy about it , but we put all the resources we could to make sure it was dealt with . ''

He said also `` this does n't represent the Barclays that I know and I love . '' Diamond blamed the wrongdoing on 14 traders out of `` a couple thousand . ''

Between 2005 and 2009 , when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank , traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $ 800 trillion of securities .

E-mails revealed as part of the rate-fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions .

A host of other banks , including Deutsche Bank , Royal Bank of Scotland , Credit Suisse , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase and UBS , are being investigated by regulators . Lawsuits have been filed against the banks in the United States , and are being prepared in the UK .
