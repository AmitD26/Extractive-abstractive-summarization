Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Across the Great Wall we can reach every corner of the world , '' read the header of the first email sent from China back in 1987 .

Two Chinese scientists sent it to their German counterparts through an `` email node , '' a rudimentary system used to send emails at that time . Their hyperbole aside , they probably did n't realize that the rare connection could foretell a digital revolution .

This year marks the 20th anniversary of China 's first connection with the Internet -- a technological breakthrough that has had a particularly massive impact on the world 's most populous country .

`` It 's been utterly transformational , '' said Kaiser Kuo , director of international communications at Baidu , China 's largest search engine . `` The advent of the Internet has been a great leveler in terms of access to knowledge , to education materials , to goods and services .

The boom years

Connection was by telephone lines through a modem . `` It was super slow and very expensive , '' remembered Zhao Wei , a college graduate then and now a top executive of a local Internet company .

By 1996 , the first Internet cafes opened in Shanghai and other major cities , enabling more and more people to access the Net even before they bought computers .

In 2008 , China 's Internet users reached 298 million , surpassing the United States as the world 's biggest Internet population . At the end of last year , that grew to 618 million , about half of China 's entire population .

A global player

Internet connectivity is changing the lives , lifestyle and consumer behavior of many ordinary Chinese .

Thanks to the thriving IT industry , hundreds of thousands of people have started private businesses . Some of them have emerged as major players in the global IT industry and are among the richest entrepreneurs in China .

E-commerce offers nearly two million direct jobs and over 13 million indirect ones domestically . China also hosts one of the world 's leading e-trade businesses called Alibaba that , based on gross trade , is already bigger than eBay and Amazon combined .

` Great Firewall ' still limits

`` The -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party devotes huge resources to ensuring that the Internet does not threaten their rule , '' said Jeremy Goldkorn , Director of Danwei , a China-focused blog and media research firm . `` So far , they have been successful . ''

State media reported last year that China employs around two million people to police public opinion online , while popular social media platforms such as Facebook , YouTube and Twitter remain blocked in China .

While China has built its thriving IT industry on the advanced Internet technology and business models found in the United States and other countries , analysts also credit the Chinese for their distinctive innovations .

The rapid spread of mobile connectivity is also prompting the convergence of online and offline industries . Youku Tudou Inc has been co-producing online shorts and feature film with leading Chinese film distributors such as BONA .

In the future , analysts foresee further Internet penetration and convergence .

`` You can get a smartphone that can access the Internet for under US$ 100 , '' predicted Goldkorn . `` Very soon , the entire literate population of China will be able to get online . It 's going to change everything from business to government to the way people find a spouse , buy real estate , and invest their savings . ''
