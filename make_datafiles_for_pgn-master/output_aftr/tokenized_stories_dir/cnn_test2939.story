New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A transit advertisement depicting deceased American journalist James Foley moments before he was beheaded by ISIS was pulled from circulation in New York and San Francisco , according to the attorney representing the organization behind the ads , American Freedom Defense Initiative .

The ad , which read in part , `` IT 'S NOT ISLAMOPHOBIA ... IT 'S ISLAMOREALISM , '' was intended to launch Monday , appearing on buses and at the entrance of subway stops .

David Yerushalmi , the attorney representing the president of American Freedom Defense Initiative , Pamela Geller , said he sent a letter to the Foley family attorney on behalf of his client Sunday in response to a letter from the Foleys ' attorney requesting the ad be pulled .

James Foley 's final months

The letter goes on : `` For this reason , and this reason alone , my clients have reached out as early as this morning to the New York and San Francisco transit authorities ' respective advertising agents to pull the displays depicting the captive Mr. Foley prior to his beheading . ''

Yerushalmi said the ad was pulled `` as a matter of compassion for the family , '' but the rest would remain in circulation .

Diane Foley , James Foley 's mother , said in an email Monday that her family received the letter and `` greatly appreciate the compassionate response . ''

Despite criticism , Geller said her message is not anti-Muslim , it 's anti-jihad .

`` There is nothing in my ads that say Muslim . We oppose jihad , and the idea that it 's anti-Muslim , in my opinion , is a way of detracting from the message , '' Geller said Wednesday .

One of the ads in circulation reads : `` Islamic Jew-hatred : It 's in the Quran . Stop the hate . ''

Peter Awn , a religion professor at Columbia University , said , `` to say that the Quran in and of itself is really what guides the choices Muslims make is really naive . ''
