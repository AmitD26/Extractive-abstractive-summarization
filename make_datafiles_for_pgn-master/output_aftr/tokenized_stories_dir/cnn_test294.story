Adams surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday evening in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army .

Under UK law , the police would have had to release him from Antrim police station Friday evening if a court had n't granted the extension .

Adams has long denied having any role in the death of Jean McConville , a widow who was reportedly killed by the IRA because the group believed she was a spy for the British army .

His arrest threatens the fragile peace in Northern Ireland , a peace Adams is in part credited with bringing about after decades of sectarian tensions .

McGuinness said he was confident that Adams would be able to rejoin election campaigning shortly and would `` continue to lead our party in a very positive way . ''

`` This will be subject to the full rigors of scrutiny provided in the criminal justice system , '' the statement said .

McConville 's family welcomed news of Adams ' arrest .

Her daughter , Helen McKendry , said , `` I can only do like everyone else in my case and hope that he will be brought to a court of law and be charged with my mother 's murder , so my family can get truth and justice for my mother . ''

In a statement released shortly before Adams surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday , the 65-year-old vehemently denied any involvement in the killing .

The questioning of Adams was not unexpected . Adams said he told authorities last month that he was willing to meet with investigators .

`` While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will , I am innocent in the abduction , killing or burial of Mrs. McConville , '' Adams said .

Long associated with the IRA , once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein , Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland . Today , Sinn Fein is Ireland 's second-largest opposition party .

A number of other people have been arrested and questioned in connection with the investigation into McConville 's abduction and killing .
