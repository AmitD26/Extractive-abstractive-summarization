`` Samadhi -- 4D Experience of Death , '' is a morbid `` escape room '' game that uses dramatic special effects to bring players close to what its creators imagine is an experience of death .

Losers get cremated -- or are at least made to lie on a conveyor belt that transports them through a fake funeral home incinerator to simulate death rites .

After `` cremation , '' participants are transferred to a soft , round , womb-like capsule , signifying their `` rebirth . ''

And the winner ?

`` He 'll also have to die of course , '' says the game 's fatalistic co-founder Ding Rui .

As in life , he explains , `` everyone will die eventually , no matter what they 've survived . ''

Ding and his partner Huang Wei-ping went to great lengths researching their game , investigating the cremation process that typically awaits 50 % of Chinese people after death .

The pair visited a real crematorium and asked to be sent through the furnace with the flames turned off .

`` The controller of the crematory was also very nervous ; he usually just focuses on sending bodies in , but not on bringing them back out . ''

The pair say realism is essential to provoke participants into thinking about life and death .

Huang says his interest in death emerged during a period of soul searching after a lucrative but spiritually unrewarding career as a trader .

`` China made me rich , but it did n't teach me how to live a rich life . I was lost , '' he says .

He went on to study psychology and volunteered to help in the aftermath of a 2008 earthquake in China 's western Sichuan province , launching Hand in Hand shortly after .

`` It opened a new door for me -- I went there to help but I was also saved . ''

`` I did that for two years before realizing that , instead of sitting here and listening passively , I could also do something . ''

That was when the two hooked up to create the `` 4D Experience of Death . ''

Voluntary work in a hospice showed them that few people wanted to confront the idea of death , even when it was at hand .

`` We lack understanding of death and the fear can become so overwhelming . ''

To sound out the idea , Huang and Ding first started a fundraising campaign on jue.so , the Chinese version of Kickstarter .

`` We received more than RMB 410,000 -LRB- $ 67,000 -RRB- in three months , surpassing our target , '' says Huang . `` It turns out many people in China are curious about death . ''

Ding says they hope the experience will promote `` life education '' -- prompting people to ask questions about what they are doing with their lives and guiding them to face death in a personal way .

`` There are n't any model answers in life and death education , unlike those courses that teach you to be rich and successful , '' says Huang . `` It is more important for people to experience it personally . ''

`` I was in a car crash once and the only thought in my mind then was ` why did n't I buy insurance ? ' '' says Huang . `` It was n't what I had imagined for the final moments of my life . That romantic idea of having a flashback of one 's entire life in the last moments before death -- that did not happen . ''
