-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You probably heard the story . It is , after all , so last week .

A wealthy banker goes out to lunch with a colleague . The banker disdainfully leaves a 1 % tip on a $ 133 bill with the message , `` Get a real job . '' The colleague , who runs a blog called `` Future Ex-Banker , '' takes a picture of the receipt , which then goes viral -- first on Eater.com , then on Twitter and Facebook , soon everywhere -LRB- including CNN -RRB- .

Sure , it 's been that way since your grandmother e-mailed you the story about the Nieman-Marcus chocolate-chip cookie recipe .

`` There 's never been such pressure to speak before one knows , '' says science writer James Gleick , who traced the increasing speed of society in his book `` Faster '' and the deluge of data in last year 's `` The Information . '' There 's always been a desire to gather and disseminate news , he points out , `` but never until now has it been global and instantaneous . ''

We want information , but more than that , we want it quickly -- and thanks to smartphones , which now comprise the majority of cell phones in the United States , we 're never far away from the latest bits of media . Moreover , with cellular companies promoting blazing `` 4G '' speeds and trying to expand their networks , it 's harder and harder to be out of touch -- and easier and easier to give in to the twitch of the clicker finger .

And accuracy ? Speed rules , baby . Even when your phone attempts to helpfully AutoCorrect a hastily written text , the result is as often mocked as appreciated .

`` There 's an old economic principle , that bad money drives out good , '' he says . `` One thing that worries me is that bad information is driving out good . ''

Me first !

Of course , the desire to be first , even at the risk of being wrong , is nothing new . But social networks and real-time Internet portability have combined to spawn errors and reactions at an increasingly breakneck pace , particularly on Twitter , which -- with its brevity and scope -- makes it easy to disseminate clickbacks and comebacks in 140 characters or fewer .

Many errors are minor . Actor LeVar Burton , mistaking Twitter 's private and public spheres , accidentally released his phone number to the entire Twitterverse , then backtracked with a joke . Celebrity rumors roar through all the time , causing quick kerfuffles as they 're checked and then dismissed .

Actor Ashton Kutcher , who has close to 10 million Twitter followers , tweeted a protest of Penn State coach Joe Paterno 's firing -- before realizing why Paterno was being let go . Kutcher later apologized , deleted his earlier messages and finally put his Twitter account under the control of his publicists .

Wrong or right , speed is exciting , says Gleick .

With speed of the essence , some websites have built a following by trafficking in rumors and uncertainties . In tech , of course , there are any number of sites devoted to all things Apple , which seize on the smallest bits of information , then watch as the unconfirmed reports get picked up by larger tech sites until they go mainstream .

That 's not necessarily a bad thing . For corporations such as Apple , an outburst of rumors certainly creates -LRB- or maintains -RRB- interest . The availability of smartphones encourages citizen journalism . And the ability to post quickly means that misinformation can also be corrected quickly , often after the Twitterverse flags an error .

Truthyness

`` You can do a fast correction , but it hardly ever has the value of the original , '' he points out .

Menczer , who directs IU 's Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research , has helped develop Truthy , a system to analyze Twitter posts that he was inspired to set up after the 2010 Massachusetts special senate election . An activist group created several fake Twitter accounts and put out misleading claims about one candidate ; thousands of followers retweeted the information . Though Twitter quickly disabled the accounts , the information was spread widely enough to rank highly in Google results .

Truthy attempts to find out who 's responsible for the initial message , how it has been spread and determine if the message is true . There are some tip-offs , Menczer observes , such as if the initial message comes from a now-inactive account or one with a suspicious name . -LRB- In the case of the 1 % receipt , the `` Future Ex-Banker 's '' blog was inactive by the time other sites started sniffing around , though it was thought that he was remaining anonymous for less suspicious reasons . -RRB-

Given the rush of information on the Web -- and that ever-itchy clicker finger -- the best strategy may be a little self-control , says Temple 's Farley .

Though , he adds , it 's not easy , particularly with a generation that has come of age with the latest technologies and thinks nothing of not thinking .

`` A lie can travel halfway ` round the world while the truth is putting on its shoes , '' Mark Twain once said .
