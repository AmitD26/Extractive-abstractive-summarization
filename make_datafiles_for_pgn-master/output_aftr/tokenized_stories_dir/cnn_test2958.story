-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- My first investigation as a new Epidemic Intelligence Service -LRB- EIS -RRB- Officer with the Centers for Disease Control was of a large outbreak of measles , mostly among Hispanic children , many under a year old , and many who became infected when they visited hospital emergency departments for other reasons .

By 2000 , a decade after my EIS experience , measles transmission in the United States was declared to have been stopped . However , we still have occasional clusters of measles in pockets of unvaccinated children after measles has been brought into the United States from somewhere else in the world .

Although most of us do n't realize it because it is so rare in our country , measles is a serious disease . Worldwide , on an average day , 430 children -- 18 every hour -- die from measles and its complications .

Measles is so contagious that if one person has it , 9 of 10 people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected .

Today 's interconnected world means we 're all linked by the air we breathe , the water we drink , and the food we eat . Global travel speeds the rate at which infectious disease threats such as measles can be delivered to our doorstep .

Some think infectious diseases are no longer a problem in the industrialized world . But the fact is that infectious diseases continue to be with us . That 's why prevention is the key .

The worldwide effort to prevent deaths from measles will leave behind an important global health infrastructure that will continue to make the world more secure . Improvements overseas , such as strengthening surveillance and lab systems , training disease detectives , and building facilities to investigate disease outbreaks , make the world -- and the United States -- safer and healthier .

These steps will protect the United States from measles until the world becomes measles-free .
