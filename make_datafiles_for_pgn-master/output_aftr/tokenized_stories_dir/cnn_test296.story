-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka slumped to a tame defeat in the fading gloom of a rain-hit opening Monday at Roland Garros to Spanish outsider Guillermo Garcia-Lopez .

He saved one match point a 0-5 down in the fourth but then completed a match of 61 unforced errors by hitting a backhand long .

Garcia-Lopez raised his arms in triumph while Wawrinka trudged off after the final action on the show courts after a weather-hit second day .

`` It was n't good at all , I kept trying to find my game , anything to get back in it but I just need to take a few days off now and figure out what happened , '' Wawrinka told gathered reporters after his defeat .

Earlier the two favorites for the men 's title , eight-time champion Rafael Nadal and world number two Novak Djokovic eased their way through between the rain showers .

Nadal dropped only three games in a ruthless demolition of Amerian Robby Ginepri , while Djokovic could afford to delight the Philippe Chatrier crowd with an impromptu chat with a ball boy .

They sat for several minutes talking and Djkovic even offered his new friend a drink before clinking bottles with him .

The crowd lapped it up and burst into applause and after his 6-1 6-2 6-4 demolition of Portugal 's Joao Sousa , Djokovic revealed the subject of the conversation .

`` It was a nice , fun time , something unusual for the grand slams . He accepted the offer to sit down , which I did n't think he would do , but he did . So he 's very spontaneous little boy , and I hope I see him my next match . ''

That will be against Frenchman Jeremy Chardy , with second seed Djokovic predicting a tougher test .

Defending champion Nadal was even less troubled by Ginepri , who has not won a match on the ATP Tour all season and but for a spell in the second set did not muster much resistance .

`` It does n't really matter a lot , '' he said .

`` Roland Garros is a pleasure for me , is a really honor , and is a special feeling . So all the memories at this place give me are unforgettable .

`` And does n't matter if it 's Chatrier or Lenglen or another court , '' added the Spaniard .

Great things were still expected of Nishikori at the clay court grand slam , but the ninth seed did not appear to have shrugged off his injury as he went out 7-6 6-1 6-2 to Slovak Martin Klizan in his opening match .

`` It 's tough for me , but I guess this is my tennis life , you know . I have to take care of my body and injury will come again , for sure . So I have to mentally be ready , '' he said .

`` I have to do whatever I can do to get healthy . ''

She will now face Bulgaria 's 2010 Wimbledon semi-finalist Tsvetana Pironkova for a place in the third round but Williams looms as a possible quarterfinal opponent for the 2012 champion .
