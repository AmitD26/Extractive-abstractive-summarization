-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four days after he was acquitted of murder , George Zimmerman stepped out of seclusion to help a family get out of an overturned vehicle in Florida , authorities said Monday .

Zimmerman and another man helped four people get out of an SUV that had overturned Wednesday evening in Sanford , the same community where the former neighborhood watch volunteer fatally shot teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , Seminole County Sheriff 's Office spokeswoman Heather Smith said .

Callers to 911 described a dramatic scene : An SUV lost control in the area of Interstate 4 and State Road 46 , flipping on its side and sliding into a median .

Several callers said they saw people helping a family trapped inside the overturned SUV , according to audio recordings released by the sheriff 's office .

Zimmerman did not witness the crash , and he left after making contact with the deputy , Smith said . No injuries were reported in the crash .

He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin 's father lived in February 2012 . Zimmerman , who is Hispanic , had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person , and he said he shot Martin in self-defense .

Shawn Vincent , a spokesman for George Zimmerman 's legal defense team , said when Zimmerman spoke with his attorneys on Friday , the car wreck did n't come up .

The defense team , Vincent said , first heard of Zimmerman 's involvement when media reports surfaced Monday .

CNN 's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .
