-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you think African-Americans will come out in greater numbers than ever before to vote for Barack Obama , you 're probably right .

If you think you know how they 'll vote in the almost 500 House , Senate and gubernatorial races , you could be in for a surprise .

In the final push toward Election Day , as politicians and political hopefuls seek to penetrate this community , they may no longer understand to whom they are speaking . Are they addressing blacks or African-Americans ? Is racial prejudice as important an issue today as affording a college education for their kids or taking care of an aging parent ? iReport.com : Black college cancels class to vote

Interestingly , the study found that 42 percent of those polled actually prefer to be called black -LRB- these are more likely to be more affluent -RRB- compared with 44 percent who choose to be described as African-American .

And yes , it would be misguided to assume that dropping a Martin Luther King Jr. quote into a speech and focusing on America 's history of racial inequality is the sure way to sway black voters when one-third of blacks , particularly younger people , believe that there is actually too much focus on past oppression .

As Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson recently said , `` black people do n't vote for candidates just because they are black . If Clarence Thomas ran for president , he would get five black votes . ''

Given Black America 's extreme diversity today -LRB- the study identified 11 specific groups -RRB- it is easy to misunderstand who they are and how they can be reached . Yes , discrimination and racial issues are still incredibly important , particularly to middle-age and older blacks . But the younger populations are more concerned about starting their own businesses , paying for their education , taking care of their children and creating a better work/life balance .

Although the history of black oppression in America is not the radioactive issue it once was , trust in the community -- whom blacks trust -- is still paramount . Of all institutions , they are least likely to trust credit card companies but also remain seriously wary of the mainstream media and tend to trust black media more than traditional media outlets .

It has been almost a century and a half since blacks in America won the right to vote . It makes all the sense in the world that the black community has evolved and diversified over the years , but too often politicians make the mistake of assuming that blacks are still a monolithic group fixated on all of the same issues .
