The demonstration came days after the Vatican called for Pakistan to repeal the controversial laws that say anyone who defiles the name of the Muslim prophet Mohammed should face the death penalty or life imprisonment .

`` If you challenge the prophet , we will take revenge . It does n't matter who does it , '' shouted a cleric on loudspeakers to thousands of cheering onlookers .

Since the shooting , hardline religious groups have held demonstrations praising suspected killer Muhammad Mumtaz Qadri -- who Pakistan 's Interior Minister says confessed to the killing -- calling him a hero and a defender of Islam .

The laws are often used to persecute minorities , Taseer had said .

At the rally , many said Taseer wanted to repeal the blasphemy laws , which they called an attack on Islam .

`` No doubt he was an agent , '' said protester Noor Ul Mustafa . `` After the pope 's statement it 's clear where he 's getting orders from . ''

At the protest , Mumtaz Qadri 's lawyer said his client should be set free because he was compelled to defend his faith .
