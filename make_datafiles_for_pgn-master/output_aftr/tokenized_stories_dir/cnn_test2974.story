A new CNN/ORC International survey indicates that public opinion of the President has barely budged in the wake of new challenges that Obama has faced this year .

According to the poll , which was released Wednesday , the President 's approval rating among Americans stands at 42 % . That 's not great , but it 's basically unchanged since March .

The survey indicates there have been one-to-two point changes -LRB- which are within the poll 's sampling error -RRB- in the number of Americans who say that Obama is a strong leader , that he shares their values and that he cares about people .

Obama drop started last year

Obama 's numbers edged down during the late spring and summer of 2013 following controversies over the Edward Snowden intelligence leaks and congressional investigations into the IRS ' alleged targeting of conservative political groups . Then came October and the politically charged botched rollout of the website for Obamacare , his signature domestic policy achievement .

Obama 's approval ratings slightly rebounded earlier this year before edging down to their current standing in the low 40s in most national public opinion polling .

The release of the new CNN poll comes after the crisis along the southern border dominated headlines for weeks . Prior to that controversy , the scandal rocking the Department of Veterans Affairs was in the media spotlight .

The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from July 18-20 , with 1,012 adult Americans questioned by telephone . The survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .
