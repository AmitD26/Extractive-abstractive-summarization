-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The first 3D-printed toy plane will soon jet off to the stratosphere .

`` Without doubt , this is the most complicated amateur high-altitude mission ever undertaken , '' said Lester Haines , head of the Register 's Special Projects Bureau that is behind the project .

`` We do n't know quite what will happen when the big day arrives , but one thing 's for sure -- it 's going to be quite a show , '' Heines , who also holds the Guinness World Record for the highest launch of a paper aeroplane , added .

A helium-filled meteorological balloon will lift the spaceplane to around 20 kilometers above the ground . Once it reaches that altitude , a rocket motor will fire and push the plane up to 25 kilometers .

`` Its going to be doing some very smart things ; collecting data from numerous sources , making decisions in real time , to form its trajectory and landing , '' said Guy Lipscombe from database software firm EXASOL , which sponsored the project .

Once at the right altitude , the plane will switch to autopilot and glide back to earth , guided by a built-in GPS navigation system .
