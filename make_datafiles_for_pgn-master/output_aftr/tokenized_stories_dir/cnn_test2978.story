-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` I got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it . I was lashed for four hours and I did not expect to escape , but I felt bound to record it if I did . ''

Joseph Mallord William Turner had a truly obsessional attention to art , so following in his footsteps is no easy task .

British artist Andy Parker admits he will draw the line at being tied to a mast for hours on end , but nonetheless he plans to retrace the movements at sea of arguably the greatest maritime artist of all time .

Parker may be relieved to know that the quote attributed to Turner by John Ruskin after his 1842 painting `` Snow Storm -- Steam-Boat off a Harbor 's Mouth making Signals in Shallow Water , and going for the Lead '' -- is now thought to have been apocryphal .

`` His style of painting , I believe , was not necessarily what 's in front of you but what you want to see , '' explains Parker . `` These fabulous sunsets of his were not necessarily what he saw , he could just come up with a good idea .

`` That 's what makes him such a great artist , while I 'm just a painter . So I 'm not trying to emulate his style but the position where he was . ''

`` Turner 's father was a barber and I 'm sure the Parkers and Turners probably knew each other , '' says Parker , whose family ran a saddlery business .

And while Turner set off to sea to sketch , Parker will travel the 1,000 or so miles to the various ports and harbors .

`` Chartering boats is so expensive so I 've contacted some yachting magazines to see if I can get any helpers , '' he says .

Parker , 56 , spent the majority of his life working in the music industry before coming to painting as a profession .

While Parker is `` not really a sailor , '' Turner had sea legs .

`` Turner was a great traveler , '' says Christine Riding , head of art at London 's Royal Museums Greenwich .

`` He liked to travel alone or with intimate friends , who paint the picture of a mariner .

The Greenwich National Maritime Museum recently hosted an exhibition called `` Turner and the Sea , '' the first to solely focus on his apparent obsession .

`` If you take that painting , the title itself is very important . The boat 's name is Aerial and there is no evidence of a ship by that name then .

`` Turner was known to be a very poetic artist so you think of Ariel in the Tempest , or else Ariel the ship on which Percy Bysshe Shelley died . ''

At the time , the British Empire ruled the waves with the world 's biggest navy .

`` He was born in 1775 when Captain Cook had just come back from his second voyage of discovery and the nation was a global sea power . It was almost part of his DNA from the outset . ''

`` He traveled the south coast to emulate his artistic idol , and you can see a heavy Turner influence in his work , '' Riding says .

Moran 's subsequent work , paintings such as `` The Shipwreck , '' were very Turner-esque in their use of bold colors and glowing , turbulent skies , as boats were tossed in different directions amid stormy seas .
