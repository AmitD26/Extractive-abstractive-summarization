-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Until he returned home this weekend , Merrill Newman -- an American held in North Korea -- had no idea what a story he 'd become .

`` Looking at the television and newspaper reports , I 've seen a lot of speculation about why I was detained . I 've given considerable thought to this and have come to the conclusion that I just did n't understand that , for the North Korean regime , the Korean War is n't over and that even innocent remarks about the war can cause big problems if you are a foreigner , '' he said in a statement Monday .

In his statement , Newman describes what he thinks might have set them off .

`` I innocently asked my North Korean guides whether some of those who fought in the war in the Mount Kuwol area might still be alive , and expressed an interest in possibly meeting them if they were . The North Koreans seem to have misinterpreted my curiosity as something more sinister , '' he wrote .

For weeks , the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman .

An explanation finally came last month , when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran 's `` apology . '' The word was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions .

In the note dated November 9 , Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol unit , part of the `` intelligence bureau '' fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War . He detailed how he commanded troops to collect `` information '' and wage deadly attacks .

Newman thanked Biden , the U.S. State Department , the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang and family and friends in his statement .

He also asked that people not forget Kenneth Bae , another American being held in North Korea . Bae was arrested in 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years for so-called hostile acts and attempts to topple the government .

`` For now , let me finish by saying again how great it is to be back home , safe , and with my loved ones . ''
