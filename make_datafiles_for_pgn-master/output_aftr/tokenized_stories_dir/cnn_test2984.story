-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Views on marijuana are shifting , but nearly everywhere , it is too early to talk about substantive changes to drug policies .

Not so in Uruguay .

The bill , which was passed by Uruguay 's Chamber of Deputies and will be taken up by the Senate , attempts to answer the questions that inevitably arise when debating drug policy : How will marijuana be regulated ? Who will grow it ? How can the country avoid cannabis tourism ?

The government supports the marijuana bill and says it was designed to resolve issues particular to Uruguay . But the model the bill proposes will undoubtedly be studied by other countries that grapple with the similar questions .

Why Uruguay , why now ?

There is a contradiction in Uruguayan law , the secretary-general of the country 's National Committee on Drugs , said : Consumption of marijuana has been legal , but its production and sale are not .

`` We seek to eliminate that incongruence , '' Julio Calzada told CNN .

`` We have reflected on our problems , '' Calzada said , and the government felt that Uruguay 's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue .

It is not the executive branch , but the Congress that will pass the law , and voters will decide in the next elections whether to `` punish '' the ruling party for going against public sentiment , he said .

The model

In short , the proposed law states that the planting , cultivating , harvesting and selling of marijuana remain illegal but adds a long list of exceptions to that rule .

Households may grow up to six plants and harvest a maximum of 480 grams of weed per year .

These growing operations must be licensed by the government , and the pot will be sold to the public through pharmacies , which also will be licensed to do so .

Those who grow or sell marijuana outside of these government-licensed options will be subject to prosecution and could face prison terms of 20 months to 10 years .

The bill calls for the creation of a new government body -- the Institute of Regulation and Control of Cannabis -- that would be in charge of the licensing and any sanctions for noncompliance .

This requirement is also meant to deter cannabis tourism to the country .

A grand experiment

Rising drug violence `` has impacted daily life in our country , '' and regulating the market could be a solution , he said .

If it becomes law , the new marijuana regulation will put Uruguay at odds with many countries that continue to pursue an aggressive policy of prohibition . But conversations about rethinking marijuana laws have sprung up in Latin America and elsewhere , and Uruguay is prepared to take any heat about its decision , Calzada said .
