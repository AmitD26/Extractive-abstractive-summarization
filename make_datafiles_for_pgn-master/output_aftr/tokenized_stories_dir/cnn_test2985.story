Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The private law firm hired by House Speaker John Boehner to represent the government in the federal Defense of Marriage Act has suddenly pulled out of the case .

The chairman of King & Spalding said Monday the firm 's internal vetting for accepting representation was `` inadequate . ''

The Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 by the GOP-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton . It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states can not be forced to recognize such marriages allowed in other states .

Boehner said that with the Justice Department not participating , he had `` no choice '' but to act unilaterally , and moved to lead the legal defense of the law .

Robert Hays Jr. , chairman of King & Spalding , said the firm had filed a motion Monday to withdraw its representation of the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives , `` on the constitutional issues '' regarding the law .

Law firms typically undergo an internal review process headed by senior-level lawyers to determine which cases they will accept . Controversial issues like same-sex marriage are normally subject to intense scrutiny to balance the legal issues with financial , ethical , and other considerations .

The Hays statement made no specific mention of the reasons behind the sudden change of heart .

Clement had filed a brief a week ago while at King & Spalding in a pending case from New York , where a lesbian received an estate tax bill of more than $ 360,000 after her longtime partner and legal wife had died .

Separately , he also is representing more than two dozen states in a lawsuit against the Obama administration over the sweeping health care reform law passed by Congress last year . That case is pending in a federal appeals court in Atlanta .

`` The Speaker is disappointed in the firm 's decision and its careless disregard for its responsibilities to the House in this constitutional matter , '' Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck told CNN . `` At the same time , Mr. Clement has demonstrated legal integrity , and we are grateful for his decision to continue representing the House . This move will ensure the constitutionality of this law is appropriately determined by the courts , rather than by the president unilaterally . ''

Papers have not yet been filed for Clement to continue representation of the House .

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had been vocal about her opposition to the decision to take on the case .

`` Leader Pelosi shares Mr. Hays ' apparent concerns with the lack of transparency and accountability in the way this contract was signed , '' spokesman Drew Hammill told CNN . `` She also vigorously opposes using half a million taxpayer dollars or any taxpayer resources to defend discrimination at a time when Republicans in Congress are cutting critical initiatives like education and infrastructure . It is now more critical than ever that Speaker Boehner fully account for his decision to sign this half million dollar contract to defend this indefensible statute . ''

Such a move would require Senate approval , an unlikely prospect since Democrats control that chamber .

President Barack Obama on February 23 ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the law . `` The president has concluded that given a number of factors , including a documented history of discrimination , classifications based on sexual orientation should be subject to a more heightened standard of scrutiny , '' said Attorney General Eric Holder at the time . The key provision in the law `` fails to meet that standard and is therefore unconstitutional , '' he said .

Obama had previously expressed his personal opposition to the Defense of Marriage Act but had never stated an opinion relating to its constitutionality .

Gay-rights supporters applauded the law firm 's decision to withdraw .

The New York legal fight was prompted by Edith `` Edie '' Windsor , who lived with her female partner , Thea Spyer , for more than four decades . They married out-of-state in 2007 , but neither the federal government nor their home state of New York recognized the legal union . Spyer died and left her estate to Windsor , who was then forced to pay taxes on the money because she was not considered a legal spouse .

In July , a federal judge in Massachusetts , in a separate case , became the first to rule part of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional . District Judge Joseph Tauro said that `` irrational prejudice plainly never constitutes a legitimate government interest . ''

The administration 's decision comes on the heels of other major developments in the struggle over gay and lesbian rights . In December , Obama signed legislation that will repeal the controversial `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy and bring an end to the ban on openly gay men and women serving in the armed forces .

Same-sex marriage is legal in five states -- Connecticut , Iowa , Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Vermont -- and in the District of Columbia . Civil unions virtually equivalent to marriage are permitted in New Jersey , while several other states offer more limited civil unions or partnerships .
