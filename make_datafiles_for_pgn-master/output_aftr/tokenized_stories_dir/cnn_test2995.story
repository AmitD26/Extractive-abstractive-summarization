Zale H. Thompson charged at four New York police officers with a metal hatchet Thursday , hitting two of them . The attack is the third on people in uniform in North America in a week .

He exited the car , and police opened fire on him . He died in the confrontation .

On Wednesday , radical Islamist convert Michael Zehaf-Bibeau , 32 , shot and killed a soldier , Cpl. Nathan Cirillo , who was standing guard at a veterans memorial in the capital , Ottawa . Bibeau then stormed Parliament and opened fire .

Kevin Vickers , sergeant-at-arms of the Canadian Parliament , and police officers fired dozens of rounds , killing Zehaf-Bibeau .

No direct connection has been found between any of these men and ISIS , though both Canadian attackers had been caught attempting travel to join jihad .

Official : New York case does n't appear tied to radical Islam

ISIS has a draw on the disaffected and those who do n't feel at home where they are , said jihad expert Richard Barrett of the Soufan Group .

`` The general picture provided by foreign fighters of their lives in Syria suggests camaraderie , good morale and purposeful activity , all mixed in with a sense of understated heroism , designed to attract their friends as well as to boost their own self-esteem , '' he said .

And ISIS constantly cranks the PR machine , making expert use of slick videos and social media .

ISIS has , for an anti-Western organization , been surprisingly attractive to young male recruits from the West as well as to some young women .

Canadian authorities believe that 130 citizens are fighting in jihad .

Hundreds more have gone from Europe , which is geographically closer to the fight . British authorities place the number of UK citizens fighting in Syria at 500 .

Thousands more come from the Middle East and Africa . More than 3,000 have joined from Tunisia , the largest single contingency .

ISIS sympathies

And incidents have cropped up to support those fears .

This week , a video turned up of a 17-year-old Australian boy standing with ISIS fighters and threatening to behead Western leaders , including President Barack Obama , and then to fly the ISIS flag over the White House .

And three schoolgirls from Colorado were intercepted last week at an airport in Germany as they traveled to join jihad in Syria .

In September , Australian authorities interrupted a plot by ISIS sympathizers to snatch a member of the public , behead him or her and drape an ISIS flag over the corpse .
