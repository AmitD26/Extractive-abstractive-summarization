-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Arkansas inmate seeks to exercise what he says is a key tenet of his faith , but corrections officials cite security concerns in their refusal to accommodate . The issue comes down to a half-inch beard , and this claim of religious liberty within prison walls will now be debated by the Supreme Court .

The justices will kick off the first week of their new term with a one-hour oral argument Tuesday . The case will be another major test of the government 's ability to justify a range of policies that might restrict religious accommodation -- from the Obamacare health law to workplace hiring .

Gregory Holt , also known as Abdul Maalik Muhammad , is a Muslim who filed a handwritten petition with the high court . He cites rights under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act , or RLUIPA .

The state responds that inmate beards could pose a security risk to guards and the public : Prisoners who escape could shave their facial hair , altering their appearance . And weapons and other contraband could be hidden in heavy beards or inside their cheeks , covered by facial hair .

The Obama administration is backing Holt , and some legal analysts say that could ultimately sway the justices , who have traditionally been deferential to the security judgments of prison officers .

`` It 's all about whether or not there is a compelling government interest that 's being put forth in the least restrictive way possible , '' said Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center , a progressive legal think tank . `` And here , maybe Arkansas has n't met its burden for saying it can limit a person 's ability to grow a beard when his religion compels him to do so . ''

The beard case is one of three high-profile disputes over religion that will be heard by the justices in coming weeks .

One involves a federal law allowing American citizens born in the holy city of Jerusalem to list the county of origin on their passports as `` Israel '' or `` Palestine . '' Right now , those passports list no country , a reflection of the disputed control over the region . President Barack Obama and his predecessor have resisted the congressional mandate , saying it interferes with his executive power to recognize independent sovereigns .

He cited the Hadith -- literary traditions and sayings of the Prophet Mohammed -- which says , `` Allah 's Messenger said , ` Cut the mustaches short and leave the beard -LRB- as it is -RRB- . ' '' Holt said he offered to keep his beard to a half-inch as a `` compromise , '' but that was rejected .

A few years later , he was convicted in state court and sentenced to life in prison for breaking into the home of his ex-girlfriend and severely wounding her , slitting her throat and stabbing her in the chest .

Law enforcement officials say he threatened to wage `` jihad '' against anyone who helped convict him , both at trial and later behind bars .

So state leaders had a simple message for the courts : Allow us room to decide which restrictions work best within each institution 's unique circumstances .

`` Prisons are dangerous places ... officials create rules intended to strike a delicate balance between safety and security , on the one hand , and giving inmates a sense of dignity and achieving rehabilitative goals , on the other hand , '' said the Arkansas brief to the high court . Corrections officials take `` religious freedom seriously , '' but they also take seriously their `` paramount interests in safety and security , too . ''

Hobby Lobby case connection

At issue there was whether a federal law permitted closely held family-owned corporations the discretion to deny contraception coverage in employer-funded insurance plans .

The conservative court dealt a setback to the White House and Obamacare supporters in the so-called Hobby Lobby dispute , saying those with `` sincerely held '' religious beliefs had a limited right to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace .

The Beckett Fund noted that groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League , along with Catholic bishops , are now backing the inmate .

`` The across-the-board support for Mr. Muhammad shows that religious liberty remains one of the bedrock ideals of America , '' said Eric Rassbach , the group 's deputy general counsel . `` Whether we treat prisoners with basic human dignity -- including the freedom to seek God -- speaks volumes about who we are as a nation . ''

The Supreme Court has debated the issue of body grooming and liberty before . In 1879 , Justice Stephen Field struck down San Francisco 's Queue Ordinance , which required an inmate 's hair in the county jail be cut to a `` uniform length of one inch from the scalp . ''

The current Arkansas dispute is Holt v. Hobbs -LRB- 13-6827 -RRB- . A ruling is expected in a few months .
