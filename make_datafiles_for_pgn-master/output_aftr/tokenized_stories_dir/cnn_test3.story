A statement by Interior Minister Claude Gueant said the moves were part of `` an acceleration of the deportation procedures of foreign Islamic radicals . ''

Deportation proceedings also have started or are planned against three others : an imam of Saudi nationality , a militant Islamist from Tunisia and an imam from Turkey , the statement said .

It cited provisions in the law governing aliens and political asylum , saying the statutes `` allow this type of decision with regards the ` urgent need for state security or public safety ' or ` conduct likely to harm the fundamental interests of the state . ' ''

According to the statement , other expulsions will occur soon .

Last week , French President Nicolas Sarkozy told French radio that 19 people had been arrested in a series of police raids on suspected Islamists .

`` It 's not just linked to Toulouse . It 's all over the country . It 's in connection with a form of radical Islam , and it 's in agreement with the law , '' he said .

Sarkozy suggested then that more raids would follow , saying , `` There will be other operations that will continue and that will allow us to expel from our national territory a certain number of people who have no reason to be here . ''

Merah was blamed for the killings of three French paratroopers , a rabbi and three Jewish children ages 4 , 5 and 7 . Two other people were seriously wounded in the shootings .

But his uncle , Jamal Azizi , denied statements by French authorities that Merah was an al Qaeda sympathizer and that he had traveled to Afghanistan or Pakistan to train to use arms .
