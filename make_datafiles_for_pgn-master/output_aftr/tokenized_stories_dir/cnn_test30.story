-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is a veteran of nearly 300 Formula One races , but he still felt a rush of excitement on Tuesday as Mercedes unveiled their car for the 2012 season .

The 43-year-old , who has won more drivers ' titles than anyone else in history , is enjoying a second spell in the sport after initially retiring in 2006 -- only to return again in 2010 .

Despite being unable to replicate the form he showed prior to his first retirement , Schumacher said he is still hungry for success as he prepares for a 19th season in the elite division of motorsport .

`` I have done quite a few roll-outs and launches of new cars , but even after all these years I must say it still feels special , '' Schumacher , who won two championships with Benetton in 1994 and 1995 and five with Ferrari between 2000 and 2004 , told the sport 's official website .

`` Days like this are precious moments , as they are always filled with hope and anticipation . ''

`` I can say already that the guys and girls back in the factories at Brackley and Brixworth were brilliant in putting in so much effort , and we can only say a big thank you them , '' he said .

`` We have had a good start to our 2012 testing program , and it was a great feeling to drive the first laps in the new F1 W03 , '' the 26-year-old said . `` The car looks good , and is very nicely packaged under the bodywork .

`` All the parts are in harmony , which reflects how well the different departments of our team are working together . From the beginning of our running , we have been able to focus on understanding the car and making good progress with our test program .
