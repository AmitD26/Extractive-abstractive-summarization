`` The leader of the opposition says that people who hold sexist views and who are misogynists are not appropriate for high office . Well , I hope the leader of the opposition has got a piece of paper and he is writing out his resignation , '' Gillard blared .

Abbott 's National-Liberal Coalition took deep offense . Had the prime minister conflated or confused `` sexism '' and `` misogyny , '' or worse , deliberately distorted the meaning of misogyny to score a resounding political point ? Was Gillard seriously asserting that her opposite number held a pathological hatred of women , as most dictionaries define misogyny ?

Editor Sue Butler surprised the nation Wednesday by declaring Macquarie Dictionary would alter its definition of misogyny , closer to the conflated version used by the prime minister .

Butler said Macquarie Dictionary had decided that for the past 20 or 30 years , `` misogyny '' had taken on wider meaning , particularly in feminist discourse and that with changed usage should come a changed definition .

`` You 're not really saying they -LSB- misogynists -RSB- have a pathological sickness , that they should be on a psychiatrist 's couch discussing their early relations with their mother or anything like that , '' she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation -LRB- ABC -RRB- .

`` They merely have what we think of as sexism , an entrenched prejudice against women , '' she added .

As `` Ron 1966 , '' a reader of the ABC website , put it : `` This is just ludicrous ! A prominent figure misuses a word -- and gets embarrassingly caught out for doing so by anyone who understands the English language or who can read a dictionary -- and so the Australian Dictionary decides to redefine the word to match the prominent person 's intended meaning . ... Is the Macquarie Dictionary also going to redefine ` misandry ' , or is it only accusatory and inflammatory words used by women against men that need to have their definition broadened to save embarrassment ? ''

For the record , Macquarie has said that it 's also considering redefining `` misandry , '' which it says currently covers `` entrenched prejudice rather than hatred . ''

Even for those who applauded Gillard 's speech , the dictionary 's move seemed odd and unhelpful .

Comedian and columnist Corinne Grant said the debate over dictionary definitions was `` reductive and pointless . '' She said she thought questioning the prime minister 's use of the word misogyny detracted from what she said was Gillard 's triumph -- calling out sexism -- and diminished the speech to a whine .

'' ... if the only way to have any kind of debate about gender in this country is to play the dictionary card , we ask Macquarie to change the definition of complaining to ` women defending their right to take part in public and private life without being ridiculed , negated or abused on the basis of their gender . ' ''

Grant found an army of supporters . One of them wrote : `` It is obvious that many males and alas females ca n't accept the idea that the behavior the prime minister called out is misogynistic . Much easier for their conscience that the word be attacked as the wrong word than face the truth of the situation . ''

Hewett continued : `` What is even more astonishing though is how so much of the feverish argument has seamlessly managed to equate Julia Gillard 's attack on Tony Abbott into a general and principled assault on the evils of sexism or misogyny , however defined . ''

The thing about fevers is that they can be catchy .

Watch out Mitt Romney , who like Abbott , is trying to mend his image with female voters , after his statement in the second U.S. Presidential debate that he 'd been brought `` whole binders full of women '' by women 's groups after he issued a plea for qualified women to work in his Massachusetts government .
