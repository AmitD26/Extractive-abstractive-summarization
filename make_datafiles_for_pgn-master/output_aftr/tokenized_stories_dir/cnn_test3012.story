-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of students in Colorado walked out of classes this week in response to recent attempts by the conservative-leaning Jefferson County board of education to change the school curriculum .

One of the board 's most controversial initiatives is to avoid historical instances of civil disobedience while promoting `` patriotism , respect for authority and free enterprise . ''

Imagine for a moment : What if the board succeeds ?

What if we step into a time machine and travel to such a future ? In such a world , not only have those pesky moments of civil disobedience been put in their proper place , but also their dangerous effects have finally started turning around .

For example , the late 1800s look a lot different in Colorado 's textbook in the future . Take that troublemaker Susan B. Anthony , who spent 50 years of her life fighting for women 's right to vote .

And even though there 's no repealing women 's right to vote , future generations of girls at least know never to protest against continuing forms of gender inequality , such as being paid less for doing the same job as a man . To fight for equal pay would be unpatriotic , disrespectful , and contemptuous of CEOs , who -- let 's face it -- ultimately know what 's best for us .

The progressive movement of the early 20th century would likely look different in Colorado 's textbook of the future . While current textbooks detail the illegal labor strikes that eventually led to things like a 40-hour work week and workplace safety laws , future textbooks may make no mention of it .

Finally , in the Colorado textbooks of the future , the civil rights movement could be recast in the proper light . For example , Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King could be depicted as disobedient rabble-rousers rather than brave fighters for equality . How dare Rosa Parks -- a black woman -- sit in the front of the bus ? In Montgomery , Alabama , in 1955 , that was illegal , not to mention disrespectful and unpatriotic .
