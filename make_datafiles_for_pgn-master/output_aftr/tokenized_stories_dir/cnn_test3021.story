Minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner . By 2023 , the bureau said , more than half of all children will be minorities .

`` Part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups , Hispanics in particular , '' said Dave Waddington , chief of the Census Bureau 's population projection branch , which issued the report . `` Those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age . Non-Hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older . ''

The group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the Hispanic population . It is projected to nearly triple , from 46.7 million to 132.8 million , from 2008 through 2050 , the bureau said . Its share of the total U.S. population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent . `` Thus , one in three U.S. residents would be Hispanic , '' the Census Bureau said in a news release .

The African-American population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050 , going from 14 percent of the U.S. population to 15 percent . The Asian-American population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million , or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population .

Among the remaining races , the bureau said , American Indians and Alaska natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million , going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. population . Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are expected to more than double , increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million .

In addition , the number of U.S. residents identifying themselves as being of two or more races is projected to more than triple , increasing to 16.2 million from its current 5.2 million , the Census Bureau said .

By 2030 , all baby boomers will be age 65 and older -- comprising nearly 20 percent of U.S. residents , or one in five Americans , the bureau said . By 2050 , the 65-and-older age group will increase to 88.5 million , more than doubling its current number of 38.7 million . Meanwhile , the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple , from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050 .

Non-Hispanic whites make up most of the baby boomers , Waddington said . `` They 're in a higher mortality rate ... nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster '' instead of reproducing at the rate projected for minorities .

The United States is projected to reach the 400 million population milestone in 2039 , according to bureau projections . By 2050 , the population is expected to be 439 million . Of those , 235.7 million are expected to be minorities .

As U.S. cities and towns have increasingly become more diverse , Census officials knew the day of a majority minority would come , Waddington said . And `` the aging one is sort of simple , '' he added . `` That 's demography 101 . ''

Other highlights from the report released Thursday :

â€¢ By 2050 , 62 percent of the nation 's children will be minorities , up from 44 percent today . Of those , 39 percent are projected to be Hispanic , up from 22 percent in 2008 , and 38 percent are projected to be white , down from 56 percent in 2008

Waddington said the timelines are not written in stone . `` It 's a projection . And things like the baby boom generation could n't be predicted . '' Major changes in policy affecting families and children , or a major policy affecting immigration , could have an impact on the expectations , he said .

The nation 's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections , Waddington said . Census data includes all U.S. residents , regardless of their legal status , he said .
