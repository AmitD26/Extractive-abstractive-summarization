America 's premiere independent expert on the American nuclear arsenal , Hans Kristensen , of the Federation of Atomic Scientists , said `` The paradox is that with the `` fake '' bomber counting rule , the United States and Russia could , if they chose , deploy more strategic warheads under the New START Treaty by 2017 than would have been allowed by the Moscow Treaty by 2012 . ''

Debates about the size of the cuts are certainly worth having . But they distract from a glaring reality contained in the treaty that is more important and in many ways more surprising . The treaty does cut a few hundred warheads , but at the same time it sanctions and , so to speak , blesses , many more -- namely the 1,550 that are permitted .

Why ?

During the Cold War , no one had to ask . The two superpowers were involved in a global confrontation .

But once the Cold War and the USSR ended , the arrangement became downright weird . Was there something in the wary U.S.-Russia friendship of the 1990s or the mild rivalry of the new century that warranted threats of mutual annihilation ? The question is almost never asked . Certainly , it has never been adequately answered .

True , each time the negotiating teams have met , the cuts have been substantial . At the height of the Cold War , the two countries jointly possessed some 70,000 warheads . Now we 're down to some 20,000 . -LRB- The difference from the 1,550 figure for each side is accounted for by warheads held in storage -RRB- . Two cheers for that !

But the Cold War figures were so high that the United States and Russia could cut warheads by the hundred or by the thousand for decades and still be capable of wiping each other out many times over .

Consider the 1,550 , for example . One hundred warheads used against the hundred largest cities of either country would spell the effectual end of that country . That means that the current figure leaves a factor of overkill of at least 15 -- and more if the thousands of stored warheads are counted .

The cut of a few hundred warheads is a success . But the survival , 20 years after the end of the Cold War , of the 1,550 that each country still points at the other is a gross failure that outweighs it by far .

Jonathan Schell says U.S.-Russia treaty lowers ceiling for each country 's nuclear arsenals

@highlight

But `` counting rule '' undercuts new limits , theoretically allows more weapons , he says

@highlight

Cuts are welcome , he says , but why continue balance of terror long after Cold War 's end ?

Schell : Existence of thousands of nukes is failure that outweighs treaty 's acheivement
