-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Summer is a time for grilling , relaxing and apparently getting your life together -- at least on television .

Those lazy , hazy days this year are featuring reality shows aimed at everything from weight loss to ego adjustments .

`` During the summer , people are more tuned into those types of pursuits , '' said Deborah King , author of `` Truth Heals : What You Hide Can Hurt You . '' '' -LSB- Viewers -RSB- are thinking more about health , how to feel better and how to feel healthier so they are more inclined to go that route . ''

Before CBS premiered the series , which drops contestants in the wilderness to compete against each other for $ 1 million , summertime viewing was pretty blah and standard , said Al Norton , who blogs about television at his site , Two Tivos to Paradise .

The self-help shows are also more conducive to viewers ' TV habits in the warmer months as opposed to series such as `` Lost '' or `` Fringe , '' where the audience is called upon to remember plots from week to week , Norton said .

That means viewers can hop in and out of such shows , without missing a beat .

The women , who believe they have been chosen to participate in a show called `` The Good Life , '' are moved into a home and forced to forgo all of the amenities they enjoyed in the real world .

`` People are probably more open in the summer and looking at themselves , '' `` When you are doing self-help in the winter when it 's dreary outside , your journey is not as fulfilling . There is something about summer that offers possibilities . ''

`` I 've seen the interest in such programming increase from year to year , '' said King . `` It 's something people are concerned about and focused on more and more . ''
