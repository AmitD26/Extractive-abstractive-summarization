Their bloodthirsty advances have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the borders into neighboring countries , like Turkey , increasing the risks of instability there .

With anti-terrorist raids in Australia , the beheading of a French citizen in Algeria and reports of ISIS sympathizers in Indonesia , here 's a look at the countries that could be affected .

The United States

U.S. officials have repeatedly said that they have no information to suggest that ISIS is planning an attack on the U.S. homeland at the moment .

But the group recently called on devotees around the world to carry out attacks against people in the United States and other Western countries .

But a number of attacks in the U.S. in recent decades were committed by lone wolves -- people with no known link to any terrorist organization -- such as Timothy McVeigh , who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995 , or Joseph Andrew Stack , who flew a small plane into an Austin , Texas office building that housed IRS offices in 2010 .

Guarding against individuals acting on their own is extremely difficult , experts say , as there are no orders coming down through organizations .

`` Almost all the time it 's not there , '' McFadden told CNN . `` So that ingredient makes it so much more tough to combat these kind of things and root that out . ''

The Americans who have come to harm at the hands of ISIS are James Foley and Steven Sotloff , journalists who were abducted in Syria and beheaded by the militant group in recent weeks .

`` Pay a 250 million pesos ransom -LRB- $ 5.6 million -RRB- to free the hostages and meet the second condition , '' the letter says .

The second condition : `` The German government needs to stop supporting the U.S. in the killing of our Muslim brothers in Iraq and Syria , especially -LRB- ISIS -RRB- militants . ''

`` We have warned you . Delay : 15 Days , '' the groups says in Tagalog , the language spoken by some Filipinos .

The group sets an October 10 deadline . It also posted a photo of the hostage .

A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry told CNN , `` The German government has set up a crisis group in the Foreign Ministry to deal with this situation . ''

She declined to be identified because of ministry regulations and would not give any further information .

Anti-terrorism raids

Earlier this month , Australian police carried out large-scale raids after investigations suggested suspects were planning `` a random attack on individuals . ''

Authorities say they have foiled plans to kidnap a member of the public , behead the victim and drape the body in an ISIS flag . One man arrested in the raids was formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism .

Prime Minister Tony Abbott suggested that `` quite direct exhortations '' were coming from an Australian citizen overseas who has a `` quite senior '' role in ISIS .

On Tuesday , Australian police shot dead an 18-year-old terrorism suspect who had stabbed two police officers at an arranged meeting . The teenager had raised concerns after being seen at a shopping mall in recent days with what appeared to be an ISIS flag , police said .

Civil liberty advocates have criticized the speed at which the new legislation has been brought in , calling for the Australian public and members of Parliament to be given more time to have their say on the legislation .

France

ISIS ' recent call for attacks against Western citizens singled out what it called `` the spiteful and filthy French '' for punishment .

French planes have taken part in airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq , but Paris says its forces wo n't be involved in bombing raids on Syria .

A video posted online Wednesday showed the beheading of Herve Gourdel , a French citizen who was kidnapped in Algeria over the weekend .

The video shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in Algeria . They pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi .

French President Francois Hollande said the attack wo n't affect France 's role in the fight against terrorism . `` France will never give in to blackmail , to pressure , to barbaric acts . Quite to the contrary , France knows what is expected , '' he said .

Mehdi Nemmouche , the French citizen accused of the deadly shooting at Belgium 's Jewish Museum in May , recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist , according to French officials .

Prosecutors say that when police arrested Nemmouche in France , they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia .

The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday passed a resolution aimed at tackling the threat posed by foreign fighters who seek to join ISIS and other terrorist organizations .

United Kingdom

ISIS has already beheaded one of the British hostages it 's holding , aid worker David Haines . It has also threatened the life of another , altruistic taxi driver Alan Henning , and used a third , John Cantlie , to deliver the group 's message in videos .

Threat level ` severe '

`` The increase in the threat level is related to developments in Syria and Iraq where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the West , '' Home Secretary Theresa May said at the time . She made no mention of ISIS in the statement .

British Muslim leaders have repeatedly condemned the actions of ISIS .

`` These extremists in Iraq and Syria claim to be acting in the name of Islam . But there is nothing in our faith that condones such behavior , '' Shuja Shafi , secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain , said after the killing of Haines .

Indonesia

Report sees risk of influence

Analysts say ISIS ' high-profile extremism has gained it a small following in Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim nation .

The support in Indonesia increases the risk of violence there , potentially directed at foreigners , according to the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict , which is based in Jakarta .

`` The overall capacity of Indonesian extremists remains low , but their commitment to ISIS could prove deadly , '' said Sidney Jones , director of the institute .

The danger is that Indonesians fighting in Syria and Iraq will return home with `` the training , combat experience , and leadership potential now lacking in Indonesia 's extremist community , '' the institute said in a report on ISIS in Indonesia .

But the report said that many Muslims in Indonesia have strongly rejected ISIS ' actions .

`` ISIS has triggered a bigger backlash than ever seen before in the Indonesian Muslim community , suggesting that support will stay limited to a fringe of the radical fringe , '' it said .

Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Tuesday called for a comprehensive approach to tackling the ISIS threat , the national news agency Antara reported .

`` This is not only the responsibility of the military forces but also the police , diplomats , religious figures and civilians , '' Yudhoyono said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point . `` Indonesia , for instance , has conducted deradicalization programs by engaging religious figures to fight extremism .
