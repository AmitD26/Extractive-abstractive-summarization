If your smartphone is attached to your hip , your blood flows like a Twitter feed and you 're fairly certain your eyes permanently see through an Instagram filter , then maybe it 's time to disconnect for a bit ?

`` We really hope people reconnect with themselves , '' said Ben Hanna , a partner at The Digital Detox .

`` So many people now do n't understand their relationship with technology , but they do know something 's wrong with how often they feel the need to check their phone . ''

`` Part of what we want to do is give people this ability to kind of dive deep into something that they have n't really done , '' Hanna told Mashable .

Hanna says this sold-out June 14 to 17 event has attracted people from all over the world , including people in the tech community like CEOs and venture capitalists . But at camp , everyone will use nicknames and attendees ca n't ask each other their ages , so everyone is really `` just another camper , '' Hanna said .

Though there is currently a waitlist , they plan to hold another session in the future , since demand has been so high .

But with Camp Grounded , it 's the largest retreat they 've done so far , according to Hanna .

`` When you were a kid , your life was not dominated by the technology that it is now , '' he said . `` We want to take people back to that easy state of living where their only concern is ` what 's the next activity that I 'm going to right now and what 's going to be the next fun thing ? ' ''

Could you survive a tech-free weekend on a `` digital detox ? '' Or would it be too difficult for you to disconnect ? Share your thoughts on this concept in the comments .
