-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For three months , Mark Cherry lay in a Chicago-area hospital room , close to death .

He suffered a gunshot wound during a home invasion in Gary , Indiana -- a crime he is accused of committing , and in which he allegedly shot and killed a 22-year old man .

Now , the victim 's family is questioning how an accused killer could just leave , with no one stopping him . Law enforcement and the hospital are blaming each other for the mix-up . And Cherry is still on the run .

At some point during the home invasion , shots were fired and Cherry allegedly shot and killed Rolando Correa , Gary Police spokeswoman Cpl. Gabrielle King told CNN .

Cherry was also wounded and transported to a local hospital , and then airlifted across state lines to a hospital in Illinois , she said .

That same month , Cherry was charged with murder , attempted murder , criminal confinement , and battery with a deadly weapon .

At Advocate Christ Medical Center , Cherry recovered but was apparently not under police guard during his hospital stay .

Privacy laws are in place to prevent that type of information from being shared , a hospital spokesman said .

`` If a patient is under suspicion for a serious offense , the police department involved in the case typically posts an officer on site during the period of the hospitalization , '' the hospital said .

Gary police say that they have no jurisdiction in Illinois , and that prevented them from having someone guarding Cherry .

`` Unfortunately , our investigators assumed because he was unconscious that the hospital would give the detective a call before he was released , '' Chief Wade Ingram told WLS .

It 's an emotional blow for a family that 's already lost so much .

`` It 's like our whole family is falling apart due to this . We are falling apart , '' Lourdes deJesus Correa said . `` Please , I just want justice for my son . For my family . That 's all I want . ''
