A jury recommended Friday that Joshua Komisarjevsky receive the death penalty for his role in a deadly Connecticut home invasion in 2007 .

The decision was made after more than five days of deliberations following a six-week penalty phase of a case whose grisly details may have helped slow efforts to abolish capital punishment in Connecticut .

`` We believe justice has been served , '' said William Petit , the sole survivor of a brutal attack that left his wife and two daughters dead in their Cheshire , Connecticut home . `` We think society will be a little safer with he and his co-defendant locked up and facing the death penalty . ''

Flanked by family members , Petit thanked jurors for Friday 's decision , acknowledging the public support he says he 's received throughout the duration of the trial .

Still , Petit said , there 's never complete closure when you lose your family .

Judge Jon Blue is expected weigh the jury 's recommendation in sentencing Komisarjevsky , who was convicted in October on six capital felony charges . The 12-member jury voted for death by lethal injection on each of the six counts .

`` You have done something many people find impossible , '' said Blue , acknowledging that jurors had been `` exposed to profoundly disturbing evidence . ''

Prosecutors argued that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home , beat and tied up William Petit , raped and strangled his wife , molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee .

`` Its just wrong -LRB- for jurors -RRB- to give their authorization ... to kill this man , '' attorney Jeremiah Donovan said . `` Appropriate punishment in this case is to confine Joshua in a state prison . ''

He called Komisarjevsky 's family dysfunctional , pointing to his uncle , Chris , who told reporters that he supported the jurors ' decision and that Joshua had to take responsibility for his actions .

`` The crime was monstrous and beyond anyone 's comprehension , '' he said , offering his apologies to the Petit family .
