San Diego , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Where are the lost boys of Mexico ? That 's what many people , in that country and around the world , want to know . The answer could say much about the new narrative that has been pushed about the country .

The investigation of the case has prompted speculation that Abarca was so worried that the students might disrupt his wife 's speech that he ordered Flores to have police officers confront the students and stop the protest . -LRB- According to Murillo Karam , another protest had previously upset Abarca -RRB- .

But it gets worse . According to the attorney general , the police quickly turned the students over to Guerreros Unidos , a local drug trafficking gang . The prosecutor claimed that Abarca and his wife keep bad company . Pineda 's brothers are suspected drug traffickers . And , according to the attorney general , the first lady of Iguala has been called `` the main operator of criminal activities '' in the town .

This being Mexico , one has to ask . After all , this is the land of the desaparecidos . In the 1970s , there were at least 2,000 documented cases of people who simply disappeared after challenging government officials . Those people were never found , and the cases never solved .

Even if this is an isolated incident -- and that 's a big `` if '' given how closely intertwined drug gangs are with Mexican officials -- the blame is n't limited to the individuals who have been arrested or are being sought . It extends to the Mexican people , many of whom long ago made a devil 's bargain with the drug traffickers who are threatening to tear the country apart . They built altars to La Santa Muerte , the patron `` saint '' of drug lords , wrote corridos -LRB- folkloric ballads -RRB- praising the exploits of traffickers , and accepted the fruits of an illicit trade .

The reality is that the modern Mexican drug dealer is n't living in a camp in the mountains . He 's a Spanish-speaking version of Tony Soprano . He lives in the suburbs , drives a Cadillac , and spends weekends attending his kids ' soccer games -- which are played on a field that he built . It 's no wonder that , when former Mexican President Felipe Calderon waged war against the cartels , he was ridiculed and criticized by many Mexicans for stirring the hornet 's nest . South of the border , drug traffickers are familia .

By the way , much of this is not meant for the public consumption of Americans . When you talk to Mexico 's elites on both sides of the border -- lawyers , politicians , businessmen -- what you hear again and again is that Mexico had a makeover . Desperate for U.S. investment dollars -- now more than ever , given Mexico 's recent and historic efforts to open up the country 's lucrative petroleum industry to foreign investment -- the elites aggressively push a narrative that Mexico is safe , democratic and open for business .

Now , due to events in a small Mexican town , that narrative is being challenged by reality . Unfortunately , the new version of Mexico bears a resemblance to the old one .
