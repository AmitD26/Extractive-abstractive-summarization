Criminal gang membership increased as much as 40 percent in the United States during the past three years , according to an FBI report released Friday .

The 100-page 2011 `` National Gang Threat Assessment '' claimed criminal gangs pose a growing threat in communities throughout the United States .

`` The most notable trends for 2011 have been the overall increase in gang membership and the expansion of criminal street gangs ' control of street-level drug sales and collaboration with rival gangs and other criminal organizations , '' according to the report .

While there was no data related to how the economy might factor into growth in gangs , more aggressive recruiting and cultural and ethnic factors may have contributed to the increase in gang membership .

Although overall crime in the United States has continued to decline over the past three years , the relative amount of crime inflicted by gang members appears to have increased . The new FBI report claims that gangs are responsible for 48 % of violent crime , on average , in most jurisdictions .

Officials said that some gang members have radicalized while in prison , expressing worries that those individuals could be even more dangerous when they 're released .

Gangs can be found in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia . The largest number of gang members is in southern California , southern Arizona and the Chicago area . The vast majority of these people belong to street gangs , predominantly in the West .
