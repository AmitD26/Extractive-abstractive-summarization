The so-called `` birther bill '' got final approval in the state House last week . Now that Brewer , a Republican , has vetoed it , the bill will not become law unless legislators vote to override her veto .

`` As a former Secretary of State , I do not support designating one person as a gatekeeper to the ballot for a candidate , which could lead to arbitrary or politically-motivated decisions , '' the governor wrote in a letter addressed to the Arizona House speaker .

`` This measure creates significant new problems while failing to do anything constructive for Arizona , '' she added .

William Bennett 's take on Donald Trump

The author of the so-called `` birther bill , '' Arizona State Rep. Carl Seel , has said the bill was not targeted at Obama , but at `` maintaining the integrity of the Constitution . ''

`` I never imagined being presented with a bill that could require candidates for President of the greatest and most powerful nation on earth to submit their ` early baptismal or circumcision certificates ' among other records to the Arizona Secretary of State . This is a bridge too far , '' wrote Brewer .

Fourteen other states are considering similar legislation this year , according to Jennie Bowser , a senior fellow with the National Conference of State Legislatures . Measures have failed in three states -- Connecticut , Maine and Montana .
