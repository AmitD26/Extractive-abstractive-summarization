International inspectors were present when Iran started implementing the historic deal , Press TV said .

The action is part of a six-month interim agreement that gives Iran and the other countries more time to negotiate a permanent solution .

Iran struck the deal on November 24 in exchange for lighter sanctions .

Nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5 % as fuel to generate electricity .

The six nations and the European Union are reviewing a report by the U.N. watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , which provided details of the nuclear activities on the first day of the deal , according to the U.S. State Department .

She said she 's optimistic a new round of negotiations could come soon .

`` Depending on how things work out today , I hope that we will start talks in the next few weeks , '' Ashton said .

For years , Iran and Western powers have left negotiating tables in disagreement , frustration and open animosity .

And the deal appeared to be on the right track Monday .

As part of the deal , Iran was required to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20 % .

While uranium is n't bomb-grade until it 's enriched to 90 % purity , `` once you 're at 20 % , you 're about 80 % of the way there , '' said Mark Hibbs , a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .

World leaders applauded the interim deal after years of a stalemate .

`` For the first time in nearly a decade , we have halted the progress of the Iranian nuclear program , '' U.S. President Barack Obama said when the deal was announced in November .
