`` The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine , '' Obama said .

The president made his remarks as events moved quickly in Ukraine , with troops believed to be from Russia moving into Crimea , the southern section of Ukraine that favors close ties with neighboring Russia . Other parts of Ukraine and the new government leaders want to align with Europe .

`` We are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine , '' Obama said . `` Russia has a historic relationship with Ukraine , including cultural and economic ties , and a military facility in Crimea , but any violation of Ukraine 's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing , which is not in the interest of Ukraine , Russia , or Europe .

He said Ukraine must be autonomous .

Just before Obama spoke , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , Samantha Power , called for an `` urgent international '' mediation mission to Crimea .

Also , a bipartisan group of 12 senators from the Foreign Relations Committee expressed support for U.S. assistance in Ukraine and warned of Russian intervention .

`` We do not seek confrontation with President Putin and his government , but simply to ensure that Russia abides by its commitments and adheres to core principles of international law . A peaceful , democratic , stable , and sovereign Ukraine is in our national interest , '' the senators wrote in a letter to Obama .
