After hours of debate on the massive government spending package , the Senate adjourned until Saturday , pushing a fight that dominated Congress for days into the weekend .

The Senate is expected to vote Monday on the $ 1.1 trillion package , which has already passed the House , Sens. Mitch McConnell and Barbara Mikulski said late Friday .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made a procedural move Friday that would set up a vote on final passage in the Senate no later than Monday .

Reid tried to get unanimous consent for an adjournment until Monday when there would be enough votes to end the filibuster , but Sen. Mike Lee , R-Utah , objected because Reid would not guarantee a vote on an amendment dealing with immigration funding .

It 's unclear whether both sides will speed things up enough Saturday for a vote on the spending package .

Earlier Friday , the House approved a five-day stopgap bill to make sure the government was continually funded .

The chamber has been sifting through many of the same arguments that tied up the House on Thursday , when disagreements over immigration and provisions related to Wall Street and campaign finance nearly derailed the bill . Senate lawmakers wanted votes on amendments that would address those issues .

`` Congress should not put taxpayers on the hook for another bailout , and this giveaway that was drafted by Citigroup lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill , '' Warren said .

Meanwhile , Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , a chief critic of President Barack Obama 's recent executive action on immigration , also said he wanted a vote to block those actions .

`` I think it is critical that the Senate have the opportunity to have a clear up or down vote on funding President Obama 's illegal executive amnesty , '' he told reporters . `` I am using every tool available to help bring about that vote . ''

But by making the procedural move , Reid prevented those amendments from being considered . Amendment votes could have been risky because if either measure passed , the spending bill would have to go back to the House to be voted on again . While the House is technically in session , most members have left Washington until the new Congress convenes in early January .

A day after his administration scrambled to save the bill after it appeared it might be defeated in the House , the President said he was pulling for it in the Senate .
