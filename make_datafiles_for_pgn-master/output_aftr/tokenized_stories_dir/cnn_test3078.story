Syria 's opposition urged the United States to provide arms to rebel groups in a Thursday meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry at the U.S. mission to the United Nations .

`` The US commitment of military support ... is vital , but it needs to happen fast , and in a way that allows us to defend ourselves and protect civilians , '' a statement from the Syrian National Coalition . `` To deny us the right to self-defense is to risk that the regime will survive : thousands will be executed , the repression will continue without end . ''

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for a peace conference to stop the violence on both sides .

In addition to the deaths , Ban noted that `` millions of people have either been displaced or become refugees in neighboring countries . ''

A State Department official said Kerry and Jarba agreed that a `` political solution is the best path forward '' in the conflict .

`` Secretary Kerry reiterated the ongoing commitment of the United States to helping end the bloodshed and suffering of the Syrian people , '' the official said .

This May , the United Nations reported that more than 1.5 million had fled for other countries because of the violence , while 4 million more had been displaced within Syria .

And -- as has happened very day for more than two years -- more of them died Thursday .

A car bombing rocked a square in Jaramana , which is about 5 kilometers southeast of Damascus , according to both opposition activists and state-run media .

The attack left 17 dead and tens more injured , according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .
