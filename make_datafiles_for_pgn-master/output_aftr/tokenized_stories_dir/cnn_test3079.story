The Senate vote was 59-41 to table the measure , which effectively kills it unless Democrats decide to bring it up again .

Earlier , Boehner 's proposal was approved by the House in a sharply polarized 218-210 vote that was delayed by a day while the speaker rounded up support from wary tea party conservatives . No Democrats supported the measure , and 22 of the 240 members of the Republican majority also opposed it .

Even though it was blocked in the Senate , the Boehner plan now is the Republican negotiating position for hammering out a deal with congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama to avert a possible government default next week .

However , no face-to-face talks were scheduled , with Democrats accusing Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of refusing to negotiate and McConnell in turn seeking a chance for his caucus to reject a proposal offered by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid as a vehicle for compromise .

Democratic and Republican sources familiar with the situation told CNN that McConnell insists the White House be present in further negotiations toward a debt ceiling deal .

In a continuation of the political theater that has characterized the negotiations so far , the House scheduled a vote on the Reid plan for Saturday -- before the Senate will even begin considering it -- as what appeared to be payback for the rejection by Senate Democrats of the Boehner proposal .

Reid , meanwhile , said the Senate will likely vote to take up his plan at 1 a.m. Sunday ET as part of the procedural path required to get something passed in coming days .

As the political maneuvering continues , the clock continues to tick down . If Congress fails to raise the current $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling by August 2 , Americans could face rising interest rates and a declining dollar , among other problems .

Some financial experts have warned of a downgrade of America 's triple-A credit rating and a potential stock market plunge . The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped for a sixth straight day on Friday .

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued a statement Friday to remind military personnel that they should plan to come to work next week as scheduled , regardless of whether a deal gets worked out . Panetta pledged to do `` everything possible to ensure that our national defense is protected . ''

Friday 's House vote was a critical test of Boehner 's control over his tea party-infused GOP caucus . The speaker was forced to quell a right-wing revolt over the measure after a number of members complained that it does n't do enough to shrink the size of government and stem the tide of Washington 's red ink .

Boehner , R-Ohio , managed to sway several of those members by including a provision requiring congressional passage of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution before the debt ceiling can be extended through the end of 2012 .

`` We 've tried to do our level best ... but some people continue to say no , '' Boehner said , adding : `` I stuck my neck out a mile to try to get an agreement with the president of the United States . ''

His voice rising to a shout , Boehner continued to cheers and applause from fellow Republicans : `` It is time for this administration and the other party across the aisle -- put something on the table . Tell us where you are . ''

Boehner 's plan `` has no chance of becoming law , '' Obama said . `` The time for putting party first is over . The time for compromise on behalf of the American people is now . ... It 's important for everybody to step up and show the leadership that the American people expect . ''

`` This is not a situation where the two parties are miles apart , '' the president insisted . But `` we are almost out of time . ''

Reid announced Friday morning that he intended to `` take action '' on a Senate bill by the end of the day . Later , he complained on the Senate floor that Republicans would effectively filibuster his proposal by requiring a 60-vote super-majority in the 100-member chamber to support the start of debate on it . It was unclear when Reid would attempt to hold that vote , and he warned it could as late as 1 a.m. ET Sunday .

But McConnell , R-Kentucky , argued Senate Democrats were doing little to actually resolve the crisis .

Leaders of both parties now agree that any deal to raise the debt ceiling should include long-term spending reductions to help control spiraling deficits . But they differ sharply on both the nature and timetable of the cuts .

Sources close to the negotiations have also told CNN that Vice President Joe Biden is very much in the mix of back-channel conversations on a possible fallback position .

White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley told CNN Thursday that , presuming the Boehner plan wins House approval and gets blocked in the Senate , the next step is for everyone `` to take a step back in the Congress and look at where is a point of compromise . ''

Daley said that similarities between the Boehner and Reid plans `` may be the grounds for a deal that , hopefully , both parties can pass . ''

Boehner 's plan , which has since been revised , proposed generating a total of $ 917 billion in savings while initially raising the debt ceiling by $ 900 billion . The speaker has pledged to match any debt ceiling hike with dollar-for-dollar spending cuts .

In addition , it incorporates a process based on proposal by McConnell that would give Obama the authority to raise the debt ceiling in two steps while providing Congress the opportunity to vote its disapproval .

Among other things , Reid has stressed that his plan meets the key GOP demand for no additional taxes . Boehner , however , argued this week that Reid 's plan fails to tackle popular entitlement programs such as Medicare , which are among the biggest drivers of the debt .

A recent CNN/ORC International Poll reveals a growing public exasperation and demand for compromise . Sixty-four percent of respondents to a July 18-20 survey preferred a deal with a mix of spending cuts and tax increases . Only 34 % preferred a debt reduction plan based solely on spending reductions .

According to the poll , the public is sharply divided along partisan lines ; Democrats and independents are open to a number of different approaches because they think a failure to raise the debt ceiling would cause a major crisis for the country . Republicans , however , draw the line at tax increases , and a narrow majority of them oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstances .
