New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A day after saying homosexuality is not `` an equally valid or successful option , '' New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino denied being anti-gay Monday but said it was `` disgusting '' that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade .

Paladino drew fire for a remark he made to an Orthodox Jewish group on Sunday , in which he said he does n't want children `` to be brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality is an equally valid or successful option -LRB- compared with heterosexuality -RRB- ... it is n't . ''

Cuomo criticized his remarks Sunday , as did an advocate for gays and lesbians and an organization for gay and lesbian Republicans .

`` It 's a very , very ugly experience for those who are discriminated against , '' he told `` Today , '' adding that he has a nephew who is homosexual and also has homosexuals working for him . `` It 's terrible , and it should n't be . Society should be more accepting of it . ''

`` My nephew is a wonderful boy and he 's gay , '' he told `` Good Morning America . '' `` I see the difficulty he suffers with every day with discriminatory people . ''

Paladino 's nephew , Jeffrey Hannon , a member of his campaign staff , declined to comment when contacted by CNN early Monday .

He said his Sunday remarks were taken out of context . A prepared version of his remarks , obtained by CNN from New York affiliate NY1 , contained two lines that Paladino did not deliver . Those lines said , `` There is nothing to be proud of in being a dysfunctional homosexual . That is not how God created us . ''

Paladino emphasized in a statement Sunday night that he did not include those lines when he delivered his remarks , and said Monday he had crossed them out from his prepared remarks .

`` There was a couple lines in there that I deleted and never spoke , purposefully , because I did n't want to , '' he told CNN .

It was unclear , however , how the lines got into his prepared statements . Paladino at first suggested to `` Today '' that the lines were written by members of the Jewish group he was speaking to , although he later said he was n't sure whether they originated with a group member or one of his staff . He told `` Good Morning America '' he had dictated in general terms his remarks to a staffer who put the lines in his remarks .

In his Sunday statement , Paladino said , `` Apparently a few reporters relied upon suggested remarks distributed by my hosts at the synagogue in Williamsburg after my departure , not the actual statement I made . ''

The written remarks given to reporters were identical to Paladino 's spoken comments other than the two sentences in question .

Paladino on Monday denied being homophobic .

`` I am 100 percent in favor of all gay rights and always have been . There 's one reservation . I do n't think they should be married , '' he told CNN .

Paladino 's Monday remarks came the same day New York police announced the arrest of an ninth suspect in a series of brutal , anti-gay hate crimes against four men .

`` Do n't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way , '' Paladino said Sunday . `` That would be a dastardly lie -- my approach is live and let live . ''

Paladino also criticized Cuomo for marching in New York 's gay pride parade in June .

`` That 's not the example that we should be showing the children and certainly not in our schools , '' he said .

Asked about Paladino 's comments later Monday , Cuomo called them cynical and divisive .

`` Carl Paladino 's comments would matter if they were coming from a serious political figure . However , they are not , '' said Christopher Barron , chairman of the gay conservative group GOProud , in an e-mail to CNN . `` They are instead coming from the imploding campaign of a man with the personal baggage of John Edwards and all the electability of Alan Keyes . ''

The Log Cabin Republicans of New York State also took issue with the candidate .

`` Carl Paladino 's statements are unfortunate and show he lacks an understanding of what it means to be gay , '' said Gregory T. Angelo , chairman of the group . `` I think gay men and women -- my neighbors and your neighbors -- would be much better off and much more successful if they were allowed equal rights and the option of getting married and raising a family . I do n't want New Yorkers to be brainwashed into thinking that ignorance is an equally valid and successful option . It is n't . ''

But Paladino 's campaign manager , Michael Caputo , stood by the gubernatorial candidate 's comments on homosexuality .

`` You send another goon to my daughter 's house , and I 'll take you out , buddy , '' Paladino said , apparently referring to the Post 's coverage of a daughter the candidate had out of wedlock .

Dicker shot back : `` You gon na take me out ? ''

`` Yeah . ''

`` Watch , '' Paladino said before walking off .

Paladino 's campaign issued a statement the next day claiming that the Post sent a photographer to the Buffalo-area house where Paladino 's 10-year-old daughter lives .
