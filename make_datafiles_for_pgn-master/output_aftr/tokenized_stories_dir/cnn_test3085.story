Defense attorneys for Amanda Knox are expected to present their final arguments in Italy Thursday continuing an effort to to counter prosecutors ' portrayal of her as a cunning `` femme fatale . ''

Knox 's attorneys statements Thursday follow arguments presented earlier this week by the lawyer of her co-defendant .

Bongiorno compared Knox to the voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit , who protests , `` I 'm not bad , I 'm just drawn that way , '' in the movie `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? ''

Bongiorno , who represents Sollecito -- Knox 's former boyfriend -- said the whole trial was based on DNA evidence `` on which mistakes were made , '' and urged the jury to `` abandon imagined fantasies '' and acquit the pair .

As she began her closing arguments Tuesday , Bongiorno said there was no physical trace of Knox or Sollecito in the room where Kercher was found murdered .

Bongiorno , one the highest-profile lawyers in Italy , attacked media coverage of the trial as sensational , saying it could have affected what witnesses told the court .

She rejected the notion that Knox and Sollecito were into violent sex , saying they rubbed noses in `` Eskimo kisses . ''

And she hammered home attacks on DNA evidence that have been a key part of the appeal .

She said police could have contaminated the crime scene or the evidence , playing video from the police investigation itself to make her point .

Both defendants were in court Tuesday , with Knox in a long-sleeved pink sweater and Sollecito in a long-sleeved prune-colored shirt . Their parents were in court as well .

On Monday , the lawyer for Kercher 's family showed photos of the British murder victim 's bloodied body , pointing out multiple stab wounds . He urged the Italian jury not to overturn Knox and Sollecito 's convictions .

`` Given the type , number and locations of the wounds , there had to be multiple attackers , '' he insisted , rejecting the defense theory that Guede acted alone .

He attacked as `` useless '' a review of DNA evidence that may cast doubt on the original convictions .

Knox avoided looking at the photographs of Kercher 's body as they were shown .

Lawyers for the civil suits related to the case presented their closing arguments Monday .

At the hearing , another lawyer called Knox two-faced and `` diabolical . ''

`` Within her lives a double soul : one which is angelic , good , compassionate ... tender and ingenuous , '' Carlo Pacelli said .

Pacelli sought to portray Knox as sexually promiscuous and a difficult roommate as he fights for damages for his client , Patrick Lumumba .

A verdict in the appeal could come as soon as October 1 .
