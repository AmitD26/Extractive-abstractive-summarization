The U.S. Department of Education is legally prohibited from having any control over curriculum or instruction in the nation 's public schools , but nonetheless Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is a zealous advocate of the new Common Core standards for students ' proficiency in English and math .

First , he said their critics were members of extremist groups , and he recently assailed the parents who criticize them as `` white suburban moms who -- all of a sudden -- their child is n't as brilliant as they thought they were , and their school is n't quite as good as they thought they were . ''

The parents were n't angry because they found out their child was n't brilliant , but because most were told by the state that their children were failures . Only 31 % of the state 's students in grades third through eighth passed or exceeded the new tests . Among students who are English-language learners , only 3 % passed the English standards ; among students with disabilities , only 5 % passed them ; among black and Hispanic students , fewer than 20 % passed . The numbers for math were better , but not by much .

The high failure rate did not happen because the students are dumb , but because the state chose to set an unrealistic passing mark . The state commissioner knew before any student had taken the test that only 30 % or so would pass ; that is where the state commissioner set the passing mark .

Some states adopted them without seeing a finished draft . The standards , unfortunately , were never field-tested . No one knew in advance whether they would improve achievement or depress it , whether they would widen or narrow the achievement gap among children of different races . It is hard to imagine a major corporation releasing a new product nationwide without first testing it among consumers to see if it is successful . But that is what happened with the Common Core standards .

The Common Core standards emphasize critical thinking and reasoning . It is time for public officials to demonstrate critical thinking and to stop the rush to implementation and do some serious field-testing .

It is time to fix the standards that do n't work in real classrooms with real students . It is time to stop testing students on material they have not been taught . American students take more tests than students in any other nation . Our dependence on standardized testing has become excessive .

Standards alone ca n't right everything that needs fixing in American education , and some experts , like Tom Loveless at Brookings Institution , say they will make little or no difference in student achievement .

Field-testing should have been done , she says , not fast implementation
