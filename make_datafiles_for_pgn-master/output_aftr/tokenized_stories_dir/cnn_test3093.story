After one of the attacks , people carrying stretchers were seen running to the site of the bombing .

The tribal leader , who did not want to be identified for safety reasons , said youths in Ajdabiya were massing and heading toward the conflict area to help defend the town , which has been in the control of rebel forces in recent days . Some military bases in eastern Libya have fallen into the hands of rebels as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi 's regime and joined the opposition .

The bombings could support calls for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent such attacks . The United States has said all options are on the table . Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said imposing a no-fly zone would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . ''

Senator John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said Wednesday that , while Libyans are not asking for foreign troops on the ground , they need `` the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on Libyan streets , and I believe that the global community can not be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe . A no-fly zone is not a long-term proposition , assuming the outcome is what all desire , and I believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary . ''

The Arab League met Wednesday to consider a resolution rejecting foreign military intervention in Libya , where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks , calling for more freedoms and for the longtime ruler to step down .

In another of his trademark , rambling speeches carried live on state television , Gadhafi continued to claim that there are no peaceful Libyan protests , only al Qaeda-backed efforts to tear the country apart . He blamed the problems on former prisoners at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , who were released to Libya and then freed by Libyan authorities after they pledged to reform . He said they turned out to be members of al Qaeda sleeper cells -- but insisted that his country is `` stopping al Qaeda from flourishing '' and preventing Osama bin Laden from moving into North Africa .

Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for more than 41 years , also denied having any assets besides `` history , the people , the glory -- not the American dollars or the oil . ''

Later , several thousand people , including many young men and women , took part in a pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli 's Green Square .

Some residents of the capital have told CNN they want to protest Gadhafi but fear being killed by his forces . And some have said Gadhafi forces have dragged residents into the streets and forced them to take part in rallies praising the leader .

A spokesman for the Libyan government , Musa Ibrahim , told CNN that assertions of widespread military attacks on peaceful demonstrators are wrong . `` This is an armed rebellion , with people going around attacking police stations , army offices , getting a hold of guns and attacking , '' he said .

He said the government had supported the initial peaceful protests , but said al Qaeda supporters have hijacked that movement `` and they are leading the country into chaos . ''

Asked for evidence , he said , `` We have captured dozens of these people , we have figures , we have interviews , we are willing and prepared to take these people and show them on international media . ''

But numerous witnesses have described indiscriminate killings and attacks .

The court said it is focusing on what it considers `` the most serious crimes of concern to the international community . '' No possible charges or violations were listed in the statement .

The conflict between Gadhafi 's government and opponents , in its third week , followed protests in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia that ousted those countries ' leaders .

International efforts to persuade him to follow the message of protesters and step down have also ratcheted up .

He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with deaths and ongoing repression .

`` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , he added , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday .

Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the leader 's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told CNN Tuesday that his talks with the opposition were in `` chaos '' because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders .

The capital city of Tripoli remained under the control of Gadhafi 's rule , though opposition forces have taken control of the eastern city of Benghazi and a number of other cities .

The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia , and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders .

Ban called for immediate action by the international community . `` Time is of the essence , '' he said . `` Thousands of lives are at stake . ''
