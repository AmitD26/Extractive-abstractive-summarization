CroisiEurope : Loire cruise

Cruise fans have been eagerly awaiting this particular outing because the boat will use paddle wheel technology to allow it to navigate the shallow waters of the Loire , and overnight cruises along the river have n't been possible until now .

Crystal Cruises : Best of the Baltic

Proving that cruises are no longer just about eating a lot of food and not doing very much , Crystal Cruises is just one operator offering passengers the chance to work off those calories -- in this case , with a 90-minute run around St. Petersburg during its `` Best of the Baltic '' cruise from Stockholm to Copenhagen .

Crystal Cruises : Crystal Symphony , +1 310 785 9300 , from $ 3,845 per person
