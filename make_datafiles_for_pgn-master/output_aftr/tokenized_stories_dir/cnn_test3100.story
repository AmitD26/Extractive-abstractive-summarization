The flooding has forced more than 132,000 people to evacuate , Malaysia 's official Bernama news agency said .

Strong currents and interrupted power supply are adding to the chaos , Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak told reporters .

Strong high pressure develops over Eastern Europe and China and strengthens northeasterly winds from the South China Sea , bringing heavier rainfall over Malaysia , Indonesia and southern Thailand .

And it 's going to get worse . Another 100 millimeters -LRB- 4 inches -RRB- of rain could fall over the next two days near the Malaysia-Thailand border , he said .

`` That leaves open all kinds of possibilities -- more flooding , and the possibility of landslides and mudslides , '' Van Dam said .

Across the Bay of Bengal , Sri Lanka has been hit hard , too .

Kandy , in the center of the island nation , received more than twice the average monthly rainfall in just the past eight days , Van Dam said .
