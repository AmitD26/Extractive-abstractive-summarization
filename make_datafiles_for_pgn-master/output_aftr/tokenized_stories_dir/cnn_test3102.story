It could be the wedding video to end all wedding videos . There are not many newlyweds who can say they received a call from the President of the United States on their wedding day .

Granted , the President was calling to apologize after the bride and groom -- Natalie Heimel and Ed Mallue Jr. -- were forced to scramble to find an alternate location for their wedding , once they were informed by the Kaneohe Klipper Golf Course at Marine Corps Base Hawaii that Obama wanted to play through the site of their nuptials .

`` I hope the wedding went OK anyway , '' he continued .

In the video , Heimel and Mallue can be seen all dressed up for their big day , hanging on Obama 's every word , and laughing as they carried on a conversation with the President that lasted several minutes .

`` Thank you very much . It was a blessing in disguise , '' Mallue said .

Acknowledging he is far from an ace golfer , Obama quipped , `` That must have been kind of painful . ''

`` I shot an 84 . If I had skipped the 16th hole , I would have shot a 79 , '' Obama replied .

The conversation then turned to what sounded like an episode of the presidential dating game .

`` How long you been going out ? '' Obama asked .

The couple proceeded to tell Obama they have been dating since 2011 . The military couple , both captains , attended West Point , before moving to Germany where they met . They now live in Hawaii , which led to the President 's next question .

`` Might be Fort Polk , Louisiana , '' Mallue quipped .

`` Congratulations and thank you both for your service , '' Obama added at the end of the call .
