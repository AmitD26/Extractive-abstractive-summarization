-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East , has been treated for early stage prostate cancer and says recent screening tests have delivered `` very positive '' news .

`` My cancer was caught very early , '' Petraeus , 56 , said in remarks released by his office . `` I 've had two PSA tests since completing treatment five months ago , and they 've both been very positive . Surgery to remove the prostate was not an option due to plates/screws that were used to repair my pelvis after it was fractured in a parachuting accident . ''

PSA tests are blood tests performed to screen for prostate-specific antigens -- proteins produced by cells of the prostate . Higher levels of PSAs could signal prostate cancer or benign prostate conditions .

At an appearance Tuesday after news of the treatment was out , Petraeus made only a lighthearted comment about this health .

`` With the CNN reports today , they 're all just here to see if the guy 's still alive or not , '' said Petraeus , joking about the camera crews recording his speech at the Association of the United States Army meeting in Washington . He did not comment further on his condition .

Petraeus made at least one overseas trip during the radiation treatment .
