The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that the unemployment rate fell to 8.2 % . That should have been a signal that jobs are coming back and that the economy is about to rebound . But , as many economists say , the numbers fell primarily because unemployed Americans have become so discouraged with trying to find a job that they 've simply quit looking .

The people we met are n't lazy or eager to live off so-called government entitlements . We spoke with formerly middle-class parents who were thrust into poverty when one or both lost their salaries . We heard the stories of single mothers and fathers , military veterans and former high-wage employees desperately trying to re-enter a workforce that no longer pays living wages .

Receiving government aid , however , has not been as depressing as her job search . Joann says she has applied for at least 300 jobs . Even though she can barely afford gas , she drives to the interviews only to learn that the employers want to hire younger candidates at low wages .

The experiences have taken a toll : `` I 've aged 10 years in the three years that I 've been looking for a job , '' Joann told us . `` I want to get a job so I can just relax and exhale ... but I ca n't . After a while you just give up . ''

Like Joann , millions of Americans are just giving up on the possibility of ever rejoining the workforce . These frustrations reflect a reality that is unraveling the American identity . One of the most fundamental dictates in achieving the `` American Dream '' has always been a good job that pays wages decent enough to care for our families , buy a car and a home , and live reasonably comfortable lives .

Unemployment has been discussed in sound bites within the framework of the Great Recession . Reporters and pundits pontificate about the housing and home-lending fiasco , the collapse of Wall Street and the amount of construction , manufacturing and government jobs lost as a result of the market 's economic downturn .

Not only do these efforts lack the innovation necessary to meet the demands of a burgeoning world economy , they also do nothing to change the nation 's capitalist equation that renders everyday Americans irrelevant .

`` Fair trade '' with China will not interrupt the transportation of construction , manufacturing and production jobs overseas in exchange for huge profits . Fat-cat executives running investment firms , banks , insurance , health care and pharmaceutical companies might like to curb health care mandates , but that approach certainly does n't address the needs of Americans looking for decent wages and affordable health care .

Most major corporations are run by the Ã¼ber-rich -- the same people who shipped American jobs overseas , broke the backs of labor unions , pay a fraction of the salaries once paid for manufacturing jobs , turned full-time work into part-time positions , and snatched health care benefits away from employees . And many companies have even established `` unemployed need not apply '' policies . In other words , if you do n't have a job when it 's time to apply , you ca n't get the job .

When the `` need not apply '' story broke late last year , more than 6 million Americans had been out of work for six months or more .

Talk about kicking people when they 're down .

During our poverty tour last year , we met countless people caught in vicious cycles of looking for nonexistent jobs because their unemployment benefits were expiring or had run out , scraping change together for gas to go on interviews that may or may not pan out , and having to swap food stamps for cash to keep the lights or gas on in the house .

`` Our generation has been hit far worse than any other , '' said Scott Gerber , 28 , part of the group of young people who started the campaign . `` We represent the broken dream of America , and we ca n't let it continue . ''

Many single mothers have stopped looking for work for the sake of their children 's health . Because of deficit budget cuts , states are either eliminating or tightening eligibility requirements for child care programs that used to serve the working poor . More cuts are on the way , but , for the moment , children of women on welfare have access to basic health care . But previously eligible low-wage-earning parents are now either denied assistance or their children are placed on interminable waiting lists . It has reached the point where struggling parents have to choose between a low-wage job and welfare so their children can receive basic medical attention .

The inconvenient truth is that America itself is in need of a transfusion of economic equity and radical reform . Everyday people must recognize that their lives matter just as much as the lives of the rich . A workplace rooted in fundamental fairness that provides decent living wage jobs will allow frustrated , unemployed workers like Joann Cotton to breathe again , and give them a chance to become revitalized contributing members of society . It 's time to resuscitate the American Dream .
