One thing appeared certain when Barnes & Noble announced Thursday how much money its Nook e-readers brought in over the past three months : The news would be lousy .

Is the bookseller just losing ground to rival Amazon and its market-leading line of Kindles ? Perhaps . But many tech analysts see something else happening : the booming market for tablet computers is starting to make the dedicated e-reader obsolete .

Competitors struggled to come up with a worthy alternative until late the next year , when Amazon -- already a leader in the e-reader market -- rolled out its simpler , smaller Kindle Fire , priced at $ 199 , far lower than the iPad .

Its relative success not only inspired the launch of devices such as the Google Nexus 7 , but it likely nudged Apple into the new midsize tablet market with the iPad Mini .

The net effect ? Anyone interested in a tablet now probably has a price point with which they 'll be comfortable . And tablets , which are priced similarly to top e-readers , also work well for reading e-books . Throw in Internet , apps and e-mail -- all on a full-color tablet screen -- and e-readers suffer by comparison .

During the quarter that included last year 's holiday season , Barnes & Noble 's Nook business , which includes e-readers and e-books , suffered a 12.6 % sales decline over 2011 , bringing in just $ 311 million .

Earlier this month , the company said the Nook-related losses they 'll announce Thursday would be even bigger than previously expected . The bad news came despite Barnes & Noble slashing the price of its Nook Simple Touch e-reader in December to $ 79 .

But analysts expect that even Amazon 's success with dedicated e-readers will fade .

`` It 's a rough market to compete , '' said Michael Gartenberg , a tech-industry analyst with research firm Gartner Inc. `` On one hand , devices like the iPad dominate the consumer tablet experience which includes reading . On the other hand , less demand for dedicated devices had helped Amazon , which already established a strong brand presence with Kindle as part of a much larger personal-cloud ecosystem . ''

Amazon has transitioned well into that new world . This holiday season , the new Kindle Fire HD was Amazon 's top-selling device in the Kindle line , the company announced . Second ? The older , and price-reduced , Kindle Fire .

Hands-on with the new Kindles

`` As part of Barnes & Noble , the Nook is stuck as a media device offered to media consumers when in reality the tablet business is poised for much more than this , '' he said .

Many reviewers actually liked Barnes & Noble 's response , the Nook Tablet , better than the first-generation Kindle Fire . But , as McQuivey notes , its lack of an expansive ecosystem hurt it .

`` If you love reading and are looking to invest a chunk of money into a device as a dedicated e-reader , then the iPad is not your best bet , '' Cesar Torres , of CNN content partner ArsTechnica , wrote last year in a review comparing the third-generation iPad to e-readers such as the third-generation Kindle . -LRB- That iPad has the same screen as the most recent one -RRB- .

So , is there any future for dedicated e-readers ?

McQuivey says that as Amazon continues to establish itself as an Internet clearinghouse for all sorts of goods -LRB- both physical and digital -RRB- , the Nook , which got a $ 300 million infusion from Microsoft last year , could look to selling textbooks and other educational tools .

A rumored plan to split the e-book division off from Barnes & Noble 's brick-and-mortar stores could come as early as Thursday and would be a perfect jumping-off point , he said .

`` All the more reason for Nook to separate from Barnes & Noble , turning to its investment partners like Microsoft and Pearson and saying , ` Let 's see how far we can take this platform into productivity and education , ' '' he said .

`` Of course there 's risk there , but there was risk in getting into the tablet business . ''
