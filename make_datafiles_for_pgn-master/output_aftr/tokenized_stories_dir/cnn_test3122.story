The Quiver Tree Forest

The striking quiver tree , or kokerboom , is unique to Namibia , and only found in the southern part of the country . A species of aloe , the quiver tree is renowned for its unique , sculptural beauty . The name comes from the fact that local bushman traditionally used the tree 's quills to make their quivers .

Giant 's Playground

`` This area is sub-volcanic . It was a shallow sea millions of years ago , '' explains Marian Hulme , the owner of the local rest camp and caretaker of the forest .

`` Lava pushed up and cooled down underneath the water . After the water disappeared , it opened up with erosion and -LSB- formed -RSB- like this , '' she says .

In addition to these natural sculptures , Hulme 's father , who was a caretaker before her , created art from stones and recycled materials . Hulme keeps up the tradition .

`` Everything here tells a story . That 's the idea -LSB- behind the art -RSB- , '' she says .

You can mule trek

Many tour operators offer two-to-five day mule treks . Visitors can explore the area with a guide on foot , while mules carry the load of their baggage .

`` I looked at the Grand Canyon and saw how they do it there , and just adapted it , '' he explains .

`` The first explorers came in and they disrupted the balance that existed here . This is a very dry area , and only gets some rain -LSB- two to four inches yearly -RSB- , '' says Goldbeck .

`` Tourism was secondary , '' he explains .
