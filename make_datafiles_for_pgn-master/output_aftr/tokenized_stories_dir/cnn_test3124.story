It 's one of several puzzles , but there are a number of clues as to who committed this horrible act and where .

1 . Accent

The focus has been on a man in the video who has a British accent . Peter Westmacott , British ambassador to the United States , said Sunday that British agents have been using `` very sophisticated technologies , voice identification and so on '' to identify the suspect . `` We are very close to identifying who this guy is , '' he said .

`` The speaker is using a variety of English known as multicultural London English and that 's a kind of melting pot accent that 's emerged in recent years , particularly in deprived , multi-ethnic areas of inner London , '' Barry said .

There is only one voice heard on the audio track .

The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit .

The video contains other data like the measurements of a face , even though it is hidden . That could help investigators sift through databases of passport photos .

3 . Knives

The dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different , Patel said .

4 . Holster

When trying to determine whether the British-accented man is also the killer , it helps to examine where his pistol is holstered . It is underneath his left armpit -- that is for use by his right hand . But the executioner appears on the video to be left-handed . It 's unclear why this happened .

5 . Location

Blogger Eliot Higgins looked at the background of the video . Behind the men is a road going over the hilly terrain . On the right side of the frame is a dip in the hills , one Higgins matched to a break he found in an image on Google Earth . There was another camera angle used in the video and in the distance there is a field and some buildings . He believes the clues show the video was recorded south of the town of Raqqa in north central Syria .
