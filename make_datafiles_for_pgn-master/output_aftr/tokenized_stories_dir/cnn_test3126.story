The body of an Iraqi woman , whose brutal beating death may have been a hate crime , will be flown home for burial .

Shaima Alawadi , a 32-year-old mother of five , died of a severe head injury after the attack at her home in southern California March 21 . A note beside the body told the family to go back to Iraq and called them `` terrorists , '' her daughter said .

Alawadi , who was hospitalized in critical condition after the beating , was taken off life support Saturday .

A memorial service will be held Tuesday at her home , organized by the local Muslim community .

The U.S. State Department Tuesday expressed its condolences to Alawadi 's family .

Late Monday night , the Council on American-Islamic Relations -LRB- CAIR -RRB- said Alawadi 's body would be taken to Iraq for a funeral and burial .

Hanif Mohebi , executive director of the organization that advocates for Muslim civil liberties , said he did not know exactly when the funeral will take place , but believed the Iraqi government was footing the bill to transport the body .

Alwadai 's teenage daughter found her mother unconscious in the dining area of their home last week .

Police have not disclosed the contents of the note , but called it `` threatening . ''

Al Himidi told KGTV that a similar note was left outside the family home earlier in the month , but the family did not report it . Police confirmed it .

Mohebi said the family was holding up as best as they could , amid an outpouring of support from the community .

`` But they 're also emotionally realizing that yes , their mother is no longer with them . And that 's heartbreaking , '' he said .

Social media users quickly compared Alawadi 's death to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin , calling both hate crimes , and drawing a parallel between a hijab and a hoodie .

Martin was killed last month as he walked back to the house of his father 's fiancee in Sanford , Florida , after a trip to the convenience store . Police say he was shot by George Zimmerman , a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he was acting in self defense and has not been charged .

The teen was unarmed , carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea , and was wearing a hoodie .
