Twenty-three people died when an Overseas National Airways DC-9 ditched off the Caribbean island of St. Croix in 1970 , and 123 were killed in the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 off the Comoro Islands near Africa in 1996 .

In fact , Corsetti said , the 1970 crash helped lead to a redesign of seat belts .

The belts aboard the DC-9 were `` metal-to-fabric , '' Corsetti said , depending upon tension to keep passengers strapped in their seats .

`` Those things gave out ... People were thrown out of their seats 10 rows up , '' said Corsetti , who has written a book , `` 35 Miles from Shore , '' about the 1970 crash .

Corsetti also said that the DC-9 did n't have life raft capacity for all those aboard . Unlike the A320 's escape slides , which helped dozens of passengers get out , the DC-9s rafts could hold only three or four .

Sullenberger had other advantages , too , Corsetti said . Putting the jetliner down into the placid Hudson River probably helped him keep the plane level . The DC-9 pilot faced 8 - to 15-foot seas in the 1970 ditching and the Ethiopian jet was dealing with offshore waves . Watch a pilot describe how plane went down ''

The A320 also is equipped with a ditching button , Corsetti said , which closes all valves below the waterline , enabling it to float more easily .

No matter the lessons learned from the earlier crashes , US Airways passengers were happy Sullenberger was in the cockpit Thursday .

`` He 's the man ! He 's absolutely the man ! '' passenger Vince Spera said . `` If you want to talk to a hero , get a hold of him because that is the hero in this whole deal . ''
