-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of another round of national protests against police killings of unarmed black men , many Republicans seem unable to identify with protesters or give credence to the goals of the #ICantBreathe movement .

These protests are about citizens ' rattled faith in the fair delivery of justice . In any civil society , there 's a serious problem when confidence in the rule of law is shaken . Republicans who are committed to the stability of our society must acknowledge that these protests reflect real doubts in the equity of our criminal justice system . We all have a moral obligation to constantly improve it to the benefit of everyone .

As a reform Republican who works for the GOP to broaden its base and reach new constituencies , I see no contradiction between supporting law enforcement and the policy solutions highlighted by these protestors .

More Republicans should champion the implementation of body-worn cameras on police officers , requested by Michael Brown 's family and supported by Republican law enforcement proponent Rudy Giuliani .

Republicans should also champion `` community policing '' practices such as those employed by Camden , New Jersey , Police Chief Scott Thomson where creative engagement with community partners has reduced homicides by 50 % and violent crime by 20 % .

Among the 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls , Sen. Rand Paul stands out on the issue of criminal justice reform because he 's consistently reached out beyond the base to communities of color . More Republicans should follow his lead on policies ranging from reforming mandatory minimum sentencing and giving felons who have already served time the right to vote .

On a recent Saturday afternoon , I co-hosted an opinion panel on CNN with my friends Sally Kohn , Sunny Hostin and Mel Robbins . While we usually represent contrasting perspectives on the week 's top issues , we strive to disagree agreeably and forge common ground . That was the case this past weekend , when we jointly agreed to end the show with a salute to the ongoing #ICantBreathe protests .

The photo of us four raising our hands was celebrated on social media by creative icons such as Shonda Rhimes , who tweeted , `` Inspired to see @CNN opinion voices speaking out on left and right , '' and Russell Simmons , `` Glad to see diverse and bold voices on @cnn . Beautiful statement of support for humanity . ''

CNN is and always should be the place that breaks through left/right , black/white divides and forges common ground on contentious debates . That 's what we aspire to in our opinion panel .
