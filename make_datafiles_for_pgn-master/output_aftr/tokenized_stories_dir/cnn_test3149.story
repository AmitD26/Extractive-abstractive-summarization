The president of Florida A&M University moved Wednesday to dismiss the school 's longtime band director in the wake of last weekend 's hazing-linked death of a drum major in the school 's famed marching band .

`` The reason for this intended employment action is based upon your alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the ` Marching 100 , ' '' President James H. Ammons said in a letter to Julian E. White .

But Berlinda Johnson , whose 18-year-old son is a band member whom she did not want to identify by name for fear of retribution , praised White . `` Any time I alerted him to an issue , Dr. White was always responsive , '' she told CNN . She blamed section directors for setting the tone that allowed hazing to occur , despite White 's efforts to halt it . `` I do not think he had the support that he needed , '' she said .

Johnson accused a section leader of having hit her son in the back when practices first began last summer , and said that was just the beginning . `` I reported maybe four to five incidents , '' she told CNN . `` They need to interview each member of the band , no matter how long it takes . This is not a witch hunt , this is about getting things under control . ''

Wednesday 's dismissal comes four days after band members returned to their Orlando hotel following Saturday 's game . There , Robert Champion , 26 , `` reportedly threw up in the parking lot and started complaining of not being able to breathe , '' the sheriff 's office said in a release . Champion was taken to a hospital , where he was pronounced dead .

`` The investigation indicates that hazing was involved in the events that occurred prior to the 911 call for assistance , '' Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said Tuesday .

His death was not the first incident linked to hazing within the marching band , and school officials were well aware of the abuse , Fabre said .

Fabre 's 20-year-old son , Marcus , plays alto saxophone in the band and was among a number of musicians who were being maltreated , she said . `` My son told me he was mentally and verbally hazed ; he was not physically beat , but that 's because he does n't allow that kind of thing .

Fabre said she met with and e-mailed band staffers about her concerns over what she saw as pervasive hazing . `` I addressed them to the leadership and they act like they do n't know -- they say if students do n't address it , then there 's nothing they can do . If students are n't willing to stand up and say there 's something going on , there 's no one they can prosecute . ''

Marcus Fabre declined to speak to CNN , his mother said . `` He 's just not ready to talk , '' she said . `` He 's just not ready to go to that next level yet . ''

Calls to the school 's spokeswoman , Sharon Saunders and to Turner were not immediately returned .

On Wednesday , Gov. Rick Scott sent a letter to Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey asking the department to join the investigation `` to assure that the circumstances leading to Mr. Champion 's death become fully known , and that if there are individuals directly or indirectly responsible for this death , they are appropriately brought to justice and held accountable . ''

Under Florida law , any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony .

After the incident , President Ammons suspended band performances and said he will convoke a task force `` to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching 100 . ''

Ammons acknowledged that at least 30 band members were let go this semester because of possible involvement in hazing .

She likened the hazing incidents to gang initiations and said they were carried out in secret . `` Not like street thugs , but here , if you want to be accepted , then you got to go through it . ''

The Marching 100 's motto lays out `` qualities to live by , '' including `` highest quality of character '' and `` dedication to service . ''

In 2009 , the band represented Florida in the parade for President Barack Obama 's inauguration .
