In the 61 years since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached the top of Mount Everest , most of the 5,000-plus people have descended from the summit the same way they came up : on foot . A few have paraglided down .

Joby Ogwyn has other plans .

The ultra-daredevil plans to plunge off the world 's tallest mountain in May while wearing a custom wing-suit equipped with cameras to share the jump with a TV audience .

It 's not like the 39-year-old Ogwyn is unfamiliar with the 29,035-foot tall mountain . He was 24 the first time he reached the summit , which at the time made him the youngest American to do so . He 's scaled the mountain from a base-camp in just 9Ã‚ 1/2 hours . And three years ago , he did a test jump from an airplane .

Mount Everest : By the numbers

`` I never saw myself as a very gifted athlete , '' said Ogwyn , who was raised in Louisiana . `` I do have a very high threshold for pain and suffering at very high altitudes . ''

He said it 's important to win the mental battle . What 's in your head and heart are more important than what 's in your arms or legs , he said .

The Discovery Channel , which televised Nik Wallenda 's tight rope walk over the Grand Canyon last year and Felix Baumgartner 's jump from the edge of space in 2012 , has said it will show Ogwyn 's jump live , though no firm date has been set .

Ogwyn said he will reach the summit then change into his suit and put on his helmet .

He 'll take three or four steps .

`` And I will be out of there . ''
