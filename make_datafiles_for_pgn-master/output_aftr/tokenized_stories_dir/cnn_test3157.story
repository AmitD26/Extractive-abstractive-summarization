Police killed a suspected militant leader in a shootout in Russia 's restive republic of Dagestan , state media said Tuesday , amid increasing security concerns ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi .

It 's also emerged that Russian authorities are hunting two more ` black widow ' suspects -- a notorious type of terrorist that 's emerged in Russia 's clashes with Chechen separatists .

The latest incidents have fueled debate over security at Sochi , despite assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia will do its utmost to keep the Games secure .

There have been years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region , and Islamist militants have vowed to strike at the Games .

Russian terrorism officials named the suspected militant killed Tuesday in Dagestan as Eldar Magato , state news agency RIA Novosti reported .

Earlier , the news agency said Russian special forces were engaged in two operations in Dagestan , which lies about a 12-hour drive from Sochi on the other side of the Caucasus Mountains .

Security forces killed three more suspected militants in Dagestan on Monday , it reported .

` Black widows '

Meanwhile , a flier handed out by security forces to hotels in Rostov-on-Don , southeast Russia , names three women it says could carry out a suicide attack planned by militant groups between January 21 and 24 , during the Olympic Torch Relay .

Sochi suspect

Police have also handed out fliers at Sochi area hotels warning of a woman they believe could be a terrorist and who now may be in the Black Sea resort town .

CNN obtained a copy of the flier , which is dated January 15 , from security staff at a hotel in Sochi . The flier says authorities have received information about Ibragimova 's possible arrival in the region last week .

Photos of Ibragimova have flooded television and social media reports from Sochi , and some describe her as a `` black widow . ''

In a video that surfaced Sunday , two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month 's back-to-back bombings in the Russian city of Volgograd made an ominous promise .

The U.S. military has contingency plans in place for an evacuation of U.S. citizens in case of a major incident in Sochi .
