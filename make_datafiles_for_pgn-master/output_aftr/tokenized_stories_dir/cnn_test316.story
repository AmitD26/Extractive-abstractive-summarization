It takes thousands of people like him to keep Capitol Hill -- and the U.S. government -- running .

Here are some Capitol Hill jobs that those outside the Beltway may have never heard of :

The House and Senate each have their own Office of the Parliamentarian . The parliamentarian 's job is to advise lawmakers on procedure and clarify the often arcane legislative lingo . The parliamentarian provides nonpartisan advice to help lawmakers understand the ins and outs of the legislative process .

With reconciliation a likely step on the path to health care reform , expect to see Frumin in the headlines for a while .

Keeper of the stationery

The secretary of the Senate still has a stationery room , which is looked after by the keeper of stationery . Today , that room is more of an office supply shop , where lawmakers ' staff can pick up computer paper and ink cartridges .

The House and Senate each have similar stores , which are not open to the public .

Cloakroom personnel

Each party has its own cloakroom . Floor assistants and cloakroom attendants are among those who work in the rooms . Their duties include alerting lawmakers when votes are coming up , telling them whether the chamber will be open on a snow day and working with pages to deliver messages .

Senate hair care staff

Hairstylists have worked on Capitol Hill since the 19th century , Ritchie said . Although haircuts were free for lawmakers when the shop first opened , that 's not the case anymore . In addition to hairstylists , the Senate hair care staff also includes a shoe shiner and a manicurist .

Reading clerk

The reading clerk , also known as the legislative clerk , reads the titles of bills . In the Senate , the clerk also calls the role when votes take place .

The reading clerk is also the lucky person who has the task of reading aloud 1,000-plus-page bills when lawmakers request it .

Gift shop workers

The Senate and House each have their own gift shops . There are also two gift shops at the Capitol Hill Visitor Center .

These shops employ gift shop assistants , sales associates and shop directors .

The House sergeant-at-arms introduces the president at the State of the Union address .

When the office of the House doorkeeper was abolished in 1995 , the House sergeant-at-arms absorbed some of that position 's duties , along with the clerk of the House and the chief administrative officer .

Subway operators

There are multiple subways that run to the Capitol from lawmakers ' office buildings . A driver operates the one from the Rayburn House Office Building . The Senate has three office buildings . Subways running from the Hart and Dirksen office buildings are mechanically operated . The original Russell Senate Office Building still has an operator on its subway , Ritchie said .

The subways shuffle lawmakers from their offices to the House and Senate floor .
