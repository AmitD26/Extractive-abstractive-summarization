Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- The straight talking governor is suddenly mealy-mouthed over measles .

As he toured the United Kingdom on Monday , Chris Christie seemed to leave his tough guy persona back in the United States . The potential Republican 2016 presidential contender punted on questions about whether Americans should vaccinate their kids amid a 14-state outbreak of a disease which is staging a comeback after being largely eradicated by science .

`` All I can say is we vaccinated ours , '' Christie said , while touring a biomedical research facility in Cambridge , England , which makes vaccines .

The New Jersey governor added that `` parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well , so that 's the balance that the government has to decide . ''

Parents : What is your message to parents who do n't vaccinate their kids ?

The flap is a reminder that as a politician who made his name by telling it like it is , Christie will be carefully watched for any sign he is toning down his act or hedging on difficult issues as he tries to navigate the early skirmishes of a likely presidential campaign .

With Democrats pouncing on a new chance to brand Christie as `` anti-science '' and reporters jumping on a story that livened up a routine trade mission , the Christie camp rushed out an unusual clarification .

`` To be clear : the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated , '' said Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts . `` At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination , which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate . ''

The United States is one of the most vaccinated nations in the world . Experts note that infants face more than 20 shots before they are 18 months old and some parents question the speed and utility of all the doses .

Claims picked up by the so-called anti-vaxxer movement , now debunked by scientific research , argue that shots can cause childhood autism and other unintended side effects .

So it 's not surprising that politicians should face questions about the issue -- especially if they are a governor who is thinking of running for president .

Christie seems to have been tripped up more by policy than substance . When he spoke with nuance , it came across as a political calculation because his careful remarks contrasted with his own tendency to talk most of the time in an unmistakeably blunt way .

`` Get the hell off the beach ... and get out , you 're done , '' Christie , for instance , once told people he saw on news footage who had yet to take Hurricane Irene 's approach seriously in 2011 .

Was Christie for instance fudging on an issue that could play into suspicions of government mandates - in health care , education and other areas -- that could animate the 2016 Republican primary race ?

There is , after all , precedent for a vaccination flap having political reverberations in a primary race .

Another candidate , Michele Bachmann , helped torpedo her own campaign by suggesting the drug could cause `` mental retardation . ''

Christie 's struggles in getting his own message across may have several explanations , not all political . He could simply have been caught off guard in a place far from the early skirmishes of the Republican presidential sweepstakes .

Or perhaps he was off his game , when appearing before a small traveling press pack , after battling a five-hour time difference to stay up late to watch the Super Bowl .

But the episode is a reminder of the perils facing a politician who prizes speaking off the cuff .

`` It depends on what the vaccine is , what the disease type is and all the rest , '' Christie said , trying to explain his initial quote . `` I did n't say I 'm leaving people the option . What I 'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns . ''

Mark Largent , a Michigan State University professor who wrote a book about the vaccination debate in modern America , said that issues like inoculation schedules tend to be seen as a barometer for candidates on wider issues of scientific and medical issues .

He says the debate is a rare one which cuts across political divides . On the right , objectors tend to sense the overweening hand of big government and infringments on individual liberties . On the left , suspicion is driven by skepticism about the motives of the pharmaceutrical industry , he said .

The result is a debate in which legitimate concerns can be drowned out by politics .

Christie `` is very moderate in what he is saying , but he is going to get pummeled as anti-vaccine , '' Largent said .

Christie 's comments may also be conditioned by his time in New Jersey where there has been a spirited debate over the issue , with activists complaining about what they say are the nation 's most expansive mandates for child vaccines .

The speed with which Christie 's camp rushed to put out Monday 's storm appeared to signal that the governor was not making some sort of clever play for government-hating activists on the conservative right -- a sector of the Republican Party where he must make inroads .

`` Chris Christie is n't a scientist . He is n't a doctor . And he sure as heck is n't a leader , '' said Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee .
