`` I 'm ever mindful of the fact that there certainly has been some damage done , '' Perez said . `` If you talk to the citrus farmers whose citrus rotted on the port , that 's damage that has been done . ''

`` 2014 was the best year since the late 90s in terms of job growth and we see a real hop in the step of this economy , '' he said . `` I think in the grand scheme , I 'm confident that we can recover quickly . ''

Contract negotiations between the Pacific Maritime Association , which represents shipping companies and port operators , and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union , which represents dock workers on the West Coast , started in May . The two parties were unable to come to an agreement and have been without a contract since July .

The standoff has been a nightmare for U.S. businesses that use the West Coast ports to import and export their goods . For weeks , vessels carrying thousands of containers have been sitting on the waterfront waiting to be loaded or unloaded , and the problem grew exponentially worse when the PMA temporarily stopped all loading and unloading of ships this month .

`` We are also pleased that our ports can now resume full operations , '' they said .

Analysts say the process of clearing the ports of the existing congestion could take weeks , if not months .

Perez , who has been labor secretary since 2013 , told CNN that playing mediator in the West Coast ports dispute was `` among the most difficult '' challenges he has faced so far in office .
