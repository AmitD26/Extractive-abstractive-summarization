Not only does a total lack of sunlight give one the excuse to stay until close to breakfast time , many of these subterranean bars have had bizarre former lives as nuclear bunkers and bank vaults .

Now , sensibly , they 're devoted to the joys of imbibing .

Converted bank vault -LRB- Trinity Place , New York -RRB-

Deep underneath a typically Gotham City-esque Big Apple skyscraper in the heart of the financial district , gaining entrance to Trinity Place involves walking through a set of two century-old 35-ton doors , which lead to the former vaults of the United States Realty Bank .

Food is in a suitably mid-20th century `` Mad Men '' style -- there 's steak tartare and lobster bisque along with high-end craft ales on tap including Smuttynose and Duvel .

Former underground public toilet -LRB- Cellar Door , London -RRB-

It 's predictably tiny but the usual vile environs of the London public toilet have been blown apart by this conversion of a Victorian underground convenience into a cabaret and burlesque bar .

Holding just 60 people there 's an array of oddities to discover including snuff tobacco available from the bar , opaque toilet doors which only frost over when locked and an SMS jukebox .

London bar and travel blogger Harriet Constable is a regular visitor here and says , `` It 's got a really loyal following of genuine London eccentrics who come here knowing they can be naughty and not have to deal with oppressive bouncers .

`` It 's amazing that somewhere this centrally located still has such a cult reputation -- it 's been here a while but it 's still an ` in the know ' kind of spot . ''

Nuclear bunker -LRB- Parukarka , Prague -RRB-

Down two spiral staircases you 're in Bunkr Parukarka , a nuclear bunker built by the Czech Communist party in the 1950s .

`` It would have been easier to destroy it and then rebuild it from scratch , '' says Michal Tesinsky , the man behind the three-year clean up job that turned this Cold war oddity into a thriving club , art gallery , bar and live music venue that can hold 250 Prague night owls .

Stranger still is the fact that one of the stipulations of the use of this incredible space is that , should Armageddon break out , the club must be converted back to its original purpose within 48 hours .

Converted by three French school friends who all moved to the German capital , the bar is now a warren of rooms with Dali-esque touches of surrealism including an upside down room where tables and lamps hang from the ceiling , a wardrobe leading into a secret bar and a delightfully low admission fee on a `` donate what you can afford '' basis .

Madame Claude , 19 Lubbener Street , Berlin ; +49 30 8411 0859

Located in The Lanes , one of the most ancient parts of the historic market city of Norwich , the building upstairs is no spring chicken , constructed in the 17th century and formerly used as a Post Office .

Listed as an ancient monument , the crypt was once used as a creche for the children of the office workers in the main building -- enough to give any child nightmares .

Bombings during WWII meant that many of Norwich 's crypts collapsed or were filled with rubble .

This is one of the few survivors , where you can find anything from a DJ night to a salsa dance class -- and even the odd wedding after-party .
