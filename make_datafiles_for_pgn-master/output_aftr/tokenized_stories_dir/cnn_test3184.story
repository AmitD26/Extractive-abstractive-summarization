A U.S. patient who had an infection of the mysterious MERS virus has recovered , the Florida Department of Health announced Monday .

The patient , a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia , has been discharged , the department said . He was admitted to Dr. P. Phillips Hospital in Orlando on May 9 .

`` All health care workers and household contacts who had contact with the patient were tested for MERS-CoV and all of those results have come back negative , '' the health department said in a statement . `` There is no broad risk of MERS-CoV infection for the general public , and no threat to those traveling to the Orlando area . ''

MERS-CoV stands for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus .

The Illinois man said he was suffering only mild cold-like symptoms and did not seek or require medical care , Dr. David Swerdlow told reporters . A blood test indicated that he had been previously infected with MERS .

`` We think that this patient was likely infected with MERS . But technically he does n't count as an official case of MERS , '' he said .

To date , there have been more than 570 confirmed cases of MERS , including 171 deaths , according to the World Health Organization . The number of countries with confirmed cases has expanded to 18 , with a case in the Netherlands , according to the WHO .

There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS . Doctors say they believe the Indiana patient 's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances of getting better .

`` This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person in community settings , '' she said .

No cases of MERS have been diagnosed as a result of transmission on a plane , the CDC 's Dr. Marty Cetron said .

The Florida patient

The 44-year-old Florida patient traveled on May 1 from Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , to London , then from London to Boston , Boston to Atlanta , and finally Atlanta to Orlando .

The man began feeling unwell on the flight from Jeddah , with symptoms including `` fever , chills and a slight cough , '' Schuchat said .

He now tests negative for the virus , the Florida Health Department said .
