North Korean officials could not be reached for comment . Meanwhile , state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident .

Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin , a top official in Bangladesh 's customs agency , told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th , after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight .

He said the suspect , whom he identified as Son Young Nam , the first secretary of North Korea 's embassy in Dhaka , initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched .

`` He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag , '' Ziauddin said . `` At first he said ` This is an electric motor . ' After further questioning he changed his mind and told us , ` These are cipher machines and very confidential . ' ''

Eventually , customs officers opened the diplomat 's bag and found the undeclared goods , that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments .

At current market prices , the gold would be valued at around $ 1 million .

An official with Bangladesh 's Foreign Secretary , speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity , said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador .

It 's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds .
