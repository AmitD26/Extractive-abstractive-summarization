-LRB- CNN -RRB- Last month Wu Rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on International Women 's Day against sexual harassment in China . Since then , the Chinese authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for `` creating disturbances . '' They also briefly detained some of the activists ' supporters , raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release , and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment , lawyers and adequate rest .

This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential Fourth World Conference on Women hosted in Beijing , during which Hillary Clinton famously declared that `` women 's rights are human rights . ''

I first met Wu at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in China 's weiquan or `` rights defense '' movement . It was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as `` babes '' or `` little sisters , '' even in professional -- and ostensibly progressive -- settings . As women 's rights activists , Wu and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the Chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second-class citizens .

By the time we met again two years later , Wu and her young `` direct-action '' feminist colleagues were clearly off and running . They staged small , public `` performance art '' protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women 's rights movement , and pushed women 's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government 's agenda .

Wu had an upbringing typical of her times . She comes from the countryside , which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes . In recent decades the economy has soared , but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth : pollution , unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor . Like many parents , she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy , and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter , safer upbringing .

And it is in Yirenping that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern China . Wu and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor -- `` occupying '' public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women , donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence , shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women -- that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate , especially with young women in the country .

What Wu and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism . Authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists , and imprisoned others , but they have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable , so long as they abandon their activism .

This kind of `` differentiated management '' of nongovernmental organizations -- punishing some but co-opting others -- may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups . But ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make Wu and her friends ' campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through `` authoritarian activism '' alone .
