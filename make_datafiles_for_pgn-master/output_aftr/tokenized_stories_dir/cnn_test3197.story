-LRB- CNN -RRB- Shortly after being elected chief prosecutor , Baltimore City State 's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said prosecutors in the hardscrabble town had the `` toughest job in America . ''

Gray , 25 , died in police custody from a fatal spinal cord injury , one week after he was arrested . Six officers involved in his arrest have been suspended with pay pending an investigation .

`` My grandfather was one of the first African-American police officers in Massachusetts and one of the things he instilled on us is the importance of public service , '' Mosby said in a campaign video .

A 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect two days ago , and National Guard troops have joined Baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order .

During her campaign , Mosby spoke about the broad daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep .

`` I learned very early on that the criminal justice system is n't just the police , the judges and the state 's attorney , '' she said . `` It 's much more than that . I believe that we are the justice system . We , the members of the community , are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes . ''

Mosby said her cousin 's 1994 murder was her first introduction to the criminal justice system .

Mosby , who grew up in Boston , is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in the United States , according to the state 's attorney 's website .

At the age of 6 , Mosby was accepted in a school desegregation program in Massachusetts . She later participated in a study of the civil rights movement .

A. Dwight Pettit , a civil rights attorney and Mosby supporter , said he believes she will `` deliver on doing it right , and getting it right . I 'm confident in that . ''

`` She 's very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office , and so I believe that she will move in a methodical way , '' he said . `` And I think that she will follow where the evidence leads . I do not think she will follow just public opinion . ''

`` Our time to repair that trust , to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now , '' she said .

Mosby added , `` As a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color , I will seek justice on your behalf . ''

The people on Mosby 's transition team included former Mayor Kurt Schmoke , former congressman and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume and Murphy , who is now representing Gray 's family .

Schmoke , a former state 's attorney and Baltimore 's first African-American mayor , said Mosby 's background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice .

`` I actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state 's attorney , Marilyn Mosby , was recently elected , '' he said . `` She has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience . I ca n't say how long , but I do think that people will give her a little bit more time to do it right rather than to do it fast . ''

Mosby defeated Gregg Bernstein as state 's attorney in a 2014 election .

`` Baltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court -- we 've got the toughest job in America , '' she said in a statement after the election .

Mary Koch , another attorney for Gray 's family , said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her .

`` The family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that 's not going to be an easy job for Ms. Mosby , '' said Koch , adding : `` That 's her job . That 's the job she took on . ''
