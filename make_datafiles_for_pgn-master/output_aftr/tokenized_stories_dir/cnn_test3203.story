Nairobi , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- They were sons and daughters , brothers and sisters , friends and fellow citizens .

Mourners read names of some of the victims as candles flickered in the dark . The crowd then sang the national anthem .

The attack at a university in Garissa on Thursday killed 147 people , mostly students . The Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility .

`` I ca n't even look at pictures of the people killed without crying , '' said Mary Wambui , 32 , who lives in Nakuru , hundreds of miles from Garissa .

`` They were just children . They were trying to make a better life for themselves . Some were first to go to college in their communities . They died trying to get an education . ''

Some students remain unaccounted for , and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues . Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the names of the victims .

At Uhuru Park , right next to the crosses , a bulletin board featured 32 photos of the young students .

`` With the previous attacks , there 's been a sense of the victims just being numbers , '' Doreen Areri said . `` The idea behind this is to have faces behind the numbers . We need to hear their stories , their dreams . ''

`` In 2010 , I was in a grenade attack in downtown Nairobi and every time there 's a terrorist attack , it hits too close to home , '' Murungi said . '' It 's not just happened to me , but many others . ''

The vigil was important for the healing process , she said , because `` we should n't have people walking around with scars . ''

In the Garissa attack , the terrorists separated Christians from Muslims , making some recite verses from the Quran .

Kenya launched airstrikes Monday targeting Al-Shabaab 's training camps in Somalia , according to a military source , adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at the university .

`` The latest attack of Al-Shabaab bases by the Kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011 . It is not a retaliation to the Garissa attack . The operation has been ongoing , '' the source said Monday .

It 's unclear why the elite team was stuck in the Kenyan capital about 230 miles -LRB- 370 kilometers -RRB- west of the attack . Kenyan politicians and Nairobi-based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did .

Once the team entered the university complex , the hourslong siege was quickly defused .

Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed echoed that sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday . She denied reports that an elite rapid response team single-handedly ended the siege .

`` We have a military garrison in Garissa , and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists . So the response was adequate , '' she said . `` We did everything that we could do . ''

The ministry offered a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings , or about $ 215,000 , for information on his whereabouts .

He is in charge of external operations against Kenya , according to a government document , and commands the militia along the border .

Dorm becomes scene of a slaughter

Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia , and its violence has spread to Kenya before . In 2013 , militants attacked Nairobi 's upscale Westgate Mall , leaving 67 people dead .

The terror group has intensified attacks in Kenya since the country sent troops to Somalia four years ago to help battle the militants .

CNN 's David McKenzie and Joseph Netto reported from Nairobi , and Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta . CNN 's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles .
