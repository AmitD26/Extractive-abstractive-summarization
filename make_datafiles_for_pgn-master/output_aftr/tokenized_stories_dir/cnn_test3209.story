UNHCR goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie visits the Al Waleed refugee camp in August .

About 2,000 Palestinian refugees are stranded in camps along the Syrian border and face difficult living conditions , including limited medical care , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said .

The agency has appealed for the resettlement of `` vulnerable and sick '' children in Al Waleed refugee camp at the Iraqi-Syrian border .

One of those who died in the camp was a 3-year-old Palestinian boy who was suffering from rickets and pneumonia . He died a few days ago in a Ramadi hospital and then was buried in Al Waleed . The other was a 14-year-old suffering from Hodgkin 's disease who died in Baghdad last week .

A 50-year-old man who was waiting to be resettled died earlier this month in Al Waleed .

The agency says seven people , including three children , have died at the camp since refugees fleeing attackers began arriving at the border in March 2006 .

About 30 to 40 people arrive at the Al Waleed camp each week , the UNHCR reports .

Thousands of Palestinians have lived in Iraq , with some going there when Israel was formed and others born there .
