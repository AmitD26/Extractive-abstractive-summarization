UNITED NATIONS -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe 's longtime president , Robert Mugabe , and 11 senior members of his government .

According to a draft of the resolution , the measure would have instituted a travel ban on Mugabe and others in his government , frozen many of their assets and imposed an international arms embargo on the regime .

The measure received nine votes -- the minimum for it to pass . However , two of the five negative votes were from Russia and China , who as permanent members of the Security Council have veto power .

One Security Council member abstained .

The resolution was pushed by the United States after Mugabe ignored the Security Council 's appeal to postpone the June 27 presidential runoff election .

The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai . But Tsvangirai withdrew days before , saying Mugabe 's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings , intimidation and murders against his supporters .

With their votes , ambassadors for China and Russia said they wanted to give the rival political parties a chance to resolve the election matter on their own terms without undue interference from the Security Council .

Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in South Africa on the Zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions .

`` Many countries , including China , repeatedly called upon the Security Council to respect the position of the African countries on this question and give more time , '' Wang said .

`` Recently , in the positions of a number of council member states , we have seen an ever-more-obvious attempt to take the council beyond its chartered prerogatives and beyond maintaining international peace and security , '' Churkin said . `` We believe such practices to be illegitimate and dangerous , leading to a realignment of the entire U.N. system . ''

U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said the United States was disappointed at the veto .

`` China and Russia have stood with Mugabe against the people of Zimbabwe ... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground , '' he said .

`` The U-turn on the Russian position is particularly surprising and disturbing , '' he said , noting that a few days ago , the Russian Federation was supportive of a statement adopted at the Group of Eight meeting in Japan expressing `` grave concern '' about the situation in Zimbabwe .

`` The Russian performance here today raises questions about its reliability as a G-8 partner , '' Khalilzad said .

`` The Security Council has failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa , '' British Ambassador John Sawers said after the vote .

Sawers also questioned Mbeki 's efficacy as a mediator in Zimbabwe 's affairs .

`` We have to be realistic . Those efforts have so far come to naught . The only one who has benefited to date is Mr. Mugabe , '' he said .

`` Today we have seen reason , '' he said . `` I want to express our gratitude to the people in the Security Council who managed to see reason and refused to be intimidated or cowed into following the national interests of the U.S. and UK . ''
