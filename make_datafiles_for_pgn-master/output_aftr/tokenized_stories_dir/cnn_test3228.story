Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , requested that the VA look into potential contamination at its facilities .

This comes after more than 10,000 veterans were possibly exposed to HIV and hepatitis at three VA facilities while undergoing colonoscopies and other procedures with equipment that had not been properly cleaned . The VA sent letters to those veterans offering free testing for hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV .

`` The VA prides itself on being accountable , and we are extremely concerned about this matter , and as a result we have initiated an investigation , '' Dr. Michael J. Kussman , the VA 's undersecretary for health , said in a news release Friday . `` We have an obligation to provide those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation the care they deserve . ''

The VA says it 's reviewing procedures at other facilities . So far , it says , it has encountered no additional problems . In the meantime , the VA has brought in additional personnel to help with testing and counseling in Miami , Murfreesboro and Augusta . It has also set up a toll-free number that VA patients and their families can call , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for additional information : 1-877-575-7256 .

The VA says it will pay for treatment for the infected vets even if they did n't get hepatitis or HIV from the dirty equipment .

`` We are making sure to take corrective measures to ensure veterans have the information and the care necessary to deal with this unacceptable development , '' Kussman said .
