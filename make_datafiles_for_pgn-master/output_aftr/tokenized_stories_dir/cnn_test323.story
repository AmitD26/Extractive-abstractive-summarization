The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker government gave the green light to the Iranian warships Friday , state media reported . They are expected to be the first Iranian warships to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic 's 1979 revolution .

Last week , Egypt 's newly empowered military government said it would honor all its international treaties . That would include Camp David .

`` This is awkward -- at a minimum , '' said David Schenker , director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .

Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply ship -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean . Both are armed with missiles , he said , adding that their passage would create more uncertainty in the region .

Egypt 's decision , analysts said , could show the direction that the military caretakers intend to take the Arab world 's most populous nation .

Asked about Iran 's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday , `` My initial response to that would be we 're highly skeptical of that . ''

Those concerns were shared by the White House , where Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One , `` We 're monitoring that , obviously , but we also would say that Iran does not have a great track record for responsible behavior in the region , which is always a concern for us . ''

`` We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations , designed to deteriorate the situation in the area , and put the Iranians in their place , '' he said .

The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies .

The Suez Canal is a key waterway for international trade . It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea , allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go around Africa . Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day en route to Europe and North America .
