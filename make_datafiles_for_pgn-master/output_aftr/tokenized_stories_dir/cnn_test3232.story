HAVANA , Cuba -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- William Potts picks up his daughters from school every day . People consider him a generous neighbor and a good father .

But few know how this eccentric American ended up in Cuba .

Potts says he was enthused by Fidel Castro and his revolution . He imagined a racial and social utopia that could be replicated in his own country .

In 1984 , he smuggled a firearm aboard a commercial flight and forced the crew to fly to Havana , Cuba . No one was injured .

`` In my revolutionary naivete , I came looking for military training , '' he says .

Instead , he ended up in jail . He spent 13 years behind bars in Cuba .

He says the time is right .

There are thought to be 700 American fugitives hiding in Cuba . Members of the Black Panthers , Puerto Rican independence movement members and common criminals have sought sanctuary on the island . For the most part , they try to go unnoticed .

Perhaps the most famous is black activist Assata Shakur , who was convicted for killing a police officer in New Jersey in 1973 but escaped from prison in 1979 and ended up in Cuba .

Potts says he wants to leave behind his radical days and expects that Obama will finally allow him to do that .
