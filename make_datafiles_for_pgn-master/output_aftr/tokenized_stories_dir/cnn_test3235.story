Chris Cornell 's new solo album , `` Scream , '' was produced by Timbaland . He acknowledges it 's an odd mix .

Not to suggest he 's using the popular social networking service to cause trouble . Hardly .

The 44-year-old rock musician said he enjoys the open stream of chit-chat with his fans .

`` It 's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone 's probably had forever , '' said Cornell . `` And I do n't mind answering them . And I can actually have conversations with fans that are quick , but still more meaningful than the typical situations you 're put into . I 've really liked it . ''

The former front man of Soundgarden and Audioslave -- who is also known for singing the James Bond theme `` Casino Royale '' -- is the first to admit he 's a fan of experimenting . His new solo album , `` Scream , '' has him meshing his rock vibe with dance-floor beats by the much sought-after producer Timbaland .

The collaboration has left some people scratching their heads . Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor took a swipe by twittering : `` You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable ? Heard Chris Cornell 's record ? ''

But Cornell -- who said he 's never met Reznor nor read or responded to his tweet -- was more than ready for criticism .

`` You could kind of see it coming , '' he said . `` Some of it is a script that was written just by putting -LSB- me and Timbaland -RSB- together . And most of the negative responses fit that script perfectly : ` You ca n't put these two things together . We do n't like it ! We 're not going to let you ! So we 're gon na say bad stuff . ' ''

For Cornell , working with Timbaland required him to `` rinse away everything that I knew about songwriting and recording . '' He said the biggest challenge was in having to relearn how to sing to a different rhythm , his raspy voice needing to match up with slick studio beats rather than sliding loosely around the live , loud accompaniment he 's so used to .

`` To me it seemed like an exciting thing to just go and do , '' he said . `` I think this is as good as any album I 've ever made , and I listen to it probably more than any other record I 've ever made . ''

Chris Cornell : I do n't have one , really . I do n't want to have one . If I had a musical identity that was definable then it would be time to get into painting or something else . Race car driving .

Cornell : Absolutely .

CNN : So what was it like working with Timbaland ?

Cornell : He did n't really have a particular direction in mind in terms of what he wanted me to do . He did what Timbaland does , and I did what I do . We just wrote songs , which is really the best thing that came out of it . ...

It does n't sound like anybody else 's record . It does n't sound like music I 've ever heard . It defies genre , and yet it 's very much a song-oriented album as well as an album-oriented album . ... The music never stops . I 've performed it that way . It 's almost like a movie soundtrack .

CNN : How often do you Twitter ?

CNN : What is the biggest misconception about being a rock musician ?

Cornell : My first answer would be that it 's just all a big party . But then I 've been in that situation or seen bands like that where it is all a big party .

CNN : Have you ever thrown a really big object through a window ?
