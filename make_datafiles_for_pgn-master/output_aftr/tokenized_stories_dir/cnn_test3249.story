-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Growing up in a small Sri Lankan fishing town , cricket changed Sanath Jayasuriya 's life . But his association with the game and humanitarian work has also helped transform the lives of many others .

Jayasuriya 's stature and shot-making led to comparisons with India 's Sachin Tendulkar .

`` Even now when many people hear the word -LRB- tsunami -RRB- , they are still scared . When my mother hears it , she still ca n't run , '' he said .

`` Coming from Sri Lanka you need to do a lot of charity work and help in anyway you can . People love cricket and they look to cricketers , so as a team Sri Lanka also does a lot for charity . It 's a personal commitment , '' he told CNN .

On the pitch he has always been just as committed to helping his team . Making his international Test match debut in 1991 , he captained the Sri Lankan team for four years until 2003 and hit memorable centuries against every other Test side , bar the West Indies and New Zealand . He retired from the five-day version of the game in 2007 .

However it was in the one day game that the all-rounder has really made his mark .

In 2005 he became only the fourth batsman to reach 10,000 runs in one-day matches and his current stats stand at 12785 runs from 421 one-day internationals .

`` Cricket has changed all over the world . For the public to watch this game we need for it to change . You can now enjoy all that in around 3 hours -LRB- with Twenty20 -RRB- . The Indian Premier League -LRB- IPL -RRB- is good for cricket and good for cricketers . The one-day game will be phased down . ''

Throughout his career he 's shown his own resilience adapting to changing circumstances on the cricket pitch as well as off it . Before the 2003 World Cup he took the decision not to sign a contract with the Sri Lankan cricket board , citing the loss of potential earnings it would mean for him and fellow players .

With no Test cricket to play this year , Jayasuriya found himself omitted from the Sri Lanka squad for 2008 series one-day series against the West Indies .

`` Looking back I could never have thought I would have come this far . Buddhism helped me a lot . It says that you should take the middle path and you will never go wrong , '' he said .

`` But I 've done a lot of hard work and everyone , my family and coaches , have given me support . Without that I would n't have got here . '' When he does finally retire you can expect Jayasuriya to keep giving all he can to the game and causes he loves so much .
