Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Monday he would boycott the conference .

Announcing the postponement at a news conference Tuesday , Irvin Khosa , chairman of the South African football league , did not offer an explanation .

`` South Africa has made this decision , '' he said . `` We stand by the decision . ''

The peace conference had been scheduled to start Friday . Officials said they would like to have a conference in the future , but they did not offer a specific date .

The conference had been organized by South African soccer officials , led by Khosa , and was billed as an opportunity to showcase South Africa 's role as a human-rights champion ahead of the 2010 World Cup -- the global soccer championship the nation will host next year .

The presidential spokesman had said earlier that the Dalai Lama -- Tibet 's spiritual leader and a Nobel Laureate -- did not receive a visa because it was not in South Africa 's interest for him to attend .

`` We can not allow focus to shift to China and Tibet , '' he said . He added that South Africa has gained much from its trading relationship with China .

The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule .

The peace conference was to bring together Nobel laureates and top soccer officials . Archbishop Desmond Tutu ; former President F.W. De Klerk ; laureates Nelson Mandela and Martti Ahtisaar ; Seff Blatter , president of soccer 's international governing body ; and actress Charlize Theron were among those invited . The event had the blessing of the Nobel Committee .
