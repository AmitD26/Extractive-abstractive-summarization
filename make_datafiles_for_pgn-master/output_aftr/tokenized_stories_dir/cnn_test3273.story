The Heene family appeared on two episodes of ABC 's `` Wife Swap . ''

Richard and Mayumi Heene and their three sons were featured on the ABC show `` Wife Swap , '' in which the mothers of two often opposite families switch places for two weeks .

Mayumi Heene traded places with Karen Martel , whose husband runs a child-proofing business intended to keep children safe , according to a recap posted on Reality TV Magazine .

In listing information on the Heene family , ABC 's `` Wife Swap '' Web site described them this way : `` When the Heene family are n't chasing storms , they devote their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm . ''

According to the newscast , the family track 30 to 40 weather activities a year .

The family was invited back by ABC to appear on the 100th episode of `` Wife Swap , '' where Mayumi Heene switched places with Sheree Silver , a psychic .

A Los Angeles Times story documented the show by saying `` The Heene family , with its three rowdy boys , is anchored by father Richard , whose anger arrives in sudden bolts between his fringe science projects . ''

`` The Silvers , who have two quirky , artistically inclined sons , revolve around the mother , Sheree , who is a psychic and who initially fails to impress Richard . ` Sheree 's like a clogged drain , OK ? Things are n't happening , ' he barks . ` I 'll bet you the heaviest thing she lifts is the fork to her mouth . ' ''

`` It 's their spouses who struggle most , '' the Los Angeles Times story said . `` Richard 's wife , Mayumi , finding Sheree 's ` househusband , ' Sam Castiglia , to be ` a very feminine husband ' and finds it tough to even tolerate the quirks of the Silver children , who are so unlike her own , seeming less like a parent than a conspirator against the alien family . So much for learning . ''

A balloon that was set adrift from the Heenes ' Fort Collins , Colorado , home was empty when it landed , and authorities later found one of the Heene sons -- who initially had been thought to be in the balloon -- safe on the ground . Officials said he had been hiding in the attic of the family 's garage .
