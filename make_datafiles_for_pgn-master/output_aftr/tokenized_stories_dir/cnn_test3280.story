Derek Mears arrives on the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the new `` Friday the 13th '' movie .

Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new `` Friday the 13th '' movie .

A remake of the original 1980 film , the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake .

Mears is no stranger to the horror genre , having co-starred in `` The Hills Have Eyes II . '' His career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' films .

He recently spoke to CNN about taking a turn as the ultimate evil , the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he 's really not that bloody nice .

CNN : You are n't that scary in person , so what made you think you could be that scary on camera ?

No , I sound like a basket case . It 's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life . Not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask , but like right now I 'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character , and I will start to speak faster .

CNN : Tell me a little bit about how you were approached . Did you know they were making it before they came to you ? Was it kind of a shock ?

On the other end , on the producer 's end , they asked a bunch of different industry professionals . They said , `` Hey , were doing a new ` Friday the 13th . ' Who do you think would be a great new Jason ? '' And my name kept popping up , which I 'm blown away by .

They brought me in for an audition , and I met with them . and they called me the next day and went , `` OK , you 're the guy . '' And I still do n't believe it till this day . I 'm blown away .

Mears : Believe it or not , all the actors ... got along so well . I have never been so close to a cast before on set . We were just goofing around and playing , but then when it 's time to work and get serious with certain scenes , we 'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to .

I already knew all of the originals . I had them all on DVD , and when I first met with Platinum Dunes -LSB- the production company behind the new movie -RSB- , I told them , `` Hey look , I 'm a fan of the series first and foremost . If I 'm right for the part , fantastic . If I 'm not right for the part , that 's OK , too . I , just as a fan , want to see a good ` Friday the 13th ' film . I want to see the series continue so if I can help it , awesome , but I just want to see something good . ''

CNN : Did you try to model your character after previous Jasons , or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own ?

Mears : Definitely make it my own .

And there are times in the film here and there where I would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before .

CNN : It 's kind of a dream come true .

Mears : Yeah , that 's why I keep saying the words this whole interview like `` unbelievable , '' unbelievable because I do n't believe it .
