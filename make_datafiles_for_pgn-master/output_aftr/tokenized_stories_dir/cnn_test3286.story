ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Retired Army Spc. Scott Winkler had many scary encounters while serving in Iraq , but they were nothing compared with his recent experience at the world 's largest aquarium : swimming alongside a massive whale shark .

Ret . Army Spc. Scott Winkler , 35 , was paralyzed five years ago during an accident in Iraq .

The fact that Winkler , 35 , of Augusta , Georgia , is a paraplegic made the once-in-a-lifetime experience even more challenging .

A separate swim and dive program is open to the public , but the waiting list is nearly full until the end of the year .

Therapeutic recreational specialist Susan Oglesby helps train safety divers at the aquarium to assist swimmers with disabilities . She explained there are very few limitations in the tank . Watch more on veterans swimming with sharks ''

`` The water is the great equalizer . Once you get in , you 're floating , you 're weightless , and everybody becomes equal , '' Oglesby said .

Winkler was outfitted in a wet suit and snorkeling gear . He rolled his wheelchair down a long ramp to a dock floating in the 6.3 million-gallon tank of salt water .

In addition to four 23-foot-long whale sharks , Winkler gazed on a manta ray , hammerhead sharks , goliath grouper and sawfish .

He used his arms to move his body around the football-field-size tank .

Swimming next to him were two safety divers and Orlando Perez , another young veteran from Augusta .

`` It 's beautiful down there ! '' Perez exclaimed . `` It 's peaceful , and you just forget that you 're in a wheelchair . You 're one with the fish . ''

`` I never thought being disabled would bring me to do something so amazing , '' he said . `` I think it 's about overcoming the disability and not letting the disability overcome you . ''

Winkler had a big grin on his face as he talked about the benefits of taking part in the program .
