LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Volunteering with local law enforcement , Shaquille O'Neal has learned from his peers that domestic violence calls are among the most dangerous for police officers .

NBA star Shaquille O'Neal praises Karen Earl for her efforts on behalf of domestic abuse victims .

'' -LSB- It 's -RSB- a very disturbing thing , '' said the NBA star , who has dealt mainly with children 's cases . `` I do n't really think a lot of women know what to do . ''

That 's where Karen Earl comes in .

As executive director of the Jenesse Center , the oldest domestic violence intervention program in south central Los Angeles , California , Earl is a `` tireless and fearless '' champion of women and children living in abusive situations , O'Neal said .

For more than two decades , Earl has helped give victims a way out through the Jenesse Center , which provides shelter , education , outreach and legal services to more than 8,500 victims of domestic violence every year .

Earl has heard countless stories of domestic abuse and has seen a range of tipping points before victims seek help . She is working to lower these statistics .

These women were able to find shelter and support -- and ultimately safety and success -- through the Jenesse Center .

`` It is not normal to go to bed afraid , '' Earl said . `` And the thing that I know for sure is that there is help . ''

Today , Earl serves as Jenesse Center 's executive director and calls her work with staff , fundraising and volunteer recruitment `` a 24-hour thing . ''

Earl said this emergency period `` is a time of regrouping '' and lets the women know that they 're not alone and that they did n't do anything wrong .

`` Women and their children can stay for two years , '' Earl said . `` Every able body , every day , gets up and takes classes . And when they 're not taking classes , they 're looking for employment , going through counseling sessions or -LSB- getting -RSB- legal assistance . ''

For Earl , comprehensive care through a team approach is the key to the center 's success . She said she has seen women at the center earn graduate degrees and become `` full-fledge '' professionals -- and that changing lives is what keeps her going .
