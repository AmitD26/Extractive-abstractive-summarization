Faces of the Free Syrian Army

`` People are fleeing the city towards the countryside . I think they are sensing that a huge battle is about to take place , a decisive one , '' Kurdi said .

The confrontation could signal the fate of the President Bashar al-Assad and his government , which has been engulfed in an uprising that started peacefully in March 2011 but has transformed into an armed rebellion .

`` They are besieging our area , '' Abu Omar , a resident of the Salaheddin neighorhood , said . `` There is no electricity in some parts , and food is scarce . ''

Aleppo , in northern Syrian near Turkey , is the country 's commercial capital and a World Heritage site . The CIA World Factbook says it is the nation 's most populous city .

Maj. Gen. Robert Mood , the former head of the U.N. observer mission in Syria , told CNN `` it 's only a matter of time before this regime will fall '' and `` time is on the side of the rebels . ''

Syrian rebels appear more capable , yet still outgunned

`` It can take a lot of time or it can go quickly , it 's impossible to say . ... It is a cycle of violence . Sooner or later we will reach a climax with the fall of the regime , '' he told CNN .

The international activist group Avaaz , saying it has spoken to witnesses , also reported violence in Fardos .

The witnesses reported casualties in a `` blistering '' regime `` dawn attack '' in the district , in central Aleppo .

Regime forces in the Khaldieh district fired at protesters coming out of the Al-Ghafran mosque and shelled the Salaheddin district with missiles , automatic weapons and attack helicopters , the LCC said .

Syrian state TV said that `` special security authorities '' destroyed five pickup vehicles equipped with machine guns used by `` terrorists '' in the Aleppo countryside . The report said people in the vehicles were killed and injured .

Kurdi said rebels have had skirmishes with regime forces and destroyed several vehicles .

The world community urged al-Assad 's regime to stop its assault .

`` I urge the Syrian government to halt their offensive , '' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Friday in London . `` The violence from both sides must stop for the sake of the suffering civilians of Syria . ''

British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the `` utterly unacceptable escalation of the conflict could lead to a devastating loss of civilian life and a humanitarian disaster . ''

Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the developments in Aleppo `` really worrisome , '' saying the use of heavy weapons and air forces on such a civilian hub would constitute `` an international crime , clearly . ''

Iran , meanwhile , signaled its support for al-Assad 's government . Its energy minister , Majid Namjou , vowed his government `` will not leave Syria alone in such a difficult situation , '' according to a story by state-run Press TV .

The report said the two nations signed a deal Thursday to expand sharing of electricity and water , with Namjou saying Iranian firms are ready to rebuild damaged power plant facilities . Iran plans to export at least 250 million watts of electricity , and Iranian companies `` to produce and supply industrial equipment needed in the Arab country , '' according to the energy minister .

`` The U.S. and others are playing more of an advisory role to the opposition now , '' the official said .

Yet U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said Friday he 's not aware of any discussions about giving the opposition any `` lethal support . ''

They are gearing up for a fight .

Rebel commander Mustafa Abdullah , told CNN that rebels have set up medical clinics in Aleppo homes and have plans to transport and evacuate anyone who is wounded .

Abdullah , the rebel commander in Aleppo , recalled the merciless government bombardment of the city of Homs this year as he geared up for battle . Asked if these fighters had enough ammunition to withstand a government siege , Abdullah said simply `` no . '' He then added , `` It will be just like Homs '' and wept at the thought .

A Syrian parliamentarian from Aleppo has defected to Turkey , according to the opposition Syrian National Council . Ikhlas Badawi is the first member of the assembly elected in May to defect and the latest in a series of high-profile officials to cut ties with the regime . This follows defections by high-level Syrian diplomats to the United Arab Emirates , Cyprus and Iraq .

`` I call on all of my colleagues to join this revolution and defend their rights to stand up for the free across all of our society 's sects , '' he told reporters Friday in Antakya , Turkey . `` I also call on members of the Syrian army to honor their word and defend our country , not just one ruling family . ''

As fighting raged in recent days , aid agencies scaled back their efforts in Aleppo .

A spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross -- which said it is temporarily moving some aid workers out of Syria to Beirut for security reasons -- said the organization does n't have a presence in Aleppo at the moment . In addition , the Syrian Arab Red Crescent has had to suspend some of its activities .

Outside Aleppo , battles between regime forces and rebels raged . Heavy shelling rocked other cities , including Damascus , Daraa , Idlib and Homs , the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . Thirty people died in Daraa province , 23 in Damascus and its suburbs , 11 in Deir Ezzor province and 10 in Homs province , the LCC said .
