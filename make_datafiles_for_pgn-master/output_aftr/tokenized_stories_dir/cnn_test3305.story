Gov. Edward Rendell , who traveled to Haiti to accompany the orphans back to his state , said the 53 children from the Bresma Orphanage in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince were flown to Florida on an Air Force C-17 transport plane . The group was then transferred to another plane to fly to Pittsburgh International Airport , he said at a news conference at the airport .

Another child is to arrive in Pittsburgh late Tuesday or Wednesday , Rendell said . Ali McMutrie , a Pittsburgh-area woman who ran the orphanage with her sister , Jamie , said her sister will accompany the 54th orphan .

According to Rendell , adoption cases are under way for 47 of the children . Of these , 40 will be U.S. adoptions , four children will go to Spain and three to Canada . Adoptive parents will be sought for the remaining seven children .

The orphans almost stayed in Haiti .

Rep. Jason Altmire , D-Pennsylvania , who was traveling with the group , said it had been understood that all the children were cleared to leave . However , 14 of them had no papers because they were destroyed in the quake , and the U.S. Embassy said they could n't leave the country , Altmire said .

`` We were frantically calling the State Department , the White House and everyone else '' to get the clearance , he said .

Altmire said that despite their trauma , the children adjusted well to the flight .

`` They were polite and either slept or were quiet or just played among themselves , '' he said .

`` We will continue to grant , in special cases , humanitarian parole for orphans and medical evacuees , but our position is clear that people from Haiti attempting to enter the country illegally will be repatriated . ''

The children were taken by bus to Children 's Hospital of Pittsburgh .

In a separate statement , the State Department said Monday it is working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who are waiting to adopt Haitian children . Of those , 200 cases are being accelerated .

At least 24 of those children have left Haiti and have joined their adoptive families since the embassy expedited processing for immigrant visas , said Michele Bond , deputy assistant secretary for American citizen services .

Janet Napolitano , secretary of homeland security , can allow otherwise inadmissible people into the country for urgent humanitarian reasons or other emergencies .

Before the earthquake , Haiti was home to about 380,000 orphans , according to the most recent data from the United Nations Children 's Fund .

Rendell 's plane flew into Haiti on Monday with a shipment of medical aid and several doctors . It arrived after aid organizations had complained that their planes bound for Port-au-Prince had been delayed .

The agency Doctors Without Borders says several of its flights were delayed or diverted for long spells , including a plane carrying supplies for an inflatable hospital . That plane could not land in Port-au-Prince on Saturday and instead was rerouted to the neighboring Dominican Republic , it said . Another medical supply flight was diverted to the Dominican Republic on Sunday , causing a 24-hour delay in delivering aid that had to be transported by truck as a result , the group said .

The airport handled 180 flights Monday , none of which were delayed , Lt. Gen. P. K. Keen told CNN . One Doctors Without Borders flight was unable to land over the weekend , he said , because another aircraft 's departure was delayed . Instead of circling and burning fuel , the plane landed in the Dominican Republic , he said .

Keen added that planes turned back `` a number of times '' and `` quite a bit '' in the first few days after the quake . While the field manages more than 100 flights a day now , before the quake , it handled slightly more than a dozen a day , he said .
