-LRB- The Frisky -RRB- -- There 's no question that I find Don Draper sexy . If I lived in `` Mad Men '' land for a day , I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk . In real life ? Not so much . At least not anymore .

But that aloof , secretive , and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show 's viewers ? Not easy to live with .

But the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode . As with any TV show or movie , we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does , and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind `` Mad Men '' will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man .

In a business situation this comes across as professional , confident , and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly . In a real-life romantic relationship , the refusal or inability to `` turn it off '' can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved .

At the same time , being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful . When you 're in love , having that power only makes you feel even more special . The Frisky : 10 things women do n't understand about men

There are reasons why Draper 's wall is so high and impenetrable . Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him . There 's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior ! A man with secrets so big , he has to hide behind a wall all of the time .

They 're not threatening to his persona , but she is . These are , of course , just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life .

My ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade , for not letting anyone get too close , for acting like a jerk ; some he shared , some I figured out , but all made me want to stay with him . The Frisky : Could you get past hearing `` I do n't love you anymore ? ''

Similarly , Don Draper gives viewers plenty to love and root for , like his support of Peggy Olson , his disinterest in Pete Campbell 's brown-nosing , his delivery of that Kodak pitch in the first season , and the punch he landed on Jimmy Barrett 's jaw .

Like Tony Soprano before him , the behavior that would be massively unacceptable in real life is sometimes dwarfed by his acts of kindness , loyalty , and strength . The Frisky : When did you know it was over ?

That 's why I -LRB- and I think lots of other women -RRB- mostly love -- and sometimes hate -- Don Draper . This season -- which started August 16 -- I 'm sure we 'll see more cracks in Don Draper 's facade , and it should be compelling and exciting to watch . But in real life , with a real Don Draper , I could only do so much .
