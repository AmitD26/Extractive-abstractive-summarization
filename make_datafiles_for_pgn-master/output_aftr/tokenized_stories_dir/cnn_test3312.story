-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A tornado almost a mile wide tore through Mississippi on Saturday , killing at least 10 people and causing significant injuries and damage as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama .

Two of the dead were children and one was a 3-month-old baby , according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency -LRB- MEMA -RRB- spokesman Jeff Rent .

Five of the dead were from Choctaw County , in the north central part of of the state , four were from Yazoo County , north of Jackson , and one was from Holmes County , also in the north central Mississippi , he said .

Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour , who was in Yazoo City where his home is located , called the twister `` gigantic '' and said that `` in places -LSB- it -RSB- seemed to be to be several miles wide . ''

Some residents were trapped in badly damaged homes , he said .

His injuries : `` three little scratches . ''

Rob and Ashley Saxton were driving to a Yazoo City restaurant owned by Rob 's father -- planning to take shelter in the restaurant 's walk-in freezer ahead of the tornado -- when the twister blew out the car 's windows at a red light . The car was tossed across the intersection , then picked up again and flung into the restaurant .

`` When the windows exploded it was n't like anything I 've ever experienced , '' Rob Saxton said . `` It was amazing . It scared us plumb to death . ''

In all , 12 counties were reporting injuries , with some of the injured airlifted to a Level 1 trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson , said Jeff Rent , a MEMA spokesman .

Many tornado victims were seeking attention at King 's Daughters hospital in Yazoo City , where only one doctor was on duty Saturday night , said Jess Silvino , a nurse there .

The hospital is expecting `` another one or two waves of victims '' as crews are able to fully access the tornado 's path , said Richard Summers , chairman of emergency medicine at the medical center .

The state 's emergency management officials have set up a command post near U.S. 49 in Yazoo City and the state has activated a 25-person rapid response team from Hattiesburg that is capable of search and rescue operations .

The governor said he is activating local members of the National Guard in Yazoo City to maintain order .

Barbour said that he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but that he plans to do so on Monday .

`` FEMA is in contact and coordination with our state and local partners and stand ready to help if a request is made , '' said Brad Carroll , a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agancy .

Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide , said Mark McAllister , a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson .

In Yazoo City , Fire Chief Roy Wilson said that between 20 to 30 houses were destroyed , and said some people were trapped inside structures . Wilson said he did n't yet have confirmed numbers on injuries .

`` It 's in pretty bad shape so far , '' he said of the city .

`` By God 's grace -LSB- the tornado -RSB- did not go into the most central part of the city , the most populous . However , it went through the southern edge and eastern edge of town in a number of large neighborhoods , '' he said . `` A number of businesses have been destroyed and others severely damaged -- there are churches that have been obliterated . ''

The sheriff 's department in nearby Hinds County is sending two dozen deputies and 100 inmates to assist with the response in Yazoo County and to clear debris , MEMA said .

Parts of three highways were closed due to downed trees and other damage : State Highway 3 in Yazoo County and State Highways 14 and 17 in Holmes County , according to the the Mississippi Department of Transportation .

Linda Green , a dispatcher with the Issaquena County Sheriff 's Department , said there was minimal damage in the area around Valley Park , and a few power lines were down .

No injuries have been reported in Valley Park after the twister ripped through around 11:30 a.m. -LRB- 12:30 p.m. ET -RRB- , she added .
