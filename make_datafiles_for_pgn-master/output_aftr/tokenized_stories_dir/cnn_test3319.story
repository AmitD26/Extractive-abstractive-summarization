-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New Zealand scored a last-gasp equalizer to deny Slovakia a victorious World Cup debut in South Africa on Tuesday .

A 50th-minute goal from striker Robert Vittek in Rustenburg had seemed set to settle a clash between two of the tournament 's smaller nations -- Slovakia has a population of around 5.4 million ; New Zealand has about 4.3 million people .

But a stubborn New Zealand side , returning to soccer 's biggest stage for the first time since their debut in 1982 , hit back in the third minute of time added on to secure the nation 's first-ever point from their fourth World Cup finals game .

Defender Winston Reid , who had been beaten in the air by Vittek for the opening goal , ghosted in behind the Slovakian defense to glance a header from Shane Smeltz 's cross into the net off the base of the post .

`` It is just a nightmare . We could have had three points , and at the end it felt like we have lost the match , '' Smittek told AFP .

`` We are very , very proud . You would have to say this is our best-ever result , '' he told AFP .

`` We have come and thrown some extremely good punches and got what I thought was a fully deserved result . ''

The Kiwis , known as the `` All Whites , '' mixed battling defense with some shaky moments at the back as goalkeeper Mark Paston was lucky to escape after a complete miskick and some ineffectual attempts to clear crosses .

And it was the aerial route that provided Slovakia 's breakthrough five minutes after halftime as Vittek managed to evade Reid and head home a cross by Stanislav Sestak .

Reid made a goal-saving challenge on Vittek in the 69th minute , and Slovakia 's failure to capitalize on their possession gave New Zealand the chance to mount a late assault .

New Zealand next play Italy in Nelspruit on Sunday , when Slovakia face Paraguay at Ellis Park in Johannesburg .
