Rodolfo Godinez was the first person to stand trial in connection with the Newark murders . He got a 20-year sentence in addition to the life sentences .

The lone-survivor of the attack , Natasha Aeriel , spoke last , according to Romesh Sukhdeo , assistant county prosecutor .

`` She spoke today , and clearly at this point she was angry ... she said some harsh words toward the defendant but that 's to be expected since her brother and two best friends were killed , '' Sukhdeo said .

A jury convicted Godinez , 26 , on all 17 counts including murder , felony murder , attempted murder and robbery after just four hours of deliberations , according to Sukhdeo .

Aeriel 's sister , Natasha , was also shot in the head , but survived the attack and later testified as the prosecution 's main witness , according to Sukhdeo .

`` These kids were n't into drugs , they were minding their own business and these guys came up to them , robbed them , sexually assaulted one woman and then executed them , '' Sukhdeo said .

Godinez maintains his innocence , but admitted to be a member of the MS-13 gang and present at the school on the night of the triple homicides . However , he said he did n't participate in the crimes , according to his attorney Roy Greenman , who said he is planning to file an appeal .

Ballistic evidence , information from Aerial and a fingerprint lifted from a beer bottle at the scene led to the major break in the case that outraged the city .

By the time the attacks took place , the city had already recorded 60 killings that year .

`` Community organizations got together and through local foundations were able to raise money ... and that has enhanced our ability to create public safety in this city in a big way , '' said Garry McCarthy , Newark police director .
