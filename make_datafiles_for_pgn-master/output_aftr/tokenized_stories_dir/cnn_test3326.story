-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of family members , friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester , Connecticut , on Saturday to share tears and memories .

The four men who were laid to rest had each worked at Hartford Distributors for around 30 years before Omar Thornton 's shooting spree Tuesday , which ended when he took his own life .

`` We 're a pretty tight neighborhood , '' said Mary Bey of South Windsor , at the funeral of Craig Pepin , 60 , who she described as a `` wonderful neighbor and friend and coach and referee . ''

`` We 're very happy he made it through , '' she said of Steven Hollander , a neighbor who was treated and released from Hartford Hospital .

`` We 've just had an outpouring of support , '' James ' daughter told WTNH . `` And it just felt good to hear the stories and just to see the amount of people that came to see my dad . ''

Connecticut Gov. M. Jodi Rell has called for Monday to be a day of remembrance for the victims , asking state residents to observe a moment of silence at 9:15 a.m.

On Friday , police arrested a woman they said had accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by Thornton .
