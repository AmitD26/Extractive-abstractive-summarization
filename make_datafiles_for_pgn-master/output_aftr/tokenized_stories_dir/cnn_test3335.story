Dustin Johnson should have joined Kaymer and fellow American Watson in the playoff but was controversially penalized two-shots for an infringement on the final hole in regulation play .

Watson initially made the running in the playoff as he made a birdie at the first extra hole , but Kaymer hit back with a birdie of his own on the next .

Kaymer was also in trouble , but made a two-foot bogey putt to clinch victory after a dramatic final day in Wisconsin .

`` I hope it is one of many majors I win in my career . It 's spectacular , '' the 25-year-old told gathered reporters .

Long recognized as a star of the future , Kaymer becomes the second German after Bernhard Langer to win a golfing major .

He is also the third first-time major winner this season after U.S. Open winner Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland and British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa .

It means Tiger Woods remains as world number one , but he finished well off the pace after a fine round one-over 73 , still searching for the first win of his truncated season .

Northern Ireland 's Rory McIlroy and another American Zach Johnson shared third , both having their chances to claim victory , but missing the playoff by one shot .

Overnight leader Nick Watney lost his three shot lead on the first hole and carded a sorry nine-under 81 to slip into a tie for 17th .

But it was hard not to feel sorry for Johnson , who had blown a three-shot final round lead at the U.S. Open in search of his first major title .

`` It never crossed my mind I was in a sandtrap , '' said Johnson . `` That was one situation where I should have looked at the rule sheet a little harder . ''

Johnson finished in a tie for fifth with compatriot Jason Dufner and Australian Steve Elkington .

China 's Liang Wen-chong , who set the course record with a 64 on Saturday , shot a final round one-over 73 and finished in a tie for eighth .
