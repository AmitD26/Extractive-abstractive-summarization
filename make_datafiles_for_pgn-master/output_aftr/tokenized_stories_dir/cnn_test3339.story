Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law , it was clear he would face an uphill battle defending the law and communicating its benefits to the American public .

In the months leading to passage , we heard cries of rationing , death panels and blatant mischaracterization of what is in the bill .

In a recent national survey conducted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners , only 14 percent of respondents correctly identified September as the starting month for the law 's first set of patient protections . Less than half understood that health reform would allow for them to receive preventive care services without having to pay anything . Even fewer could specifically identify other important provisions that started on or after September 23 , 2010 .

The confusion and apathy surrounding the health care reform law leaves ample opportunity for others to mischaracterize and foster doubt , energizing and exciting the repeal platform . The unwavering confidence of dissenters is stronger than a mere promise of good .

To override a presidential veto would require a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate . But even according to the GOP 's most optimistic forecasts , Republicans can not expect to achieve a supermajority in both chambers in November .

But more importantly , a repeal of health care reform , followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes , is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall , with no net to catch them . As a physician , I see the consequences of uninsurance and a broken health care system every day .

Frustrated patients , crowded emergency rooms and burdensome insurance requirements are driving good physicians into other professions and making patients feel hopeless . Our system was not working , and we can not afford to quietly stand by while one in seven lack access to basic care and one in six people live in poverty .

It would be unfortunate if our country kept listening to ideological shouting and failed to understand the value of the important provisions in the law .

Together this all adds up to more patient protections than we have ever had , and this is just the beginning . Keep in mind that some of these provisions will not technically kick in until your health plan starts the new plan year , which usually happens in January . But do not wait until then to get your information ; search your plan 's website and talk to your employer 's human resource department or benefits manager .

The real verdict on health reform will likely come in 2014 when an expected 32 million people will be added to insurance exchanges , state Medicaid programs and other private insurance plans . The pathway from here to there is long and filled with many speed bumps , but information , transparency and advocacy are our best friends .

As medical providers , we must not compromise our responsibility to first do no harm . We should begin by asking our patients what they do and do n't understand and by helping them navigate these uncharted waters together .

As Americans we need to send a strong signal to Republican and Democratic leaders that repeal and replace is not an option .
