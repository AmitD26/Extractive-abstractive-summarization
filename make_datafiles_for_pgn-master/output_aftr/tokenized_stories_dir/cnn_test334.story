Magistrate William Turnoff agreed with the government 's case for extraditing Noriega to France and issued a `` certificate of extradability . ''

The issue has emerged because Noriega is scheduled to complete his Florida prison term on September 9 .

His attorneys had argued that his status as a prisoner of war meant he should be returned to Panama , but a separate court ruling last Friday rejected that argument .

`` This court never intended for the proclamation of defendant as a POW to shield him from all future prosecutions for serious crimes he is alleged to have committed , '' Senior U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler wrote in Friday 's 12-page opinion . `` It appears that the extradition proceedings should proceed uninterrupted . ''

Hoeveler noted that Noriega `` has not always sought repatriation , '' and had , at one time , asked to be allowed to go to a third country .

Noriega also faces possible prison time in Panama , where he is accused of kidnapping , extortion and the murder of political opponents .

Though the charges are more serious , if the 69-year-old Noriega is convicted of murder , he would likely serve much of his sentence under home detention in Panama .

Panamanian law provides home detention for anyone 74 years old or older .

The Panamanian constitution would also forbid his extradition to France .
