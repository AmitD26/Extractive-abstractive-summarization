The U.S. Embassy said that a cargo aircraft carrying 530 rolls of heavy-duty waterproof and fire-resistant plastic sheeting for use as temporary shelters was sent by the United States to Karachi , Pakistan , on Monday , a day after another flight ferried 240 rolls of plastic sheeting to Karachi .

`` Our experience has shown that plastic sheeting is urgently needed for temporary shelters , and we know it is urgently needed in Sindh as the flood waters continue to move south , '' Ambassador Anne Patterson said in a written statement . `` It will be supplied along with locally purchased materials that can be easily moved when people are able to return home . ''

The embassy said the sheeting material will provide dry shelter for 46,800 people in Sindh province . It was going to a logistics hub in Sindh for distribution by local and international organizations .

John Holmes , the emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations , acknowledged Monday that the international community is just beginning to recognize the massive need in the flood-ravaged country .

He noted that while the need is beginning to be recognized , `` unfortunately , the need is still rising because the floods are still rising in some parts of the country . ''

Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Saturday that as many as 20 million of his countrymen have been affected by the flooding . The Pakistan Humanitarian Forum put the number at 14 million on Monday .

The death toll from the flooding that 's raged more than a fortnight is up to 1,463 , and more than 2,000 people have been injured , the National Disaster Management Authority said Sunday .

With about one-fifth of the country underwater , almost 900,000 homes have been damaged , the agency said .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that while he has visited sites of natural disasters around the world , he has never seen anything like the devastation created by flooding in Pakistan . He said the disaster is worse than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Pakistani earthquake combined .

Up to 3.5 million children are at high risk of deadly waterborne diseases including watery diarrhea and dysentery , which cause dehydration , said Maurizio Giuliano of the humanitarian affairs office .

Clean water is an urgent need , but UNICEF can not reach all those in need due to a serious lack of funds , Giuliano said . Medication is a priority , but funding shortages hamper the work of the World Health Organization even though plans are in place . Lack of proper food increases vulnerability , the United Nations said .

President Zardari said his nation needs more international help to deal with the immediate recovery efforts as well as longer-term reconstruction and infrastructure development , according to spokesman Farhatullah Babar .

According to ReliefWeb.int , more than two dozen countries , organizations and individuals have pledged about $ 305 million .

Ban and Zardari have made a public plea to the international community to increase aid .
