-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in Wisconsin due to the failure of a 120-year-old sand levee along the Wisconsin River .

Patrick Beghin , a representative of the Columbia County Emergency Operations Center , confirmed to CNN Monday that the levee had in fact failed .

`` Once the levee completely fails ... it is unknown how far south the flood waters of the Wisconsin River will travel , '' the Weather Service said Sunday night .

Portage Mayor Ken Jahn later told CNN that while the levee had n't completely broken yet , it had deteriorated . Local prison inmates were being used to help with sandbagging , he said .

The levee is located on the south side of the Wisconsin River , just south of Portage . The weather agency urged residents to move to higher ground . Roadways , including parts of Interstate 39 , could close .

Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week .

`` Anyone in there right now wo n't be able to come out , '' she said .

A Red Cross shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents .

The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday , Beghin said . Portage wo n't be considered to be out of danger until the river has dropped below flood levels , he added .

Forecasts suggest the river at Portage will undergo a second peak in height on Tuesday morning , adding more pressure to the compromised levee .

The levee 's failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota . Portage itself , however , did not receive any of the heavy rain .

CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there 's no immediate end in sight to the flooding .

`` Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they 're still in flood , so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days , '' Jeras said . `` Many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the Mississippi River which then in turn will rise up and we 'll see some flooding there , maybe in La Crosse and the Winona areas later in the week . ''

CNN 's Don Lemon and Rob Marciano contributed to this report .
