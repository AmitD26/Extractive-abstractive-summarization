Son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo , the younger Cuomo squared off against Paladino , a businessman and developer , after the Tea Party-endorsed candidate scored an upset victory over former Rep. Rick Lazio earlier in the GOP primary . Cuomo added to Democratic wins in New Hampshire , Maryland and Arkansas , according to the projections .

But governorships in Kansas , Oklahoma , Tennessee , New Mexico , Pennsylvania , Wyoming , Michigan , Wisconsin , Ohio and Iowa all have gone from Democrat to GOP , according to CNN analysis of exit poll data .

Republicans , however , lost Rhode Island . But Democrats did n't win it either . That 's because Independent Lincoln Chafee , a former Republican , was projected by CNN to defeat Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio for the governorship , which had been vacated by Republican Gov. Don Carcieri because of term limits .

Chafee becomes Rhode Island 's first governor since 1857 who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat .

Often overshadowed during midterm campaigns , governorships can impact national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates .

Republicans needed a net gain of only three governorships Tuesday for a majority nationally . If the eight-state pickup margin holds , the GOP will have gained a national gubernatorial majority plus five .

Tennessee became the first Republican pickup Tuesday evening , when Knoxville Mayor Bill Haslam edged past Democrat Mike McWherter .

Haslam will succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen , who was precluded from running again by term limits .

In Michigan , Republican Rick Snyder defeated Democratic Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero in Michigan .

In Pennsylvania , CNN projected Tom Corbett , who had an 8-percentage-point lead with 84 percent of precincts reporting , as the winner over Democrat Dan Onorato .

In Wyoming , Republican Matt Mead was the projected winner over Leslie Petersen .

And in New Mexico , also a contest between female candidates , Martinez defeated Diane Denish in a race to replace Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson .

Addressing her cheering supporters Tuesday night , Martinez hit repeatedly on one theme : `` You were the ones telling me how desperately we needed to move New Mexico in a new direction , '' she said . `` At the end of the day , New Mexico chose a new direction . ''

In South Carolina , Haley became the state 's first female governor by defeating Democratic opponent Vincent Sheheen in a tightly contested race .

Haley , a 38-year-old state representative , is supported by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Tea Party activists , and has promised to tackle unemployment and excess government spending by way of a 10-year plan .

During a bitter campaign run-up , Sheheen hammered Haley on reports of late tax payments while campaigning on the scandal surrounding the former governor .

The governor 's race in South Carolina had earned a prominent stage among a series of high-profile gubernatorial elections that some analysts speculate could be a bellwether for future presidential politics .

Nevada , Arizona , Alaska , Georgia , Idaho , Utah , Texas , Nebraska , South Dakota , Alabama and South Carolina returned Republicans to their governor 's mansions ; Colorado , Arkansas , New Hampshire , New York , Massachusetts and Maryland did likewise for Democrats .

In Texas , incumbent Gov. Rick Perry defeated Democrat Bill White , and Democratic incumbents held on to governorships in Arkansas and New Hampshire , based on projections .

Deal narrowly defeated Tea Party favorite and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel for the state 's Republican nomination .

The national spotlight turned on the Georgia race when national GOP heavyweights Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney endorsed Handel , while Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich backed Deal .

According to Vermont law , if no gubernatorial candidate wins a majority of the vote on Election Day , the responsibility of electing the governor falls to the state legislature , with each state senator and representative casting one vote .

In Nevada , Republican Brian Sandoval , who had beaten scandal-plagued incumbent Gov. Jim Gibbons in the primary , defeated Democrat Rory Reid .

In Arizona , incumbent Republican Gov. Jan Brewer defeated Democrat Terry Goddard .

In Alaska , Palin 's successor as governor , former Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell , beat Democrat Ethan Berkowitz , a former state representative .
