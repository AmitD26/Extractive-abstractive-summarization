But when volunteers get kids past the upside-down coyote hanging from the ceiling and the owl with an elephant trunk , they shape young minds with after-school tutoring , writing workshops and books written by kids .

`` I think the kids are tricked in and then , as they are talking to the person at the front desk , they are learning about what 's going on in the tutoring center , '' said Gerald Richards , the chief executive of 826 National , the nonprofit network of tutoring centers that look nothing like classrooms . The Washington `` museum , '' which set up shop in the Columbia Heights neighborhood in October , was the latest branch to open .

Each of the eight centers has an imaginative storefront that helps raise money and encourage creativity among students .

In Ann Arbor , Michigan , Liberty Street Robot Supply & Repair sells robot emotion upgrades , fruit powered clocks and robodentures .

Early on , organizers at 826 Valencia St. learned the space they 'd rented was zoned for retail , so they needed to come up with something to sell . The space looked a bit like an old pirate ship .

`` Someone thought , ` Why do n't we sell pirate gear and see what happens ? ' '' Richards said .

And the imagination enticements work . 826 National is on track to serve 24,000 students this year through its tutoring centers and school outreach programs .

Writing is the primary focus at 826 centers , which also work with middle school and high school students .

It also publishes books written by students . Their latest , `` I Live Real Close to Where You Used to Live , '' is a collection of student letters to First Lady Michelle Obama . It will be in bookstores on December 15 .

The letters run the gamut from asking if Obama cooks with an Easy-Bake Oven at the White House , to a suggestion that she use robots to keep drugs off the streets . The book is a companion to one that came out last year that contains letters to President Barack Obama , `` Thanks and Have Fun Running the Country . ''

Kathleen Yancey , an English professor at Florida State University , said the 826 National centers complement the learning that goes on in classrooms . Schools are about college and job readiness , and tests that prove it , Yancey said . Those demands do n't leave much time for playful reading or imaginative writing , even if it could help some students learn .

`` If you want people to engage in activity , you find a way for them to have fun with it . 826 is a genius at that , '' said Yancey , a past president of the National Council of Teachers of English . `` If -LSB- students -RSB- do n't take any pleasure in it , they wo n't actually practice it . When they have fun , they wo n't quit on you . ''

`` It 's OK to be strange , '' said Richards , the 826 leader . `` It 's OK to be magical , it 's OK to be whimsical . ''
