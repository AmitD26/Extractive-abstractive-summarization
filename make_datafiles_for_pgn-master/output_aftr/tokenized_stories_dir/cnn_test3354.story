-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Liverpool director Tom Hicks Jr has resigned from his position with the club and their parent company Kop Holdings in the wake of a foul-mouthed e-mail rant at a fan .

The American , son of co-owner Tom Hicks , became embroiled in controversy when it emerged he had responded abusively when one supporter contacted him directly about the state of the Premier League club and their finances .

Hicks Jr subsequently apologized but he has now quit the club .

However , with his father as co-owner it appeared there would be little pressure from the top to do so .

Hicks Jr was seen as a key player on Anfield 's board -- comprised of Hicks and his father , Gillett and his son Foster and managing director Christian Purslow .

One of Purslow 's priorities since taking over from Rick Parry in June last year has been to find new investment in the club as they seek to get the funding in place to build a new stadium .

Hicks Jr had no real input into decision-making at the club on a daily basis and so his departure will not affect on-going plans .
