The in-form Rooney , who had scored 22 goals in all competitions this season prior to the match -- including four against Hull City last weekend -- achieved the milestone with United 's second goal , a brilliant finish following a devastating counter-attack .

United , who won by the same scoreline at the Emirates in last year 's Champions League semifinal , needed a victory to keep pace with Chelsea at the top of the table -- and they took a 33rd-minute lead with a moment of skill from Portuguese winger Nani .

And United doubled their lead four minutes later when Nani out-stripped the Arsenal defence on the break and Rooney -- who had started the move -- ran half the length of the pitch to be on hand in support to fire past Almunia .

Arsenal continued to press forward looking for a way back into the match , but once again they were caught on the break as this time Korean Ji-Sung Park burst through a huge gap in the home defence to slide home the decisive third goal early in the second half .

United had chances to increase their advantage with both Rooney and Nani close to adding a fouth , but it was Arsenal who claimed a late consolation when Thomas Vermaelen 's shot found the net after taking a deflection off Jonny Evans .

The result means United remain a point behind Chelsea at the top of the table , although the London side have a game in hand -- at Hull on Tuesday .

Arsenal are now five points behind Chelsea in third place having played a game more and , if Chelsea win in midweek , that gap will increase to eight points ahead of the two sides meeting at Stamford Bridge next Sunday .

It proved a good day for Manchester as United 's rivals City maintained their push for a Champions League place with a comfortable 2-0 home win over crisis-club Portsmouth .

And City made the points safe on the stroke of half-time when Vincent Kompany powered a header past goalkeeper David James from Martin Petrov 's corner .
