As well as the significance of a World Cup semifinal , the match also marked the last apperance on home soil for legendary Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan .

The 38-year-old , who is the most successful Test and one-day bowler in cricket history , went out in style , taking his 534th one-day wicket off his very last ball .
