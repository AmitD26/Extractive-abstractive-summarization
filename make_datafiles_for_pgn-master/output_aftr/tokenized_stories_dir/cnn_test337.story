NBC News first reported on the contents on Tuesday . A congressional source verified the document 's legitimacy to CNN .

Details surfaced just days before the confirmation hearing for John Brennan , who has been nominated to head the CIA .

Brennan has served as President Barack Obama 's top counterterrorism adviser and is considered to be behind the administration 's dramatic rise in the use of targeted killings against suspected terror suspects .

- `` Where an informed , high-level official of the U.S. government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States . ''

- `` Where a capture operation would be infeasible -- and where those conducting the operation continue to monitor whether capture becomes feasible . ''

But the document also said the government is not required `` to have clear evidence '' that an attack against the United States will occur in the immediate future to determine that an imminent threat is posed by a U.S. citizen .

The Supreme Court has held that the military may constitutionally use force against an American who is a part of enemy forces .

The document dismissed arguments by commentators that the war against al Qaeda can not extend outside of Afghanistan .

The American Civil Liberties Union called the Justice Department document `` profoundly disturbing . ''

Hina Shamsi , the director of the ACLU 's National Security Project , said , `` It summarizes in cold legal terms a stunning overreach of executive authority , the claimed power to declare Americans a threat and kill them far from a recognized battlefield and without any judicial involvement before or after the fact . ''

Shamsi called on the Obama administration to release the 50-page legal memo on which the white paper is based .

A group of senators also called for the administration to release its legal opinions on presidential authority .

`` It is vitally important , however , for the Congress and the American public to have a full understanding of how the executive branch interprets the limits and boundaries of this authority so that Congress and the public can decide whether this authority has been properly defined and whether the president 's power to deliberately kill American citizens is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards , '' according to a letter the lawmakers sent to Obama on Monday .

Dianne Feinstein of California said in a statement that the Justice Department memo and other information has permitted the Intelligence Committee to conduct `` appropriate and probing '' oversight into the use of lethal force .

`` That oversight is ongoing , and the committee continues to seek the actual legal opinions by the Department of Justice that provide details not outlined in this particular white paper , ''

Feinstein said .
