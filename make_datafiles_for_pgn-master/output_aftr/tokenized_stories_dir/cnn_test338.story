Almost 80 years after its introduction , a few hundred DC-3s are estimated to still be flying worldwide . That 's kind of unbelievable in an age when dozens of younger types of airliners have already retired to aviation boneyards .

`` When we take them to air shows I watch people gravitate toward -LRB- them -RRB- , '' says Joe McBryan , co-star of History Channel 's `` Ice Pilots . '' McBryan owns Canada 's Buffalo Airways and its six operating DC-3s . `` People always have a story . They say their dad or grand-dad flew one ... or they flew on one when they were young . ''

The DC-3 debuted in the mid-1930s as an aviation rock star . With its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionized the travel industry by cutting typical coast-to-coast flight time across the United States from 25 hours to just 18 . Although it typically seated only about 21 passengers , the plane allowed airlines to make a giant leap toward profitability .

Pilots will tell you the DC-3 wo n't quit because it was so well-built . Some say its design and rugged landing gear helped it touch down safely on short runways .

But for McBryan -- age 70 and still flying almost daily -- it 's about love .

`` You can choose your friends and coworkers but you ca n't choose the one you love . An airplane is the same . And in 1969 , the DC-3 came and it stayed with me , '' McBryan says .

McBryan 's son once said the engines sound like a `` funeral procession for the Hell 's Angels . ''

On the flight deck , for McBryan , it 's all about the plane 's feel . These classic aircraft are controlled with a yoke connected directly by cables to the tail and wings . No fancy fly-by-wire electronics like newer airliners . No flashy heads-up displays for speed or altitude , either . An old fashioned instrument panel works just fine , thank you very much .

007 flies the Gooney Bird

In 2008 , a Gooney Bird helped James Bond get out of a jam .

Fans of the Bond film `` Quantum of Solace , '' may recall actor Daniel Craig in the cockpit of a beat-up DC-3 .

Does it ? Oh yeah . And then some .

After takeoff , a super-fast jet fires on the Gooney Bird , forcing Bond to use the DC-3 's slow speed to outwit the jet pilot . The jet winds up as a stain on a rocky mountainside . Chalk up a win for low and slow .

Back in the 1980s , a DC-3 served another movie franchise hero . In `` Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , '' Indy flies from New York to Newfoundland to the Azores and Europe on his quest for the Holy Grail .

Taildraggers

Getting on board a DC-3 is an uphill climb . Literally . The plane 's tail sits on the ground when it 's not flying , forcing passengers to walk up a steeply inclined aisle to take their seats .

`` One of the most common comments I hear when some passengers come on board is , ` Wow , there 's really an angle here , ' '' says Ric Hallquist , a longtime pilot for Missionary Flights International .

The Gooney Bird 's rugged landing gear with its big struts can handle rough runways in places like Haiti or the Dominican Republic , Hallquist says . `` And the air frame is just so strong , it really is . ''

`` You just have to respect it , not abuse it , '' says Bolling . `` I kind of feel like I 'm going back in time to the 1940s or '50s . flying these airplanes around . ''

`` They keep making parts , so there wo n't be a shortage , '' says this son of a prospector . If anything stands in its way , McBryan says it will be a shortage of leaded fuel that his DC-3 's engines burn . The environmentally hazardous leaded fuel is being phased out .

But losing the DC-3 would be a shame , McBryan says . There 's simply nothing else like it . The plane is about as near humans will get to growing wings .

`` Strap a DC-3 to your a ** and let the wings extend out , '' he jokes . `` That 's the closest thing you will come to a human flying . ''
