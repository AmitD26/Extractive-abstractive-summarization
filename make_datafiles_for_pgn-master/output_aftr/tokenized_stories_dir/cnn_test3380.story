-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has backed Red Bull 's world champion Sebastian Vettel to match the achievements of fellow German driver Michael Schumacher .

Ecclestone , 80 , said the competition faced by Vettel is much tougher than when Schumacher -- who now races for Mercedes -- was so dominant for Ferrari .

Red Bull claimed the constructors ' title in 2010 to complete a clean-sweep of the sport 's top honors , and the British-based Austrian marque have been equally successful in 2011 with Vettel winning six of the season 's opening eight races .

Far from making the sport less appealing , Ecclestone is confident that Vettel 's current supremacy increases fans ' interest in the elite division of motorsport .

`` Sebastian is in a similar position as Michael . Sebastian is the best right now and that 's why he is dominating , and that 's what makes it so interesting for the fans , '' Ecclestone said .

`` Every race weekend starts with a big question mark -- who will be able to beat Vettel ? That 's why fans tune in . ''

Vettel , who also became Formula One 's youngest champion with his 2010 success , extended his contract with Red Bull until 2014 in March this year , but had previously been linked with a switch to Italian outfit Ferrari .

Vettel , who started his career at Sauber in 2006 before joining Toro Rosso in July 2007 , said he admired the proud history of teams like Ferrari and Mercedes , but he insisted he was happy with Red Bull .

The 2011 season continues with the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on July 10 , a race won last year by Vettel 's Red Bull teammate Mark Webber .
