Mexico City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five gang members have confessed to involvement in last week 's torching of a casino in Monterrey in which 52 people were killed , Nuevo Leon Gov. Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz told reporters Monday .

The State Agency of Investigations identified the suspects as Luis Carlos Carrazco Espinosa , 25 ; Javier Alonso Martinez Morales , alias `` el Javo , '' 37 , from Monterrey ; Jonathan Jahir Reyna Gutierrez , 18 ; Juan Angel Leal Flores , 20 ; and Julio Tadeo Berrones , 28 , alias `` El Julio Rayas . ''

The five have been arrested and `` have confessed , and we have scientific proof that these people participated , '' Medina de la Cruz said .

The attorney general 's office said evidence points to involvement by all five men , `` some as intellectual authors , others as accomplices and lookouts , others as material authors , others as drivers . ''

`` Presumably , there was a disagreement and this crime was perpetrated as a reprisal , '' Medina de la Cruz said .

`` They may not have counted on killing 52 human beings , '' he said .

The governor presented a video that he said showed two vehicles that participated in the attack , with people putting gasoline in tanks later used at the casino .

Mexico 's Attorney General 's Office had offered a 30-million peso -LRB- $ 2.4 million -RRB- reward for information leading to the capture of the men they suspect were behind Thursday afternoon 's attack in the affluent city .

On Saturday , 300 soldiers from the Mexican Army and Air Force boarded planes in the nation 's capital , bound for Monterrey as part of President Felipe Calderon 's plan to help local authorities fight drug trafficking and organized crime , Mexico 's defense department said .

Two mayors were assassinated in 2010 . Last month , four civilians were wounded when two grenades were thrown at a prison in Apodaca .

Monterrey , the state 's capital , is a key industrial hub and Mexico 's wealthiest city .

Since 2008 , the government has stepped up the military 's presence in Nuevo Leon as it tries to crack down on crime . It sent more troops to the state last November .

More than 34,600 people have died since Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006 , according to government statistics . Other reports have listed higher tolls . The latest Mexican government tally was released in January .
