-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His was a suicide with a macabre twist . In February , former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest , but not before leaving behind a note requesting that his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players .

Scientists announced Monday that Duerson 's brain tissue showed `` moderately advanced '' evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma .

`` Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease , '' said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA medical center , and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy . `` He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment , inhibition , impulse control , mood and memory . ''

CTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the Boston University center . Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both . The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that that trauma could be causing brain damage .

Mike Webster , an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers and also diagnosed posthumously with CTE , was 50 when he died . John Grimsley , a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers was 45 , and Duerson was 50 . Scientists at BU have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18 .

Alicia Duerson said that several years before he died , her husband had been extremely bright , articulate , gifted . But as time wore on , he began to lose those faculties . Duerson began to have trouble forming coherent sentences and spelling . Alongside cognitive and emotional problems , a business that he established after his NFL career began failing .

The tragic culmination of his problems was his suicide on February 17 .

`` We do seem to be seeing an increased rate in athletes who have early and moderate stage CTE , '' said McKee , adding the caveat that the BU sample is autopsy-based and therefore inherently biased .

Duerson 's death , and specifically the decision to shoot himself in the chest , apparently to avoid damaging his brain tissue , shocked members of his family and the football community . Duerson 's case is the first in the CTE narrative in which a player ostensibly took his own life to have his brain studied .

`` It 's important for people to understand that it does not help our research or our mission of the CSTE to take their own lives because they fear they have this disease , '' said Stern . `` The future will lead to successful treatment of this disease . ''
