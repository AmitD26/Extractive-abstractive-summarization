-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly four months after a P-51 Mustang veered out of control and slammed into spectators at the Reno , Nevada , air races -- killing 11 people , injuring scores of others and jeopardizing the future of the event -- race organizers Wednesday said the show will go on .

The head of the Reno Air Racing Association said the association will seek permits for the full schedule of races to take place September 12-16 and is confident that it will get them . If not , he said , organizers will stage a one-time-only memorial event to commemorate those killed and injured last year , and will bring an end to the 49-year-old tradition .

It was unclear how close spectators would be allowed and whether that would include areas in which they were killed or hurt in the September crash .

The September 15 , 2011 , crash came when noted pilot James Leeward 's Mustang flew off course , pitching upward briefly before flying into a spectator area . Leeward and 10 spectators died , and about 60 people were injured .

The NTSB is investigating the cause of the crash and is examining video that shows a piece of trim tab , an aerodynamic surface on the tail of the plane , separating from the plane at the time the pilot lost control .

Houghton said the race sponsors , vendors and pilots he has met have `` universally '' expressed support for continuing the races , and that fan support has been `` overwhelming . '' Fewer then 20 % of the fans asked for refunds from the races canceled after last year 's crash , he said .

Houghton said the association needs permits or waivers from the FAA , the local airport authority and the city of Reno . He expressed optimism that all three entities would permit the races , but said his biggest concern is any unknown obstacle that could interfere with race plans .

The FAA said it has revised its air race policy to require all air racing organizations to go through a standardized accreditation process to ensure all air race organizations are subjected to the same review and authorization standards .

In the 49 years of racing at Reno , 19 pilots have died in crashes . Last year 's crash is believed to be the first to kill spectators .
