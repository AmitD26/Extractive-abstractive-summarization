The lines , which drew thousands , were part exercises in tech commercialism and part homages to Steve Jobs , Apple 's other co-founder , who died last week following a battle with pancreatic cancer .

In New York , Apple fans created a makeshift memorial to Jobs that included flowers , photos , iPad boxes and apples -LRB- as in the fruit -RRB- .

And in Atlanta , some people said they were lining up for the phone in part because of Jobs .

About 200 people had lined up in the wee hours of the morning in New York to buy the new phone , which has a faster processor and a `` digital assistant '' that responds to voice commands and talks back to phone owners , answering their questions .

`` I want to get mine along with the millions of other fans , '' Wozniak said . `` I just want to be able to talk to my phone . ''

He published a series of his conversations with Siri .

`` Me : ` I 'm drunk , ' '' he wrote .

`` Siri : ` I found a number of cabs fairly close to you . ' -LRB- Perfect ; it did n't dial my ex-girlfriend . -RRB- ''

`` I just want the personal assistant , '' said Teresa Sparks , 41 , an Atlanta nurse who had been waiting in line for the phone since 4:45 a.m.

`` He 's got a secretary -- I do n't , '' he joked .

`` I love Siri , '' she said . `` We played with it in the store . I know for sure it will make me a safer driver . I do n't have to scramble through my phone while I 'm driving . If I can talk to it and get answers , it 's going to cut out so much time for me . ''

Plenty of excitement seemed to surround the phone 's release .

In true Apple-head fashion , two Apple fans in New York said they arrived at the flagship Apple Store 18 days before Friday , and blogged about the experience on a site called iPhoneWhatever , CNNMoney reports .

`` I got hit by a car and had surgery a few weeks ago . There 's tons of metal plates in my foot -- it shattered , '' David Betz , a 26-year-old bartender , told CNNMoney . `` Is it worth it ? We 'll find out . ''

If you were hoping to pre-order now and pick up the phone Friday , you 're out of luck . Pre-orders at AT&T , Sprint and Verizon are sold out , and phones ordered through Apple 's website may not be delivered for several weeks .

All of those brick-and-mortar retail stores also will carry the phone , along with select Apple-approved retailers : Radio Shack , Best Buy , Target and Sam 's Club . -LRB- Word of warning : Check availability before lining up at one of those third-party sellers . Inventory is limited , and some will be filling pre-orders before selling whatever stock may remain . -RRB-

Customers who buy the phone at an Apple retail store will be offered free in-store setup service , personalized instruction on how to set up e-mail and download apps .

It also seems impossible to separate interest in the iPhone 4S with news of Jobs ' death last week .

Among the legions of Apple 's diehard fans , some have taken saying the `` 4S '' in the phone 's name represents the words `` For Steve . ''

Although it 's virtually impossible that the company would have done that on purpose -LRB- the phone 's development happened largely when Jobs was still CEO -RRB- it speaks both to the long reach of Jobs ' legacy and the cult-like devotion that some Apple loyalists feel toward the company and its products .

CNN 's Mark Milian and Umika Pidaparthy and CNNMoney contributed to this report .
