-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the marshland just south of the seaside-resort of Anaklia in Western Georgia , the air is often filled with birdsong and the croak of tiny frogs . But added to nature 's chorus is the sound of construction , something difficult to escape along Georgia 's Black Sea Coast .

Anaklia is still being built and the marshlands are being drained to make way for new five-star hotels . A new railway and airport are planned as the government aims to bring back the tourists who used to come to Anaklia during Soviet times .

But there are bigger plans than that . Georgia 's president Mikheil Saakashvili wants to build a whole new city called Lazika . The promotional video for it presents an impression of futuristic skyscrapers , golf courses and high-end luxury for the entrepreneurs who will make this city their home .

And all this in five years , according to Iva Davitaia who admits that there are currently no international investors in the project `` but we do have international interest . ''

Many local residents are enthusiastic as Lazika would mean jobs for a community that struggles to make a living through agriculture . But just 20 kilometers -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- south is Poti , Georgia 's main port that others believe should be revived before a new city is built .

President Saakashvili is a man who operates at breakneck speed and is quick to defend Lazika .

The Black Sea resort of Batumi has turned from a warlord 's paradise into a bustling tourist town where Donald Trump is the latest to invest and the country 's parliament building has been moved from its traditional home in the capital Tbilisi to a futuristic new government building in Kutaisi

Yet behind the construction boom Georgia 's economic fundamentals remain difficult . Unemployment hovers at 16 % and poverty is still widespread . Projects like Lazika sound wonderful but it may have to be seen to be believed .
