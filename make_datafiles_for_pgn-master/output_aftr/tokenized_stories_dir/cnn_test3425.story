-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forget World Cups . For many rugby union players the ultimate accomplishment is being selected to appear for the famed British Lions on their overseas tours .

Giant Munster lock Paul O'Connell is leading the 2009 Lions in South Africa .

The Lions are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of England , Scotland , Wales and Ireland and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside .

In the modern professional era , Lions tours take place every four years , visiting the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations powers of New Zealand , South Africa and Australia in rotation .

A typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides , interspersed with international or Test matches .

Midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams , with the Lions giving all their squad members a chance to play , with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the Tests .

The 2009 Lions are touring world champions South Africa , looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side , which visited New Zealand .

Under England 's 2003 World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward , the 2005 squad were expected to prosper , but slipped to defeat in all three Test matches against the All Blacks .

The team was captained by Brian O'Driscoll , but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first Test when he was controversially ` spear ' tackled by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu and dislocated his shoulder .

O'Driscoll , who led Ireland to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year , was expected to captain the Lions to South Africa , but coach Ian McGeechan gave the job to Munster lock Paul O'Connell .

They played provincial and local sides without formal Test matches .
