Maybe Joe Biden is n't always `` presidential '' as that word has come to be defined , but is n't it about time we revised the definition of that word ? Sadly , it has come to mean a staid , reserved person who shows almost no emotion -- almost like Spock from `` Star Trek . '' But presidents and vice presidents are still human beings and should be allowed and encouraged to act like it .

Look at Biden at Thursday night 's vice-presidential debate : He laughed , he almost cried , he got angry , he looked to the heavens , he laughed some more . Joe Biden gave us a veritable one-man show . It was a tour de force . After Biden retires from politics , he should seriously consider touring the nation with a show : `` Being Biden '' or `` Say it ai n't so , Joe . ''

Opinion roundup : Feisty Biden , wonky Ryan

Mitt Romney may now be finally learning how to `` let Mitt be Mitt , '' but that has never been Biden 's problem . Joe Biden wears Joe Biden on his sleeve .

There has been a lot written about whether Biden went too far at the debate . Did he laugh too much ? Was he too impassioned ? Too animated ? -LRB- One of my favorite moments occurred early in the debate when Ryan was answering a question and Biden turned to the camera a la `` Ferris Bueller '' and gave us a look of : `` You 've got to be kidding me . '' -RRB-

Romney hammers Biden on Libya remark

Instead of media pundits and the public attacking people like Biden when they show honest emotion , we should applaud it . In fact , we should demand it from all of our presidential candidates .

There should be one presidential debate that is not about the dry figures of deficit reduction or oil company subsidies , etc. , but about heart .

We need a debate that that reveals who they really are beneath their expensive suits with the American flag pins on their lapels . Questions that raise issues that are n't black and white , but hundreds of shades of gray .

What do you tell a family that is scraping by to make ends meet about why you think millionaires should n't have to pay slightly higher taxes ? What would you say to a young woman who does n't want to have an abortion , but you are advocating cutting the government funding that she needs to raise her child ?

How would Mitt Romney or President Obama do in response to those type of questions ? Probably OK . Obama would be law professoresque but trying to fake some emotion . Romney would give us a memorized answer that has been sanitized by consultants after a gaggle of focus groups . Neither horrible , yet neither compelling . But there is no doubt that Biden would be the big winner .

Look , if you want `` Candidate-enstein '' or `` Franken-tician , '' a creature designed by high-priced political consultants from the spare parts of past political campaigns , be my guest . There are boatloads of them . But there 's only one Joe Biden . And that is truly a shame .
