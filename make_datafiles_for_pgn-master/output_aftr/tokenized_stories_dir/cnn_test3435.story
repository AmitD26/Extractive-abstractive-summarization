-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- To promote her Fox comedy `` Raising Hope '' -LRB- which begins its third season October 2 -RRB- , Martha Plimpton pitched a funny idea .

`` People are always trying to come up with creative ways of engaging the viewers , '' she tells EW . `` And I thought well , I play a housekeeper on a show , what if I went and cleaned the house of `` Raising Hope 's '' biggest fan . In my uniform . ''

The network thought she was joking , but she was serious . The contest begins today at www.fox.com/cleansweep .

`` Raising Hope '' creator Greg Garcia will select the winner from the top 10 finalists in mid-October , and Plimpton and Dillahunt will get their hands dirty later that month or in early November .

Martha Plimpton : Well , I think it says a lot about my commitment to promoting the show . -LSB- Laughs -RSB- It 's a funny thing : A lot of people who have n't seen the show yet say they have n't watched because they 're not really sure what it is . They think it 's about a baby , or that it 's extremely dumb or something . But I think this show is a lot smarter than people realize . The writing is very , very sharp . If dare I say it , it 's a lot more sophisticated underneath . -LSB- Laughs -RSB- Do you know what I mean ? The exterior is really ridiculous and silly , but there 's real sophistication in the writing , and I 'm really proud to be a part of it . And I think it 's really smart , and it makes me laugh . If it makes me laugh , well , I 'm sorry , but then it must be good . -LSB- Laughs -RSB- Because I do n't laugh at a lot of things .

I 'm thrilled that we got a third season . I very much would like for people to enjoy this show as much as I do . I want to share it with the largest amount of people I can . And I will do what is necessary .

Clearly . Have you given Greg Garcia any guidelines for choosing the winner ?

We should stay away from hoarders , crime scenes , and people with too many cats . I 'm not bringing a hazmat suit .

I am excellent with laundry . For example , as a laundry expert , I never use fabric softener on towels because it makes them less absorbent . I do n't know if your readers know this . You should not put Bounce sheets or fabric softener in with your towels . You should dry them separately without fabric softener , so they stay absorbent .
