-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mitt Romney promised Monday to restore U.S. foreign policy to a traditional role dating back decades , based on exerting global influence through military and economic power , in a major speech two weeks before he debates President Barack Obama on international issues .

In the address at the Virginia Military Institute , Romney argued that Obama is failing to provide the global leadership needed and expected by the rest of the world , especially key allies such as Israel .

Romney cited recent protests and violence in Arab countries , including an attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya that killed the American ambassador and three others , as examples of a worsening security situation that he blamed on Obama 's policies .

Romney 's running mate , Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , offered a similar criticism on Monday at a campaign appearance in Ohio .

`` If you look around the world , what we are witnessing is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy , '' the conservative House Budget Committee chairman said , later adding that `` if we project weakness abroad , our adversaries are that much more willing to test us , to question our resolve . ''

In specific policy examples , Romney called for the United States to join allies in ensuring that rebels fighting government forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad get the military hardware they seek . However , he stopped short of calls by some conservatives for Washington to directly arm the rebels .

`` We should be working no less vigorously through our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran -- rather than sitting on the sidelines , '' Romney said , making a change from the advance text of the speech that originally called for working `` with '' international partners . `` It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East . ''

The Obama administration has limited direct aid so far to non-lethal support such as communications equipment . In addition , the United States is vetting rebels and working with Qatar and Saudi Arabia to make sure weapons go to preferred groups .

Obama ad : Romney is ` reckless ' with foreign policy

Romney also criticized Obama 's overall approach to the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .

The recent assault in Benghazi , which took place on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda , is under investigation by U.S. officials , with no formal word yet on exactly who was behind it .

In the United States , the intelligence community believes it was `` a deliberate and organized terrorist assault carried out by extremists '' affiliated with or sympathetic to al Qaeda .

The Obama administration has been criticized for initially blaming the attack on protests over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States , then acknowledging it was a terrorist attack .

While Romney sought to distinguish himself from Obama on foreign policy , specific proposals he cited remained similar to what the administration is doing .

For example , he called for ending military operations in Afghanistan by the end of the 2014 , the same date set by Obama and NATO , and warned of unspecified steps to stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon . Obama has said all options remain on the table for preventing an Iranian nuclear weapon .

Romney also angered Palestinian leaders with a reference to cultural differences as a reason for differing levels of prosperity between Israel and the Palestinian territories .

On Monday , Romney pledged to recommit his administration to seeking the two-state solution and blamed Obama for what he called a negotiation process that has `` devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations . ''

Romney also has faced negative headlines over his quick response to the Benghazi consulate attack . Soon after word broke of the violence , he fired off a statement that was criticized as inaccurate and premature .

The 30-second spot features news clips of what the commercial calls Romney 's `` gaffe-filled '' trip to England , Israel and Poland .

`` If this is how he handles the world now , '' the narrator in the new ad says , `` just think what Mitt Romney might do as president . ''

Responding to the ad , a Romney campaign spokeswoman said Obama was the one who had `` weakened '' the U.S. standing in the world .

Obama 's mixed week

`` Mitt Romney 's vision is to restore influence and to support our friends and allies to move the Middle East onto a path of greater liberty , greater stability , and greater prosperity , '' Wong said . `` It 's a restoration of a strategy that served us well for over 70 years . ''

What would you ask Biden , Ryan ?

Referring to the U.S. perspective after World War II , Wong said that `` we saw the need to have a military that no one would challenge . '' He also cited the need to have strategic allies around the world as part of what he called a full spectrum of power `` so we do not have to face again the horrors of war . ''
