-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama recently encouraged Americans to `` take about 10 minutes to answer 10 questions '' and fill out their 2010 census form .

The census , taken every 10 years , is used to determine how to allocate more than $ 400 billion in federal funds and seats House of Representatives and determine the boundaries of representatives ' districts .

`` There is no representative democracy without it . It 's the scientific , nonpartisan , apolitical starting point of what eventually becomes a quite partisan , political process , '' said Kenneth Prewitt , a professor at Columbia 's School of International and Public Affairs and the former director of the United States Census Bureau .

The process of apportioning seats is straightforward , but redistricting is much more complicated . Districts are supposed to be redrawn to reflect population changes and to make sure there is equal representation in the House .

Lawmakers have been accused of carving district lines around the constituents that will give their party an advantage and secure political gains .

The process is known as gerrymandering , a term coined after Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry . Elected in 1810 , he signed an obscure redistricting bill that enabled greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature .

Critics say gerrymandering gives those in power an unfair advantage and can dilute the power of minority groups .

Prewitt said the redrawing of lines to the benefit of one party or the neglect of other is just a part of the political process .

`` The production of the statistics has got to be nonpolitical ... but the use of the statistics can be as political as the country wants it to be , '' he said .

`` I expect people to try to take advantage of situations to advance their political goals , interests , values -- so it 's healthy . Now , do I think overtime creating districts so incumbents are always re-elected is the healthiest way to have a democracy ? No , '' Prewitt said , adding that it 's up to the voters to decide whether they want to throw someone out of office .

The more pressing issue for Prewitt is making sure everyone is counted because he said those who are n't counted will be treated unfairly in the political process and in the allocation of economic benefits .

Illegal immigrants , for example , sometimes opt not to turn in census forms for fear of legal ramifications . Those fears , however , are unwarranted because the information is confidential .

This year 's census is projected to cost more than $ 14 billion . Prewitt said it 's comparatively easy to count the first 75 to 85 percent , but the last 2 to 3 percent is `` really , really tough going . ''

`` I 'm much more concerned about trying to have a fair census than I am about some drawing of odd lines after the census is over , '' he said .

CNN 's David Ariosto and Bill Mears contributed to this report .
