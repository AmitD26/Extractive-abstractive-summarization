It 's not of the tsunami-inflicted destruction -- the flattened homes , mangled cars or piles of debris -- in Ishinomaki , one of the worst-hit areas in the Tohoku region , in the country 's north .

Instead , it is an image of retirees huddled on small benches outside their temporary homes .

The pre-assembled homes have ample heating and are equipped with small kitchens -- and yes , many people in other parts of the world live with much less .

But in talking with some of the elderly residents in March , one year after the devastating earthquake and tsunami , it was clear that they were struggling to adapt to their new surroundings .

Now as a second winter arrives after March 2011 quake , I was curious as to how these people were coping and I wondered what their thoughts were on Japan 's upcoming general election .

And it could be the case for quite some time .

Sixty-seven-year-old Katsuji Ogata lost his wife in the tsunami . He used to run a small restaurant in Ishinomaki . Now it 's a simple food truck .

He says , `` I know it was a huge disaster and things would take time . But I am frustrated . The reaction has been too slow for too long . We are working hard and trying to move forward , but there are many people who are really struggling and need some help . ''

The people in the housing complexes are making the best of their situation though .

One we visited outside Ishinomaki had setup a small Sunday morning market the day we visited .

And we also met Satoshi Sakurai at the complex 's barber shop .

`` Another prime minster and another new cabinet , the reconstruction will be delayed again , '' he sighs .

But the barber shop 's owner , Hiroshi Yokota , tried to keep things in perspective .

`` I sometimes wish I 'd wake , and it was all a dream , '' he says .
