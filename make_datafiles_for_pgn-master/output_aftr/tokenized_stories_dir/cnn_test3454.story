Rome -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Technical experts directing the salvage operation aboard the Costa Concordia cruise ship are recommending that the underwater part of the operation be called off because it is becoming too dangerous , Italy 's civil protection agency said Tuesday .

The advice is based on safety concerns and follows consultations with relatives of the people still missing from the shipwreck and diplomats representing their countries , the civil protection agency said .

Franco Schettino , captain of the Costa Concordia , said that after the ship hit the rocks , he ran it aground off Giglio island to keep it from sinking and limit the tilting . It came to rest on its starboard , or right , side , with roughly 50 % of the ship under water . It is currently rotated nearly 90 degrees .

Salvage operations in the part of the ship above the water line will continue , Gabrielli 's office said , as will searches of 7 square miles -LRB- 18 square kilometers -RRB- of sea around the wreck .

Schettino is under house arrest on suspicion of manslaughter , causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship while passengers were still on board .

But Schettino 's lawyer says he should be released from house arrest .

Officials are particularly concerned for divers who are searching submerged areas of the ship amid a sea of debris that includes heavy items and wires , they said Sunday .

The ship jolted slightly and then slowly moved even further , totaling about 4 centimeters over a few hours , Gabrielli said Sunday .

The ship 's movement renewed fears that the vessel could slide farther .

A number of survivors have filed lawsuits against the company that ran the cruise , Costa Cruises .

Costa has announced it was offering each of about 3,200 passengers who had been aboard the vessel a lump sum of 11,000 euros -LRB- $ 14,400 -RRB- , in compensation for their loss of property and emotional distress , as well as a refund of costs associated with the cruise .

Separate agreements will be reached with those passengers who were injured and needed treatment at the scene and with the families of those who died , Costa said .
