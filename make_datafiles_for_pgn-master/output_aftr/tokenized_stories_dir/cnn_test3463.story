An editorial cartoon in a Cairo daily sums up Egypt 's state of affairs : a scribbled mess of spirals .

And the presidential election this weekend , once hailed as Egypt 's big step toward democracy , is now satirized in an online mock-up of a video game pitting a bare-chested Ahmed Shafik , the last prime minister under ousted President Hosni Mubarak , against the bearded Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood .

The ruling dealt a blow to the Muslim Brotherhood , which dominated parliament , and was victory for supporters of Shafik , the focus of protesters ' derision for his ties to the deposed dictator .

Anger festered Friday among those who feared that a hard-won revolution was fast unraveling ; that little had changed .

`` SCAF has been suppressing our protests , suppressing the youth movements on the ground , '' said Wisam Mohamed . `` They have been arresting thousands of us . ''

The contentious verdict , he told the English language news website Ahram Online , will `` pave the way for the reanimation of the ousted Mubarak regime . ''

The court dissolved parliament after it had been in session for a little more that four months , saying that constitutional articles that regulated the parliamentary elections were invalid .

Sally Toma , a member of the Revolution Youth Coalition , blamed the Islamists for what happened .

After the ruling , speculation rose that Morsi , the Brotherhood 's candidate , would pull out now that his party 's pillar of power had crumbled . But Morsi said he will stay in the running , though the notion of carrying on a vote under the circumstances seemed absurd to some .

In the absence of a parliament , the winner of the runoff vote will be put in a position of dealing directly with Egypt 's military leaders , a reason for SCAF to postpone the elections , said Mohamed ElBaradei , a 2005 Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose own presidential bid failed .

`` Electing president in the absence of constitution and parliament is electing an 'em peror ' with more powers than deposed dictator . A travesty , '' he tweeted Friday .

The streets of Cairo were calm early Friday , but everyone braced for Tahrir Square to erupt with anger . Already , protesters were amassing in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria .

`` We are now back at the crossroads and perhaps at the point of zero . Martial law under the disguise of legality , '' it said .

`` The Muslim Brotherhood proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they are incapable of understanding history , refuse to learn from their mistakes , and have a level of arrogance that makes them unable to accept advice . ''

The unease was palpable on Twitter as well .

Wael Ghonim , the former Google executive who attained fame after being arrested during the uprising , said : `` The only thing that will make us go back to living in fear , oppression and silence is a time machine -- they have n't invented that yet . ''

Many Egyptians , emboldened to speak their minds now more than ever , felt alienated by both the Muslim Brotherhood and their other choice : a remnant of the old regime .

`` Both choices are unacceptable to me , '' said Ahmed Maher , a civil servant . `` I will be boycotting . ''

University student Ibrahim Gamal Al-Din has become an online sensation with his satirical music videos . In one , he takes aim at the Muslim Brotherhood .

`` This is our country , but you were all sleeping , '' he sings . `` We took parliament and the constitutional assembly , and we 'll take the presidency , too . And if you do n't like it , you can go to hell . ''

But the rumblings Friday were not all funny . It was clear many Egyptians had had enough .

Wait until the sun goes down , tweeted an activist . The small gathering at Tahrir will get stronger .

But by the time evening came , the air filled with uncertainty , though not much had transpired in the iconic square .
