Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Congress debates the size and scope of defense budgets in a looming age of austerity , one senator is seeking to resolve a much older question about the president 's ability to exercise military power without the consent of the House and Senate .

`` The question is simple , '' Webb said last week . `` When should the president have the unilateral authority to decide to use military force , and what is the place of the Congress in that process ? Year by year , skirmish by skirmish , the role of the Congress in determining where the U.S. military would operate , and when the awesome power of our weapon systems would be unleashed , has diminished . ''

Last summer , a sharply divided Congress was unable to pass any legislation explicitly endorsing or rejecting America 's involvement in NATO 's Libyan intervention . The matter was never voted on by the full Senate .

`` The -LRB- Obama -RRB- administration , which spent well over a billion dollars of taxpayer funds , dropped thousands of bombs on the country , and operated our military offshore for months , claimed that ` combat ' was not occurring , and rejected the notion that the War Powers Act applied to the situation , '' Webb recently said on the Senate floor .

`` I am not here to debate the War Powers Act . -LRB- But -RRB- I am suggesting that other statutory language that covers these kinds of situations must be enacted . ''

`` These attempts by Congress to restrict the president 's authority as commander-in-chief are almost always symbolic , because presidents rarely enter conflicts without some expectation of public support , '' said Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller .

CNN polling showed a slight majority of Americans in favor of the Libyan intervention in the spring of 2011 , though public sentiment quickly turned against the conflict .
