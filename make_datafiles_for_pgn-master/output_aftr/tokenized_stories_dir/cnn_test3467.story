Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It should come as no surprise that prominent union leaders are among the first group President Barack Obama courts as he seeks support for overhauling immigration policy .

It was organized labor that helped ensure defeat of a bipartisan effort to reform the nation 's immigration laws five years ago .

At that time , the AFL-CIO and other prominent union groups came out against the initiative , fearing a proposal for a temporary guest worker program for seasonal workers would weaken union membership and bargaining clout .

That led to a handful of liberal-leaning Democrats to vote against the bill , including Sens. Sherrod Brown , Tom Harkin and Debbie Stabenow .

The purpose of the hour-long , closed-door meeting was to engage in a `` dialogue '' about `` immigration reform and how it fits into his broader economic agenda , '' the White House said .

The White House has long been hopeful that the labor movement get on board .

Nonetheless , the same sticking points that turned labor against immigration reform five years ago remain .

` Now 's the time ' to move on immigration , Obama says

Conservatives , including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , are again pushing a temporary guest worker program that is favored by the business community and agricultural interests that depend on seasonal employment .

But the major unions remain opposed to such a measure .

In 2009 , both the AFL-CIO and the SEIU jointly released guidelines on an immigration reform package they would support .

Both the AFL-CIO and SEIU are lobbying for an easier path to citizenship than was proposed by the 2007 effort .

`` We were talking about trying to fix a broken system , '' Trumka said after the White House meeting . `` We were talking about commonsense reform that has an inclusive and broad path to citizenship that allows us to bring people in and take advantage of that . ''

Another leader said she thought there was agreement between the labor groups and Obama .
