On CNN 's `` State of the Union , '' CNN host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country . This week , King traveled to Peoria , Illinois , to explore how the recession is hitting the blue-collar town hard .

Chris Guynn says he 's grateful that his wife has a full-time job while he studies for life after Caterpillar .

PEORIA , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Suddenly , this city 's motto rings hollow : `` It 's Better Here '' does n't match the mood in a place where the recession hit late but is now hitting hard .

`` I just felt , I thought I could n't lose with this company '' is how Chris Guynn described his motivation for moving his wife and two children to Peoria from Las Vegas , Nevada .

There was a job waiting at Caterpillar , the 80-year-old heavy equipment giant , and `` It was a company that you could just retire with , great pension , retirement , 401 and so on . ''

To visit Peoria is to meet the faces behind the numbers : rising new claims for unemployment benefits and the rising state and national unemployment rates .

`` I believe he 's going to help it out , '' Guynn said in an interview at the college . `` Everyone is worth giving that chance to . ... I want to give him a fair shot . I know it 's not going to happen overnight , but I 'm willing to see what he 's going to do . ''

Still , Guynn acknowledges that not all anxious workers are as patient .

`` I mean , it was basically left to him , you know , he did n't really do it , in my opinion , but it 's his problem now . ''

As President Obama works to meet those high expectations and deal with mounting conservative criticism of his approach , Guynn is hoping his classes eventually land him a new career as a crime lab technician .

To that end , she waited until the end of her two-week notice period before telling them Mom would suddenly be spending more time at home .

`` I do n't let them see that I 'm stressed out about things , '' Williams told us as her two youngest watched television in a lower-level family room of her Peoria home .

`` I waited . I did n't tell them right away . The two 5-year-olds , I did n't think they would understand what that meant anyway . So I just waited until I was done working , and then I said , ` Things are going to be a little bit different . I 'm going to be home in the morning , you know , when you go to school and when you get home from school . ' And we 've just kind of gone that route . ''

Williams , who worked as an administrative assistant , had never been laid off . She has a four-year college degree and initially was optimistic that she would quickly find work . Now , with about 10 weeks of unemployment benefits left and a bleak job market , Williams is getting more nervous and keeping an even more watchful eye on the family budget .

`` Just everything in general has been , had to be cut back , '' she says . `` I really went into it thinking I would have a much easier time finding a new job . Looking for something , I thought it was going to be easier for me than it has been . ''

`` I 'm very nervous , '' Williams said . `` I 'm very nervous of what will be available , and every day on the news , there 's more layoffs that are being shown , in our town as well as the nation . ''

On the floor of one of Caterpillar 's giant assembly plants , however , Jim Lierle is quick with a warning that lawmakers looking to help blue-collar workers like him might think again about one idea gaining steam in Congress .

If Congress mandates `` buy American , '' Lierle echoes Caterpillar management in worrying other countries will retaliate with trade sanctions , and the company 's exports will dip even more .

Like many , Lierle hopes a new administration in Washington will help bring an economic turnaround . But he is more reserved than many here when it comes to rating the new president .

`` I respect the rank , but the man has to earn respect from me , '' Lierle said . `` I do n't give respect . They have to earn it . And so far , I have n't seen a whole lot that anybody 's earned . ... I 'm not going to judge the man yet . I 'll see what he does . Give him the benefit of the doubt . See what he comes up with . The way he 's talking , he 's made a lot of promises . It 's gon na be hard to fulfill all those promises . And he 's sure not gon na do it in the first six months .

`` I 've got a lot of patience , '' Lierle said . `` I 've been married for 36 years . I 've got a lot of patience . ''
