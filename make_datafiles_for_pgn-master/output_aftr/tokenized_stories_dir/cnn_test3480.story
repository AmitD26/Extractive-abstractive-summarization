In the long history of popes , stretching back two millennia to St. Peter , some names have picked up negative associations , while others have come to signify conservatism or a desire for change .

On the other side of the coin , a new pope that named himself John XXIV would be signaling an openness to reform .

John XXIII was famed for calling the Second Vatican Council in 1962 , which ushered in great changes in the Roman Catholic Church 's relationship with the modern world .

He was brave to pick the name John at all , says Melloni , since the last man to hold the name is viewed as an `` antipope '' because he was elected pontiff during a schism in the church in the 15th Century .

John XXIII got away with it because he said it was in deference to his parish saint , John the Baptist , Melloni said .

Benedict XVI , who gets to keep his name in rather than reverting to Joseph Ratzinger in his unprecedented position as pope emeritus , meant his choice to be unifying .

In his first general audience after taking office in 2005 , he told the crowds gathered in St. Peter 's Square that he wished to follow in the steps of Benedict XV , who led the church through the turbulent years of the First World War .

The choice also evoked St. Benedict , founder of the Benedictine order of monks , who helped spread Christianity throughout Europe and was particularly venerated in Ratzinger 's homeland , Germany .

For the early popes , the choice of a name was n't an issue . It was n't until the end of the 10th Century that the head of the church started taking a different name to the one he was born with , said Melloni .

But since then only one , Adrian VI in the 16th Century , has kept his baptismal name .

He died barely more than a month later , putting him among the shortest-lived of popes .

John Paul II , born Karol Wojtyla in Poland -- making him the first non-Italian pope since the 16th Century -- in turn wanted to show homage to that brief pontificate through carrying on the name , said Melloni .

`` What you may find in the next few days will be the tendency not to try to guess who will be elected and and what name he will take , but to try to define the kind of pope they may hope for , '' said Melloni .

`` There is a very conservative party within the cardinals who are hoping for Pius XIII or Benedict XVII , '' he said .

Others look to someone like Archbishop Luis Antonio Tagle , of Manila , as a possible John Paul III , he said , while some of the Italians who want to see the papacy returned to one of their number talk about Paul VII .

In any case , any cardinal who 's in with a shot of the papacy would do well to do his homework .

While we wait to hear , we can be sure of only one thing , according to Melloni : the new pope wo n't be called Peter .

This is out of respect for the first St. Peter , the Apostle -- but perhaps also reflects a centuries ' old prophecy that a Peter II will be the very last pope to serve .
