Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Asia is set to have the world 's wealthiest residents , with city-state Singapore heading the rich list .

By one measure , they are already are . Singapore 's per capita income is estimated by Knight Frank and Citi Private Wealth 's 2012 Wealth Report to be the highest in the world at $ 56,532 in 2010 , measured by purchasing power parity . Norway follows at $ 51,226 , then the U.S. -LRB- $ 45,511 -RRB- , Hong Kong -LRB- $ 45,301 -RRB- and Switzerland -LRB- $ 42,470 -RRB- . -LRB- The International Monetary Fund listed Singapore 3rd in the world in 2010-11 by per capita GDP , behind Qatar and Luxembourg , which were n't included in the Knight Frank report -RRB- .

By 2050 , the Wealth Report estimates the world 's wealthy citizens will be dominated by Asia : Singapore -LRB- $ 137,710 -RRB- , Hong Kong -LRB- $ 116,639 -RRB- , Taiwan -LRB- $ 114,093 -RRB- and South Korea -LRB- $ 107,752 -RRB- . The only western economy projected to remain in the top five is the U.S. , with an estimated per capita income of $ 100,802 .

Some of the world 's super-rich have already crossed the Pacific . Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin , a native of Brazil , moved to Singapore in 2009 has since renounced his U.S. citizenship . Jim Rogers , the co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros , also moved to the former British colony in 2007 .

`` I have moved -- I have sold my house in New York . I have moved to Asia and my girls speak Mandarin , speak perfect Mandarin ... I 'm preparing them for the 21st century by knowing Asia and by speaking perfect Mandarin , '' Rogers told CNN recently .

`` The largest creditor nations in the world are China , Japan , Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore . The assets are in Asia . You know who the debtors are and where they are . Look at Greece . Look at Spain . I mean , I do n't like saying this . You know , I 'm an American , too . But facts are facts . ''

The report 's list of fastest growing economies between 2010 and 2050 also gives more credence that the world 's wealth is moving toward Asia . Of the top 10 fastest rising economies -- Nigeria , India , Iraq , Bangladesh , Vietnam , the Philippines , Mongolia , Indonesia , Sri Lanka and Egypt , respectively -- all but three are in the region .

Old World economies will have the worst growth performance in the next 40 years , the report predicts : Spain , France , Sweden , Belgium , Switzerland , Austria , the Netherlands , Italy and Germany are at the bottom of the list . But Japan and its aging population will have the weakest projected growth of all economies , Knight Frank estimates .

In the report Tina Fordham , Senior Global Political Analyst at Citi , warns that the dissatisfaction with income inequality shown in the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations `` will gain momentum , and that there could be a long-term recalibration between governments , businesses and society as a result .
