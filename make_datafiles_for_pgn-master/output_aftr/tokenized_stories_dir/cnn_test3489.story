No casualties were reported in the early morning attack , which shattered several weeks of relative calm for the city 's residents .

Over the past year , Benghazi , the birthplace of Libya 's 2011 revolution , has been the scene of multiple attacks targeting security forces . Many of the attacks have been blamed on Islamist militants .

After the attack , a car bomb with more than 50 kilograms of explosives was found and defused , the news agency said .

There has been no claim of responsibility for Tuesday 's attack .

After the French military intervention in Mali in January , there were fears militants could strike French interests in the region , including Libya , which has been struggling to impose security across the country since the 2011 revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi .

A team of French investigators has been in the Libyan capital collecting evidence and investigating the bombing .

The French Embassy bombing followed a series of attacks last year that targeted foreign diplomatic missions and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Benghazi .

Last September , U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi .

After Tuesday 's bombing , the first targeting a foreign diplomatic mission in Tripoli , Libyan officials said security would be increased around such facilities .

The high level of unease was evident when a bomb threat at a cultural event Friday evening led to its cancellation and the evacuation of the foreign diplomats in attendance .

The statement said the rest of the events scheduled for Saturday and Sunday have been postponed until further notice `` while insecurity persists ''

A management source at the Radisson Blu Hotel told CNN the hotel did not receive any threats and was functioning as normal on Saturday .

A security official told the Libyan state news agency that security precautions were taken Friday after a member of the security forces guarding the hotel received a call from an unidentified person saying there was a car bomb in the vicinity .
