-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least two people were killed and as many as 120 injured in Thanksgiving pileups involving an estimated 100 cars on a foggy stretch of highway in southeast Texas , authorities said .

The first accident -- a multi-car wreck in the eastbound lands of Interstate 10 -- occurred about 8:45 a.m. , according to the Texas Department of Public Safety . Chain-reaction crashes followed , the department said in a news release , and included several accidents in the westbound lanes of the intersate , southwest of Beaumont in Jefferson County .

The two fatalities occurred in the same vehicle , authorities said . The victims were identified as Vincent Leggio , 64 , and Debra Leggio , 60 , both of Pearland , Texas .

Video from CNN affiliate KBMT showed badly mangled vehicles atop one another and people who appeared to be injured stretched out in grass alongside the highway and on ambulance gurneys . Long lines of cars , each battered and some appearing to be totaled , lined the roadway . The vehicles included cars , minivans , pickups , tractor-trailer trucks and at least one FedEx truck .

It was not known exactly how many injuries resulted from the accidents , said Davis .

Several victims were transported to neighboring hospitals in Beaumont and Port Arthur .

Westbound lanes of the interstate were closed for nearly four hours before being reopened . The eastbound lanes of I-10 were closed after the accident throughout most of the day , with the Department of Public Safety saying shortly after 5 p.m. that those lanes had been cleared of debris and reopened .
