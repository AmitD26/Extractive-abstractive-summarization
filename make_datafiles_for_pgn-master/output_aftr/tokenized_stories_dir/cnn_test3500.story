But on this occasion reporters were n't allowed access to the well defended Floridian complex , which drew criticism from the White House Correspondents Association .

Very few details emerged from Woods and Obama 's round , but the fact that Golf Channel reporter Tim Rosaforte appeared to be tweeting from inside the complex only added to the WHCA 's ire .

White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded by releasing a statement defending the secret nature of the meeting .

`` The press access granted by the White House today is entirely consistent with the press access offered for previous presidential golf outings , '' it read .

`` It 's also consistent with the press access promised to the White House Press Corps prior to arrival in Florida on Friday evening . ''

On Saturday , Obama is reported to have spent time working on his swing with Woods ' former coach Butch Harmon , who called it an `` honor . ''

The 69-year-old tweeted : `` What a great weekend . To spend it with the President and have my son Claude III by my side . It does n't get any better than this . ''

The American , who attended UCLA , made par on the second extra hole , the 10th , while Beljan missed a five foot putt to prolong the playoff .

`` To be able to play the tournament was a dream of mine , '' Merrick told the PGA Tour website . `` But to win ? I ca n't describe it . It 's so much fun . ''

Elsewhere , the draw for the first World Golf Championships tournament of the year , the Accenture Match Play , has been made , pairing world No. 1 Rory McIlroy , who lost to Hunter Mahan in the final last year , against Irishman Shane Lowry .

Woods will play Charles Howell III in his opening round match while defending champion Mahan comes up against Italian teenager Matteo Manassero .

Luke Donald , the 2011 champion , begins his charge against Marcel Siem of Germany . Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa , the No. 4 seed , will play Richie Ramsay of Scotland .
