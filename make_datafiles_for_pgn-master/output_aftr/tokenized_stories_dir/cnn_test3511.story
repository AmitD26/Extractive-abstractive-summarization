Embraer is gaining traction in the sector , he said . `` We are around 15 % of market share in terms of number of aircrafts from 12 years ago , so this is a growing business for us , '' he added . `` In a certain sense -LSB- it is -RSB- outgrowing the commercial business . ''

Embraer , founded over 40 years ago , is also looking to make inroads into the U.S. defense market . In February the U.S. Air Force announced it had selected Embraer Defense for its LAS -LRB- Light Air Support -RRB- program , a contract for 20 aircraft worth $ 427 million .

The company also supplies 50 % of the aircraft for the Brazilian Airforce , and Curado remains committed to that country . `` Definitely Brazil is our largest defense customer , always has been , always will be , '' he said .

But , following a decline in exports of manufactured goods over the past decade , competitiveness has been eroded by a strong currency .

According to Curado , high-costs and bureaucracy makes it difficult to do business in Brazil , despite its `` tremendous potential . ''

Despite this billing , the country has struggled with relatively low growth for the last two years , recording only a 0.6 % increase in 2012 .
