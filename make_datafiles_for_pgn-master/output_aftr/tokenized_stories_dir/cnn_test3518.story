-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The sign at the airport was so ridiculous , I thought it was a joke .

`` Please be advised , snow globes are not allowed through the security checkpoint , '' it read .

Over the years , Transportation Security Administration officials have taken away my deodorant , my toothpaste , even my nose hair trimmer in the name of safety . Now it seems as if they are going after Christmas -- one snow globe at a time .

To be fair , I can see some reason for their caution .

After all , the liquid in a normal snow globe could be replaced with something dangerous . And at a time in which an al Qaeda operative is on trial for trying to blow up a plane by igniting explosives sewn inside his underwear , there does n't appear to be a limit as to how far our enemies will go to harm us .

A couple of weeks ago , I had an agent ask to frisk my dreadlocks because the scanner read it as an `` anomaly . '' I argued , and the eventual compromise was having me whip my hair around like a Vegas showgirl until the guy with the rubber gloves was convinced I was n't carrying a bomb in my hair .

Then he groped me ... just in case I had any dignity left .

If this were the '80s , everybody would miss their flight .

And if you can answer that , maybe you can explain why we are given plastic knives and forks to eat with in airport restaurants , but metal knives and forks are handed to us in first class ?

Did you know that one of the factors that led to more deaths on the morning of September 11 is that New York police and fire departments did not have a way to communicate with each other ? Ten years later , there still is n't a nationwide first responder network in place because of the bureaucracy in Washington .

Face it : The question is n't whether we 'll be attacked again but when and how . Afro-frisking and snow globe-grabbing are just placebos given to an incurable patient .

But they do make us laugh .

And laughter 's a pretty good medicine in its own right .

Like the glass case in the Atlanta airport that displays items you ca n't bring aboard , one of them a chainsaw , in case you were packing a chainsaw as your carry-on .

I 'm OK with him being president .

Given the physical requirements and inherent importance of an exit row seat , I would feel more comfortable if I knew the person sitting there could at least do a pushup and not just be collecting a reward for being a repeat customer .

These are the kind of systematic disconnects that just crack me up .

After I got done staring at the sign , I took a picture of it and posted it on my Facebook wall so my friends could also enjoy the laugh . And as the cynical comments came pouring in , I smiled , temporarily forgetting that I live in a world where shoes are a threat , afros can be dangerous , and someone tried to blow up a plane with their underwear .

LZ Granderson thought the TSA ban on carrying snow globes was a joke

@highlight

He 's had his nose hair trimmer and toothpaste taken , dreadlocks checked

Granderson says airport security rules inconsistent and often absurd

@highlight

Still , he says , anything 's possible considering the would-be `` underwear bomber ''
