-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Durable , shock resistant and , most of all , growing in a ready-to-use tubular form , it 's a wonder bamboo has n't always been used to make bicycle frames .

Now 120 years later and a small but determined outfit in Ghana is working hard to change all that .

Here the advent of a minimal amount of technology has made all the difference .

Growing international attention

Their first prototype came out of the factory more than four years ago and is still in operation . Dapaah said the bikes are remarkably durable and there 's every indication that the first model will continue for many years to come .

Last November the bicycle was the darling of the Warsaw Climate Change Conference -LRB- Conference of the Parties 19 -RRB- where UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon donned a crash helmet to take a shaky turn around the conference center on one of the Ghanaian bikes .

Christiana Figueres , the head of the United Nation 's Framework Convention on Climate Change -LRB- UNFCCC -RRB- , also entrusted herself to the bicycle 's rigid pannier rack to hitch a ride around the center .

`` They 're made by women and these women are teaching other women to make these bamboo bikes and to sell them so that they have another income stream , '' Figueres said .

Building opportunities

As a vehicle for women 's emancipation , the bicycle in history has been unrivalled .

During the bicycle craze in the United States and Europe of the late 19th century , it came to symbolize the new woman , not only giving them unprecedented mobility but launching reform movements such as the Rational Dress Society which advocated for a woman 's right to dress appropriately for cycling .

For Dapaah -- who co-founded the company with school friends Kwame Kyei and Winnifred Selby -- the Ghana Bamboo Bikes Initiative proudly carries on that tradition .

`` Currently we have about 20 to 25 women trained who are working in the factory but as we expand we hope to bring more on board , '' she said , adding that the initiative was launched as a way of using local renewable materials and satisfied local needs and created employment opportunities .

`` Not only that but it looks cool and attractive , '' she said .

She said the prize the initiative won last year in Warsaw , the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Women for Results Award , was bringing with it more attention , more orders and greater ambitions for the company .

`` Currently we do n't manufacture many of the metal parts -- the chain and the forks we have to import but some of the metal parts for the frame are manufactured here .
