`` People have forgiveness in their hearts , '' said Eliot Spitzer , a former crime-fighting prosecutor and then governor who resigned in 2008 after revelations that he frequented prostitutes .

Spitzer , who briefly joined us at CNN as a TV host during his exile from elected politics , began his comeback campaign this week with a surprise decision to run for comptroller of New York City . The job would essentially make him the Big Apple 's accountant -- a huge demotion from his days running the entire state .

Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace

By contrast , Spitzer started late and had a rough first week simply trying to collect enough signatures to get a place on the ballot .

Spitzer has to hope that it 's something voters can overlook come September .

Is the road to redemption getting shorter ?

`` Ten minutes in politics is 50 years in anything else , '' said Hank Sheinkopf , a Democratic strategist who has worked with Spitzer in the past . `` And anything can happen , all times , any time , forever . ''

The prospect of the disgraced duo running ` the city that never sleeps ' has n't escaped the attention of America 's comedians .

In the words of late night TV host Conan O'Brien , `` New York is changing its name to the city that never sleeps with its wife . ''
