Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China has long banned the sale of certain books , but now it has banned media reports on the opening of a Taiwanese book chain in Shanghai .

A source at the Shanghai Labor Newspaper confirmed to CNN that the paper 's editor-in-chief on Thursday received a terse directive from the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Department not to report the deal .

The source , who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue , said the message was communicated by SMS text message , an unusual medium for propaganda directives to the media , which are typically delivered in writing .

`` Eslite respects the rules and regulations in mainland China , including those on the book market , '' she said .

Founded in 1989 , Eslite is Taiwan 's largest bookstore chain , with more than 40 locations , including a 24-7 branch in the capital of Taipei .

Its multi-story flagship in Taipei , located a block from the iconic Taipei 101 tower , is wildly popular among locals and tourists .

It opened its first overseas branch in August 2012 in Hong Kong , where titles banned on the mainland are freely available . While Hong Kong falls under Chinese sovereignty , the special administrative region enjoys a high degree of autonomy and is not subject to China 's regulations on banned material .
