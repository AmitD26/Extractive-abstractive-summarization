That 's understandable . Her heyday was a century ago . She was French and spent only a few years in the United States . Her work -- what little of it has survived -- generally lives on in museum collections .

But perhaps you should find out who she is . For Guy-Blache , who died in 1968 , was a pioneer in the film industry . She was the first female director . She was perhaps the first to create a narrative film . She was an innovator in storytelling and in business .

Pamela Green is trying to raise her profile .

Green and Jarik van Sluijs , her colleague at the Los Angeles design firm PIC , have created a Kickstarter campaign to secure funding for a documentary on Guy-Blache . The work-in-progress , called `` Be Natural '' -- after a common Guy-Blache acting instruction -- is attempting to raise $ 200,000 .

Green was inspired by a special about female pioneers in cinema , which also included Mary Pickford and Lois Weber .

`` Alice stuck with me , '' says Green . `` And when it was over , I was surprised that I did n't hear -LRB- more -RRB- about her . ''

She started her own company , Solax Films , in 1910 , and set up a state-of-the-art studio in Fort Lee , New Jersey , two years later -- the first woman to own a studio . She oversaw more than 1,000 films , many noted for their pioneering use of light , composition and even synchronized sound .

`` She had a very important place in film history , '' says Thomas J. Slater , a film scholar at Indiana University of Pennsylvania who specializes in the silent era . `` She was more than just a filmmaker -- she also knew how to organize a production company and get her work out there . ''

Slater suspects that a combination of factors caused Guy-Blache to fall into anonymity . The business moved to Hollywood ; Guy-Blache never really made the move . At the same time , her husband , Herbert Blache , took control of Solax , and she eventually returned to France and divorced him .

It was a different atmosphere in the teens and early '20s , says Slater . At the time a number of women were screenwriters and directors . But once the business started consolidating , women 's creative positions `` dropped off drastically , '' he says . Even Weber , one of the most accomplished directors of the teens , was largely forgotten .

Though the film will make use of old stills and Guy-Blache 's work , Green and van Sluijs want it to have a modern look , where -- thanks to computer effects -- the viewer will practically feel inside the frame . The two have the experience : as established creative directors , they 've produced sequences for such films as `` The Cabin in the Woods , '' `` 42 '' and `` The Muppets . '' The trailer for `` Be Natural '' invites you into another time .

Green is hopeful they 'll make it across the finish line . After all , just because she 's little known does n't mean that Alice Guy-Blache is any less inspirational , says Green .
