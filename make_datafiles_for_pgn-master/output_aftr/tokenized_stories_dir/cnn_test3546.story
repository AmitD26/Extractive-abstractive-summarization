-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Maya is about to become the most famous CIA operative since Valerie Plame .

Except that 's not her real name . We 're not allowed to know her real name . Maya is the name of her character in the film `` Zero Dark Thirty '' , which is already generating controversy for its depiction of the hunt for Osama bin Laden .

Thus it was that the Washington Post ran a highly unusual front-page profile of someone whose name is unknown . The woman was passed over for a promotion , the story says , and is an abrasive sort who e-mailed colleagues saying they did n't deserve to share in a prestigious award she received for her role in the mission . -LRB- By the way , what does it take to get a government promotion if helping eliminate the world 's top terrorist does n't qualify ? -RRB-

In the movie , Maya seems to have a messianic streak , saying after a female colleague was killed during an attack in Afghanistan : `` I believe I was spared so I could finish the job . ''

Did the real-life Maya actually say that ? Who knows ? Kathryn Bigelow , the director , says she tried to approach the project as a journalist . But even the best docudramas tend to mix reconstructed facts with cinematic liberties .

It 's hardly surprising that this has become the film 's flash point . Liberals and conservatives in this country spent much of the Bush years arguing over whether waterboarding is torture and whether such coercive techniques , whatever they are called , helped or hurt in the war on terror .

But the pro-Obama suggestion is , well , less than preposterous . Bigelow made this film with the help of officials at the Pentagon , CIA and White House who provided her with extraordinary access . President Obama makes only a brief appearance , but the movie highlights the biggest success of his first term , culminating a manhunt that began after the 9/11 attacks .

The film can only help burnish his reputation , and the cooperation began soon after one of the most classified missions in U.S. history . When a director gets that kind of official help , it raises troubling questions about the objectivity of those rendering the instant history .

Opinion : Did torture really net bin Laden ?

Bigelow has every right to work whatever sources she can , and every administration tries to influence media coverage , but rarely do Hollywood and government work so obviously hand in glove .

As for Maya , we may never learn whether she liked her portrayal in `` Zero Dark Thirty . ''

Valerie Plame was outed against her will ; even if Maya 's real-life counterpart decides to resign and go public , she would be prohibited by secrecy agreements from discussing her role in the mission . The most likely outcome is that the CIA operative who helped nab bin Laden will remain an unknown if flawed heroine .
