Merian C. Cooper 's 1933 classic fantasy tale of a giant gorilla has become a musical reality at the Regent Theatre , in Melbourne , Australia -- thanks to a six-meter high robotic puppet , and the pioneering work of puppeteer Sonny Tilders .

The animatronics expert leads a 35-strong team at The Creature Technology Company in west Melbourne and has an impressive track record in both film and theater .

The 46-year-old has more than two decades ' experience making high-tech puppets and counts `` Stars Wars -- Revenge of the Sith '' and `` The Chronicles of Narnia '' among his many movie credits .

The rubber and rabbit fur model seen hanging off the Empire State Building swatting bi-planes in the original film was 24 inches tall . The modern stage incarnation of Kong stands six meters high and weighs more than a ton .

When the multi-million dollar project started five years ago , Tilders originally set out to create a fully animatronic creature but ended up combining old-fashioned puppetry with modern robotics .

Around 300 meters of electrical wiring are crammed inside the puppet 's steel and aluminum shell powering 16 microprocessors and 15 servo motors which move Kong 's eyes , eyebrows and eyelids , nose , lips , jaw , neck and shoulders . He also makes sounds -- a vital part of making his movements appear realistic , says Tilders .

From the elbow down , Kong 's arms are filled with air , allowing him to furiously pound the floor without causing a minor earthquake .

Overlaying the air bags are a series of sculptured muscle bags made from a stretchy nylon material that expands and contracts to mimic the sinewy movements of the real thing .

`` It 's a machine that allows Kong to both move around the stage and be raised up and down but also take different positions , '' said Stage Technologies ' Group CEO Mark Ager .

`` We move his torso with eight winches and that allows us to change the aspect of it . So , for instance , when he walks , his shoulders can roll from side to side . It 's basically a big boys version of a wooden cross you see on smaller puppets . ''

The company , which is currently helping pop star Pink fly around stage on her world tour , has previously assisted Tilders with the Walking with Dinosaurs project , helping create a flying prehistoric bird called an Ornithocheirus .

But the complexity of Kong surpassed anything they have previously built , leading to a few nerves as opening night approached .

`` Given -LRB- Kong -RRB- is the main actor it was quite a concern , but it is incredible , '' he said .

`` There 's an awful lot of engineering that goes into something that looks so effortless . He feels real . I think you have to see inferior robotic incarnations to see quite how clever -LRB- Kong -RRB- is . ''

Overall , it 's been an extraordinary collaboration of engineering and software expertise with sculptors , artists , musicians and actors creating a unique spectacle .

The critics like it too . Many have warmed to the show itself since it opened in June and almost all have heaped lavish praise on Kong himself . It 's only a matter of time before audiences worldwide get their chance to feel the towering stage presence of Kong , said Tilders .
