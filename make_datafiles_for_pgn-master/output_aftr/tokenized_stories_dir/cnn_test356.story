-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unlike their Western counterparts , Africans take elections very seriously -- rising up early to queue patiently in line for hours under the hot sun and cast their ballots . Any misguided attempt to nullify or steal their votes will evoke a strong reaction from them . In fact , it explains why the destruction of an African country often begins with a dispute over the electoral process or transfer of power .

In recent years , allegations of electoral fraud have stirred political violence and civil war , causing death and destruction in Ethiopia -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , Kenya -LRB- 2007 -RRB- , Zimbabwe -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , DR Congo -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , among others .

The adamant refusal of their respective leaders to relinquish or share power damaged or destroyed these African countries : Liberia -LRB- 1990 -RRB- , Somalia -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , Rwanda -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , Zaire , now Congo DR , -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , Sierra Leone -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , Ivory Coast -LRB- 2000 , 2011 -RRB- , Egypt -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , Libya -LRB- 2011 -RRB- .

What are the secrets to Ghana 's democratic success or maturity that other African countries can learn from ?

In Africa , radio is the life and death of information transmission and the proliferation of FM radio stations in Ghana provided an invaluable tool to expose problems , hold government accountable and ensure transparent elections . In the 2000 elections , for example , FM Radio stations sent their reporters to every polling station . Anything suspicious or unseemly was immediately reported on the air , leading electoral officers and observers to rush to the scene and fix the problem on the spot .

Watch : Media 's role in Ghanaian politics

One with impressive credentials is the Institute of Economic Affairs -LRB- IEA -RRB- , which organized the presidential debates . The IEA also facilitated the crafting of a `` Political Parties Code of Conduct '' and the setting up of a National Enforcement Body to enforce the code . Eight parties have signed on . The code ensures that the political parties behave responsibly and can be held liable for any unlawful or unethical acts they commit .

In most other African countries , the space for civic activism is severely restricted . In Ethiopia , journalists critical of the government have been branded `` terrorists '' and jailed .

The third important factor has been the maturing of political leaders , which was stupendously displayed in the 2008 elections , which the ruling NDC party won by a mere 40,000-vote margin . Elsewhere on the continent , an election that close would have spelled trouble -- angry calls for a recount and descent into violence . But Nana Akuffo-Addo , the losing candidate and now a contender , graciously conceded defeat .

Having hosted refugees fleeing political violence and mayhem in neighboring countries , Ghanaian politicians and the people are now well aware of the destructive consequences an irresponsible political decision may cause .

Political maturity was also on full display following the death of former president John Atta-Mills in July . Not only was the transition to a new president extraordinarily smooth but Ghanaians of all shades and stripes , buried their differences and came together to grieve over their departed president . A violent and chaotic election this week would dishonor his memory .

A nod should also be given to regional leaders , in particular those of Ghana 's neighbors . Borders are porous in Africa and violence in one country can send refugees streaming across the border .

Ghana has hosted refugees from civil wars in Liberia and Ivory Coast . In the past , regional leaders have also helped ensure free , fair and transparent elections in Ghana . For example , for the 2000 elections , the former and late president of Togo , Gnassingbe Eyadema , closed the Ghana/Togo border to prevent some of his citizens from crossing it to vote illegally in Ghana 's elections .

The fourth factor has been sheer luck . Ghana was fortunate to have one of its sons , Kofi Annan , serve as the United Nations Secretary-General -LRB- 1997-2006 -RRB- and co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize .

Though other African countries may not have a `` Kofi Annan , '' the other three factors are still potent in ensuring free , fair and peaceful elections .
