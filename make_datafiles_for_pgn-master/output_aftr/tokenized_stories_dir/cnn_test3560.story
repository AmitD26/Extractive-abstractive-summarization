Then , the very next morning , the same prosecutor asked for Navalny 's release pending his appeal . It was a move so unexpected that an incredulous Navalny asked the court to make sure the prosecutor had not been swapped for an identical twin overnight .

That this strange occurrence happened to the most prominent member of the anti-Putin opposition movement is therefore shocking and meaningful . In Putin 's Russia , political dissidents simply do not get out of jail . Mikhail Khodorkovsky , once Russia 's wealthiest man , has been imprisoned since his October 2003 arrest for the `` crime '' of disloyalty to Putin .

Everyone knows his jail term is exactly as long as Putin 's stay in power , no shorter and no longer . It is no coincidence that Navalny 's sentence will leave him in prison safely beyond the 2018 presidential elections .

The motivations for Navalny 's brief respite are unclear , and will likely always remain so , but it likely reflects factional infighting inside the Kremlin . Putin 's main allies , the security and intelligence forces known as the siloviki , advocate ever-greater repression . They want to jail every opposition leader and activist and prevent any legitimate expression of democracy .

Former Putin classmate Alexander Bastrykin is the leader and symbol of the siloviki camp . As former top prosecutor and current chief of the powerful Investigative Committee , Bastrykin is the administration 's main weapon against political and social resistance .

It is likely Sobyanin and those in the Kremlin sympathetic to his position on social unrest were behind Navalny 's release . Sobyanin craves the legitimacy of retaining his prestigious position as the mayor of Moscow in a relatively fair contest against Navalny . He believes this would position him as a leading contender to succeed Putin when the dictator inevitably falls .

Sobyanin is hardly a democrat , but his selfish interests may work to bring democracy back to Russia . Conjecture aside , Navalny 's quick release was either incompetence or high-level internal sabotage -- and neither possibility is good news for Putin .

This matters , because the policeman on the Moscow street gets his strength from the knowledge that his superiors will support him unconditionally . He can crack open a protester 's skull knowing his captain will defend his action . The captain knows the colonel will defend him because the general will protect him , the judges will protect them , and so on all the way up to the plushest chair in Putin 's office .

This unbroken chain is critical and a public weakening of the links at the top means Red Square moves a bit closer to Tahrir Square . The protests that erupted after Navalny 's conviction were the largest unsanctioned rallies since 2011 and the police let them happen nearly without incident . -LRB- The prosecution 's request to release Navalny was made immediately after the verdict was read . -RRB- There is doubt in the ranks because they sense doubt at the top . If Navalny is set free , wonders the police captain , should he give the order to beat those protesters demonstrating in his name ?

This may be only a brief moment of hesitation , but it is real . Cracks are appearing in the faÃ § ade elsewhere as well . Mikhail Prokhorov , the oligarch who pretended to be an opposition candidate in last year 's presidential election without saying a word against Putin , is now openly supporting Yaroslavl mayor Yevgeny Urlashov after he was arrested on bribery charges . -LRB- Kremlin partners do not suffer such indignities . -RRB-

Navalny is a real fighter and he has thousands of enthusiastic volunteers to campaign for him and to closely observe the election process on September 8 . There are only bad choices for the Kremlin at this point . Their fear of Navalny and the movement he represents is provoking conflict and confusion .

We should not let avid speculation distract us from the cruel reality of Navalny 's situation -- and of Putin 's Russia . The lives of opposition members and journalists are worth very little . A man will spend five years in a labor camp for nothing more than speaking openly his opposition to Vladimir Putin . Navalny 's former colleague , Pyotr Ofitserov , refused to testify against him and got a four-year sentence . He has five young children . And for every case you hear about , there are dozens of others forming this new generation of political prisoners under Putin .
