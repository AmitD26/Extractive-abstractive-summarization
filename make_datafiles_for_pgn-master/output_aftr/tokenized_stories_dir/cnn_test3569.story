-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Condemned for his self-confessed belief in fascist ideals , yet congratulated for acts of admirable sportsmanship .

Perhaps not surprisingly Italian Paolo di Canio 's rollercoaster career has guaranteed the Italian has occupied the front and back pages of British newspapers since he first came to the United Kingdom .

Fiery temperament

Born in Rome and raised through Lazio 's youth ranks , the first half of Di Canio 's career included stints with some of Europe 's most famous clubs -- and plenty of rows with some of Italy 's most respected coaches .

The playmaker clashed with Giovanni Trapattoni at Juventus before incurring the ire of Fabio Capello at AC Milan and then heading to Scotland in 1996 where he flourished during one season with Celtic .

It was after swapping Scotland for the English Premier League 's Sheffield Wednesday in 1997 that the complexity of Di Canio 's character was laid bare .

The Roman became front page news in September 1998 when he shoved referee Paul Alcock to the ground after being sent off in a match against Arsenal .

During four years at Upton Park , Di Canio left an indelible mark on West Ham and the Premier League .

`` It was sportsmanship of the highest merit , '' Harry Redknapp , West Ham manager at the time , said of Di Canio 's act .

`` Paolo thought the goalkeeper might have a broken leg and refused to take advantage . ''

Values of civility

After returning to Lazio in 2004 , Di Canio made remarks which he has refused to clarify following his appointment at Sunderland .

`` I am a facist , not a racist , '' Di Canio once told an Italian news agency .

Since his appointment at Sunderland , Di Canio has insisted that he doesn ' want to talk about politics , though in 2005 he was willing to aim a straight-arm salute at Lazio 's fans which , he claimed , was directed at `` my people '' . Was that a political or just a sporting gesture ?

`` I saluted my people with what for me is a sign of belonging to a group that holds true values , values of civility against the standardization that this society imposes upon us . ''

Who Di Canio 's people are is the subject of much debate , but in his autobiography he described himself as `` fascinated '' with Italy 's former fascist leader Benito Mussolini , who enacted anti-Semitic laws and oversaw the deporting of thousands of Italian Jews to concentration and death camps .

Di Canio is not the only Italian footballer or manager to express sympathy with Fascism or flirted with the ideology , notably Daniele De Rossi , Christian Abbiati , Gianluigi Buffon and Alberto Aquilani .

As a club , Lazio has been punished for racism offences four times this season .

A statement issued by Sunderland following Di Canio 's appointment declared that to suggest he held fascist or racist views was to question `` the integrity of the club '' .

While Di Canio faces scrutiny off the pitch , on it his new team are sinking without a trace .

As always , Di Canio plans to meet his latest challenge head on .

Over to you , Paolo ...
