-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said he 'll leave the Ecuadorian Embassy in London `` soon '' after living there for two years to avoid extradition to Sweden .

`` I can confirm I am leaving the embassy soon , but not for the reason you might think , '' Assange said at a news conference Monday .

Ecuador 's foreign minister , who sat next to him , said his freedom is long overdue .

`` The situation must come to an end ... two years is too long , '' Ricardo Patino said . `` It is time to free Julian Assange . It is time for his human rights to be respected . ''

Swedish authorities want to question him over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another .

He denies the allegations and describes them as politically motivated .

Assange says he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States , where he could face the death penalty if he is charged and convicted of publishing government secrets through WikiLeaks .

In addition to the Guantanamo procedures manual , it also published documents related to U.S. activities in Iraq and Afghanistan , and diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies .

In August 2010 , Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him over allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers .

He turned himself in to London authorities the same year , and was remanded in custody .

At the time , a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden , and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court . It denied his appeal .

In June 2012 , Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum , which was granted in August of the same year .

He 's been living at the embassy in London since then .
