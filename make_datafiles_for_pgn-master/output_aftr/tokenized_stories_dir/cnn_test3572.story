Dozens of passengers slept at the airport Wednesday night , with some waiting nearly 12 hours before their aircraft were cleared for takeoff .

`` Some did lose their tempers , but it was all worked out amicably , '' airport spokesman Greg Meyer told CNN via e-mail .

Spirit announced Thursday afternoon that all checks had been completed and apologized for the delays .

`` We are working diligently to get our customers where they need to go as quickly as possible , '' airline spokeswoman Misty Pinson said . `` We expect to be back to regular schedule later this evening . As always , the safety of our customers is our No. 1 priority . ''

Besides one flight cancellation , passengers on Atlantic City-bound Flight 268 may have experienced the worst delays . They waited nearly 12 hours to depart on a flight scheduled to take off Wednesday night at 8:15 p.m. . They did n't leave until Thursday morning at 8:08 a.m. , according to airport flight departure records .

One angry passenger was Rafael Hernandez , who was trying to get home to Chicago . Hernandez told CNN affiliate CBS4 in Miami that authorities escorted him out of the terminal after he lost his temper . `` It has been a disaster . I was so frustrated . I 'm never ever going to fly Spirit again , '' he said .

The safety checks take about 45 minutes per aircraft , and were expected to be completed Thursday morning , she wrote .
