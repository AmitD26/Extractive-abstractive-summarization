The two-man team is heading to Antarctica to attempt to walk the 2,987 kilometer -LRB- 1,800 mile -RRB- journey to the South Pole and back . If they succeed , it will be the longest unsupported polar journey in history .

His rival Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had claimed the honor 33 days earlier .

`` I ca n't imagine what their morale must have been turning around at the Pole , having found a Norwegian flag there , and having to walk all the way back to the coast , '' says Saunders .

It has been more than a century since Scott died on that return journey and while many have since visited the South Pole , no one has ever even attempted to walk the entire round trip without a support team .

`` It just seemed to be hanging out there as a journey that ought to be finished , '' says Saunders , who will attempt the feat .

A century on , Saunders and L'Herpiniere will still face the same brutal Antarctic conditions as Scott .

They will have to negotiate ever-changing glaciers riddled with crevasses where temperatures plunge as low as -50 degrees Celsius -LRB- -58 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- .

But what they will have is state-of-the-art equipment and technology .

The ability to communicate could not only be potentially life-saving , but will also allow Saunders to upload blogs , video and photographs to the Scott Expedition website throughout what he hopes will be a ground-breaking four-month journey .
