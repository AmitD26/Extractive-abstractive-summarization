Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While reaching out to supporters through one of the latest high-tech means , President Obama expanded his social media experience by holding a Google + video chat room interview Monday afternoon .

The president was also asked to sing and dance , -LRB- which he refused -RRB- to say hello to one of the questioners ' young children , and from an Obama impersonator a question about the impact of comedy sketches on the election .

`` We 're starting to see some signs that the economy is picking up . We 've created 3 million jobs over 22 months , and we saw the largest boost in manufacturing jobs that we 've seen since the '90s . Best job growth we 've seen since 2005 . But we 've still got a lot more to do , '' President Obama said . `` I have to keep this recovery going , that 's why it 's so important for us to extend the payroll tax cut . ''

Jennifer Wedel in Corpus Christi , Texas , asked the president why the government continues to extend visas for immigrant workers when there are many people , like her husband , who have been out of work .

President Obama offered to look at her husband 's resume to help him find an engineering job . `` Forward me his resume , '' he told her . `` The word we 're getting is someone in that high-tech field should be able to find something right away . I want to follow up on that . ''

The questions were chosen by Google team members from among the most top-rated of those submitted . Google maintains the White House had no role in the selection of the participants .

Obama also held a similar Facebook town hall at the Web giant 's headquarters in Palo Alto , California , in the spring , and a YouTube town hall at the White House in February .
