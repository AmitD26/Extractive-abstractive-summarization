First of all America has gone through shutdowns before . Andrew Stiles notes in National Review that the U.S government has shut down 17 times since 1976 . The vast majority of those shutdowns happened when the Democrats controlled the House . They happened under Jimmy Carter over abortion policy -LRB- remember when that divided the Democrats ? -RRB- and under Ronald Reagan , mostly about budget priorities -- including efforts to nix Reagan 's pet projects -LRB- sound familiar ? -RRB- . During the 21-day face-off between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich , unemployment fell slightly and America emerged with a welfare reform deal . Not too bad .

Those shutdowns remind us that U.S. politics have always been partisan and rancorous -- as the two-party system was established with the intention of being . Honest , heated debate is part of being a democratic nation .

Before the 1960s , progressive legislation in the House was constantly stonewalled by coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans -- a bloc that it took a civil rights revolution to undo . In the 1940s , Harry Truman found his legislation blocked by a `` do-nothing '' Congress of Republicans -LRB- although that Congress still got a lot done -RRB- . Of course , in the 19th century , partisan divisions reflected the battle lines of a bloody civil war . Abraham Lincoln 's superhuman effort to get a ban on slavery through Congress testifies to the timelessness of the battle between executive and legislature .

And Congress in recent decades has rarely been popular . True , today a shockingly low 10 % of the population approves of its performance . But its rating never exceeded 40 % throughout the 1970s and 1980s and sunk to 20 % in 1979 and 1992 .

The polls also show that the shutdown is bad politics , and that the public blames the GOP for it . But would we rather the House do exactly as the president tells it to and not follow its conscience on the vital subjects of health care and finance ?
