-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was certainly an unprecedented surprise when Saudi Arabia announced -- on 18 October , only a day after its election to one of the 10 rotating seats on the U.N. Security Council -- that it was turning down the chance to participate in the world 's top forum for discussion of international issues .

After all , the last few years have , if anything , seen an increase in Saudi Arabia 's international profile -- particularly as a member of the G20 -- and in its regional activism .

Moreover , all the signs had been that they had seriously prepared for their role on the Security Council , including training their New York team in how best to make an impact .

So what happened ?

The Saudi statement turning down the seat spoke of international double standards and the international community 's failure to resolve key conflicts , homing in on the Syria crisis , the long-running sore of the Palestinian issue , and the failure to achieve a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction . The Saudis demanded reforms to the Security Council , and said they would refrain from membership until that body was capable of discharging its responsibilities to maintain international peace and security .

Of course , many countries outside the magic circle of the Permanent Five -LRB- the UK , U.S. , France , Russia and China -RRB- have wanted to see Security Council reform , and some of the P5 countries have themselves worried that the Council 's failure to reflect changing patterns of world power -- and the wider ability to open up the government of international bodies to new players -- will inevitably eat into the legitimacy and credibility of the U.N. .

While one can also point to Saudi unhappiness with Western policy towards Egypt , it seems clear that it is above all the Saudi sense of Western failure over Syria which has driven their decision , as it did when Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud declined to address this year 's U.N. General Assembly . At the start of the Syrian crisis , the Saudis hoped that President Bashar al-Assad would go far enough to meet the demands of the Syrian people so as to avoid a crisis . When Assad -- never in any case one of their heroes -- chose repression instead , there was no mistaking the note of genuine moral outrage which came from the very top of the Saudi system , from King Abdullah himself .

They worry too -- inevitably , and ironically like Israel -- that Western limpness on the Syrian agenda prefigures a willingness to accept a less than satisfactory deal with Iran , cutting Tehran too much slack in the regional strategic equation .
