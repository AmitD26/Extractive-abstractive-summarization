-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- It turns out moviegoers want fire and ice this Thanksgiving .

Both `` The Hunger Games : Catching Fire '' and Disney 's `` Frozen '' are thriving at the box office , so much so that the films are on track to break records and achieve the two best Thanksgiving five-day weekends of all time .

`` Catching Fire '' earned $ 20.7 million on Wednesday and $ 14.9 million on Thursday . That $ 35.6 million haul puts the film on track for a five-day weekend of about $ 100-105 million , which will handily beat `` Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone '' $ 82.4 million gross over the same period of time in 2001 . Remarkably , `` Catching Fire '' will have earned about $ 290 million after just 10 days of release , and if it keeps up this pace , it will easily outdo the original `` Hunger Games ' '' $ 408 million domestic total .

Judi Dench 's Oscar contender has grossed just under $ 1 million from 753 theaters in two days . No numbers for Spike Lee 's `` Oldboy '' have come in just yet .
