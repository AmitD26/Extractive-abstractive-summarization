-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The former lead investigator in the JonBenet Ramsey case says that newly released documents may spark renewed interest , but they have little effect on the cold case investigation .

Previously sealed court documents released Friday show that a Colorado grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents of the slain 6-year-old JonBenet on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime .

The district attorney decided that year , however , not to file charges against John and Patricia Ramsey , saying there was insufficient evidence . In 2008 , a new district attorney said new DNA evidence cleared the parents and their son in the death .

Kolar wrote a book about JonBenet 's killing and said he does not believe that there was an intruder at the Ramsey house that night , implying that the Ramsey family -- the late Patricia Ramsey , her husband John and their son Burke -- know more than they have told .

`` That 's a very complicated question . I think there are a lot of things that could be considered missing from the D.A. 's perspective to be able to bring them to a threshold of prosecuting beyond a reasonable doubt , '' Kolar said .

Still , the documents released Friday are an important part of the history of the case .
