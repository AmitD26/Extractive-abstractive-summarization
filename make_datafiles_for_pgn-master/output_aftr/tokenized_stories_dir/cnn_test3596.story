We live in a time of instant outrage . The explosion of social media and the demands of the 24-hour news cycle let us immediately express our self-righteous anger about any incident , while the content-desperate media eagerly report -- and repackage -- our rage .

Any chance they wanted the public backlash to make the show , which has seen ratings woes in recent years , more relevant ? -LRB- And ratings did rise for Sunday 's Oscar telecast 11 % in the coveted 18-49 age group . -RRB- Make no mistake : Our outrage has value .

It even happened to me last weekend when I was on CNN with anchor Don Lemon and playfully joked about Canada . Bingo ! My Twitter feed was instantly filled with Canadians incensed that I had the audacity to poke fun at their beloved country . Just to be clear , I have nothing against Canada . In fact , it 's my third favorite country in North America .

There 's so much more : Beyonce 's halftime Super Bowl outfit ; Hulk Hogan tweeting a photo of his daughter 's legs ; Kim Kardashian tweeting a photo of her diamond-encrusted gun ; NBA star LeBron James wearing a T-shirt that some claim was about devil worship and/or a symbol for the illuminati .

I get it . We all want to have our opinions heard . When we are mad about something , we want others to know about it . When we are offended , we want to call out the person who has offended us . I 'm no different .

But here 's the thing : Why not also unleash our collective fury over issues more meaningful than just a comedian 's joke or a celebrity 's tweet ? I 'm not suggesting we ignore those -- because even if I did , no one would listen . But in addition to those , take a moment to express your powerful outrage over issues that might tangibly benefit your life and the lives of others .

Let 's get collectively angry that every nine seconds , a woman in the United States is assaulted or beaten . And let 's get even angrier that three women a day in the United States are killed by domestic violence attacks .

Sure , go ahead and be outraged over Joan Rivers ' and Seth MacFarlane 's jokes if you must , but let 's show some anger about the fact that almost 10,000 Americans died in gun violence last year and still Congress has n't passed a universal background check to ensure that criminals and mentally ill people ca n't legally buy guns .
