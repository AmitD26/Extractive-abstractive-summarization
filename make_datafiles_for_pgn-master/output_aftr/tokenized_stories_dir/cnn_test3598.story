From snow villages to pyrotechnic-laced skiing theater to ice hotels built from blocks of the cold stuff , we 've created a roundup of the best frozen getaways around the world . With vacation ideas in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres , the snowbirder in you can express its inner penguin almost any time of year .

The Harbin Ice Festival , China

The festival begins in December and runs through the end of February .

`` It was as weird and wonderful as it sounds . Big replicas of famous buildings from around the world . Working restaurants and hotels and shops made of ice , '' said Tim Harper , a professor at CUNY and editor of the CUNY Journalism Press , who visited the Harbin Ice Festival in 2005 . .

`` All sorts of ice art and games . And thousands of people wandering in couples or small groups , nearly all smiling and eating frozen fruit on a stick . ''

Icehotel , Sweden

Now in its 23rd incarnation , Sweden 's Icehotel is the longest running hotel of its kind in the world , with 50 rooms . There is even a chapel so couples can plan an icy wedding and stay overnight with their guests .

Located 200 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle near the Torne River , the hotel in Jukkasjärvi is the largest in the world made entirely out of natural ice and snow from the Torne River , Karlsson said .

Rooms are a chic mix of glassy ice furniture , fur throws and ornate ice chandeliers . Even with frozen water as its building blocks , the indoor temperature remains roughly 5 to 7 degrees Celsius , or in the low 40s Fahrenheit .

`` The Hannibal spectacle is unique in the Alps , '' with more than 500 artists performing on a huge natural stage , said Sarah Ennemoser of the Ötztal Valley tourism office .

Ski by day and dance by night , too , with the Electric Mountain Festival international DJ event , going on through March .

Tierra del Fuego

Many travelers think of South America as sultry , with images of Rio de Janeiro 's carnival and the Amazon burned into the mind .

The deepest south in South America is anything but , however . A wild , unspoiled region of ice-covered mountains , glaciers and the frozen tundra of endless Patagonia , which stretches between Chile and Argentina .

One of the most comfortable ways to see this region is through Cruceros Australis , a cruise company operating in Southern Chile 's Tierra del Fuego and around Cape Horn and the Straight of Magellan , an area Charles Darwin passed through on his famous Beagle voyage . Passengers explore the scenery and the amazing wildlife , from penguins to sea lions to whales , on at least two mini-expeditions a day in zodiacs , returning to the comfort of the ship to socialize over a glass of Chilean wine or scotch served over 40,000-year-old glacier ice .

Ships sail during South America 's warm season , running roughly from the end of September through the end of March .

If you ca n't get to Chile during the warm season , head there during South America 's winter to ski at Portillo in the Chilean Andes , about two hours from Santiago .

Polar bear watching , Churchill , Hudson Bay , Manitoba

Who does n't love polar bears ? Truth is , global warming means within the next few decades the world 's polar bear population is expected to rapidly plummet . With an environmentally mindful operator , you can see polar bears live in Churchill , on the Hudson Bay in Manitoba Province , Canada .

Other companies have remote lodges in the middle of bear territory . `` The bears come all the way up to the fence , '' of the lodges , said Foxcraft .

Montreal is also paying homage to a nearby U.S. cultural capital this year with a `` New York on Ice '' Snow Village . Stay overnight in all that icy goodness in the village 's 25-room ice hotel , which has meeting rooms for events and boasts the 100-seat Pommery Ice Restaurant .

The thrill of Alaska 's wild frontier combined with the pleasure of fishing is what Fishtale River Guides offers outdoor enthusiasts ,

This year ice fishing trips started much earlier in November , but a very warm season may mean waiting to ice fish until late in December , he said . The season usually lasts into late March or early April .

The thrill of fishing here has both to do with the size and quantity of the catch .

`` The largest landlocked salmon we caught on an ice fishing trip was likely about 16 inches . In the summertime , the largest king salmon taken by my guests have weighed in at 56 pounds . ''

Most of the tour participants are locals from Anchorage , making it a great way to get to know Alaska . Beyond fishing , there is nearby skiing , dog sledding and snowmobile tours , as well as airplane flights to see the wilderness .

Antarctica

If you really want ice , there 's no place like Antarctica , the frozen continent . It 's perhaps the most otherworldly experience a traveler can have while still on Earth .

Oceanwide Expeditions , a Dutch company with an office in Houston , has trips that pass from Ushuaia in Argentina 's most southern Patagonia .

Their Atlantic Odyssey cruise is the ultimate in ice vacations , lasting nearly 40 days , with visits to the Antarctic peninsula , the South Shetland Islands , South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands .

Antarctica is rich in wildlife , from whales to sea lions to Emperor penguins and many other species of birds . Zodiac boats allow for passengers to get close to the animals , with expert guides explaining the wildlife .

Expeditions run during the Southern Hemisphere summer , from approximately November to April . The experience can be life changing , said sales manager Florian Piper .

`` Our passengers experience and learn about the fragile nature of the polar regions . They become ambassadors for life . ''
