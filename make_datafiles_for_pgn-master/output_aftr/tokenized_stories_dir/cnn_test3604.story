But Jane Austen 's best-known and most-loved novel , first published on January 28 , 1813 , and viewed by the author as her `` own darling child '' was n't an immediate hit .

`` It was very well received , and it made money , but it was n't a massive bestseller in her day , '' says Louise West , curator of the Jane Austen House Museum at Chawton , in Hampshire .

`` Austen is one of the very few real crossover writers , who are popular with the public and also feted by critics and academia -- it is very rare . ''

`` It 's not just any old love story , '' says West . `` It is also brilliantly written . Austen was the first truly modern novelist , and ` Pride and Prejudice ' is full of irony , craft , careful plotting -- you read it for the story , but you get all these other layers of richness too . ''

The book 's bicentenary is being marked throughout the year with a series of events , starting with an international `` Pride and Prejudice Readathon '' at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath on Monday , and including exhibitions and an outdoor theater production in London .

`` It is a multi-billion pound business , because nobody has to pay any royalties to the author , '' explains solicitor Mark Stephens . `` They can just go back to the original text and remake programs , and as a result they 're much cheaper to make . ''

`` That had a major impact for us , '' she says . `` At the time we had about 25,000 visitors a year , and that doubled almost overnight -- we had 58,000 visitors that year .

`` Everyone fell in love with Colin Firth . I do n't want to go on about him -- though I could , of course , '' she jokes . `` He was n't the only thing people loved about that version , but I 'd be lying if I said he had n't had a major impact . ''

David Lassman , of the Jane Austen Centre in Bath , agrees . `` The 1995 production really ignited the whole Jane Austen ` industry ' . ''

And it 's not just about the cash : Some fans say `` Pride and Prejudice '' has changed their life .

Austen herself wondered if the novel was `` too light and bright and sparkling , '' but for many it is just this uplifting tone which has `` taught them to hope . ''

`` Our visitors ' book is full of comments from people who 've come from around the world , telling us what ` Pride and Prejudice ' means to them , '' says West .

`` They range from the usual ` It 's my favourite book , ' and ` I love Darcy , ' to ` This book has saved me at times of great trial , ' she says , adding : `` Austen was even prescribed to soldiers in World War I , to help them get over shell shock . ''

Gurinder Chadha , director of 2005 Bollywood remake `` Bride & Prejudice '' says the story is universal -- whatever the setting .

And that , it would seem , is ... a truth universally acknowledged .
