`` I want to be clear , the early hours of the first day or two were very hectic , '' NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko told reporters Tuesday . `` There was not a lot of information . Much of what we knew came from a variety of sources -- some from the Japanese , some from the IAEA -LRB- International Atomic Energy Agency -RRB- and a great deal from the news media . ''

`` I do n't know if there were recordings at Three Mile Island , '' NRC spokesman Eliot Brenner said , referring to the 1979 meltdown at a Pennsylvania nuclear power plant . `` This is a way for us to give the American public a look -- a firsthand look -- at what we do in a time of crisis . ''

Jaczko acknowledged the transcripts show the confusion within the agency during the early days of the crisis triggered by the massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11 , 2011 , but said he believes they reflect well on the agency .

`` As challenging as these days were , I have never been more honored to be the chairman of this agency than I was while I was leading the staff in this response , '' Jaczko said . `` What we 're making public today is in effect a very important historical record , and I 'm tremendously proud of the important work here by the staff of the NRC . ''

Agency officials said the Fukushima experience demonstrated the `` significant limitation '' the United States had on getting information about an incident `` halfway around the world . ''

Officials also said that previous exercises in the command center had not fully prepared them for what turned out to be a months-long event that required teams of people working round-the-clock for months .
