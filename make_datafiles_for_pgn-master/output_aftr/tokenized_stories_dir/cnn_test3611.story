What I did n't know , was this is a man who was born to be famous and not even a life-threatening injury from a car accident would stop him .

His story is one made for the silver screen . It has all the elements that tug at your heart strings : family drama , near-death experience , triumph over adversity , ultimate success , and a plot that just keeps on going .

Real deal

From a young age , Iglesias showed his fancy footwork in Real Madrid 's junior league . Rising through the ranks , he would eventually become goalkeeper for Real 's reserve team .

Iglesias humbly admits he was never a real football talent but he had the discipline which would see him play with the biggest names of that generation .

Accident

While taking a curve in the road , the car he was driving crashed , leaving him clinging on to life . What would come would crush his dreams of ever playing football again . The crash compressed a nerve in his spine leaving him paralyzed from the chest down ; a paralysis that would see him bed-ridden for two years .

For Iglesias , that belief was crystallized in that devastating moment , and those challenging two years changed his life .

What he did not realize at the time was that it would all change for the better .

Musical discovery

A nurse who was treating him brought Julio a guitar . The gesture was two-fold : a distraction from the depression of what kind of a life would lie ahead , and a means to exercise the dexterity and strength in his fingers and hands .

He discovered a passion for music that he did n't know he had . And perhaps more than anything , a renewed purpose in life .

The rest as they say is history .

Eighty albums released in 14 languages , over 300 million records sold worldwide , and a devoted following of women who hear that something in his voice that knows no boundaries of language . Despite claiming to be `` not that great '' of a singer , Iglesias ' ability to connect to a global audience has served him well . He says it 's his passion for music and for people .

Perhaps , though , what they see is his vulnerability , a quality he himself says `` is the most attractive thing that an artist can have . ''
