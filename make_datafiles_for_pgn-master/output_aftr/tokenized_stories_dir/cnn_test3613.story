`` Eight years is plenty , '' he said . `` I do n't miss the spotlight . ''

Bush used the opening to land the first shot at the late-night host , who will go off the air next spring after 20 years on the tube .

`` You 're about to head out to pasture . Just wanted to see what you look like , before you got to the gate , '' he said to laughs .
