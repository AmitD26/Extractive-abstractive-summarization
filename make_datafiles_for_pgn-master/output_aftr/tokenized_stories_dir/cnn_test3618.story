Russia wo n't support any resolution that would authorize the use of force against Syria if it does n't comply , Lavrov said Tuesday .

But the United States and France want to keep the threat of force on the table if Syria does n't comply . Those allies say they are convinced that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's regime was behind a chemical weapons attack in opposition areas that , according to U.S. estimates , killed more than 1,400 people .

U.N. weapons inspectors reported Monday that an August 21 attack outside Damascus had been carried out using the nerve gas sarin . Tuesday , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the findings should spur member states to bring the bloodshed in Syria to a halt , urging both Washington and Moscow to `` demonstrate their leadership . ''

`` Let us be clear : the use of chemical weapons in Syria is only the tip of the iceberg , '' he said . `` The suffering in Syria must end . ''

Though the inspectors did not assign blame for the attack , a U.S. analysis of their report shows the Syrian regime was responsible for the August 21 massacre outside Damascus , State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters in Washington .

One of the munitions identified in the report , a 120-millimeter improvised rocket , has been linked to previous attacks by the al-Assad regime , and `` we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket . ''

In addition , the environmental , chemical , and medical samples collected by U.N. investigators `` provide clear and compelling evidence '' that the rockets used in the attack contained sarin gas , a nerve agent , she said . `` We know the regime possesses sarin ; we have no evidence , however , that the opposition possesses sarin . ''

She added that the United States reserves the right to take military action . Though diplomacy is the preferred option , `` I do n't want to predict what the end result will be , '' she said .

Still , she was willing to predict that that end result would not include the status quo in Damascus . `` We do n't see a future for Assad , a future in Syria that includes Assad , '' she said .

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius shared Psaki 's view that the Syrian regime was responsible for the massacre .

But , at the same news conference , Lavrov brushed aside a question about blame . He noted that the U.N. inspectors in Syria were not tasked with figuring out who was responsible and that that was not the point of the U.N. report .

A scathing report

Inspectors found `` clear and convincing evidence '' that the nerve agent sarin was delivered by surface-to-surface rockets `` on a relatively large scale '' in the August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb , Ban said Monday .

The diplomatic quarrel over just who may have been responsible for the chemical weapons attack came as the toll from conventional weapons continued to mount . The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported that 70 people -- including four children and seven women -- were killed Tuesday nationwide .

Syrian-Turkish border tension

A blast rocked the Syrian side of the Turkish-Syrian border Tuesday , Turkey 's semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported .

Video shot by activists showed torrents of black smoke emerging from blazing vehicles at the crossing as survivors tried to help victims .

The LCC said the attack wounded many people .
