Whether it 's battling racism , offering a helping hand or long-overdue forgiveness , here are several practical suggestions to keep Mandela 's legacy alive .

Make the best of your current situation

His mother and eldest son both died while he was imprisoned .

While he had ample reason to remain bitter about his mistreatment , instead he wrote in `` Long Walk to Freedom , '' his 1995 autobiography , `` Prison is itself a tremendous education in the need for patience and perseverance . It is , above all , a test of one 's commitment . ''

`` I have been surprised a great deal sometimes when I see somebody who looks less than ordinary , but when you talk to the person and he -LRB- or she -RRB- opens his mouth , he is something completely different , '' Mandela said in the same interview about how his prison experience taught him to respect even the most ordinary people .

`` People are complex and dynamic , capable of change and evolving , '' Lemieux said . It would have been easy for Mandela to become and remain jaded after what he had experienced , Lemieux added .

Use your passion to persuade others

Lemieux said different situations are going to draw different things out people , but it 's never as simple as distilling the experience down to a `` type of person . '' Practically none of us knows how we will react in complex situations and interactions .

Change yourself first

`` One of the most difficult things is not to change society -- but to change yourself , '' Mandela said in 1999 at a tribute to billionaire businessman Douw Steyn , who had made his Johannesburg residence available to Mandela as a retreat after his prison release in 1990 .

While Mandela clearly fought for change in the world he lived in , he also changed himself .

While imprisoned , he reflected on his `` wild man '' behaviors . He also said he neglected to show any gratitude to those who had helped him when he was poor , after he experienced some success as a lawyer .

Lemieux points out his change from violence to peace was profound . Throughout the violence and chaos , ultimately , `` It was n't the violent conflict that led to social change . ''

`` But , the responsible airing of his weaknesses -- including his own acknowledgment -- in fact humanized Mandela and focused on his extraordinary strength of character and commitment in overcoming both his weaknesses and adversity in his own lifetime . It augmented Mandela 's greatness . ''

Mandela failed twice to complete his bachelor 's degree and readily admitted he was a poor student . Eventually he earned a law degree .

Six weeks after being elected President in 1994 , Mandela called on South Africans to solve the country 's `` profound education crisis , '' Bloomberg reported this year .

`` The task to make South Africa a learning and learned nation belongs to all of us , '' he said in a speech .

But the country 's schools are near the bottom in international rankings . Unqualified teachers , inadequate training and corruption are among the problems . Still , officials say almost all South African children now attend school , Bloomeberg reported .

`` Nelson Mandela made such a common gesture something transcendent -- a greeting that crossed all societal barriers , a symbol of reconciliation , even a declaration of victory , '' wrote CNN 's Tom Cohen in his piece , `` Nelson Mandela : Man of many handshakes . ''

Before meeting visiting dignitaries or political adversaries in five-star hotel conference rooms , Mandela made sure to approach the security guards , servers and other workers outside to shake their hands , Cohen wrote .

They went wild when Mandela concluded his final statement during a conference by offering his hand to F.W. de Klerk , South Africa 's last apartheid-era president , as an expression of unity , saying that despite their differences , he was willing to work with his adversary . De Klerk had little choice but to grasp it .

Maintain a sense of humor

`` You sharpen your ideas by reducing yourself to the level of the people you are with and a sense of humor and a complete relaxation , even when you 're discussing serious things , does help to mobilise friends around you . And I love that , '' Mandela said in a 2005 interview , published by the Nelson Mandela Foundation .

At election rallies in 1994 , Cohen wrote , Mandela repeatedly elicited trilling howls of ululation from women of all ages when he explained how voters should search their ballots for the picture of the `` very handsome young man '' -- referring to himself -- to mark their support for the ANC .

CNN 's Robyn Curnow examined Mandela 's the importance of his ability to `` charm and cajole . ''

`` The cult of Mandela had become so pronounced that celebrities , world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue-tied and gibbering when they met him , '' she said . `` Self-mockery was a typically savvy Mandela ploy to ensure that people would relax around him . ''

`` It enables me to go to bed with an enriching feeling in my soul and the belief that I am changing myself -LSB- by reconciling with former adversaries -RSB- , '' Mandela told the Christian Science Monitor about his experiences with Douw Steyn .

Steyn was a white businessman who befriended Mandela and began sharing his resources with the poor .

`` For someone who had been imprisoned , it -LRB- forgiveness -RRB- was a fundamentally transformative experience , '' Lemieux said . He explained that people unable to forgive may experience an inability to move forward .

Johann Lochner was a Johannesburg police officer from 1986 to 1990 . In an essay submitted to CNN iReport , Lochner describes responding to a shopping mall bombing scene and stepping over body parts .

`` We suspected that the deceased may have been affiliated with the Umkhonto we Sizwe , the militant arm of the African National Congress , '' Lochner wrote . He describes the police department , as well as the city , as `` greatly divided . ''

`` It 's almost like a miraculous , supernatural transformation had taken place in Mandela 's life , and consequently , in the whole nation .

`` Forgiveness freed Madiba , '' Lochner said , `` and forgiveness freed his country , ''
