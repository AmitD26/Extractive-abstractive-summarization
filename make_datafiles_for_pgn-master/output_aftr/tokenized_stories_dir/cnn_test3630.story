-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian President who will sit with U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday to discuss the state -- and the fate -- of Secretary of State John Kerry 's peace process is a good man and most likely the best partner for peace negotiations that Washington , this Israeli government or any other is likely to have . He 's rational , enlightened and a leader who eschews both violence and the dream that somehow , sometime , the armed struggle , or demography will deliver Palestinians their state .

But there 's only one pesky problem : Under current circumstances , he can not deliver his side of a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel .

Here 's why .

To diverge significantly from them would end his political viability and perhaps his life . Even the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat -- whose power , authority and legitimacy conferred some discretion and flexibility -- would n't agree to anything short of this consensus . I once heard Arafat remark , at the Camp David Summit : You wo n't walk behind my coffin . And Abbas has little of Arafat 's street cred . He is head of the Palestinian Authority , and the Palestinian Liberation Organization 's executive committee , but is master of none .

Divided Palestinians

Hamas has been greatly weakened . The ouster of Egypt 's Mohammed Morsy , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's troubles and Hamas ' need to distance itself from Syria have blocked its options . But , between Fatah and Hamas , the Palestinian national movement is still badly divided and resembles a kind of Palestinian Noah 's Ark : There are two of everything : statelets , security services , patrons , constitutions and visions of what Palestine is and even where it is .

The real problem is that any reconciliation of the two factions will likely further harden Palestinian positions , creating a `` tradeoff '' : internal peace in the Palestinian ranks but more tension with Israel , and probably the United States , too . And yet , unless the Palestinians find a way to assume control over the forces of violence in Palestine -- in short , one authority and one gun -- it 's hard to see how Israel , even if it could be persuaded to withdraw from the West Bank on paper , would ever do so in practice .

The Obama administration understandably can not deal with the Hamas issue now . Instead , it seems to subscribe to the `` Field of Dreams '' school of diplomacy : If you build it , they will come . According to this logic , an agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority would leave an already weakened Hamas no choice but to put up or shut up . The only problem is that for that to work , the `` it '' that they build would have to be an agreement so compelling that the vast majority of Palestinians would rally around it . That 's very hard to see now .

No help from Obama

Indeed , right now Obama 's priorities are Ukraine , Iran , preserving a domestic legacy and maintaining Democratic control of the Senate in the upcoming midterm elections . He has little incentive or capacity to forcefully press Netanyahu for a deal .

People may think that a second-term president freed from the need for re-election is free to take a big gamble . But it has really never been the absence of political constraints as much as it is the presence of real opportunity that drives presidents . Obama does n't want to fail .

The odds of a conflict-ending agreement between Netanyahu and Abbas in which the core issues that drive the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are resolved are slim to none . Think outcomes , not solutions .

Israel probably does n't have a Plan B. And Abbas ' fallback -- to go to the United Nations and rely on the international community and the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement -- does n't offer much promise without Washington pressuring Israel .
