-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This is all we know for sure :

Kari Bowerman , 27 , and Cathy Huynh , 26 , were backpacking in Vietnam while on break from their jobs teaching English in South Korea .

Two days later , Huynh was dead .

The travelers ' stories are just the latest in a string of mysterious tourist deaths in Southeast Asia . Investigators with the World Health Organization suspect poisoning is to blame , but determining the origin has proven difficult . Meanwhile , friends and family are desperate for answers .

Not yet determined

Almost immediately , international media reports began linking the deaths to an incident in Thailand in June in which two Canadian sisters died .

A hotel maid found Noemi and Audrey Belanger , 25 and 20 , in their room on Phi Phi Island more than 12 hours after their deaths . The sisters were covered in vomit , according to CBC News .

In February 2011 , New Zealand resident Sarah Carter , 23 , died in Chiang Mai , Thailand , after arriving at a local hospital with low blood pressure , difficulty breathing and dehydration from vomiting , according to the New Zealand television network TV3 .

Speculation on the cause arose with each death -- ranging from alcohol poisoning to something the victims ate .

As Bowerman 's relatives read story after story , they realized they were n't the only family frustrated and confused . The cause of death in every case was eerily similar to the one written on Kari 's death report : `` not yet determined . ''

Global citizens

Ashley is still in shock . Kari -- beautiful , adventurous , full-of-life Kari -- is dead .

Both Bowerman and Huynh were experienced travelers . Bowerman had applied for the teaching abroad program after graduating from Winona State University in Minnesota . She had already taught for two years in South Korea when the school asked her to come back for a second stint .

`` Those kids adored her , '' Jennifer Jaques said .

Huynh , originally from Hamilton , Ontario , had vacationed in China , Cuba and the United States , her high school friend Jetty Ly told CNN .

A frequent traveler himself , Von Seth had a large network of international acquaintances whom had never heard about this series of mysterious deaths and expressed concern .

Seeking answers

In 2011 , TV3 traveled to Chiang Mai , Thailand , to search for evidence in the Sarah Carter case . Show producers spoke with Dr. Ron McDowall , a United Nations toxic chemical consultant , who had reviewed Carter 's pathology reports and believed she died of pesticide ingestion .

According to the Environmental Protection Agency , chlorpyrifos can cause nausea , dizziness , confusion and , in high levels , respiratory paralysis and death .

The chemical is banned for use in homes and hotels in most countries , McDowall said . Yet it 's still legal in Thailand and Vietnam , he said , and was included in the pesticide sprayed in the Downtown Inn .

Evidence for the insecticide theory is mounting . Thai police recently announced they found traces of the insect repellent DEET in the Belanger sisters ' bodies , according CBC . Investigators believe the DEET was added as an ingredient to a popular cocktail served on the island .

The Downtown Inn was torn down this summer after the Thailand Disease Control Department concluded three of the deaths were `` probably connected to the use of pesticides , '' according to the Bangkok Post .

Vietnamese authorities have released very little information about the cause of death for Bowerman and Huynh . Investigators might know more when autopsy results come back in a couple of weeks .

But for the survivors , just knowing the answer is n't good enough anymore . They are determined to raise awareness and are searching for the next step , whether that 's better education , tougher insecticide regulation or banning these chemicals outright .

`` Cathy could have been alive today , '' said Ly . `` I feel like if we can at least let the world know that this is happening ... maybe when a parent 's daughter -LRB- or -RRB- son tells them that they are backpacking in South Asia , it will not be the last goodbye . ''
