Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Early this year Ukraine -- along with much of eastern Europe -- was caught in a deep and protracted cold snap . Many froze to death , energy demand spiked , and to top it all Russia accused Ukraine of stealing gas from transit pipes destined for western Europe for the second time in three years .

Ukraine issued a firm denial , adding another blot to the two nations ' fraught -- but highly dependent -- relationship . The fact remains that Ukraine needs Russian gas while Russia needs Ukraine 's transit pipeline to export west .

The Russian energy giant Gazprom claimed Ukraine 's gas company -- Naftogaz Ukrainy -- owed it huge sums of money in missed payments and fines . However , Naftogaz countered that it had paid the bill and claimed that Gazprom was in fact trying to force it to accept a new price for gas which it could ill afford .

They eventually reached a deal , but Ukraine 's Prime Minister Mykola Azarov still maintains that the terms are unfair :

But it 's not just alternative gas supplies that the energy-hungry nation of 44.8 million residents has in its sights .

The government has pledged to invest heavily in green energy . However , this wo n't do much to bolster their eco-credentials , as they are also planning to burn a great deal more coal too . It 's all testament to their increasing desire to generate power without recourse to gas .

Meanwhile , as Ukraine looks for other energy supplies , Russia is looking for other ways to get its gas to Europe . Russia is the world 's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with nearly 40 % of its imports , according to the European Commission .

At its launch in 2011 , the then Russian Prime Minister , now President , Vladimir Putin , made an ominous and thinly-veiled reference to his Ukrainian neighbors .

At the end of this year , Russia plans to begin construction on another gas pipe to Europe -- the `` South Stream '' -- running through the Black Sea to Bulgaria and on to Greece , Italy and Austria .

The projects threaten to strip Ukraine of billions in revenue and any remaining leverage it might have over future gas prices .

But in an effort to salvage long-term relations , Ukraine is now proposing a new model that would allow themselves , Europe and Russia equal control of their transit system .

`` So the consumers , the sellers , the supply and transit country is together . It 's a good model and it 's convenient for everybody , '' says energy minister Boiko .

Only time will tell if these major energy reforms will change Russia 's position in future negotiations and transform the horizon of Ukraine 's economic future .
