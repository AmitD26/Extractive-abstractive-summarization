-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Count Leopoldo Marcello is being an awfully good sport .

He 's opened his home to tourists , guided them through its grand halls and pointed out the exquisite frescoes , the work of 18th-century Venetian painter Giambattista Crosato .

Marcello smiles amicably as his guests snap away .

Sequins , silk and lace

The ballroom is plastered with 18th-century frescoes painted by the one of the most famous Italian artists of that century , Giambattista Tiepelo .

Mirrors are framed with eerily placid faces made from stucco .

Relics from another era -- including antique century hair pins and opera glasses -- speckle the home .

Visitors can explore the surrounding 18th century park and garden ; more than 968,000-square-feet of land presided over by an array of statues .

And the counts are not only are they willing to wear funny hats , they 'll also help arrange travel bookings around the Venetian countryside .

Cash-strapped counts

The answer is simple : money .

`` We 're not wealthy enough to live in this place as a home , '' admits Jacopo . `` We need this activity to maintain it . Because of our visitors , we 're able to do restorations year by year . ''

Ca'Marcello is one of nearly 150 villas in Italy 's Veneto region -- which includes Venice , Verona , Padua and Vicenza -- to have opened their doors to paying guests .

Last year , the group joined forces in a tourist-led cooperative called Villa Veneto .

The initiative was founded by Count Alberto Passi de Preposulo , a distinguished aristocrat with a well-trimmed white beard .

I met Passi de Preposulo at his home in Treviso , the 16th century Villa Tiepolo Passi -LRB- 31030 Carbonera , Treviso , Italy , +39 0422 39 77 90 ; tours from $ 7 , advanced booking required -RRB- .

After all , he too heads up one of Italy 's most respected clans -- one which recently celebrated its 1,000-year anniversary and whose family tree can be glimpsed painted on a wall inside the villa .

`` Our money is finished , '' he admits , referring not just to himself but to the Veneto region 's many landed gentry .

Aristocratic barista

I ask Countessa Carolina Valmarana -- the owner of the 17th-century Villa Valmarana -LRB- Stradella dei Nani 8 , Vicenza , Italy , +39 0444 321 803 ; apartment rental from $ 678 per week ; tours from $ 7 -RRB- -- what would happen if she did n't open her home to lodgers and tours .

`` These houses are so expensive to maintain . I actually know a friend that wants to sell it and she ca n't , '' she says . `` They 're very expensive and big and old -- people do n't want to buy them because they do n't know what to do with them , '' she says .

`` I would n't buy a place like this nowadays because it 's enormous , '' he says . `` The spaces are really grand , and we 're just two people living in 9,000 square feet . In that way , it 's a strange life , but it is also a unique kind of life . ''

For the most part , she seems nonplussed about opening her historic home , which is adorned with baroque frescoes by celebrated father and son duo Gianbattista and Giandomenico Tiepolo .

Taxing times

Jacopo Marcello says his family 's woes started after the Second World War , when nationalization stripped their land assets from 4,000 to 600 acres to support reconstruction and demobbed soldiers .

`` Our taxes have gone up six-fold , '' she laments . `` Though we do get rent , it all goes back into the house . ''

`` The roof was n't holding the four main doors properly , '' she recalls . Damage can endanger the frescoes , which already expensive to maintain .

Passi de Preposulo had a similar issue with a roof collapse at his villa .

He insists the money he makes from visitors is not lining his pocket , but goes solely into the upkeep of his estate , which , he points out , is n't merely his home , but an Italian landmark .

`` I 'm trying to protect this house , and the richness of our history , our roots , but it 's expensive , '' he says .
