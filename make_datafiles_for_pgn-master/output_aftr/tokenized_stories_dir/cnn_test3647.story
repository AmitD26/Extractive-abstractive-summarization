-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I have no idea why my 3-year-old wants to be a cowboy for Halloween this year , because she wo n't tell me . That 's OK . I do n't need to know her reasoning to make it happen .

As I turned toward to the boys ' section to continue the search for accessories , I saw the costume that scared me more than any vampire or ghost : the little black dress .

Americans are expected to spend $ 1 billion on children 's costumes this year , up from $ 840 million last year , according to a National Retail Federation survey . From my limited scan of Halloween costumes on sale this year , sexy costumes for younger girls are flooding the marketplace .

`` The message to our girls -LRB- with these costumes -RRB- is that they ca n't be too sexy , and they ca n't be sexy too soon , '' says Melissa Wardy , founder of Pigtail Pals , a clothing line for adventurous girls , who has blogged about sexy Halloween costumes . `` It 's disgusting . She just potty trained . There 's nothing sexual about her . ''

It can also be dangerous .

`` Dressing girls like grown women for Halloween communicates that they have the sexuality of adults , in the bodies of children , '' says Teresa Downing-Matibag , an assistant professor of sociology at Iowa State University . `` While little girls themselves likely have very little awareness of adult or even adolescent sexuality , or what sex is really about , the adults who are seeing them on the streets do . We are also communicating to adults that little girls are sexually appealing , and this message has tragic implications for their vulnerability to sexual abuse . ''

The sexualizing of Halloween costumes for young girls is part of a larger marketing trend emphasizing girls ' outsides over their insides , says Michele Yulo , founder of the Princess Free Zone , featuring superhero Super Tool Lula on T-shirts and in a new book .

Diane Murray of Wood-Ridge , New Jersey , has given up on store-bought costumes for her kids after ordering a SpongeBob SquarePants costume that turned out to be less than she had bargained for . Although it was supposedly the correct size for her 10-year-old daughter , `` the shirt was tight and the skirt was miniscule , barely covering her rear end . ''

`` I was thinking how embarrassed I would be to have her walk around in that costume , and she was embarrassed as well , '' Murray says . `` Dressing up as a sexpot is not part of my vision for a happy , healthy childhood . Outfits like that not only suggest a style of dress that is inappropriate but also emphasize the notion of dressing to titillate men , rather than dressing in clothes that make you feel good about yourself . ''

What can a parent do this Halloween to protect kids from growing up too fast ?

Emphasize your child 's imagination . Yulo 's daughter is going to be a baseball slugger -- no skirts please . How do you slide into home plate safely in a skirt ? -LRB- Even though Geena Davis had to do it in `` A League of Their Own . '' -RRB- Murray 's daughter is going as a Goth girl -- all black clothes and makeup .

Think cheap . My neighborhood listserv is filled with parent requests for costumes in specific sizes to borrow , rent or buy . I know someone is going to enjoy my daughter 's infant ladybug costume this year . I received it a couple of years ago from another parent who had bought it first . There 's also inspiration at your local thrift store , where I got part of my daughter 's costume cheap .

Make them . Try some last-minute ideas from websites such as Real Simple .
