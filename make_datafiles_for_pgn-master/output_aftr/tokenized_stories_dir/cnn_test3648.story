-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Texas woman has been arrested as a suspect in an alleged kidnapping of a boy eight years ago , the San Augustine County Sheriff 's Office said Wednesday .

San Augustine is about 165 miles northeast of Houston .

The boy , now 8 , was in good physical condition Monday and was in the custody of Texas Child Protective Services , said sheriff 's Chief Deputy Gary Cunningham .

The mother filed a police report in 2004 , but Houston police closed the case two years later after prosecutors asked for clarification of the date the boy disappeared and Houston police were `` unable to clarify that information , '' Cunningham said .

In an interview Wednesday , Champion-Morin expressed joy and disbelief that Miguel , the youngest of her five children at the time of his disappearance , had been finally found .

When Champion-Morin received a phone call Monday from the child welfare agency , `` I kind of had to look at the phone -- was this real ? '' said the mother , who had a sixth child after her son 's disappearance .

She wondered if authorities ' call was a cruel joke , she said .

`` At first , it kind of scared me , '' she said .

She was thinking about her son in recent days because his birthday was March 1 .

Champion-Morin will undergo a blood test possibly this week to prove she is the biological mother , she said .

On the night that her son and Tanner disappeared , Champion-Morin said she had asked Tanner to watch her son overnight . At the time , the mother had five children , all under age 4 , and Miguel was the youngest .

`` I was having hardship at the time , '' the mother said . `` I asked her to watch him overnight , and when I came back ... they were gone . ''

Tanner was a high school student at the time and had to attend classes the next morning , but when Champion-Morin went to pick up her son that morning , he and Tanner were gone , Champion-Morin said .

She never knew police had closed the case back in 2006 , and she assumed all along they were still working on it , she said .

She called Houston Police several times to check on the case over the years and was always told she had a new police contact and the case had been assigned to someone else , the mother said .

Still , she thought often of her son , she said .

She explained Miguel 's disappearance to his siblings `` the best I could , '' she said .

Miguel could be returned to her `` by the end of the week , '' she said .

When asked how she felt about how Houston police handled the case , she said , `` It took years to get some sort of progress . This took years ... a lot of running around and nobody helping me . ''

The boy was reported missing in November 2004 , and after an investigation , Houston police presented the case to the Harris County district attorney 's office for review in February 2005 , Cunningham said .

The prosecutor accepted the case , but a warrant was never issued because the prosecutor 's office apparently asked for clarification of the precise date when the boy was taken , Cunningham said .

Houston police was unable to clarify that information , and the case was closed in 2006 , Cunningham said .

An Amber Alert was never issued for the boy because the Houston Regional Amber Alert Plan was never notified , said coordinator Beth Alberts .

Houston Police Department investigators are now looking into the case , including why an Amber Alert was never requested , spokesman Kese Smith said Wednesday .

The report did n't suggest the alleged negligence was egregious , but the child welfare authority initiated an investigation and attempted to identify the 8-year-old child in the report , Cunningham said .

Tanner allegedly gave the child welfare agency 's investigators contradictory information about the 8-year-old boy , saying the child was hers and then was n't hers , that the child belonged to her brother or someone else , Cunningham said .

The state agency then called the sheriff 's office , which eventually opened a criminal investigation in January after authorities could n't find the child , Cunningham said .

The child welfare agency then provided sheriff 's investigators with a possible identity of the missing child , and San Augustine County prosecutors secured a warrant for Tanner , Cunningham said .
