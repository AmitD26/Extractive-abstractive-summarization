Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hickory Ridge landfill was once a mountain of trash sitting idle on the outskirts of Atlanta , Georgia .

The Spectral PowerCap designed by the Carlisle Energy Services is lined with 7,000 flexible solar strips which produces one megawatt of energy .

The electricity generated is collected in each panel much like a solar calculator would , says Stuart . But rather than powering a keyboard it goes towards helping power the local grid .

Beneath the solar panels , gas pumps have been driven deep into the ground collecting methane gas , which is also used for power production .

The liner made of thermoplastic polyurethane is similar to that used on commercial rooftops and is designed to keep water out and methane gas in .

A similar solar landfill project is underway in Madison County , New York where the energy generated from the eight acres of panels is being used to run the recycling center next door .

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency there are around 100,000 closed landfills in the U.S. providing thousands of acres of property that could be used for renewable energy development . Many are close to urban areas and power lines .

Landfills are a constant reminder of the waste we produce but projects like these could help dispose of the view that they are simply costly eyesores .

Waterproof sheets also trap methane which is also collected
