-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The bright yellow front wall of the compound is lined with perfectly pruned palm trees .

In any large American city , this house would be a suburban , upper-middle class home -- but here in the town of Antunez , located in a mainly rural area of the Mexican southwestern state of Michoacan , it seems much grander , certainly in stark contrast with the adobe houses next door .

Our hosts are a group of local men who rose up in arms against the Knights Templar , a rather romantic name for a criminal organization known not only for drug trafficking , but also for terrorizing people in this part of Mexico through extortion , executions , rape and murder .

The drug war in Mexico , which has been raging since former President Felipe Calderon started fighting back against the cartels in 2006 , has claimed 100,000 lives . States like Michoacan are largely in the control of the cartels : 90 per cent of the cocaine that enters the U.S. does so through Mexico . The country is also a major supplier of marijuana , methamphetamine and , more recently , heroin .

The mansion 's owner , Efrain Isaac Rosales , also known as `` El Tucan '' -LRB- The Toucan -RRB- , fled on January 10 when the town rose up in arms against him and his gunmen . They say he left so fast that he even abandoned some of his weapons in the house .

'' -LSB- The Knights Templar -RSB- are a necessary evil , '' he once told an assembled crowd . `` Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- we are here . If we were n't , another group would come . ''

From the foyer , a hallway connects to a living area with a large , dark brown leather recliner in the middle . On the wall , there 's a rack for a large flat screen TV ; but the vigilante groups have looted the house already and many pieces of furniture are missing , giving the residence the feeling of a house whose owners have just moved out .

It 's still clean , with the exception of the bathrooms , but the beds are unmade and there are pieces of furniture and objects in odd places .

This is not the only property the vigilantes have occupied that used to belong to the cartel lieutenant . He also owned a nearby ranch called `` La Ilusion '' -LRB- The Illusion -RRB- , which is surrounded by grapefruit trees and hundreds of hectares of avocado trees , the fruit of which has made the state of Michoacan known around the world .

The vigilantes also confiscated a couple of vehicles that were left at the property : a white , late-model , Dodge Ram pickup truck and a modified truck painted matt black . The latter was fitted with half-inch steel plates and shooting portals in the double cabin and in the back . It had signs of having been in a shootout , riddled with bullet holes on the driver 's side , the hood and the windshield .

The property also features a shed with white pillars and red tile roof covering a living area with grills and chairs leading to the lawn connecting to the two-level circular pool divided in the middle .

The federal government 's attitude towards the vigilante groups appears to be changing too . Once the army and police would round up the irregulars : now the authorities appear to want to legalize them , freeing them up to fight the cartels .

Hipolito Mora , the leader of yet another vigilante group in the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto , says they have kept the movement against organized crime with the same resources the Knights Templar used to attack them in the past .

He remains philosophical about the dangers in which he has placed himself . `` I am not afraid . We are all going to die anyway . ''

`` I think they 're doing the right thing , '' Villa says , `` I think it was a very brave thing to do because they stood up for everybody . ''

Her family , Villa says , had to flee after 30 armed men showed up at their property demanding the title . `` They wanted to charge the people who picked lemons and they wanted to charge people who owned houses . The drug cartels were just sucking the money out of everybody and it was just going too far . ''
