-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was discharged from a New York hospital on Wednesday , three days after she was admitted for treatment of a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain , the State Department announced .

`` Her medical team advised her that she is making good progress on all fronts , and they are confident she will make a full recovery , '' Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines said in a statement announcing her release .

She had been admitted Sunday , after doctors found the clot during a medical test related to a concussion she suffered in December .

The secretary is being treated with blood thinners to dissolve the clot , which has not resulted in a stroke or any neurological damage . Doctors expect her to make a full recovery .

Clinton 's future ` as good as her past , ' docs say

Earlier , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters that Clinton was in communication with aides and there was nothing new on her condition or treatment .

`` She has begun to pick up her regular phone contact with some of her counterparts , '' Nuland added .

Clinton , 65 , has not been publicly seen or heard from in more than three weeks since falling ill with severe stomach flu and a subsequent concussion that occurred when she fainted because of dehydration , officials said .

Nuland said officials have been `` extremely forthcoming '' about Clinton 's health .

Asked how Clinton 's illness might affect her plans to testify on Capitol Hill about the deadly September terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , Libya . Nuland did not directly say whether Clinton would appear .

`` She has said that she is open to going up to the Hill . We are working with them now on their schedule because there 's also a question of when they are going to be in and we will let you know when we have something to share , '' Nuland said .
