-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I count 105 football movies on Wikipedia 's `` list of sports films . ''

There is a 1976 one called `` Gus , '' about a mule who kicks field goals .

-LRB- Not a true story , I believe . -RRB-

The 105th -LRB- chronologically -RRB- on this list is `` Draft Day , '' a tale of a fictional NFL executive -- he is played by Kevin Costner , king of sports cinema -- that opens Friday at a theater near you . From the trailer I have seen , it looks pretty good .

Raising the question :

All right , all right , all right , as Matthew McConaughey would say , let 's take a look at some of those 105 movies on this here list .

OK , for openers , what does and does n't qualify as a football film ?

For example , `` Silver Linings Playbook '' -LRB- 2012 -RRB- is not , even though its title sure does sound like one . Football gets talked about a lot , but a football movie , it is not .

`` M * A * S * H '' -LRB- 1970 -RRB- also is not , even though it ends with a football game . The movie itself had nothing to do with football .

There are two versions of `` The Longest Yard '' -LRB- 1974 and 2005 -RRB- , two of `` Brian 's Song '' -LRB- 1971 and 2001 -RRB- , two about legendary Alabama coach Bear Bryant -LRB- 1984 and 2002 -RRB- , one of which has Bear played by the somewhat less legendary Gary Busey .

There is 1993 's `` Rudy , '' about a small dude -LRB- played by Sean Astin -RRB- who gets to play with a Notre Dame team made up mainly of big dudes . There is 1981 's `` Grambling 's White Tiger , '' in which a white dude -LRB- played by master thespian Bruce Jenner -RRB- gets to play with a college team made up mainly of black dudes .

A couple star Dennis Quaid . A couple star the Rock . I like both these actors , although both would have been badly miscast playing Rudy .

A couple star Burt Reynolds , who actually played a little football in school .

Because that 's show biz !

I appreciate that in Costner 's career he has played cowboys , lawyers , naval officers , Robin Hood , Eliot Ness and guys obsessed with JFK . I am nevertheless always pleased to find him in a sport-related role . I 'd watch him do anything , except maybe fight Rocky or play soccer .

Has there ever been a football film classic , you ask ?

Ah , but a few keepers do exist . A half-dozen , in no particular order :

-- `` All the Right Moves '' -LRB- 1983 -RRB- was a drama about a high school kid , good , not great , played by a young Tom Cruise , who basically finds out that if your coach feels like it , he sure can mess up the rest of your life .

-- `` North Dallas Forty '' -LRB- 1979 -RRB- was a realistic look , with plenty of farce thrown in , at the behind-the-scenes activities of a pro football team , including a martinet of a coach and a number of players who indulge in very unsportsmanlike conduct .

-- `` Brian 's Song '' -LRB- 1971 -RRB- , the original , not that lame reboot of 30 years later , deals with teamwork , friendship , rivalry , race relations , terminal illness , you name it . Acted impeccably by Billy Dee Williams and James Caan , this was a fine bromance .

Me , I 'd remake that one .

Costner could do a great Knute .
