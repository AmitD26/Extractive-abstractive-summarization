The outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Prediction Center forecast three to six hurricanes , with one or two major hurricanes for the Atlantic season , which begins June 1 .

There likely will be eight to 13 named storms in the Atlantic .

`` It does n't matter whether we get one or a dozen , it matters which one -LRB- s -RRB- hit land and what land it hits , '' CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said .

About 40 % of Americans live in counties on a shoreline , said Holly Bamford , the assistant administrator for NOAA 's National Ocean Service .

El Niño , characterized by warmer water in the equatorial Pacific , increases strong wind shear in the Atlantic , which reduces the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes and prevents other systems from becoming powerful enough to be named storms .

`` We are currently seeing strong trade winds and wind shear over the tropical Atlantic , and NOAA 's climate models predict these conditions will persist , in part because of El Niño , '' said Gerry Bell , NOAA 's lead hurricane season forecaster .

Last year there were 11 tropical storms and two hurricanes .

It is extremely rare for an Eastern Pacific hurricane to affect the U.S. mainland , though some do have an influence on Hawaii .

The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through November 30 . Last year there were nine tropical storms and nine hurricanes .

Winds from El Niño should lessen the intensity of storms in the Atlantic

What counts is how many storms make landfall and where they hit , CNN meteorologist says
