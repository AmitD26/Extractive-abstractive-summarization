This week , Little Egg Harbor , on the shore of Ocean County , was pulverized by Superstorm Sandy . Homes were turned into debris fields ; boats were tossed into the marshes or piled on top of each other .

One quiet ceremony , one catastrophic storm . Both symbolize a national dilemma , as the headlong migration to America 's coastlines clashes with rapidly changing climate patterns and more powerful storms .

Experts warn of superstorm era to come

Much of the development has occurred in coastal communities most vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms . According to U.S. Census Bureau data , the coastal populations of states from Virginia to Texas grew 244 % between 1950 and 2006 .

They are even higher in the summer months with the influx of tourists . One-quarter of all seasonal or second homes are in coastal Florida , and more than 60 % of homes and buildings within 500 feet of the shoreline are on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts .

The reserve is a natural sponge -- like the mangrove swamps in the Gulf of Mexico -- for absorbing storm and tidal surges . And officials with NOAA , which runs the reserve , say it coped well with Sandy 's onslaught , despite a storm surge of 6 feet .

New Jersey coastal town turned to `` devastation ''

The searing experience of Sandy , following Katrina , Irene and other major storms in recent years , will likely raise more questions about the wisdom and scope of coastal migration and development , especially as many climate scientists expect the intensity and size of storms to increase , and their geographic reach to extend northward .

But is there any way to mitigate the effects of development ?

New satellite data reveals sea-level rise

Forty years ago , Congress passed a law called the Coastal Zone Management Act . It empowered NOAA to preserve and where possible restore the natural features of the U.S. coastline . The Jacques Cousteau Reserve in Ocean County , New Jersey , was one of the areas funded by the act .

The program has spent about $ 1 billion of federal money to acquire and run these reserves , but that 's a sum dwarfed by the damage inflicted in just four hours this week . According to a 2010 report by the Congressional Research Service , some two-dozen initiatives in Congress to increase funding for the program have been rejected .

States have begun introducing laws that require setbacks for construction to take account of erosion . They also have been establishing commissions on climate change to advise on building regulations and zoning . NOAA has joined with local communities to explore the impact of development , using the estuary reserves as educational tools .

They stressed that we are in uncharted territory and much will depend on the level of CO2 emissions -- and the future of development . But the Bay 's delicate ecosystem will undoubtedly be affected , with its vital eelgrass at risk and cold-water species vanishing . Some are already observed to be retreating north .

Rather than the health of eelgrass , it 's likely that hard cash and cold fear will influence human behavior .

As coastal communities have become more crowded , so the cost inflicted by hurricanes , storms and storm surges has risen exponentially . The 1926 hurricane that hit Miami caused about $ 76 million in damage at today 's prices . In 1995 , Hurricane Andrew , which was no bigger , inflicted $ 17 billion in damage , according to figures from NOAA .

Insurance companies have taken flight -- for example , pulling out of many coastal areas in Florida , where the state is now the insurer of last resort . Total government exposure to storm-related losses in coastal states has risen more than 15-fold since 1990 to $ 885 billion last year , according to the Insurance Information Institute .

The Munich RE insurance group says North America has seen higher losses from extreme weather than any other part of the world in recent decades . Not all had to do with coastal events . But a year like 2005 -LRB- which included Hurricanes Katrina , Wilma and Rita -RRB- comes with a price of $ 60 billion in insured losses . That 's the sort of number that drives up premiums .

In a report last month , Munich RE said : `` A main loss driver is the concentration of people and assets on the coast combined with high and possibly growing vulnerabilities . ''

Risk Management Solutions , which models catastrophic risks , recently updated its scenarios , anticipating an increase of 40 % in insurance losses on the Gulf Coast , Florida and the southeast over the next five years , and 25 % to 30 % for the mid-Atlantic and northeastern states . Those calculations were done pre-Sandy .

Getting more people out of harm 's way is also a daunting challenge . As population density grows , so evacuation routes come under greater pressure . One out of Atlantic City this week was blocked by a stranded houseboat . More powerful storm surges threaten a wider area farther inland . And while forecasting the track of hurricanes has improved dramatically , forecasting their intensity has not . Hurricane Opel in 1995 went from a Category 1 to a Category 4 in just 20 hours .

Several homeowners lamented their lack of adequate flood insurance and their now tattered dreams of retiring to the shore . It 's a fair bet that many households along the northeast coast will purchase such insurance -- through the National Flood Insurance Program -- in the coming months . After Irene the number of homeowners in the region with flood insurance rose from 5 % to 14 % .

Of the millions of people with jobs , businesses or vacation homes on the coast , or who just find the lure of the shore irresistible as a place to live , few will likely pack up and seek higher ground because of Sandy . They can buy insurance . But if the scientists are right , peace of mind might come at a premium .
