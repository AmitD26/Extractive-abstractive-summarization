By mid-morning the stadium was packed to the rafters . The beautiful , melodic songs used by activists through the years of struggle against apartheid until 1994 when Mandela was voted into power filled the stadium . Party activists crowed about the party 's pulling power : no other political party in the country has yet managed to fill the stadium .

This was the last political rally before new South Africa 's fifth democratic elections are held . All the major parties staged political rallies , but the ANC sought to present a show of force as it attempts to swat off challenges from the relentless opposition Democratic Alliance and the upstart , Left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters launched a few months ago by expelled former ANC Youth leader Julius Malema .

In all these cases , Zuma has said that he did not know and that people abused his name to gain favor .

Yet , despite the cocktail of scandals and gaffes that engulf Zuma , there is no doubt here that the ANC will win the election on Wednesday and Zuma will be returned to the presidency . According to a South African Sunday Times poll released on May 4 , the ANC will get 63.9 % of the vote , down from the 65.9 % the party won in the 2009 general election . The opposition DA will increase its support to 23.7 % while Malema 's EFF party is expected to get 4.7 % .

If there is so much disenchantment with Zuma , then , why is he headed for victory ? History , for one . In Zuma 's speech on Sunday he went through a long list of achievements by the ANC in the 20 years of democracy . It is an impressive roll call : ubiquitous access to water , electricity and health services . About 16 million people are now on social grants while there is universal access to no-fee schools . The dignity of full citizenship has been restored to blacks like me , a powerful , deep act that resonates with many . We still enjoy a free and vigorous press , despite iniquitous new legislation waiting to be enacted by Zuma that will criminalize much newsgathering .

Yet this narrative -- which the ANC has harnessed in its election slogan : `` We have a good story to tell '' -- is incomplete . Violent strikes over poor services are on a sharp increase , with the SA Police Services reporting a total of 569 protests in three months in South Africa 's wealthiest province , Gauteng . About 122 of these turned violent .

The economy is taking a beating under Zuma , with paltry GDP growth of 1.9 % last year and unemployment at 24.1 % -LRB- narrowly defined -RRB- or a staggering 36 % if one includes those who have given up looking for work . The EFF has found fertile ground among these disaffected youth , with an estimated 30,000 young people turning up to listen to Malema giving his final election speech on Sunday .

Many are hoping that the ANC will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures . Among these would be assessing the damage done to the party by Zuma 's scandals , and a return to some regard for the people . Indeed , speculation is rife that Zuma may be ousted should the ANC 's showing in this election fall to 60 % .

That is unlikely . Zuma controls about 75 % of the ANC 's national executive committee , and it is unlikely that his allies in that powerful body would cut him loose . Given that scenario , he will continue to inflict damage on the party of Mandela -- and on the nation 's fortunes .

That would open the window for a stronger challenge from the opposition in 2019 and beyond . On the other hand , President Zuma could attempt to introduce serious economic reforms to build a proud legacy for himself . That , too , seems unlikely .

And so South Africa finds itself caught in a slow , glacial even , journey towards a multi-party future . Loyalty to its past heroes continues to hold it hostage .
