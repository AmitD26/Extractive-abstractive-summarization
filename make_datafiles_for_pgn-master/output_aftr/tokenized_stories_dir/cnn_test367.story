NEW DELHI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Religious groups in India have warned they will oppose any move to legalize homosexuality as the federal government prepares to hold talks on a law that classifies same-sex acts as crimes .

`` This is a sensitive issue and warrants a debate within the Indian society at large before arriving at any decision , '' said Sidharth Nath Singh , spokesman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party .

An Indian court is due to give its judgment on a petition filed by a nonprofit group that has challenged the anti-gay provision of the penal code .

In a news conference last week , Moily refused to spell out his government 's stand on it because it awaits judicial determination . But his comments that the federal home minister was `` contemplating '' a meeting with his Cabinet colleagues on the law drew widespread coverage in the largely conservative country .

`` Hope floats at rainbow parades , '' read a caption on a front-page picture from a gay parade in New Delhi in Monday 's Times of India newspaper .

`` We are against calling homosexuality a criminal activity , but we are certainly in principle against legalizing it , because that would mean the state endorsing same-sex relationships , '' said Babu Joseph , spokesman for the Catholic Bishops ' Conference of India .

Homosexuality `` violates fundamental norms of a family , '' he said .

`` Islam is totally against it . Islam does not allow any unnatural act . No Muslim in the world , let alone India , can ever support it , '' Faruqui said .

India 's top Sikh administration echoed similar opposition .
