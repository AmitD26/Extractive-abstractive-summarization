Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If at first you do n't succeed , try to change the rules .

A proposal under consideration in Virginia 's Republican-led state Legislature would change how the commonwealth allocates its 13 electoral votes in the wake of Democratic President Barack Obama 's re-election last November .

If the district-based system had been in effect in Virginia last year , Romney would have gotten nine electoral votes to four for Obama .

Jindal urges GOP to stop being ` stupid '

While a subcommittee has advanced the Virginia proposal , skepticism expressed by some GOP state senators raised doubts that it would proceed any further .

However , Reince Priebus , newly re-elected chairman of the Republican National Committee , called the idea worth examining .

`` I think it is a state issue , but personally I 'm pretty intrigued by it , '' he told reportersFriday .

Opinion : Where the stupidity really lies

The state party chairman in Florida , Lenny Curry , questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the party is trying to broaden its support .

To Sean Trende , the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics , the concept does n't violate democratic principles , but he called it a bad idea .

`` Close elections would likely always result in extensive recounts , we could see huge disparities between the popular and electoral vote , and the partisan motive behind it would be transparent , '' he wrote Friday on the group 's website .

Their systems differ from the Virginia proposal by awarding the two additional electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote , rather than who won the most districts . Last year , both split their electoral votes between Obama and Romney .

Under the Electoral College system , each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population . Winning the presidency requires a majority of the electoral vote , regardless of who wins the popular vote .

From 2001 to 2006 , bills proposing adoption of the district system were introduced in many states , but failed to pass , according to the NCSL website . Both Maine and Nebraska adopted their district-based systems before 2000 .

In Virginia , Obama got strong support in two heavily populated northern districts close to Washington as well as a district that includes much of Richmond and Norfolk . Romney won more rural districts in the central , southern and western parts of the state .
