-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hillary Clinton had a good week .

She seemed to be energized on a surprise appearance on Barbara Walters ' final episode of `` The View . '' `` Why do n't you take my place on the show ? '' Walters joked .

Although the former secretary of state has not yet thrown her name into the 2016 presidential campaign , a series of seemingly negative stories that unfolded recently have the potential to actually strengthen her case for running to become president of the United States .

The piece in Vanity Fair written by Monica Lewinsky has also brought up memories of the nastier side of the late 1990s , when the scandal involving her relationship to the President almost brought down the Clinton administration . The ongoing release of documents from President Clinton 's archive is also triggering more stories about Clinton in the 1990s .

6 major takeaways from Lewinsky 's Vanity Fair essay

Just to make matters more difficult , Karl Rove 's statements suggesting that Clinton had suffered brain damage from a fall will trigger more discussions about whether she is physically up for the job . Rove stood by his statements this Sunday on the talk shows .

And Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick , who some think could be a possible candidate in 2016 , said on CNN that he was worried so many people speak of Clinton as inevitable . `` I think it 's off-putting to the average . . . voter , '' he said .

But all of this news , while certainly problematic , can work to her advantage . One of Hillary Clinton 's greatest assets is her resilience and ability to take on the toughest of political fights . By bringing back memories of the 1990s , many of these stories will also bring back discussions of how much Hillary Clinton was able to endure .

At a time when many Democrats are frustrated with how congressional Republicans have been able to stymie this administration , the personal and professional record of Hillary Clinton -- both as first lady and in her subsequent roles as senator and secretary of state -- could look extremely good and offer an attractive model as Democrats select a leader to guide their party through the partisan wars that are surely going to continue in the coming years .

Given how long Americans have been forced to suffer through the fierce partisan attacks of recent years they might have greater sympathy for what she endured several decades ago . As Chelsea looks forward to giving birth to her first child , Hillary Clinton has talked more about the joys of parenthood and excitement of becoming a grandparent , also experiences that will make her more human to American voters .

The turbulence over her record that takes place in the weeks ahead can help shake some of the sense of inevitability that surrounds her candidacy , which would not necessarily be a bad thing . After all the media , and to a large extent voters , tend to like someone who has to struggle to achieve victory .

In 2008 , Barack Obama 's supporters seized on the fact that Clinton was said to be the inevitable nominee and used that against her . Obama 's supporters presented her as the candidacy of the status quo , while depicting him as the fighter and as the person struggling toward victory in an exciting contest .

And there is nobody better able to play up this angle and take advantage of these party weaknesses than Hillary Clinton , who was part of the White House team that turned this image against the GOP in the late 1990s .

Finally , it is good to get all of this out of the way so early , before she has even announced her candidacy .

If there is one truism in American politics , it is that everything bad will get out eventually . It is always good to get bad news out of the way long before the game really gets going . It 's still the preseason in the presidential campaign of 2016 . Given the short attention span of many Americans , it is much better for all this to circulate now when most voters are not really paying attention and before any serious contest has even begun .
