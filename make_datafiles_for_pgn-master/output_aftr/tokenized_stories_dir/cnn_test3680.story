The justices , by a 5-4 margin , said the adoption by a white couple was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father , a registered member of the Cherokee tribe , over where his daughter , Veronica , 3 , would live .

The court said the father could not rely on the Indian Child Welfare Act for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings , which were initiated by the birth mother without his knowledge .

Justice Samuel Alito said when `` the adoption of an Indian child is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent with sole custodial rights , the -LRB- law 's -RRB- primary goal of preventing unwarranted removal of Indian children and the dissolution of Indian families is not implicated . ''

She is known in court papers as `` Baby Girl . ''

The ICWA remains in effect , but the high court majority concluded the biological father could not apply it to his circumstances .

`` We are very happy with the ruling today . The Supreme Court gave us everything that we asked for , '' Melanie Capobianco told CNN affiliate WCSC . `` They made it very clear that Veronica would have never been taken from her home and from her family and that the adoption would have been approved . ''

`` We are looking forward to seeing her again soon when we have the opportunity to do so , because we miss her so very much , '' said Melanie Capobianco .

Christinna Maldanado , Veronica 's birth mother , also expressed satisfaction .

`` Matt and Melanie are part of my family , and they have treated me like part of theirs . I 'm hopeful that we will all be reunited with Veronica very soon , '' the statement said .

There was no immediate reaction from Brown , or the tribe . But Native American groups remained hopeful he would still keep custody .

The case is Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl , a Minor Child Under the Age of Fourteen Years -LRB- 12-399 -RRB-
