My classroom oversaw a large courtyard , which we could n't see from our benches during class hours since all the windows had been half-painted in gray . Who had done it , I often wondered . Whose idea was it to cover the windows in such a dull color to prevent us from peering into the world outside ? The school I attended in Madrid was an international college with a predominantly British curriculum . I was the only Turk there .

There were interesting contrasts between the two institutions , each of which left an impact on my young mind and soul . But the distinction that perhaps struck me most was the presence and the absence in each of `` the national oath '' .

In Ankara , every Monday morning we would gather in the schoolyard , hundreds of us , wearing black uniforms and snow-white lace collars . Turning our faces towards the bust of Ataturk -- the founder of modern Turkey -- and keeping our arms straight like soldiers , we would chant in perfect unison : `` I am a Turk , I am correct , I am diligent ... '' And we would finish the oath with the same pledge : `` May my existence be a gift to you ! ''

Generations in Turkey have grown up repeating the national oath . Even if you were Kurdish you were still expected to say aloud , `` I am a Turk . '' It was assumed that we all shared the same nationality -LRB- Turkish -RRB- and the same religion -LRB- Muslim -RRB- -- even those students who were Jewish or Armenian . The school system was based on sameness . We were treated as a mass of undifferentiated beings rather than individuals with diverse backgrounds and varying talents .

One thing that makes me happy as a writer is to witness the diversity of my readers in Turkey : conservatives , liberals , leftists , secularists , Kemalists , Kurds , Alevis , Jews , Armenians ... Women with headscarves , women in miniskirts .

But Turkey 's mainstream culture is deeply suspicious of `` difference '' -- be it cultural , ethnic or sexual . Turkish society is stubbornly patriarchal and homophobic . Sameness is venerated . The Prime Minister tells us that every Turkish woman should have at least three children while the government talks about the need for creating a `` new , pious Muslim youth . ''

And beneath the weight of sameness , Turkish society is more polarized than ever . The gap between supporters of the Prime Minister 's AKP party and its opponents is so wide that no one even attempts to bridge it anymore . We are divided into ghettoes of the like-minded . Glass walls surround us everywhere . We see each other but we neither listen nor talk , afraid and paranoid of the Other .

As a result , the culture of coexistence , which was never profound in the first place , is eroding fast .

There are only three areas left where people from different cultural and political backgrounds can still get together : art , literature and football . Outside these spaces we are a badly divided society .

Until 2013 , Turkish children would chant a national oath at school , says Elif Shafak

Its wording made her query the place of separate and collective Self in Turkey , she writes

Shafak says Turkey 's mainstream is suspicious of difference

But she says `` sameness '' is stifling creativity and democracy and causing divisions in society
