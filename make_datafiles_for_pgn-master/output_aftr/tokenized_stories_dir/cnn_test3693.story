Belfast , Northern Ireland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An international effort to save a dog on death row in Northern Ireland ended in failure , heartbreak and recrimination Wednesday when Lennox -- described by the Belfast City Council as a `` dangerous , illegal pit-bull terrier type '' -- was put to death .

The case provoked outrage from dog-lovers across the globe . Barnes ' `` Save Lennox '' campaign went viral , attracting the support of celebrities , lawmakers and almost 200,000 people in an online petition . Vigils and protests were held by animal rights activists on both sides of the Atlantic , including demonstrations outside the British and Irish consulates in New York , to plead for Lennox 's life .

However , the struggle -- which involved several court hearings -- ended when the council confirmed the 7-year-old dog had been `` humanely put to sleep . ''

The statement added that the council 's expert `` described the dog as one of the most unpredictable and dangerous dogs he had come across ... The council regrets that the court action was necessary but would emphasize that the safety of the public remains its key priority . ''

Northern Ireland 's First Minister Peter Robinson turned to social media in a doomed , last-minute attempt at intervention .

`` As a dog lover I am very unhappy with the outcome of this case , '' he tweeted . `` Spoke to Lord Mayor about Lennox . Suggested BCC -LRB- Belfast City Council -RRB- should seriously look at re-homing option . Why exercise the order if there 's an alternative ? ''

The council was so determined to kill Lennox , Barnes said , that `` they would n't even listen to the man responsible for running the country . ''

A 28-day deadline for legal appeals expired at midnight Tuesday . The dog was put to sleep at a secret location , the council said .

Barnes said all legal options had been exhausted and the `` heartbroken '' family finally had to admit defeat .

`` We are devastated and disgusted by the way we have been treated by Belfast City Council . They would n't even let us say goodbye to Lennox . ''

In its statement Wednesday , the council claimed that some staff members had been threatened because of the Lennox case .
