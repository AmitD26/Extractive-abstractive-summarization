That 's right -- the soundtrack to the hit '80s movie `` Dirty Dancing . ''

And the fact that the 25-year-old soundtrack still gets motors running was n't the only surprise finding of a recent study , `` Science Behind The Song . ''

The study was commissioned by digital music service Spotify to examine the relationship between music , romance and seduction .

Well played , gentlemen .

Another surprise finding ? Respondents said music playing in the background is 40 % more likely to turn them on than the touch or feel of their partner .

`` It 's no surprise that so many respondents claimed to find music arousing in the bedroom , '' Mullensiefen said in a release . He said music activates the same pleasure centers of the brain that respond to rewards such as food , drugs or sex .

The study interviewed 2,000 people in the United Kingdom between the ages of 18 and 91 , with an almost equal gender split .

Mullensiefen is co-director of the Master Program in Music , Mind and Brain and senior lecturer in the department of psychology at Goldsmiths , University of London .

He said even though some UK pop hits were favorites coming out of the study , he believes many results would also hold true in the United States .
