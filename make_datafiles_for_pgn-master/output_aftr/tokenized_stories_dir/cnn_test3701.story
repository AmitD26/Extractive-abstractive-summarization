Several locations in Turkey are featured in `` Skyfall . '' `` It is where East meets West , and the colors and vibrancy of Istanbul provided us with a great backdrop and such amazing locations as the Grand Bazaar , '' McDougall said .

Railway scenes for `` Skyfall '' were shot on and around Adana 's dizzying Varda Railway Bridge in southern Turkey , and beach scenes -- including one that was meant to be in the Far East -- were shot near Fethiye on the Mediterranean coast . `` Turkey actually allowed us to combine our needs of four different looks in one country , quite remarkable , '' McDougall added .

7 ways to go local while traveling

Key West , Florida

`` Licence to Kill '' -LRB- 1989 -RRB- kicks off with Timothy Dalton as Bond , parachuting in with his CIA pal Felix Leiter -LRB- David Hedison -RRB- to Felix 's wedding at St. Mary 's Star of the Sea Church in Key West after some insane aerial maneuvers .

Other scenes shot in the area include a car chase on Seven Mile Bridge , the segmented concrete -LRB- to make it hurricane-resistant -RRB- span you 'll cross if you 're driving to Key West , and a scene at the Ernest Hemingway Home in which M -LRB- Robert Brown -RRB- demands that Bond relinquish his `` license to kill . ''

Of Bond 's many visits to the Bahamas , the most memorable is Sean Connery 's 1965 `` Thunderball '' battle in the underwater caves of the Exuma Cays . They 've been known ever since as the Thunderball Grotto . -LRB- Connery returned there in 1983 for `` Never Say Never Again . '' -RRB-

Several charter companies , including Four C 's Adventures and the Island Routes 007 Thunderball Luxury Tour , will take you out to the grotto by boat and guide you on a snorkeling route to the inside of the caves , where light seems to stream in directly from heaven and colorful fish dart about below the water 's surface . Some tours also include a visit to the nearby Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park and a stop at the Staniel Cay Yacht Club , where you can dine or spend the night .

Paris

With an `` I 'm too old for this stuff '' look on his face , Roger Moore as Bond chased Grace Jones as May Day up the steps of the Eiffel Tower in `` A View to a Kill '' -LRB- 1985 -RRB- , only to watch her parachute off the top in one of the film 's more memorable scenes . -LRB- It was almost as unforgettable as Duran Duran 's video for the film 's theme song . -RRB-

On a tour of the tower , you 'll learn about Franz Reichfelt 's tragic demonstration of his `` parachute suit '' in 1912 , which should convince you that parachuting is not the thing to do here . However , if you 're feeling fit , you can climb the 704 steps from the ground to the second floor . From there , you can catch the lift to the top , where you 'll find a Champagne bar with killer views of its own .

`` On Her Majesty 's Secret Service '' -LRB- 1969 -RRB- took us to the mountaintop : the 2,970-meter-high Schilthorn in Switzerland 's Bernese Alps , which George Lazenby as Bond skied down at breathtaking speed , with Telly Savalas as Blofeld in pursuit . It 's one of the great movie ski chase scenes , now documented in an exhibit at Piz Gloria , the world 's first revolving restaurant , which doubled as the Bleuchamp Institute for Allergy Research in the film .

Bregenz , Austria

The James Bond producers were so impressed by the 2007 production of Tosca at the open-air Seeb√É 1/4 hne floating stage on Lake Constance -LRB- or Bodensee -RRB- , they knew they had to work it into a film . That 's why in `` Quantum of Solace '' -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , Daniel Craig finds himself chasing bad guys under the startling open-eye backdrop of the `` Tosca '' set designed by Johannes Leiacker .

Auyuittuq National Park , Canada

`` Nobody Does it Better '' than the opening sequence of `` The Spy Who Loved Me '' -LRB- 1977 -RRB- , in which Roger Moore BASE jumps off the edge of a mountain and ... whoosh ! A Union Jack parachute opens and wafts him to safety . `` No effects , all done in camera for real , '' McDougall points out . -LRB- BASE is an acronym for Buildings , Antennas , Spans and Earth , the four things you can jump from . -RRB-
