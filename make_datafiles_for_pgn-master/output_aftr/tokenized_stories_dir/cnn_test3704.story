-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serbia 's president apologized Thursday for the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica , but declined to characterize the killings as an act of genocide .

`` I kneel and ask for forgiveness , '' President Tomislav Nikolic told Bosnian TV . `` I apologize for the crimes committed by any person in the name of Serbia . ''

Nikolic came under fire last year short after he was elected by declaring , according to published reports , there was no `` genocide '' in Srebrenica .

He has since been urged by Bosnian leaders to acknowledge the killings , which the prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have described as a systematic extermination .

At the time of the massacre , Srebrenica had been designated a U.N. `` safe area '' for people , predominantly Bosnian Muslims , trying to escape the advancing Bosnian Serb army .
