-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As thousands gathered to mark the one-year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings , one sight evoked memories of the attack that spurred widespread carnage : suspicious bags near the finish line .

But how are police preparing for this year 's marathon , which takes place Monday ? Given that the 26.2-mile course runs through eight cities and towns , how can police possibly prevent every suspicious item from slipping through ?

When asked what was in the backpack , the man told the officer it was a rice cooker , Boston Police Superintendent Randy Halstead said .

`` We looked into the backpack , saw that it was what appeared to be a rice cooker , had the individual take the knapsack off , drop it on the street , and he was taken into custody , '' Halstead said .

The man , in his early 20s , was identified by prosecutors as Kevin Edson He is also known as Kayvon Edson , officials said . He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct , disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device , Halstead said .

A bomb squad inspected the bag and deemed it safe .

Officials say they have gone to great lengths to make sure nothing like last year 's attacks will happen again .

In Tuesday 's incident , the superintendent said , the `` training kicked in . ''

`` We did n't receive pushback about the no-rucksack rule , '' Schwartz told CNN last month .

He also urged spectators to not carry large coolers or wear costumes or masks .

The Boston Athletic Association , which organizers the marathon , said while backpacks and handbags are prohibited for participants , spectators are also encouraged to leave such items at home .

Containers with more than 1 liter of liquid , costumes covering the face , and bulky clothes such as vests with pockets wo n't be allowed .

Unregistered runners and cyclists intending jump into the race along various points are n't welcome this year , either .

`` We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year 's Boston Marathon as a display of support , '' the BAA said in a statement . `` But we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves . ''

A massive enterprise

This year 's marathon will be a massive enterprise .

Keeping that in mind , police will double the number of officers on patrol from last year ; 3,500 of them will be among the crowd . They will be aided by 100 additional security cameras , and bomb-sniffing dogs .

`` In this world , you never eliminate risk ; you never bring it down to zero , '' State Police Col. Timothy Alben told reporters last month . `` But we are working very hard at reducing that risk level and managing it to the best of our collective abilities . ''

According to Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau , the marathon and related events will bring in an estimated $ 175.8 million -- the highest-ever Boston Marathon spending impact .
