Naval Air Facility El Centro , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's Prince Harry , the younger son of Prince Charles , has arrived at a U.S. military base in California for the final phase of helicopter gunship training , according to a United Kingdom Ministry of Defense statement Friday .

Capt. Harry Wales , as he 's known on the airfield , will begin live-fire training , which is combined with `` environmental and judgment training . ''

His training space is a bit famous , too : The El Centro base , which is in California 's Imperial Valley about 110 miles east of San Diego and just minutes north of the Mexican border , is the winter home of the U.S. Navy 's Blue Angels . It is also where much of the film `` Top Gun '' with Tom Cruise was filmed , said U.S. Navy Capt. Devon Jones , commanding officer .

The helicopter exercises will require the group of 20 British airmen to use all the lessons they have learned in the past 14 months of their training , Bullen said .

His brother , Prince William , is also in the military , as an army officer . But as second in line for the throne , he is specifically barred from combat .

The tactical exercises will test the fighting awareness of the prince and his 19 classmates .

The El Centro instruction will focus on aviation environmental training and crew judgment . The students will be tested on handling the aircraft in mountainous and desert conditions , including dust landings and desert landings by day and night .

`` We 'll have guys on the ground acting as civilians or the enemy , and they 'll have to use their judgment , '' Bullen said .

In the second month of training , the two-man helicopter crews will use live fire on the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range complex at the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in southern Arizona .

`` We 'll have friendly troops that will indicate a target , and they will have to engage it , '' Bullen said . `` This is the first time they will fire armaments outside of simulators .

Jones said that Prince Harry wo n't receive any special treatment on the base . `` We will treat him as we do all our visiting British personnel , '' he told reporters .

Added Bullen about the prince : `` He is treated exactly the same as any other student on the course , and he would n't want to be treated any differently . ''

Upon completion of Exercise Crimson Eagle , Prince Harry will return to Britain as a fully trained Apache pilot and will then be assigned to one of the Apache squadrons within 16 Air Assault Brigade , where he will gain more experience flying the attack helicopter and participate in exercises in the United Kingdom , the British military said .

The British Apache force , which is operated by that country 's Army Air Corps , is based in Wattisham , Suffolk , in England , and has been active in Afghanistan the past five years , officials said . The force also provided support recently in Libya . Wattisham Airfield was used by the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II , officials said .
