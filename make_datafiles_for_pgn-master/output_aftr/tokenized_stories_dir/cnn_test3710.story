`` But this is real golf , with real clubs on real fairways , '' he told CNN .

Making a par on his opening hole , he then had to watch as his nine-year-old daugher Sasha made a hole in one , besting her dad in front of the gathered ranks of the world 's media .

Obama might well be tempted to put his handicap on the line at the ground-breaking new course being constructed at Curley 's Mission Hills Haikou development .

Fantasy golf

Mindful of the impression that there is a `` sameness '' to the courses being churned out in their droves in the fastest expanding golf market in the world , Curley and his team wanted to come up with something that he felt would appeal to the wider Chinese public and other visitors to the resort .

So instead of bunkers , rough and trees , the players will be faced with a replica of the Great Wall of China winding its way the length of a 400-meter par four hole .

It also has a hole to rival the infamous `` island green '' seen at TPC Sawgrass in Florida , home of the the U.S. PGA Tour 's Players Championship .

That tricky 17th sees the best in the world attempt to hit their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by water , and spectators delight in seeing the likes of Tiger Woods find the lake .

Standing on the tee , players will not know whether to laugh or cry , and the degree of difficulty may not end there .

Curley is promising the addition of `` man made '' gale force winds on each tee , adjustable depending on the standards of the players and available by hitting a red button .

On a conventional golf course , the degree of difficulty is often dictated by which tee the player chooses to play from . Leading professionals play from the tees furthest from the hole , while higher handicappers can opt to hit their first shot from much closer .

On the Chinese fantasy course , one of the par-3s will give golfers the choice of hitting their ball onto a tiny green surrounded by lava rocks .

In true mini-golf fashion , the other easier option at the volcano theme hole will let players hit towards a mound from which the ball will be whisked nearer the hole down a pipe .

`` This will be a fun alternative for families , novices and children on holiday , '' he was quoted in the Asian edition of Golf Course Industry International .

Last year the Hainan Island development staged the World Cup teams event for the first time , taking over from the Mission Hills complex at Shenzhen .

This year Shenzhen was the venue of the prestigious HSBC-World Golf Championship event , won by Englishman Ian Poulter .

The Ryder Cup hero conquered the conventional bunker-bound Olazabal course in 21 under par , but knowing Poulter 's reputation as a golfing trendsetter , he will probably be itching to test his mettle on Curley 's new wacky creation at the first opportunity .
