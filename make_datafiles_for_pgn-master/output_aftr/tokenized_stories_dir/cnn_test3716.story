Johannesburg , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Flicking through her photos on her living room couch , Julia Quinn recounts the array of plastic surgery procedures she has undergone .

There is n't much cosmetic surgery that this housewife from Surrey in the UK has not had done .

`` You get a lot of good surgeons and dentists in South Africa , '' says Quinn . `` It 's like a holiday -- you are looked after , the weather is fine . ''

January is a good time to flee the UK 's winter weather , so Quinn is heading back to Johannesburg for more work . This time it 's a mini facelift and more liposuction . In total , she will have spent nearly $ 15,000 on surgery in South Africa . She says should would have spent a lot more if she had continued to be treated in the UK .

In a suburb in northern Johannesburg Lorraine Melvill is running around trying to organize hospital visits for her clients staying in her guest house . She started her business , `` Surgeon and Safari , '' back in 2000 and since then she has had people from all over the world , including Quinn , come to her to facilitate their cosmetic procedures , and perhaps go on safari too .

`` For most people in the first-world economies like the UK , and especially in America , their biggest desire is to go on African safari , '' she explains , `` and yet their greatest want in their life was to have plastic surgery , so why not put the two together ? ''

However , whilst the United States and eurozone economies may have languished , Melvill says she has benefited from the growth of some African countries ' economies .

`` There is a huge emergence of local Africans that chose to come to South Africa for elective surgery , whether it be breast reduction , tummy tucks , lipo , '' she says .

Chetan Patel works at Johannesburg 's private Mediclinic , in Sandton . In the three years that he has been a private cosmetic and reconstructive surgeon , he says that he has also seen an increase in clients flying in from parts of sub-Saharan Africa .

`` Certainly we are seeing people from very high income groups , '' says Patel . `` From a regional African point of view , countries such as Nigeria , Ghana , the DRC , all play an important role where socio-economic factors all dictate that there are more and more people who can afford this kind of surgery and so we are seeing a larger amount of those people coming certainly to Johannesburg for that kind of surgery . ''

`` Other than that , I think more and more African women are conscious of what their lower bodies look like , so what their tummy looks like , so they would like tummy tuck procedures , for instance . ''

`` It is not a necessity it is a luxury , so I see the trend -LSB- in having plastic surgery in -RSB- the next five to 10 years increasing amongst people from the rest of Africa , '' he says .

For now , though , it 's people like Quinn who are keeping Melvill and Patel busy ; repeat customers are the norm in the area of elective surgeries , Melvill says .

In fact , Melvill says that these days most of her clients opt instead to spend the day on a different type of safari ; they choose to visit the nearby designer shops .
