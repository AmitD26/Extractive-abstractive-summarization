-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Officers in two Utah cities will make extra patrols Monday , the anniversary of the slayings of two women -- one in 2006 , the other in 2008 -- who investigators believe were killed by the same person .

Investigators recently learned forensic evidence links the February 9 , 2006 , killing of a pregnant Sonia Mejia and the February 9 , 2008 , slaying of Damiana Castillo , police in two neighboring Salt Lake City suburbs announced last week .

Authorities are trying to determine whether the date is significant , but they want residents `` to be cautious in general '' and not focus just on Monday , West Valley City police Sgt. Mike Powell said . Still , police will do extra patrols Monday `` just so the public is aware we 're out and about , '' he said .

Investigators are not saying a serial killer was involved , Powell said . But the links are alarming for the involved neighborhoods , which are heavily populated by Latinos , the director of a Hispanic advocacy group said .

Mejia , 29 , was six months ' pregnant when she was sexually assaulted and strangled , CNN affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City reported . She was found dead in her Taylorsville apartment , and her unborn child died , too , police said .

Her car was found abandoned outside a hotel in nearby Murray , Utah , according to KSL . Some jewelry of Mejia 's is missing , Powell said .

Police in both cities announced on Wednesday that forensic evidence linked the slayings to one killer , and that they had reason to believe he was a Hispanic male in his late teens or early 20s , standing between 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches tall , weighing 135 to 150 pounds and having short black hair .

Powell declined to say how investigators arrived at those details or what kind of forensic evidence linked the killings . Police have n't said whether the women knew their attacker .

The link between the February 9 stranglings has rattled some residents in the area , KTVX reported .

`` Sometimes they 're worried about their -LSB- immigration -RSB- status . We 're not interested in that . Come forward regardless , '' Powell said in an interview after the news conference .

Police reached out to Yapias and other leaders of Hispanic advocacy groups , Yapias said . Yapias ' group is working with Spanish-language media in the area to spread information about the killings and investigators ' request for information , he said .

`` Law enforcement has assured everyone that if someone is undocumented and they have information , they just want the information , '' Yapias said . `` But if they 're afraid because of their legal status , then I or any other community leader can act as a mediator to make sure they 're going to be protected . ''

Anyone with information about the slayings can call the task force 's tip line at 801-965-5121 or send an e-mail to the task force at taskforce@wvc-ut.gov , police said .
