That 's the blood of 24-year-old Mohamed Hamdan , who was reciting the Quran when a missile from an Israeli drone struck him Monday .

Abu Sheir and his colleagues scraped together the unconscious and broken Hamdan . He tells CNN how he and his colleagues struggled to plug the holes in the man 's body with gauze to stop him from bleeding to death -- all while the ambulance races toward Gaza 's main hospital , Shifa .

It 's back at the ambulance depot that we catch up with Abu Sheir and more than a dozen of his colleagues . It 's here where the tragic cycle begins again .

It all starts with a phone call -- the emergency number in Gaza is one , zero , one . At the ambulance dispatch center located in Jerusalem Hospital in Gaza City , workers from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society monitor phones , maps and computers while they wait for the inevitable . A board illuminated with red numbers tallies 193 dead and 1,481 injured as of Tuesday afternoon .

The fight between the Israeli military and Gaza militants began over a week ago . It 's not the first time .

But he 's also acutely aware that every dispatch puts his paramedics in harm 's way .

In Cast Lead , he says he had more than 30 paramedics killed and almost all of his ambulances destroyed . In 2012 's conflict , he says , one paramedic was killed and 7 were injured . This time around , he says , he 's been lucky : only 15 paramedics have been injured .

`` Everything is bad in the war . We do not like war , '' says Shahwan . `` We want this war to stop . '' The phone rings once again , when suddenly the building shutters and windows rattle . A large bomb just exploded nearby .

On the lookout for a second explosion

A controlled panic grips the station as ambulance after ambulance races toward the rising plume of black smoke . They stop short of the crater . Experience has taught them that there could be a second bomb . Paramedics and firefighters wait in the periphery until they get the all clear . This time nobody was injured .

They return to base , where Abu Sheir and other paramedics sit with a feast of rice , lamb , dates and juice . Night is just beginning to fall and the ambulance men are getting ready to break their fast . This is the Islamic holy month of Ramadan , during which the faithful abstain from eating or drinking between sunrise to sunset . They joke around about being tempted to break it too early ; something frowned upon .

Another call haunts him , too .

`` We heard two kids selling ice cream were hit in Al Shajaya neighborhood , '' he says . `` The only thing we could do for them was to collect the pieces of their bodies . ''

False hope and a realization

Then there is 50-year-old Jihad Seleem . There 's not much this paramedic of 17 years and father of two has n't seen . But even this stoic man has trouble talking about his worst encounter .

The fighting was about to get worse and the scars were about to cut a whole lot deeper .

Abu Sheir got an update about his wounded patient 's condition -- the young man hit in a drone strike . He did n't make it . He died at the hospital .

How did this happen ? Iraq , Syria , Gaza and Libya all in flames
