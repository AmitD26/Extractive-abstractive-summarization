-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of flights to and from eastern China were canceled or delayed Monday and state media warned that more disruptions should be expected in the next few weeks .

Around 200 flights were canceled at Shanghai 's two airports -- Pudong and Hongqiao -- which are among the country 's busiest airline hubs . Another 120 flights were delayed for more than two hours .

Officials and airlines have shed little light on the reasons for the disruptions .

Local officials cited `` air traffic restrictions '' while Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines said `` the airspace was occupied , '' according to the Shanghai Daily newspaper .

Neither source has elaborated on their comments .

`` Among situations for air traffic restrictions being imposed are when military maneuvers are taking place , '' the newspaper added .

This is the second large-scale air traffic disruption in China in the last two weeks .

More than 100 flights were canceled or delayed on July 14 in Shanghai .

Two Internet users have been held by police for allegedly fabricating and circulating `` anti-corruption-related '' claims , according to Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post .

The Internet users claimed the disruption was due to the arrest of a high-ranking government official trying to flee the country .

Another 37 people were reprimanded in the crackdown against Internet `` rumor mongers , '' according to SCMP .

China 's air traffic woes continue

In June 2013 , Beijing 's Capital International Airport hit the bottom of a list of the world 's most delayed airports , according to U.S.-based air travel information service FlightStats .

Overly cautious air traffic control and airspace restrictions for civilian aircraft are two of the reasons for these delays , but flights are also affected by thick smog and once , an unidentified flying object -LRB- UFO -RRB- .
