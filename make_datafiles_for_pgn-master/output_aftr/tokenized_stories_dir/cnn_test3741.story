The video , released Friday to CNN by Idaho State University , features a man dressed in all black , with brown hair , a beard and a crucifix hanging around his neck .

`` My name is Oscar Ortega from Idaho Falls , Idaho , and I feel like I am the perfect candidate to get cast on your show because not only do I have a solution to make a huge impact on this world with small changes to our daily lives , I also have with me the answer to worldwide peace , '' he states .

The previous Friday , a witness in Washington described to investigators hearing about `` eight sounds of popping noise '' and seeing `` puffs of air '' from a car that was registered to Ortega . One bullet hit a window on the White House but was stopped by bulletproof glass , the Secret Service said , while another was found on the White House exterior .

The president was in California that day , traveling with first lady Michelle Obama later that night to Hawaii .

Many questions remain unanswered about the young man who faces the rare charge of trying to kill the president of the United States .

Public and court records shed some light on Ortega 's background , as does a story that appeared Friday in the Post Register in Idaho Falls . So , too , does the video shot by Idaho State student Ramon Bailey in September , according to CNN affiliate KIFI .

He segues to a rant against the U.S. government , which he claims bullies other nations and has `` deceived the American people so that -LRB- it -RRB- can steal other countries ' goods , which is the oil . ''

The `` Oprah '' show went off the air last spring . Still , Winfrey remains involved in the OWN network she helped create , and its website features `` casting calls '' for people who might want to get on air .

With long , tangled hair and a beard , Ortega wore a white jumpsuit and was handcuffed , his legs chained , as he entered a courtroom this week guarded by U.S. marshals .

`` That 's what started making me think there was something wrong , '' his sister told the Idaho newspaper . `` I 'd ask , ` Is it for the -LRB- mixed-martial arts -RRB- fighting ? ' He said , ` No . I 'm just trying something different . ' It was weird . Now he looks like , I guess , like a terrorist . It 's like he 's trying to play out the part . ''

Before , he would party a lot , and before his recent departure from Idaho , had been spending more time with his son , whose name is tattooed on his neck , his mother said . Ortega mentions his son in the video .

`` A year ago , every Friday and Saturday night , he was out partying with his friends and not coming home at all , '' Maria Hernandez told the newspaper . `` He started staying home on the weekends with his little boy .

`` It was not like he was acting violent or getting drunk and all drugged up . ''

Public records show that Ortega had a series of run-ins with the law going back into his teen years . Some charges were for minor infractions , like failure to affix tags to a dog 's collar and seat belt violations . He was charged at least twice with battery , but those charges were dismissed . In 2010 , in connection with one of those incidents , he was convicted of resisting arrest .

Other charges included minor-in-possession of alcohol charges and even more traffic violations . In some cases , he was found guilty and paid fines , and others were dismissed .

Another witness , identified as `` W-6 , '' also quoted Ortega calling Obama `` the anti-Christ . '' This witness told agents Ortega told him he `` needed to kill him . ''

A third witness , `` W-7 , '' told investigators Ortega owned an `` AK-47 like gun . '' His `` opinions and comments regarding the government and President Obama have gotten worse '' over the past year , the witness told agents .
