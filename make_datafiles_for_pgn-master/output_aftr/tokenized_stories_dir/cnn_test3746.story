Nanjing , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Off-camera , I 'm getting parenting advice from China 's first athlete to win gold in any sport at the Winter Olympics .

`` Your daughter should go for ice skating , '' Yang Yang advises me . `` It 's great for her balance ! ''

Yang herself is a product of a vigorous state system that created elite national athletes . She brought home that long-awaited gold medal in short-track speed skating from the Salt Lake City Olympiad in 2002 .

To realize her dream , Yang tells me she skated for 23 years , six days a week , for almost 12 hours a day .

`` Once you become an athlete , you want to win . That 's the most important thing , '' she says .

Kids driven away

`` In the West , we look more at physical education as part of education , whereas here , for many years , the educators have tried to keep sport out of education , '' he tells me .

`` I had the opportunity to meet President Xi Jinping twice , '' says the International Olympic Committee President . `` You see clearly the government has realized that sport must be part of education and that sport helps in education . ''

Byer is doing his part as the Head Technical Adviser to the Chinese School Football program , a project that works with two million children in more than 6,200 schools across China . His success at teaching football skills to students in Japan earned him stardom there , and an invitation to bring his technical magic to China .

Shanghai-based Sheng Li is one of China 's top sports agents . He laments how professional sports in China lack the infrastructure to make more money for his clients , like professional boxer and Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming .

`` If you come through the national system , you have the coach and the training system , '' Li says . `` But there 's a whole system behind a -LRB- professional -RRB- athlete : the PR , the brand , the corporate sponsorship , helping them find the best coaches outside the system .

Olympic bid

Yang is supporting China 's athletes after their Olympic dream with the Athlete Career Program she started as part of her foundation .

She 's also getting more children interested in sport with a new skating school in Shanghai that is open to everyone .

Winning the bid and hosting the games would transform the sport scene in China , sparking greater interest in winter sports like snowboarding , skiing and skating .

@highlight

China has created a vigorous state system that has produced elite national athletes

@highlight

But some argue the emphasis on winning has discouraged many children

@highlight

At the other end of the scale , sport is not considered a part of your education in China

@highlight

China has also struggled in sports like football , interest in holding a Winter Olympics is low
