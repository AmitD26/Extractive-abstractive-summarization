-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Historically , surveillance was difficult and expensive .

But while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance , the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there . The former always collected information about everyone , but over time , collected more and more of it , while the latter always collected maximal information , but over time , collected it on more and more people .

As technology improved , corporations were able to collect more . As the cost of data storage became cheaper , they were able to save more data and for a longer time . And as big data analysis tools became more powerful , it became profitable to save more . Today , almost everything is being saved by someone -- probably forever .

Governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance . Why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data ? For example we just learned that the NSA collects e-mail , IM and social networking contact lists for millions of Internet users worldwide .

But as corporations started collecting more information on populations , governments started demanding that data . Through National Security Letters , the FBI can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant . Through secret agreements , the NSA can monitor the entire Internet and telephone networks .

This is a huge part of the public-private surveillance partnership .

Data is a byproduct of the information society . Every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record , and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day . Even if we do n't use a computer -- buying something in person with cash , say -- the merchant uses a computer , and the data flows into the same system . Everything we do leaves a data shadow , and that shadow is constantly under surveillance .

Data is also a byproduct of information society socialization , whether it be e-mail , instant messages or conversations on Facebook . Conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded , and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go .

Moore 's law has made computing cheaper . All of us have made computing ubiquitous . And because computing produces data , and that data equals surveillance , we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance .

Now we need to figure out what to do about it . This is more than reining in the NSA or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse . We need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource , a part of us that is inherently ours by right , or a private good to be bought and sold .

Writing in The Guardian , Chris Huhn said that `` information is power , and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom . '' How this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined .

Schneier : Government and corporate surveillance used to be very different

He says today NSA can piggyback on corporate surveillance ; they 're like partners

Schneier : We need to decide whether data is a societal resource or a commodity
