-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Google expanded the digital world of cloud computing on Tuesday , announcing the rollout of `` Google Drive . ''

`` This is really just the next step in the evolution of Google Cloud , '' Scott Johnston , group product manager for Google Drive , told CNN . `` It 's really letting people live more in the cloud by connecting them more easily with all the devices they have . ''

Google Cloud already lets users store e-mail and other documents .

Cloud computing allows users to store documents and files , even large ones , on remote servers . Its promise is to make storage space on physical hard drives less important , as well as making it easier to seamlessly share , either with others or between multiple devices like laptops , phones and tablets .

Google Drive will launch with an Android app for smartphones and tablets running Google 's mobile operating system and in conjunction with 20 third-party apps .

As one might expect with a Google product , a big feature of Google Drive is a search feature that will allow users to comb through more than 30 types of files , such as Google docs or PDFs . There 's also a limited image-search feature , driven by Google Goggles technology , that can recognize famous faces and landmarks , such as Mount Everest .

Users may upgrade to 25 GB of storage for as little as $ 2.50 a month , Google says .

As more computer users are accessing the Web or doing work on multiple devices , cloud storage has rapidly evolved as a popular alternative to hard drives .

Apple 's iCloud service has been available since last June and , according to Apple , has more than 100 million users . And Dropbox , the leading independent cloud-storage service , reportedly has racked up another 50 million .

But others say that with a player as major as Google , even a late entrance in the market will have an impact .

`` Google Drive is significant because now all Google account holders have one click signup to free file storage , sync and sharing , which has the potential to quickly build a large volume of users , '' said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett .

CNN 's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story .
