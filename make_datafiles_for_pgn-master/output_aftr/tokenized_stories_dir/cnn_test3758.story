-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Julie Quiroz , a 14-year-old U.S. citizen , has been separated from her mother for nearly two years . Her mom was deported to Mexico for being in the United States illegally .

At the age of 12 , Julie was forced to decide between her country and her family . With the help of a Christian philanthropist , she chose to stay in the United States .

`` It 's really , really hard to leave your family , '' she told CNN by phone .

Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result , according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center .

`` Among children whose parents are unauthorized immigrants , one in three is poor . The -LSB- poverty -RSB- rate of children of unauthorized immigrants is similar whether the children are unauthorized immigrants or U.S. born , '' the study says .

Roughly 12 million illegal immigrants are in the United States -- about 4 percent of the nation 's population . The study found that the majority of illegal immigrants , about 7 million , come from Mexico .

Shuya Ohno with the Washington-based advocacy organization National Immigration Forum said the study underscores how the nation 's immigration situation is `` not so simple . ''

`` This really highlights the fact that so many undocumented families are of mixed status -- that there is a U.S. citizen in the direct family , '' he said .

Undocumented immigrants make up more than 5 percent of the U.S. work force , according to the study , based on March 2008 figures from the U.S. Census Bureau .

The children of illegal immigrants make up an even greater share of students in America 's primary and secondary schools , with nearly 7 percent enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade . That figure has jumped , from 5.4 percent in 2003 .

In states near Mexico 's border -- Arizona , California , Colorado , Nevada and Texas -- about 10 percent of the student population are the children of illegal immigrants .

The study also found that these children are more likely to live in a two-parent home , compared with the rest of the nation .

He has urged Obama to issue an executive order to stay the deportation of any undocumented parent of a citizen child to prevent the separation of families . `` It 's the only humane thing to do , '' he said .

Julie , who first told her story to CNN last year , said she speaks to her mom nearly every day by phone and communicates with her via e-mail . `` I miss them a lot , '' she said . `` I mean big time ! ''

She last visited her family in Mexico City at Christmas . She said she hopes to be a lawyer for immigrants one day `` to help make their dreams come true , to make a better life here . ''

She added with a sigh , `` It 's not right what they 're doing -- separating families . ''
