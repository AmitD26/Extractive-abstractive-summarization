-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Severe thunderstorms ripped through central Oklahoma Monday triggering vicious flash floods that left 136 people injured , roads and cars submerged , and thousands without power , authorities said .

A state of emergency has been declared in 59 of Oklahoma 's 77 counties , at the request of Gov. Brad Henry , who is out of town . Lt. Gov. Jari Askins , who approved the emergency paperwork , commended the state 's emergency crews , saying , `` Once again , our heroic responders have demonstrated the Oklahoma Standard . ''

CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the damage Monday morning was caused by `` backbuilding thunderstorms , '' a series of heavy rain cores without intermittent periods of let-up .

It 's a `` bad situation throughout the entire county , '' said Oklahoma County Sheriff 's Office spokesman Mark Myers .

According to Ooten , several state buildings in the metro area were damaged in the deluge . Those affected agencies either closed or reduced their services because of the flooding .

Standing flood waters also can be dangerous , the Oklahoma State Department of Health warned . They urged residents to avoid the water as it can contain snakes , insects , sharp objects , oil , gasoline , and in some case raw sewage .

Glynda Chu , a police spokeswoman in nearby Edmond , said it was the worst flooding that city has seen in 25 years .

CNN iReporter Jennifer Oliver , who lives in Edmond , says there 's normally a little creek with a 20-foot waterfall behind her house , but by late morning , she could n't even make it out . `` Never seen anything quite like that , '' Oliver said .

KOCO broadcast pictures of a car submerged almost to its windows . Dive teams navigated the raging waters to get to the scene and then rescued the car 's occupants by boat . CNN affiliate KFOR showed another water rescue , with crews ferrying people to safety .

It 's a dangerous situation for rescue crews as well . CNN affiliate KWTV showed gripping video of a woman trapped in a tree , struggling through the rushing water in search of stronger branches to hold . Oklahoma City Fire Battalion Chief Kirk Wright said the first rescue boat sent her way got stuck , stranding the three would-be rescuers . Another team set off for the scene and returned safely with all four people .

The National Weather Service was issuing flood warnings across the breadbasket region Monday . Most of Nebraska and southeastern Kansas were under advisories Monday afternoon .

The Weather Service said 3 inches of rain had fallen in both Tulsa , Oklahoma , and Kansas City , Missouri , which experienced flash floods Monday morning . But Morris said the Kansas City overflow had affected only low-lying areas and did n't look like a threat to homes or businesses .
