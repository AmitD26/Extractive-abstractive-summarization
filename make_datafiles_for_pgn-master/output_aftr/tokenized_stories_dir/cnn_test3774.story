First , when you hear the candidates talk about `` job creators , '' that 's just another way of saying `` rich people '' or `` the guy bankrolling my super Pac . ''

When someone says `` family values , '' that 's to remind the audience that they do n't like gay people ; `` religious freedom '' means `` Christianity '' ; and it 's not really a GOP debate until a candidate attacks the `` liberal media '' for asking questions they 're too afraid to answer .

We must secure the border .

Ron Paul said `` If elected president , I would move to quickly end foreign nation building efforts and use many of the resources we waste playing world 's policemen to control our southern border . ''

They all will receive applause , and it will all sound great ... until you realize that `` secure the border '' is slang for `` keep the Mexicans out . ''

Oh boy , here comes the black guy playing the race card again .

Yep , that 's me -- pointing out that the Canadian border is largely ignored in this dialogue despite being more than twice the size of the Mexican border and less than 1 % secure , according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office . Even if we were to disregard the 1,538 miles between Alaska and Canada , the 3,987 mile border connecting the lower 48 to our neighbors up north is still much larger than the 1,933-mile stretch that connects us to Mexico .

And yet the attention we give the northern border is miniscule at best when compared to the resources we allocate to the south . There are definitely reasons for serious concern about safety along the Mexican border , but according to our own intelligence , Mexico should hardly be our only concern .

You would think presidential hopefuls genuinely concerned about our safety would remember that just four years ago , Michael Chertoff , President Bush 's Homeland Security secretary , said he was more afraid of terrorists coming into the country from Canada than Mexico and that his department arrested more people connected to al Qaeda and Hezbollah trying to come in from up north than down south .

This is not to perpetuate the myth that the September 11 terrorists came through Canada or defame our northern neighbors . But rather to point out the glaring disconnect between some of the crowd-pleasing rhetoric the GOP candidates like to deliver about `` securing the border '' and the more nuanced reality .

We know an estimated 350,000 people trying to come in through Mexico in 2011 were stopped . We also know that number is down from the 447,731 arrests made in 2010 and that is significantly less than the 1,643,679 people stopped in 2000 .

Why ?

Last year a group of senators had to petition the Obama administration for military assistance to catch the drug traffickers who were using low-flying planes to move their products from Canada into the United States . Ten years after 9/11 and we still had undetected aircraft crossing the border because it was n't the border we 're scared of .

You know , this whole immigration discussion would be a lot more productive if the people leading it would be more honest and stop pretending as if it 's only about national security . It 's a part , but the larger truth is that nonwhite people will be the majority in this country by 2040 and this browning of America scares the hell out of a lot of people , particularly some white people . The thinking goes that if the country can deport the Mexicans who are illegally here and stop new ones from coming in , maybe that trend will slow down or even reverse .
