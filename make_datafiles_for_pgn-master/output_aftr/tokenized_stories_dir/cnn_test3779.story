Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judge declared a mistrial Thursday after jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked in the murder trial of a teenager accused of gunning down a gay classmate in their Southern California classroom .

Ventura County Superior Court confirmed the ruling in the eight-week trial of Brandon McInerney , who was 14 at the time of the shooting in 2008 .

The nine-woman , three-man jury panel said its last vote resulted in seven in favor of finding the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter , CNN affiliates reported .

McInerney was tried as an adult on charges of first-degree murder , use of a handgun and a hate crime .

McInerney , now 17 , allegedly shot 15-year-old Lawrence King , an eighth grader at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard , twice while both were typing papers in a computer lab for their English class , authorities said .

Friends said King was proud of being openly gay . He liked wearing jewelry and makeup to school , and he often wore high-heeled boots with the school uniform . He asked his teachers to call him Leticia instead of Larry . Some students bullied him , pupils said .
