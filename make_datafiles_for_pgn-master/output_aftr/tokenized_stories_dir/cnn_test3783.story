The offbeat TV series , created by David Lynch and Mark Frost , will be returning to television in 2016 , according to a strange -LRB- of course -RRB- video posted on Showtime 's YouTube channel . The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch , `` Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me . ''

`` Dear Twitter Friends ... it is happening again ... #damngoodcoffee , '' Lynch tweeted .

When it debuted , `` Twin Peaks '' was like nothing else that had ever aired on television . Lynch -LRB- then best known as the director of `` Eraserhead '' and `` Blue Velvet '' -RRB- and Frost -- who had written for `` Hill Street Blues '' -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper , who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer .

The murder mystery was only the entry point into a bizarre world , one that was alternately drily witty and brutally violent . The straight-arrow Cooper was fond of a diner 's `` damn fine coffee '' and pie to an almost absurd degree . The show featured a one-armed man , a dancing dwarf , rumblings at the local lumber mill and a malevolent spirit named BOB .

The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti 's ghostly theme music .

Despite diverse reviews , the show remains one of the most influential in television history , with its involvement of a noted movie director , its willingness to take audiences to far-out places , its deliberate pace and its obsessed-about plot points and character tics . In many ways , it was ahead of its time .

Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new `` Twin Peaks '' episodes .
