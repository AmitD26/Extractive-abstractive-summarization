The country 's `` energiewende '' -- translated as energy transformation -- is part of the government 's plan to move away from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy sources , following Japan 's Fukushima disaster in 2011 .

Michael Limburg , vice-president of the European Institute for Climate and Energy , told CNN that the government 's energy targets are `` completely unfeasible . ''

`` Of course , it 's possible to erect tens of thousands of windmills but only at an extreme cost and waste of natural space , '' he said . `` And still it would not be able to deliver electricity when it is needed . ''

The government is investing heavily in onshore and offshore wind farms and solar technology in an effort to reduce 40 % of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 .

Last year Chancellor Angela Merkel , who this week won her third term as Germany 's leader , proposed to construct offshore wind farms in the North Sea , a plan that would cost 200 billion euros -LRB- $ 270 billion -RRB- , according to the DIW economic institute in Berlin .

As part of the energy drive , Merkel also pledged to permanently shut down the country 's 17 nuclear reactors , which fuel 18 % of the country 's power needs . Under Germany 's Atomic Energy Act , the last nuclear power plant will be disconnected by 2022 .

He added : `` Offshore wind is somewhat better in performance , cost and usability but still you have to spend six times as much as what you have to spend for a conventional power plant . ''

Paying the cost of renewable energy

Germans are already facing some of the highest energy bills in Europe .

Blackouts are another problem facing Germany 's energy industry .

Claudia Kemfert , professor of energy economics at the German Institute for Economic Research , told CNN Germany 's continued use of coal and fossil fuels to power its industrial hubs is making investors nervous .

She said : `` North -LRB- Sea -RRB- wind farms can provide 25 % of electricity production . Onshore wind could produce a higher share . Offshore wind energy is important for North Germany as already a lot of jobs have been created . ''

He said : `` The costs of offshore are ahead of us , that is true ... but the quicker everyone goes offshore the quicker the economies of scale and the costs come down . ''
