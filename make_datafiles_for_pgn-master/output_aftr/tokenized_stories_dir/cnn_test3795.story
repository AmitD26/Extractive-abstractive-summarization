Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin told reporters Tuesday that Russia is looking to redirect its attention to other projects after 2020 . His comments come as tensions mount over U.S. sanctions on Russia for its role in the crisis in Ukraine .

NASA released a statement saying that the U.S. space agency `` has not received any official notification from the Government of Russia on any changes in our space cooperation at this point . ''

NASA added that cooperation in space has been a hallmark of U.S.-Russian relations , even during the Cold War , and it pointed to the past 13 years of continuous human presence on the orbiting outpost .

Private industry has filled a gap by ferrying cargo in low-Earth orbit , and NASA has awarded cargo resupply contracts to the California-based SpaceX and the Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corporation .

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Rogozin 's statements . Orbital spokesman Barron Beneski told CNN that the company did not have an immediate reaction to the Russian reports , and he noted that the company 's contract calls for the delivery of cargo to the space station through 2016 .

The United States , Russia , Europe , Japan , and Canada are the principal entities involved in the operation of the International Space Station .

CNN 's Mike Ahlers , Greg Seaby and Samson Desta contributed to this report .
