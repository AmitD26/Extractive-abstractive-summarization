-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The death toll from flooding in the Philippines climbed to 140 Monday as a tropical depression in the Pacific sparked new fears of flooding .

iReporter Doranne Lim captures the desperate measures some people are being forced to take .

Flood water began to subside after a weekend that saw Manila hit with its heaviest rainfall in more than 40 years .

More than 80 percent of the capital was under water at one point Sunday . The deluge caused by Tropical Storm Ketsana , which has since strengthened into a typhoon , engulfed whole houses and buses .

Manila , on the island of Luzon , and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm . People huddled on rooftops Sunday waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety . Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters .

`` We 're really talking about maybe hundreds of thousands of people , '' with about 280,000 to 300,000 displaced in the island of Luzon alone , he said .

Though the Philippines is no stranger to floods , Saturday 's downpours approached a record , with a month 's worth of rain falling within six hours .

`` We 're hoping that there will be no more breaching of the dams , '' Gordon said . `` That 's one of the things that are very disconcerting to many people right now . ''

Mike Anthony Catuira spent Sunday retrieving valuable belongings and seeking cover on higher ground . Overflowing rivers in the municipality of Tanay in Rizal province had inundated shops and homes , he said .
