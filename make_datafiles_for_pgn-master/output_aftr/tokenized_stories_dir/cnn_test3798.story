Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A lawyer who filed a teen sex abuse lawsuit against `` X-Men '' director Bryan Singer said three more `` Hollywood types '' will be targeted in similar suits soon .

Michael Egan , who accuses Singer of sexually abusing him starting when he was 15 , appeared with attorney Jeff Herman at a news conference in Beverly Hills on Thursday .

`` I was a piece of meat , '' Egan , now 31 , told reporters . `` There was no relationship . ''

Singer 's representative said the accusations were `` completely without merit . ''

Singer is one of Hollywood 's most successful directors and producers , having directed two installments of the `` X-Men '' film franchise and a Superman movie in the past 15 years . His next film , `` X-Men : Days of Future Past , '' is set to hit theaters on May 23 .

Fox , the studio distributing the X-Men movies , issued a statement about the accusations Thursday .

`` These are serious allegations , and they will be resolved in the appropriate forum . This is a personal matter , which Bryan Singer and his representatives are addressing separately . ''

The alleged incidents detailed in the lawsuit happened in 1998 and 1999 , the suit said . Most of the alleged sex abuse took place at parties at a California mansion , while other incidents allegedly happened during two trips to Hawaii .

Singer `` promised acting roles to plaintiff in an X-Men movie , in commercials , and in other of his projects , and professed that he would arrange for plaintiff to audition for roles and projects in others ' productions , '' it alleged .

Egan said when his mother learned about the abuse when he was 17 she called the Los Angeles Police , who then brought in the FBI . Although he gave a statement to investigators , it `` fell on deaf ears '' and nothing came of the investigation , he said .

The FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles told CNN the agency would not confirm or deny that there was an investigation or why it might not have been pursued .

Egan and other teen boys were allegedly lured with incentives and threats , the suit said .

`` He was advised that those adult males controlled Hollywood and would destroy his hopes and dreams of an acting career if he did not keep them happy , '' the suit said . `` They threatened to ` eliminate ' him and his family , and told him that they were monitoring not only his phone , but those of his family members , and asserted he would be ` destroyed ' if he ever disclosed the unconscionable activities that occurred at the estate . ''

`` The parties were typically sordid and featured sexual contact between adult males and the many teenage boys who were present for the parties , '' the suit said . The teens were seduced by the `` distraction of alcohol and drugs , '' it said .

`` The nature of the parties was well-known and notorious among many men in the Hollywood entertainment industry , '' the complaint said .

Singer allegedly gave Egan `` drugs , including cocaine , a pill identified as ` green triangle ' which is believed to be a reference to the drug Ecstasy , Xanax , Rohypnol , pain pills believed to be Vicodin or Percocet , and alcoholic beverages , '' the suit said.Ã‚

Singer `` promised acting roles to plaintiff in an X-Men movie , in commercials , and in other of his projects , and professed that he would arrange for plaintiff to audition for roles and projects in others ' productions , '' it alleged .

Egan told reporters that after the FBI declined to help , he gave up on his dream of being an actor and `` buried it in me as deeply as I possibly could . ''

He said it was a silent conspiracy that `` goes from the bottom to the top of Hollywood '' with studios `` looking the other way . ''
