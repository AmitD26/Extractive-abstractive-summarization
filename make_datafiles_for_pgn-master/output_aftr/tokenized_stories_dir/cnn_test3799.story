Earlier this month , at least seven people were killed and dozens injured in a large fire that broke out at a knitwear factory on the outskirts of the capital , Dhaka . While the cause is not immediately known , the owner of the company said in a press briefing that the fire had originated in the chimney of a heating machine . He suggested the way the fire quickly spread through factory was mysterious .

Opinion : The bloodshed behind our cheap clothes

The incident was an eye-opener for many . It led to many changes in the garment sector in the months that followed . The country 's labor laws were amended with provisions requiring employers to introduce adequate safety measures for workers , while an agreement was signed by the government and representatives of Bangladesh employers ' and workers ' organizations to ensure a more integrated approach to improving safety .

Substandard

One of the biggest issues is compliance , in part due to the shortage of inspectors in Bangladesh able to cover the vast number of factories spread throughout the country . While steps are being taken to recruit more inspectors , it 's impossible to overlook the failures of the government 's accountability mechanisms . This has created a culture of impunity among factory owners . The failure of successive governments in Bangladesh , ranked in the bottom tier of the Corruption Perception Index -LRB- CPI -RRB- of global anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International , to curb wrongdoing in the garment industry has created an environment where disasters will happen .

A sector that started to grow quickly in the 1980s , the garment industry has never been accountable to the country 's labor laws and regulations . This is because owners are mostly from powerful sections of society who seemingly did n't bother to follow rules . According to one Bangladeshi media report , 10 % of lawmakers in the national parliament are owners of garment businesses in Bangladesh . According to Mishu , the number is actually even higher .

Rules ignored

Despite gradual amendments to labor laws , workers ' rights are still far from guaranteed . Human Rights Watch , while welcoming efforts to improve the legal framework , expressed concern that international standards for workplace safety are not being met . HRW also said the government `` has consciously limited basic workers ' rights while exposing workers to continued risks and exploitation . '' Crucially , the provision to punish factory owners in cases of accidents was not properly mentioned in the amended law . Though the law mentioned that `` adequate '' measures have to be taken to ensure air circulation , light , drinkable water and sanitation , the term `` adequate '' is not properly defined , leaving it to the discretion of owners .

Many factory owners still arbitrarily sack their employees as they do not give contracts to them , thus making it impossible for the workers to demand compensation at the labor court . Mishu says most workers in the garment sector are women , so their rights and entitlements are grossly ignored . Female workers are also frequently subjected to sexual harassment and often lose their jobs so that they can not claim maternity benefits .

Owners fight back

Factory owners also have their say in this whole saga . Many I have spoken to said that with such a competitive market worldwide , they simply ca n't give in to the demands of workers . They say persistent corruption and political chaos in Bangladesh has driven up the cost of doing business there . `` The buyers , despite our repeated failures to ensure compliance , come to Bangladesh as they can get the cheapest rate here compared to neighboring countries , '' one owner , who asked not to be identified , said .

With only a few initiatives by the government and no real evidence of the political will to improve safety standards at work , disasters will continue to happen . Measures will keep being promised without effective action . The workers , who keep the economy running , will continue to bare the brunt of injustice and deprivation .
