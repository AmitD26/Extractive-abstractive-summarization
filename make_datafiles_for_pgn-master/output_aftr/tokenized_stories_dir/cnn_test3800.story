-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Though he told authorities that the devil made him do it , Satanists disapproved , after a man allegedly shattered a stone copy of the Ten Commandments last week .

The man is accused of running his car on Friday into a controversial 6-foot-tall granite tablet of the biblical edicts erected near Oklahoma City 's Capitol , CNN affiliate KFOR reported .

The man told the agents that the devil made him wreck the religious monument , which was placed at the Capitol in late 2012 .

He also said he was mentally ill and had stopped taking his medication . He has been detained at a mental health facility for evaluation .

The ACLU filed suit last year against the presence of the monument on state property , and on Friday , said that it would keep fighting for its removal , because it feels it violates the Constitution .

But the organization was also `` outraged at this apparent act of vandalism . ''

`` If our monument stands at the state Capitol , we want it to complement and contrast the Ten Commandments , with both standing unmolested as a testament to American religious freedom and tolerance . ''

Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin has vowed to have the Ten Commandments monument rebuilt .
