Quarantined guests and hotel employees wave through the glass of the main entrance of Hong Kong 's Metro Park Hotel .

They include : two taxi drivers , two fellow taxi passengers , a local friend , 36 passengers within a three-row vicinity of the patient aboard a China Eastern flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong , and 300 guests and staff at the Metropark Hotel he checked into .

Among the two cab drivers , one was suspected of taking the patient from the airport to the hotel , and another was believed to have taken him from the hotel to the hospital .

Authorities are seeing another 40 to 50 guests whose names are on the hotel 's guest list . Some of them left their luggage behind .

`` They are gambling with their health , jeopardizing public health safety , '' said Dr. York Chow , secretary for Food and Health , appealing to the guests to come forward .

The government has assured that people under quarantine will have their visas automatically extended , their hotel lodging fees waived and their onward journeys prepared . The Wanchai hotel is providing guests $ 200 worth of free overseas telephone calls daily .
