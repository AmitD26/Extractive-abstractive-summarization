-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manchester City 's misfiring start to the English Premier League season continued on Saturday with a 2-1 loss to West Ham United at Upton Park .

The disappointing league result comes off the back of another lackluster display in the Champions League in midweek which saw Manuel Pellegrini 's side squander a 2-0 lead against CSKA Moscow to eventually draw the match 2-2 .

The Senegalese striker 's sixth goal in as many league games ultimately sank City who managed to pull one back through David Silva but could n't find an equalizer .

`` We had a lot of chances to score but it is difficult to win if you do n't take them , '' City boss , Pellegrini said .

`` I do n't think it was a fault of our team for the performance in the first half , it was more about the intensity of West Ham and you must credit them for that . We are just starting the season , we have 80 points left to play for . So it is early .

Elsewhere , there were wins for Southampton who rise to second place thanks to a 1-0 win over Stoke City .

Ronald Koeman 's side kept the winning habit with their sixth victory in seven league matches and now have 19 points from nine matches .

Dortmund slump continues

Hiroshi Kiyotake 's 62nd-minute winner consigned Jurgen Klopp 's team to a third home defeat of the league season and a sixth loss in all .

Their spectacular lack of league victories -- the latest defeat leaves Dortmund hovering above the relegation places in 15th -- is in stark contrast to the club 's Champions League form where they are riding high in Group D with three wins from three matches .

`` We ca n't do more , but we can do things better , Klopp said following the latest setback .

`` We are n't in a good situation in the Bundesliga and that 's something we have n't come to terms with until now . We 'll continue to fight , the opponent made a lot out of little , we made nothing out of a lot . ''

There was little to lift the gloom at Werder Bremen either as their manager Roger Dutt was shown the door on Saturday following Friday 's 1-0 loss to FC Cologne .

Bremen are without a win this season and are currently anchored to the foot of the table with four points from nine matches . The club has appointed under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik as caretaker manager until a full time replacement can be found .

There was joy , however , for Stuttgart who claimed all three points in a 5-4 win at Frankfurt . Martin Harnik and Christian Gentner both scored braces as the visitors leapfrogged Dortmund into 14th place .
