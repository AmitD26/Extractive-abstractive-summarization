Chapman , 59 , fired five rounds into Lennon outside New York 's Dakota Hotel on the evening of December 8 , 1980 . But in the 34 years since then , Chapman has found God , he testified to three New York parole commissioners August 20 .

He also told the parole board that he was `` an idiot '' for killing Lennon `` and choosing the wrong way to glory . ''

But the `` bright light of fame , of infamy , notoriety '' was irresistible , he added .

8th bid for release

Chapman 's testimony last week was his eighth request for freedom since he became eligible for release under the 20-years-to-life sentence for his second-degree murder conviction .

The commissioners denied parole as they 've done seven times before -- in 2000 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2010 and 2012 .

The hearing transcript and the decision were made public Wednesday .

`` I was confused , '' he told them . `` I needed a lot of attention at that time , and I took it out on him . ''

Decision was made at a young age

`` I just said to myself what would happen if I killed him , '' Chapman said . `` I remember that , and then the idea just avalanched on me that this was something I am going to have to do . It grabbed ahold of me and would n't let go . ''
