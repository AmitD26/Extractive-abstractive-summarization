With an app typically costing no more than $ 1.99 , everyone is becoming a news photographer -- creating dramatic , emotive images with subdued tones , vignetted edges and selective focus . Just point your iPhone or Android device , click the shutter button and instantly you 're producing something not short of fine art .

But every time I see one of these `` news images '' -- subtly altered to resemble images taken on vintage film stock or using expensive lenses and filters -- I feel cheated . And so should you .

The app photographer has n't spent years learning his or her trade , imagining the scene , waiting for the light to fall just right , swapping lenses and switching angles . They have n't spent hours in the dark room , leaning over trays of noxious chemicals until the early hours of the morning .

Nor did they have to spend a huge chunk of their income on the latest digital equipment -LRB- $ 5,999 of my hard-earned cash just went on ordering a new Nikon D4 -RRB- to ensure they stay on top of their game .

Why should I worry about the spread of app-doctored news photos ? Surely as a news photographer I should welcome the publication of news pictures of any kind , however they are taken . Well no . A news photographer is there to record , not to produce works of art .

Any news photographer worth his or her salt will tell you that the best camera is one that lets you take the photo unencumbered by the technicalities of the process . A camera that lets you record the scene with the light and shadows as it lies before you , and to produce an image that brings the emotion of the scene to the viewer -- one that lets you take the photograph naked .

This is what sets great news photographers apart from the rest of us . In their photos we can see the pain , the suffering , the pity and often the horror . A little of the photographer 's emotion will show through in every image .

Over the past few years a number of news photographers have quite rightly been fired for altering images with the help of Photoshop . One added smoke to increase the dramatic appearance of bombing , one cut and pasted a rifle-toting soldier from one image onto another and another removed his own shadow from an image .

Since when did we trust app developers to bring us the news ?
