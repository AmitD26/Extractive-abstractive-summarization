About 26 tons of marijuana had been transported through the tunnel to San Diego , and 10 of those tons were intercepted Tuesday by authorities as a tractor trailer was transporting the load from the Otay Mesa warehouse , officials said . About five tons were found by the Mexican military inside the Tijuana warehouse and the tunnel , officials said .

`` It 's not a good day for the cartels , '' said ICE director John Morton . `` They now ca n't move that size of drugs without digging a tunnel for 600 yards . It backfired on them .

The smuggling was active for about a month until this week 's seizure . The tunnel was rather small , and an individual ca n't stand up in it , Morton said . He described the railway as `` crude . ''

The seizure was also unusual because authorities made their bust while the smuggling was active , Morton said .

`` What 's unusual about this one is the amount of marijuana found as part of this investigation , '' Mack said .

The 30 tons is considered significant by U.S. and Mexican authorities even though Mexican authorities seized 105 tons of marijuana in Tijuana last month , the largest Mexican bust in recent years , Mack said .

`` So there 's been some pretty big drug busts , '' she said . `` We 're not letting our guard down . ''

In the past four years , 75 smuggling tunnels have been discovered on the U.S.-Mexican border , most of them in California and Arizona , authorities said . In all , about 125 tunnels have been found since the early 1990s , when authorities began keeping count , with just one of them on the U.S.-Canadian border , Mack said .

A special U.S. border tunnel task force hunts for underground smuggling operations in and around San Diego . The task force consists of agents from ICE , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Border Patrol , and they also work with Mexican authorities , Mack said .

In its surveillance of the Otay Mesa warehouse , the task force noticed suspicious activity Tuesday when they saw a tractor-trailer leave the facility . Agents followed the truck to a Border Patrol checkpoint at Temecula , California , and authorities found 10 tons of marijuana hidden in cardboard boxes on pallets , said ICE director John Morton .

A married couple driving the truck was arrested , he said .

The task force uses robots to scout out a newly discovered tunnel before agents are sent into it . Federal agents are trained like miners on how to negotiate confined spaces , and the San Diego-Mexico region is even used to test the latest ground-penetrating technology to detect tunnels , including by the U.S. military , Mack said .

The sophisticated tunnels -- with lighting , oxygen pumps and rail lines -- are typically used to ferry drugs from Mexico to the United States . The more rudimentary tunnels are just big enough to smuggle people into the country , Mack said .
