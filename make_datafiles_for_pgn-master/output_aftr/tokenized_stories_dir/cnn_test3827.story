Bariloche , Argentina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During a visit to Argentina 11 years ago , Elena Durón Miranda was horrified to see children as young as 3 years old rummaging through a trash dump for food and valuable materials .

`` I saw children collect green sausages , a bag of potato chip crumbs , a bag of noodles with cream , and recovered leftover yogurt next to a diaper , '' said Durón Miranda , a Mexican psychologist who was visiting Bariloche to do research . `` The children began to gently clean the food -- wiping each little noodle , each potato and peeling the sausage skin so methodically and accurately . It was as if they had done this same activity many times . ''

Durón Miranda learned that many children in Bariloche , a popular city for skiers and tourists in southern Argentina , drop out of school and spend their lives working at the dump .

When she was starting , Durón Miranda first set out to understand what was leading the children to work in the dump .

`` All parents want a better life for their children than what they had , '' Durón Miranda said . `` However , there are times when their situation is so precarious they have no other way out but for the whole family to work and try to make ends meet . ''

PETISOS programs are open to anyone in the community , working or nonworking . But involving a working child can be a lengthy process .

`` When you work in situations where the context is one of such great poverty , it 's very difficult to talk to parents about the long term because usually they live in the immediate term , '' Durón Miranda said . `` We tell them that a child that has more years of schooling has the opportunity to get a better job and eventually -LRB- make -RRB- more money than -LRB- they make -RRB- doing subsistence work . ''

PETISOS has a team of professionals and volunteers working with the children to ensure their growth .

The children are enrolled in school and have a tracking group to make sure they attend . There are afterschool workshops held at the PETISOS headquarters , where children can get help with their homework or do art projects . And psychologists , doctors and social workers are also available to work with the children and their families .

Family heads can also receive job training and child-rearing support .

Rosa Del Carmen Aguilar is a single mother of seven who used to work in the garbage dump to provide for her family . Durón Miranda 's programs helped Aguilar get out of the dump and keep her children out of trouble .

`` I did n't have a salary , I did n't have a job , and we always have the need , '' Aguilar said . `` I resorted to her . She was the person I had the most trust in . ... The kids are moving forward , and we 've gone a long way . ''

The group is funded by grants and donations . As a result of PETISOS efforts , many children have gone on to graduate from high school and attend college . There are others who are working stable jobs , and many young women have started families and are more sensitive to the upbringing of their children .

Durón Miranda describes her job as `` full-life '' rather than `` full-time , '' but she said she ca n't imagine it any other way .
