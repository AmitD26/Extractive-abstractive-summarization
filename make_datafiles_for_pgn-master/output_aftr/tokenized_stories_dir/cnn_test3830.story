Opinion : What led to chokehold death ?

In his statement , Donovan said that prosecutors are committed to conducting `` a fair , thorough and responsible investigation into Mr. Garner 's death , '' adding that `` no person is above the law , nor beneath its protection . ''

The video that surfaced after his death shows Garner lying on the ground motionless after he was taken down by a group of officers . Garner , an asthmatic , was later declared dead at a nearby hospital .

After the incident , New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the New York Police Department 's training procedures .

Officer Daniel Pantaleo , who is seen on the video choking Garner , was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation , the NYPD said . A second police officer was placed on desk duty .

Garner , a grandfather with six children , had a lengthy criminal history , including more than 30 arrests , and had been arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May , police said .
