-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- People smugglers accused of causing the deaths of hundreds of migrants when they deliberately rammed and sank their boat in the Mediterranean must be found and punished , the U.N. human rights chief said Friday .

`` All the countries in the Mediterranean must make a concerted effort to clamp down on the smugglers who are exploiting one of the most vulnerable groups on the planet and endangering their lives , virtually on a daily basis , purely for financial gain , '' Zeid said .

`` The callous act of deliberately ramming a boat full of hundreds of defenseless people is a crime that must not go unpunished .

Zeid also called for nations to tackle the root causes that led people to undertake such dangerous journeys in a bid to reach European shores .

` They were laughing '

Eleven survivors of the sinking , rescued by authorities in Italy , Malta and Greece , told interviewers from the International Organization for Migration earlier this week that the people smugglers were Palestinian or Egyptian .

Five days later , the smugglers allegedly rammed their boat far out to sea between Malta and Greece , causing it to sink , after the migrants refused to move onto a smaller boat they judged to be unseaworthy . They 'd already been forced to transfer vessel several times , the survivors said .

`` After they hit our boat they waited to be sure that it had sunk completely before leaving . They were laughing , '' one survivor told the IOM .

`` You can not transport large quantities of foreigners in buses into a major port and cram them on board a ship without the port authorities and other witnesses being aware of what is going on , '' Zeid said .

According to the IOM , the latest reported sinking would take the death toll off Europe 's shores this year to nearly 3,000 . In 2013 , the organization 's Missing Migrants Project estimated the total for the year to be 700 deaths .

`` Criminality , on top of desperation , has been this summer 's recipe for death â € '' even murder , according to eyewitness accounts . ''

The IOM called for an end to a culture of impunity , fed by poverty and lawlessness , that has allowed criminal gangs to prosper , particularly in Libya .

And it urged European nations to reform immigration laws to allow refugees safe , legal migration to Europe .
