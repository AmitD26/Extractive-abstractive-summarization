An indictment , announcing charges on 14 more Baltimore corrections officers , reads like script from the now defunct HBO crime drama `` The Wire . ''

Rosenstein seemed to mean that literally and figuratively , court documents show . According to one indictment , alleged gang member Tavon White had a sexual relationship with four jail guards while he was incarcerated .

One of the guards had `` Tavon '' tattooed on her wrist , the indictment said .

In January , White summed up his standing in the prison while talking on a cell phone that had been smuggled in , the indictment says

`` This is my jail . You understand that ? I 'm dead serious ... I make every final call in this jail ... and nothing go past me ... Any of my brothers that deal with anybody , it 's gon na come to me . Before -LRB- somebody -RRB- stab somebody , they got ta run it through me , '' White said according to the indictment .

Correctional officers were allegedly `` bribed '' to smuggle in drugs , cell phones and other prohibited objects , which they hid underneath their clothes , `` inside body cavities , '' even in sandwiches .

`` Court documents allege the BGF members recruited correctional officers through personal and often sexual relationships , as well as bribes , and that some officers traded sex for money , '' the U.S. Attorney 's office said in its news release .
