But the Obama administration 's plans to have a government-wide policy are on hold because the Department of Homeland Security wo n't adopt the new rules for its agencies , which include Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

In a concession to national security officials , the new Justice Department rules also still would allow federal agents to recruit informants based on ethnic data .

As Holder pushed for changes to the profiling policy , he faced pushback from the FBI , which reports to him , and ultimately from DHS .
