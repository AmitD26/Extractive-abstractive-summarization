-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ten years and 1.2 billion users into its existence , there 's no question that Facebook has changed our lives .

Which is not to say it 's all `` likes '' and `` shares '' and happy kid pics . As with any new -LRB- or newly discovered -RRB- technology , the impact of the end product is largely in the hands of the user . We are , after all , only human -- with all the joy and sadness , decency and ugliness that that entails .

So here , as Facebook turns 10 on Tuesday , is a look back at five ways the social network has changed us -- for better and for worse .

The good : Wedding announcements ? Thing of the past . Birth announcement ? Just slap an Instagram shot of that bouncing baby boy or girl on your timeline .

Dating ? Graduated ? Bought a house ? Got a puppy ? Same deal .

Seriously . Ten years in , some folks have n't figured out what everyone on their friends list wants , or needs , to know .

We all want to know you got a wedding ring . The fact that you just polished the one you 've had for 14 years ? Not so much .

The past is not really past

The good : When a site has 1.2 billion users -LRB- OK , we all know some of those are multiple or abandoned accounts , so let 's say at least a cool billion -RRB- it 's a pretty amazing database of the world 's Web-enabled population .

We 're talking about exes . And past flirtations . And cheating .

More than 80 % of U.S. divorce attorneys say they 've seen an increase in cases involving social media , according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers , and one-third of all divorce filings last year contained the word Facebook , according to a survey by Divorce Online .

Temptation is always out there . But with Facebook , it can be a little too convenient .

It makes you happy

`` For many people , there 's an automatic assumption that the Internet is bad , '' associate professor Jeffrey Hancock said at the time . `` This is one of the first studies to show that there 's a psychological benefit of Facebook . ''

The bad : Or maybe it makes you unhappy .

Other studies have looked at aspects of Facebook use and the results have been less encouraging .

Last year , a University of Michigan researcher found that looking at posts by Facebook friends -- you know , the photos of smiling kids on vacation in the Caribbean or announcements about promotions , engagements and awesome nights on the town -- can make us feel sadder about our own humdrum lives .

As with many things , your mileage may very . But what 's clear is that Facebook has become such a part of our lives that it tweaks our emotions , for better or worse .

The good : Reuniting with classmates from high school or college has never been easier . Pre-Facebook , a class reunion committee looking to celebrate five , 10 or 20 years post-diploma faced a thankless task .

`` Where does Jennifer live these days ? '' `` Who has Steven 's phone number ? '' `` Do you know Wanda 's married name ? ''

Now ? One Facebook event invitation and you can focus on booking the best '80s cover band available .

Actually reuniting with old classmates is losing some of its appeal when we know the names of the former theater club president 's three kids and which character from `` The Hunger Games '' she 'd be .

Timothy Davis , co-founder of reunion website Classreport.com , told the Baltimore Sun that he has noticed a drop-off in the number of reunions in recent years , particularly among folks in their mid - to late 20s .

`` People I have n't talked to in years will see my wedding pictures on Facebook , then I 'll see them in person and we wo n't say one word to each other ... , '' Rebecca Miller , a 23-year-old whose five-year reunion fizzled to a small party at the class president 's house , told the paper . `` Why go to a high school reunion when you 're going to stand around and go , ` So , how did that doctor 's appointment go yesterday ? ' ''

Privacy

The good : For those willing to find and use them , Facebook provides tools that let you select who sees what .

Rival Twitter is designed by default to be a public forum , where you broadcast your 140-character pearls of wisdom to the world . Facebook allows that , too , but is more geared toward limiting your thoughts to certain family and friends .

The bad : Well , you know .

While Facebook has privacy settings that let users protect information , some privacy advocates say the network does n't make them easy enough to find and use . -LRB- Facebook has worked to ease those concerns , especially for younger users -RRB- .

At the end of the day , Facebook benefits when you decide to share more openly . The details about your life that you share on Facebook are rounded up and compiled into a profile of you that helps advertisers target you with things they think you 'll like .

So , when you announced your pregnancy and were , soon after , bombarded with Facebook ads for a bunch of baby stuff ? That was no coincidence .

To be clear , Facebook is not handing advertisers information about you personally . But , somewhere , there exists a nameless profile of a user with your hometown , gender , age and likes and dislikes , just waiting to be used for marketing purposes .

That , in a nutshell , is the entry fee to use this remarkable social tool . Yes , Facebook has changed the way we communicate . Whether it is truly cost-free remains another question .
