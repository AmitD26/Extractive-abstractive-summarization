Sean Hannity asked Dash : `` Has voting with Obama 95 % of the time and Obamacare , has that helped the minority community in Louisiana ? ''

`` No , not at all . It still keeps them stuck . They 're getting money for free . They feel worthless . They 're uneducated . I mean , as long as you are that way , they can keep you under their control ... ''

Whether Democratic or Republican , scores of black people -- Oprah Winfrey , Allen West , Condoleezza Rice , Ben Carson , Shelby Steele , Bill Cosby , Robin Roberts , and many many others -- are highly educated , gainfully employed , paying their bills and frankly doing quite well . Dash is one of them .

Many black people may want Obama to provide more productive policies , but to suggest , as Dash does , that blacks are largely `` uneducated '' and `` getting money for free '' is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating . That kind of talk is an offensive nonstarter in getting blacks to consider voting Republican . So is the often repeated meme by some black conservatives that blacks `` have a plantation mentality . ''

Whether you 're white or black , it 's never cool to invoke metaphors of slavery , which was a gruesome , painful institution protected by Democrats in America that went on way too long . Conservatives should remind Americans of the history of slavery and how the Democratic Party perpetuates policies of paternalism that do n't benefit blacks .

The `` Hannity '' segment was about the Louisiana Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republicans Bill Cassidy and Rob Maness . Dash and other guests discussed how blacks in Louisiana have voted for Landrieu since electing her in 1997 but have not benefited from it .

`` I think state Sen. Guillory has done a tremendous job and service , by asking in this ad a very basic question : What have the Democrats done for us lately ? Black folks show up and vote 95 % for Obama , 95 % for Landrieu and ... what do you get ? Eighteen years of poverty under Mary Landrieu in Louisiana . ''
