-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During Tuesday night 's debate with Republican challenger Mitt Romney , President Barack Obama touted his administration 's support for the federal Pell Grant program and other aid for college students .

`` We 've expanded Pell Grants for millions of people , including millions of young women , all across the country , '' Obama said . `` We did it by taking $ 60 billion that was going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program , and we said , ` Let 's just cut out the middleman . Let 's give the money directly to students . ' And as a consequence , we 've seen millions of young people be able to afford college , and that 's going to make sure that young women are going to be able to compete in that marketplace . ''

The facts :

In 2009 and 2010 , the Obama administration pushed to eliminate the federal guaranteed student loan program , which subsidized student loans issued through private lenders . The administration argued that the money that went to banks through the program would be better spent on direct federal loans to students or to Pell Grants , which provide students up to $ 5,600 .

Conclusion :

Obama 's comments accurately summarize the recent history of the federal student aid programs under his administration , which have gone up -- just not as fast as college costs .
