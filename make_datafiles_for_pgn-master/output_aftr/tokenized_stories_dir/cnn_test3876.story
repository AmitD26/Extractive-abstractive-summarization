The find is of importance because tests on the shroud and the body it wrapped revealed the earliest proven case of leprosy in the Old City of Jerusalem .

And in addition , the weave of the shroud raises fresh doubts about the Shroud of Turin , which many people believe was used to wrap the body of Jesus .

He called such a find in the Jerusalem area unique because the high humidity levels in the city do not normally allow for the preservation of organic material .

Gibson said the remains of the man covered in the cloth consisted of different wrappings for the body and the head , which was consistent with burial practices of the era . He also said research had shown that the weave of the cloth was a simple one , much different from the more complex Shroud of Turin 's .

The origin of the Shroud of Turin , a burial cloth that some believe bears the image of Jesus , is a source of great controversy , with many academics arguing it dates from the Middle Ages and not the time of Jesus .

The burial cave , which has been dubbed the Tomb of the Shroud , was first uncovered in 2000 and was one of more than 70 separate family tombs of the first century . It is in a location described in the Bible as the `` Field of Blood , '' next to the area where Judas , the apostle who betrayed Jesus , is said to have committed suicide .

Based on the tomb 's location and the style of the shroud wrappings , researchers have said the shrouded man was an affluent member of Jerusalem society .

It is likely the shrouded man died from tuberculosis , Spigelman said , and its presence in other remains found at the site suggest `` the significant impact social diseases such as tuberculosis had on society from the low socioeconomic groups up to the more affluent families , such as Tomb the Shroud in first-century Jerusalem .
