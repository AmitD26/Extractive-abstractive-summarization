The government of Sudan argues it is fighting a rebellion led by the Sudan People 's Liberation Movement that engineered the secession of South Sudan . Khartoum still struggles to stomach the victory of the Southerners , brought about partly by the large number of Nuba fighters who -- after decades of marginalization and political exclusion -- joined forces with the Sudan People 's Liberation Army .

Accordingly , Khartoum treats the Nuba people as the enemy within -- a foe whose independent spirit has never been tamed

The cost : half a million people have been displaced or severely affected by the conflict , according to the U.N. 's Humanitarian Affairs office .

The most recent rash of bombings is the second time in 20 years that the Nuba people have been targets of the same Khartoum leaders -- President Omar al-Bashir and Governor Ahmed Haroun . Both men are internationally indicted war criminals , although both deny the charges .

Haroun engineered attacks against the Nuba in the 90s , refined his deadly tactics in Darfur in 2004 , and is now back pursuing his murderous agenda against the Nuba with even greater efficiency .

I traveled to Sudan bear witness , as a journalist and a Rwandan , to a people under siege , at the war-torn border between the two Sudans , one of the most isolated regions on earth .

Smuggled into the Nuba Mountains , an area closed to the world , I filmed local activists documenting the attacks being perpetrated by the Khartoum regime .

Our team traveled to a number of villages up to 20 km from the front line . During my time in the region I experienced bombings as regimented as prison meals . We were attacked an average of three times a day . We were filming as the scale of atrocities unfolded with excruciating precision : the bombs falling , the people hiding in caves for safety , the destruction of villages , the casualties .

Every day , we experienced hunger , fear , abandonment , exhaustion and unspeakable harshness , like the Nuba people do . At a moment 's notice , we jumped in and out of foxholes and crawled in caves like they do to survive . Cramped , hot and terrified , we have seen and smelled the death of children , pregnant women and the elderly ; the destruction of villages , crops , schools , water pumps , mosques , churches and hospitals .

In Yida , I attended a WFP-sponsored food distribution and saw how a 3 kg ration of USAID-produced sorghum was distributed for each family to eat until the uncertain next round of food supply .

In Yida , a mother begged me to take home with me her three-month-old baby , whom she had delivered squatted down under a tree on a rainy afternoon .

I sat with Yida 's oldest resident , a 101-year-old man who journeyed on donkey back for eight days to be reunited with one of his sons . The poor man was so disoriented that he had stopped eating and talking for days at a time . His family feared that leaving him alone might drive him to commit suicide .

`` Erasing the Nuba '' has captured the spirit of the Nuba people of Sudan , a minority bowed but not broken -- not by the daily hellish rain of bombs and rockets , nor by the world 's complicit silence .

My family falling victim to the Rwandan genocides that started in 1994 , and a commitment to uphold the vow made by those touched by genocide the world over to `` never forget , '' inspired me to bring their story to light .

`` Erasing the Nuba '' is my testimony , as a Rwandan and a journalist , to ensure these people are never referred to in the past tense .
