A day late and a compromise short .

A split between tea party conservatives and more moderate Republicans over how to respond to the immigrant surge from Central America threatened to further delay the start of the five-week summer break for Congress .

GOP leaders abruptly pulled the bill from the House floor on Thursday , to address concerns by some conservative factions . They came back Friday with a revised version that included more money for the National Guard .

In one way , it worked : The updated version passed the House on Friday night , by a 223-189 resoundingly Republican vote .

But that does n't mean this legislation is going anywhere .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid confirmed as much Friday , saying `` I do n't think it 's going to get done '' because he `` ca n't imagine '' the Senate approving the House version .

Obama later said the failure of Congress to provide emergency funding in response to the immigrant influx means he must decide how to reallocate resources because `` we 've run out of money '' to handle the surge .

Internal division

Boehner spokesman Michael Steel shot back that it was Obama 's failed leadership that caused the current border crisis , saying the President has been `` completely AWOL . ''

Steel pushed that point , noting that `` Senate Democrats have left town without acting on '' Obama 's request for emergency funds . ''

Such is the state of politics in Washington less than four months before congressional elections . The partisan climate is as fierce as ever with conservatives again rising up to challenge establishment priorities and assert their agenda .

Immigrant influx

Obama had asked for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funds to strengthen border security and speed up the processing of new arrivals , while the Democratic plan scuttled in the Senate called for $ 2.7 billion .

Unilateral steps

They also fear further further unilateral steps signaled by the White House that would allow more undocumented immigrants to work in the United States .

Ted Cruz weighs in

Legislators said after the meeting the changes appeared to secure the necessary support to pass the bill , but some dissatisfaction remained over plans to hold separate votes on the funding measure and a Cruz-backed provision to halt Obama 's unilateral steps on immigration .

The changes widened the gap between Republicans and Democrats , who oppose removing guaranteed immigration hearings for child immigrants from Central American now required under the 2008 law .

Reid said the House `` appears to be heading from bad to worse '' in its effort to secure conservative votes .

Thursday 's developments were an embarrassing result for Boehner and his new leadership team put together after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor 's primary defeat last month .

The canceled vote and resulting confusion displayed the continuing deep divisions between conservative and more moderate House Republicans that has caused similar episodes in the past on other spending matters .

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration already has shifted resources from the nation 's interior to the border to try to speed up the processing of new arrivals .

Obama also will do what he can to address overall immigration reform because House Republicans have refused to vote on a comprehensive measure passed last year by the Senate , Earnest said .
