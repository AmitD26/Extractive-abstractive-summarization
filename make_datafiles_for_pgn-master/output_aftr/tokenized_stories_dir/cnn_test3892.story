Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson will tentatively go to trial December 1 on a felony child abuse charge , but that date could be pushed back if a Texas judge must recuse himself for calling attorneys `` media whores . ''

Until the trial is finished , Peterson will be barred from having contact with the son involved in the criminal case , but the judge set no such parameters for Peterson 's contact with his other children .

Peterson , who was accompanied by his wife , other family members and legal team , appeared in court during the brief Wednesday hearing . One of his attorneys , Rusty Hardin , and Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon engaged in a serious conversation for about 30 minutes before approaching the bench .

It 's not clear when Peterson will enter a plea , but a recusal hearing for 9th District Court Judge Kelly Case was set for November .

The possibility of a recusal was raised after Ligon approached the bench with Hardin 's legal team and told Case , `` It 's come to my attention that on October 2 you referred to Mr. Hardin as a whore . ''

`` I 'm sorry ? '' Case interjected .

'' ... Mr. Hardin as a whore , specifically a media whore . And you also called me a whore or a media whore , '' Ligon said before requesting an apology .

`` Yeah , that was meant as a humorous joke , '' Case said , `` and unfortunately humor is sometimes taken the wrong way . ''

Ligon said the remark could prejudice Peterson 's case and be construed as `` biased toward the state of Texas '' and again asked for an apology .

Hardin said , `` Just for the record , I did n't take offense to it . I 've been called much worse . ''

Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $ 100 million and is considered one of the NFL 's best running backs , if not the best -- left the Vikings last month after the team deactivated , then activated and deactivated him again following accusations that he whipped his 4-year-old son with a `` switch , '' or slender tree branch .

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters in New York after a lengthy meeting Wednesday with the league 's 32 team owners that administering punishment to a player who is waiting for his legal case to move forward after an arrest can be complex .

'' -LRB- The owners -RRB- obviously understand the balance between due process and protecting the integrity of the game , '' he said . `` Sometimes that puts you in a difficult position . ''

Goodell said there was discussion whether or not a new , interim step -- such as paid leave -- should be added to the process .

After Wednesday 's hearing , Hardin acknowledged recent reports attacking his client 's character and told reporters on the courthouse steps , `` There 's always another side , and I hope y' all will start chasing the other side some . ''

Asked for the other side , Hardin responded , `` I 'm not going to get into that '' and later told reporters , `` Adrian is chomping at the bit to publicly talk and to publicly defend himself , '' but has been advised against it by his legal team .

The case wo n't be resolved in the media , he said , adding that the only solution was a speedy trial .
