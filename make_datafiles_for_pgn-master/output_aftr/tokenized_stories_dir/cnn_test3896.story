Asked what Georgia 's greatest resources were Saakashvili said : `` The standard answer would be people and nature , but it is people and nature . This was a country that was considered to be failing years ago and -LSB- now -RSB- it is making it . ''

Saakashvili was re-elected as President of Georgia in 2008 after taking over from his predecessor Eduard Shevardnadze in 2004 following his leadership of the `` Rose Revolution '' protests .

He said Georgia needs to `` bring back the best of the past , but also show the way to the future . ''

Georgia gained independence in 1991 but relations with Russia since have been strained .

In August 2008 , Georgian troops entered the breakaway Russian-speaking region of South Ossetia , after sporadic clashes between ethnic Russians and Georgians . South Ossetia had declared independence from Georgia in the early 1990s .

Georgia 's move prompted Russian troops to enter South Ossetia and then push deep into the rest of Georgia . Each side blamed each other for the conflict but an eight-month European Union-commissioned inquiry concluded that both sides shared the blame for the conflict .

He told CNN that Georgia `` would be crazy to want hostilities with big , big Russia '' and it was `` the last thing any Georgian would want . ''

Another ongoing problem for the president are the numbers of Georgians -- especially young people -- leaving the country .

But this is being addressed Saakashvili says . `` We had 52 percent living in poverty . Now it is 22 percent . ''

`` I 'm not afraid people will leave because I expect more to come back . This is the first former Soviet country where I think the entire political class has been replaced . And from that point of view Georgia is an attractive place for people to stay . ''
