It was late in the day with the House oversight hearing on Benghazi winding down . On social media and elsewhere , there was conservative grumbling that Hillary Clinton was getting off relatively unscathed .

Then came conservative Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina 's second round of questions .

Tough legitimate congressional oversight or partisan politics ? Leading Republicans say the former ; most Democrats the latter .

Truth is , it is both .

And as the Benghazi investigations continue , that presents both parties with challenges .

House Speaker John Boehner served notice on Thursday that GOP pressure would not subside .

The speaker said the administration should make public a series of e-mails and other records he said would provide key details about the attacks and the response .

Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails

`` A senior State Department official e-mailed her superiors that the Libyan ambassador , she had told the Libyan ambassador , the attack was conducted by Islamic terrorists . The State Department would not allow our committees to keep copies of this e-mail when it was reviewed , '' Boehner said .

Doomed Libya ambassador : ` We 're under attack '

Traveling in Rome , the man who replaced Clinton , Secretary of State John Kerry , said he was as determined as the Republican House leadership to answer any legitimate questions .

`` And if there is any culpability in any area that is appropriate to be handled in some way with some discipline it will be appropriately handled . But that judgment awaits me in a report that will be forthcoming and I am confident that any recent evidence will be a component of that consideration , '' Kerry said .

Gregory Hicks , who became the top diplomat in Libya after Ambassador Christopher Stevens was killed , suggested at Wednesday 's House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing that he was demoted and otherwise punished or making it clear he believed the Obama administration was withholding or ignoring key facts about the Benghazi attacks and response .

The committee chairman , California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa , said Democrats on the panel had shown little interest in finding the truth . In turn , committee Democrats , including ranking member Elijah Cummings of Maryland , said Issa and other GOP members were to blame for a reckless campaign designed to `` smear public officials . ''

The administration concedes Rice spoke from flawed talking points , but insists the mistakes were born of understandable confusion . Many Republicans see it differently -- alleging the Obama White House , in the closing days of the presidential campaign , wanted to play down the idea of a successful , coordinated terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic post .

Mother of Benghazi victim : I blame Hillary

`` You would 've hoped that people would have stepped up and said this was wrong and the American people deserve the truth . That did n't happen . ''

Democrats are quick to suggest it is Rubio playing politics , noting his own interest in a possible 2016 presidential campaign . Democrats make the same argument when asked about the harsh criticisms of Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul , another potential 2016 Republican contender .

Paul calls Clinton 's handling of Benghazi a `` dereliction of duty '' that , in his view , disqualifies her from higher office .

`` The White House continues to claim it only made stylistic changes to talking points used by Susan Rice , ignoring the fact that senior White House officials directed the changes being made '' to those talking points , Boehner said .

Conservative media outlets also clearly see an opportunity to raise questions about Clinton that could be a factor in her 2016 calculations .

Respected conservative writer and commentator Terence Jeffrey reminded his readers this week of the initial Clinton Benghazi statement suggesting , `` Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet . ''

Among the conservatives urging House Republicans to demand answers from Clinton directly is former Vice President Dick Cheney .

On Thursday , Cheney spoke to the weekly `` Theme Team '' meeting organized by House conservatives and two people present at the breakfast said the former vice president said if Clinton declined to voluntarily answer questions , then she should be subpoenaed to testify .

In an e-mail sent to conservatives , former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said , `` What happened with Benghazi is not how it 's supposed to be handled and I think it could be a hinge point for the Obama administration . ''

The Bolton note was distributed by the House GOP 's campaign arm -- the National Republican Congressional Committee -- and asks for political contributions to the GOP . In fact , if you click on the links in that Bolton e-mail , it takes you to an NRCC fund-raising website that declares `` Benghazi was a cover-up '' over a photograph of Clinton and President Barack Obama .

That definitive assertion on a House GOP official fund-raising site is par for the course in Washington these days . But it gives Democrats fodder for their argument that Republicans have already made up their minds and are n't conducting oversight hearings with an open mind .

`` She will have to deal with this , '' the strategist said , `` but it will not be central to the campaign . ''

`` Once more , the GOP runs the risk of appearing to be blinded by their partisanship , '' Begala said . `` I have no idea if Hillary will run . But I know this : If she does this issue will not be a major stumbling block . ''

There were high-level resignations and criminal convictions , Begala recalled .
