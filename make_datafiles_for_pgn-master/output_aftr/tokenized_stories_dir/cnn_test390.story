-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A shootout in a border city that leaves five alleged drug traffickers sprawled dead on the street and seven police wounded . A police chief and his bodyguards gunned down outside his house in another border city . Four bridges into the United States shut down by protesters who want the military out of their towns and who officials say are backed by narcotraffickers .

That was Mexico on Tuesday .

What is most remarkable is that it was not much different from Monday or Sunday or any day in the past few years .

Mexico , a country with a nearly 2,000-mile border with the United States , is undergoing a horrifying wave of violence that some are likening to a civil war . Drug traffickers battle fiercely with each other and Mexican authorities . The homicide rate reached a record level in 2008 and indications are that the carnage could be exceeded this year . Watch a reporter duck to avoid gunfire ''

Larry Birns , director of the Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs , calls it `` a sickening vertigo into chaos and plunder . ''

By most accounts , that 's not hyperbole .

`` The grisly portrait of the violence is unprecedented and horrific , '' said Robert Pastor , a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s .

`` I do n't think there 's any question that Mexico is going through a very rough time . Not only is there violence with the gangs , but the entire population is very scared , '' said Peter Hakim , president of the Inter-American Dialogue , a Washington-based policy center .

`` Of course it 's a civil war , but that only touches the violence of it , '' he said Wednesday . `` It 's also a civic conflict , as an increasing number of people look upon the law and democratic values as something that can be violated . ''

Hakim is not prepared to go that far .

Enrique Bravo , an analyst with the Eurasia consulting group , points out that the violence so far is mostly affecting just drug gangs and is primarily localized along the U.S. border and Mexico 's western coast .

`` The spillover into the United States is bound to expand and bound to affect U.S. institutions , '' Birns said .

Pastor says there are at least 6,600 U.S. gun shops within 100 miles of the Mexican border and more than 90 percent of weapons in Mexico come from the United States .

And it 's not just handguns . Drug traffickers used a bazooka in Tuesday 's shootout with federal police and army soldiers in Reynosa , Mexico , across the border from McAllen , Texas .

`` There is so much money involved in the drug trade , there is so much fear involved in the drug trade , that no institution can survive unaffected , '' Birns said .

In one recent instance , Noe Ramirez Mandujano , who was the nation 's top anti-drug official from 2006 until August 2008 , was arrested on charges that he accepted $ 450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers while in office .

`` The unthinkable is happening , '' Birns said . `` People are beginning to discuss decriminalization and legalization . ... There 's only one thing that can be done : Take the profit out of it . ''

`` What worked in the U.S. was not Eliot Ness , '' he said , referring to the federal agent famous for fighting gangsters in 1920s and '30s . `` It was the repeal of Prohibition . ''

That viewpoint has picked up some high-level support in Latin America .

`` The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results , '' former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference , in which the 17-member commission 's recommendations were presented .

`` It 's as if the burden of being the main arena of the anti-drug war has overwhelmed Mexican institutions , '' Birns said . `` The occasional anti-drug battle is being won , but the war is being lost . And there 's no prospect the war is going to be won . ''

On Wednesday , the Mexican cities of Torreon and Gomez Palacio reported at least eight shootouts involving heavily armed men .
