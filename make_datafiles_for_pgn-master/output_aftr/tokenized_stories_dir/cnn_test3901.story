Similar demonstrations took place in other cities as well fueled by President Ali Abdullah Saleh 's comments the day before .

In a short speech Friday , Saleh said women who were protesting against his regime were violating Yemeni cultural norms that prohibit mixing with men who are not direct relatives . He called it forbidden behavior in Islam and advised women to stay home .

Prominent activist Tawakkol Karman said Saleh was shocked to see women leading Yemen 's revolt .

`` Saleh has finally shown the world his real face and his hatred against women , '' said Karman , a leading member of Islah , the largest opposition party in Yemen .

`` Saleh is the first to support women 's rights and has always shown interest in involving women in Yemeni politics , '' said Zaid Thari , a senior member of the ruling General People 's Congress party . `` Saleh was advising protesters and not acting against women in specific . ''

Anti-government demonstrators in Yemen have been calling for reforms and the ouster of Saleh for many weeks . Recently , women have shown their faces in greater numbers .

They took to the streets in 10 provinces Saturday , holding firm on their demands that Saleh step down . Karman said Saleh is scared he will be known as the leader overthrown by women .

Another prominent activist , Amal Basha , said it was Saleh who was using religion to prevent women 's participation .

Even the conservative tribal coalition of Mareb and Jawf warned Saleh against attacking women 's rights , saying that tribal culture has always given women the right to lead if they so desire .

`` Women ruled Yemen numerous times in the past with success , '' said Ali Obaid , a senior member of the coalition . `` Yemeni women lead the Yemeni revolution and men follow . ''
