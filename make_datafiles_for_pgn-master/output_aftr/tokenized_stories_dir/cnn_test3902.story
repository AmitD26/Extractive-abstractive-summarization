Four decades before anyone took an arrow to the knee in `` Skyrim , '' adventurers were sitting down with paper and pencil to battle fantasy monsters and explore rich , new worlds in a different kind of role-playing game .

`` Dungeons & Dragons , '' commonly known simply as D&D , burst onto the scene in 1974 , long before the word `` gaming '' came with the implied word `` video '' in front of it .

In D&D , the brainchild of creators Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson , players could become fighters , magic-users , and clerics , and run through adventures created by a `` Dungeon Master '' or `` DM '' -- the person responsible for controlling nearly every aspect of the game .

Players sat around a table rolling multi-sided dice and visualizing the adventure using just their imaginations -- a far cry from today 's vast , richly rendered video-game worlds .

But four decades later , and with all its high-tech competition , `` Dungeons & Dragons '' continues to grow and evolve . And many of today 's computer games , animated television shows , feature films , novels , and even pop and rock songs owe much to D&D lore .

`` In today 's culture , D&D has found its place as a leader and influencer over storytellers across so many different mediums , '' said Nathan Stewart , brand director for D&D at Wizards of the Coast , the company publishing the game . `` From game designers and musicians , to scores of screenwriters and film directors , D&D has had a profound effect on those who have brought fantasy and geek culture to the foreground . ''

Demon worship ?

Jerry Holkins , co-founder for the webcomic , `` Penny Arcade , '' said he started playing D&D with his young aunts and uncles , much to the chagrin of his mother .

`` My mom flipped out , of course . The belief that ` Dungeons & Dragons ' constituted some kind of ` satanic ritual ' was a common refrain at my house , '' Holkins said . `` When I got older , I hid the fact that I played it . Where she might have found another young person 's pornography or drugs , she found my DM 's guide . Honestly , I think she would have preferred the drugs . ''

For others , D&D opened the door to expanding their circle of friends at a time in their formative years when shyness may have otherwise taken over . Video game creator Ken Levine did n't have friends to play D&D with when he discovered the game in 1978 . But a trip to summer camp and a chance meeting with others who played introduced him to many new people .

`` So I went from having no friends and no social circle to an immediate social circle through ` Dungeons & Dragons , ' '' said Levine , who is best known as creator of the `` Bioshock '' series . `` We were playing a module out of the ` Dragon ' magazine called ` The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow . ' The Dungeon Master that night is still my best friend to this day . ''

By 1981 , the game had more than 3 million players worldwide . By 2007 , that number grew to 6 million , and the numbers keep rising .

The influence of `` Dungeons & Dragons '' on video games has been clear from the beginning .

In 1988 , the first officially-licensed video game based on D&D was released by Strategic Simulations , Inc. `` Pool of Radiance '' was an adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rule set , and was generally well received by fans and critics .

More successful video games would follow including the `` Baldur 's Gate '' series and the `` Neverwinter Nights '' collection . Holkins played many of the games and felt the games leveraged the vast settings of the D&D 's campaigns without tying themselves to its specific rules -- thereby leaning more on storytelling rather than combat .

`` As far as it being an influence on videogames , that 's not even a conversation , '' Holkins said . `` In the Western CRPG -LRB- computer role-playing games -RRB- tradition , the lineage is so direct as to be a straight line . ''

And many who play games like `` Diablo , '' `` Dark Souls '' and `` World of Warcraft , '' often connected to teammates and opponents through headsets and computer chat channels , also gather together for the social experience that is an old-fashioned `` D&D '' session .

Holkins agrees .

New D&D rules

The game itself has evolved over many official and unofficial rule changes in its 40 years . From the original rules in 1974 to `` Advanced Dungeons & Dragons '' in 1981 up to `` D&D 4th Edition '' released in 2008 , the idea has always been to give players a framework to create adventures the way they want to experience and enjoy them .

`` There are certain things about the D&D game that transcend generations -- the storytelling aspect , the desire to become something greater than yourself or just something different from yourself , '' said Chris Perkins , senior design manager for story and world building for Dungeons & Dragons . `` I think those experiences have given the D&D game its longevity because they are timeless . ''

A new module for the D&D online game , `` Neverwinter , '' will launch on August 14 and be `` the premier digital ` Dungeons & Dragons ' experience for players , '' according to a press release .

`` We 're aiming to tell the story not only in the role-playing game , but in other venues so that people can experience it at a number of different levels to a number of different depths , '' Perkins said . `` We have n't really dealt with dragons much in the -LRB- Forgotten Realms -RRB- over the past 40 years . It 's been a long time since we 've had an iconic villain on the order of Tiamat . ''

While rule changes have usually resulted in the gnashing of teeth and wailing of voices from some players , Perkins said there is flexibility built in to the new edition so players can play and enjoy whatever type of game they want , using as much or as little of the new system as they want .

Perkins acts as the Dungeon Master for the Acquisitions , Inc. , adventures at PAX conventions and plans to show everyone how the new rules can work .
