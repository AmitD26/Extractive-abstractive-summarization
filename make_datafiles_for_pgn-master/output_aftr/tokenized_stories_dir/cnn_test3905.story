An ultra-marathoner trying to `` run '' from Florida to Bermuda in a human-powered inflatable bubble was rescued Saturday morning after he signaled for help , the Coast Guard said .

Reza Baluchi , according to his website , has set a goal of running across more than 190 recognized nations to encourage world peace . CNN ran a story about him in 2012 .

In the press release , the Coast Guard said Baluchi had protein bars , bottled water , a GPS and a satellite phone . The Coast Guard conveyed the voyage 's dangers and asked Baluchi to quit his journey because he did n't have enough supplies . But he would n't leave his vessel , officials said .

The Coast Guard monitored his progress and on Saturday morning an exhausted Baluchi activated his personal locating beacon , the Coast Guard said .

A Coast Guard HC-130 airplane and MH-60 helicopter , along with the vessel Maersk Montana , were sent to rescue Baluchi 70 nautical miles east of St. Augustine , the Coast Guard said .

`` Part of his effort was to make world peace but he got caught up in the Gulf Stream , '' said Coast Guard public affairs specialist Mark Barney . `` The chances of muscling out of the Gulf Stream were pretty low . ''

`` Reza does n't listen to anyone , '' Davis Hyslop , a businessman and one of Baluchi 's supporters , said in the 2012 story . `` He has these outsized ambitions that he sets his mind to . He 's a success above and beyond anyone 's expectations . It 's almost biblical . But you got ta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor , right ? ''
