Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rhode Island 's top Roman Catholic leader has asked Rep. Patrick Kennedy to stop taking Communion over his support for abortion rights , the diocese said Sunday .

Kennedy , a Democrat , is the son of the late Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and a scion of the most prominent Catholic family in modern U.S. politics .

In an interview published Sunday , Patrick Kennedy told the Providence Journal that Tobin had barred him from receiving communion and instructed priests in the diocese not to administer the sacrament `` because of the positions that I 've taken as a public official . ''

Tobin , in a statement issued in response to the Kennedy interview , said his advice to the congressman was `` pastoral and confidential , '' and he was surprised that Kennedy chose to discuss it publicly .

`` I am disappointed that the congressman would make public my request of nearly three years ago that sought to provide solely for his spiritual well-being , '' he said .

`` The Catholic bishops have been fairly successful , at least to date , at putting abortion at the center of the debate over health care reform , and that obviously has generated some resentment from people who do n't share their views , '' Allen said .

Kennedy 's decision to come forward `` in effect puts the Catholic bishops in a negative light , because it ends up making them look intolerant , '' Allen said .

Tobin said Sunday only that he asked Kennedy not to take Communion .

In an October interview , Kennedy criticized the bishops for threatening to oppose the overall bill if it did not include those restrictions . That prompted Tobin to call Kennedy 's position `` unacceptable to the church and scandalous to many of our members . ''
