But a day after his death , the two sides continued to offer contrasting accounts of what killed him .

Palestinian Minister of Civil Affairs Hussein al-Sheikh told the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency on Thursday that doctors from Palestinian territories , Jordan and Israel participated in the autopsy . He said that while Israeli doctors admitted the results , they did not sign the medical report .

On the other hand , a preliminary autopsy report issued by the Israeli government said Abu Ein 's death was caused by a blockage of the coronary artery because of hemorrhaging . Stress could have caused the bleeding , the report said , suggesting the poor condition of Abu Ein 's heart caused him to be more sensitive to stress .

Bitawi , the director general of the hospital , said the cause of death was asphyxiation ; that Abu Ein choked to death on his own vomit brought on by gas inhalation .

Clashes with soldiers

Pictures from various news agencies depict an Israeli soldier with his hands to Abu Ein 's neck , followed by another showing him on the ground . The official Palestinian news agency WAFA , meanwhile , reported that the Palestinian official lost consciousness after he inhaled tear gas and an Israeli soldier hit him in the chest .

Anger and mourning

Declaring three days of mourning , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas slammed Abu Ein 's death as an `` intolerable barbaric act , '' according to WAFA .

`` What happened is a crime by all means , we can not sit idle and silent -LRB- after -RRB- this crime , '' he said later on Palestinian television . `` For that , this leadership is meeting now to decide what it wants , and I say honestly all options are open for discussion and for implementation . ... We do n't have any other solutions . ''

On Thursday , thousands of Palestinian mourners marched in Abu Ein 's funeral procession as he was taken from the presidential compound to a cemetery .
