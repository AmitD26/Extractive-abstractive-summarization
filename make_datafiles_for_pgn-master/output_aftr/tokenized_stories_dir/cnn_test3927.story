Tuesday 's Senate primary in Kansas ended another ugly showdown that pit a tea party-backed challenger against an establishment Republican incumbent .

CNN projects incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts has fended off conservative challenger Milton Wolf in the state 's GOP Senate primary .

In his victory speech Roberts said that `` we celebrate tonight '' and that `` we have another job starting first thing tomorrow . ''

The race saw controversies over residency and Facebook photos and a rare streetside confrontation .

Roberts ' win leaves only Thursday 's nominating contest in Tennessee , where incumbent Lamar Alexander faces a bunch of conservative challengers , for a tea party-backed candidate to prevail in Senate primaries .

Wolf 's campaign for months tried to portray Roberts as more in tune with Washington than Kansas , pointing to reports from earlier this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent a room to him .

Wolf said in his concession speech that `` while we came up short tonight , I believe our battle just begins . ''

`` I believe we 're just getting warmed up , '' he said to his supporters .

`` I believe we 're going to save this country because it 's up to us . Our republic needs us to stand up and fight and it is the greatest honor of my life to stand shoulder to shoulder with you , '' he said . `` To run towards the screaming instead of away . And I will always stand up and fight for our country and fight for our state . And it is the biggest honor of my life to say that I stood with you . ''

Still , Roberts was seen as the heavy favorite in the nomination battle with a large double-digit lead in the most recent poll . A couple of other minor candidates were also on the ballot .

Dueling controversies

Wolf painted himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the GOP establishment .

As a doctor , he frequently campaigned against the Affordable Care Act and proposed his own plan that he calls `` PatientCare . ''

Roberts enjoyed the support of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign , which is chaired by fellow Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran .

`` You have said it multiple times in multiple places . You tell us that you are tough and you 're tested and trusted . And I want you to keep your word on that , I want you to debate . I think Kansans deserve it . ''

`` Milton , Milton , Milton , Milton , '' Roberts said dismissively . `` This is not the time . We have a regularly-scheduled event , a listening tour event . This is not the time . ''

`` When would be the time , senator , because I 'll go anywhere you 'd like . You 've given your word to debate . Let 's just debate , '' Wolf continued as Roberts walked off .

`` The question 's not about debating . The question is about an immature candidate with a desperate campaign , an unethical candidate pulling stunts like he did today . When you 're 20 points down , these are the kind of desperate stunts you pull , '' spokesman Sean Fitzpatrick said .

Challenger Brian Ellis , a businessman who has support from the Chamber of Commerce , tried to unseat two-term Rep. Justin Amash , a libertarian who won his seat in the 2010 tea party wave that landed Republicans in the House majority .

But despite being outspent , Amash staved off his establishment-backed challenger .

Debbie Dingell , a Democrat , declared victory Tuesday in Michigan 's 12th Congressional District against opponent Raymond Mullins . She announced plans earlier this year to run for the seat being vacated by her husband , Rep. John Dingell , the longest serving member of Congress in history .
