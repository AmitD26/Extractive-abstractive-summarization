And now , the world knows her as an Ebola patient .

Last month , while working in Liberia , Writebol contracted the deadly virus . She 's one of three Americans known to contract Ebola during the outbreak that has ravaged West Africa .

The others are colleague Dr. Kent Brantly and Patrick Sawyer , a naturalized citizen and Liberian government official who died from the disease earlier this week .

The trip will be the latest of many journeys for Writebol , whose other missionary ventures include Ecuador and 14 years ministering to orphans and vulnerable children in Africa .

Nancy guided missionaries and teams and worked with nurses at ELWA hospital , where her husband is the technical services manager , according to the Christian group 's website . Nancy was diagnosed with Ebola on July 25 .

As husband David explained from Africa via Skype to members of Calvary Church in Charlotte , North Carolina , at a recent vigil for Nancy : `` We have been blessed because of what Christ has done for us , -LRB- by giving -RRB- us eternal life and salvation .

The fact the Writebols left the comforts of America to live in an area rife with poverty , instability and disease , the fact they put their lives at risk to assist those suffering everyday , is n't surprising to those who know them .

John Munro , their friend and pastor at Calvary Church , describes the couple as `` the salt of the Earth , '' the kind of people who would n't give a second thought to dropping everything to help .

The only thing perhaps ironic about what 's happening now is how such an `` unassuming '' and `` very humble '' woman has become international news .

One of those sons , Jeremy Writebol , told CNN 's Chris Cuomo that the recent ordeal has been hard on his father . Nancy Writebol has been isolated in the couple 's Liberia home ; she and David talk by phone but , given fears she might pass on Ebola to him , they ca n't touch .

`` It 's very difficult , and we feel the emotion of that , '' Jeremy Writebol said of his parents ' physical separation .

Then , of course , there 's the inherent danger of Ebola . The World Health Organization reports that there have been at least 1,322 cases in recent weeks in West Africa , some 729 of which have resulted in death .

`` We feel like Mom has a chance , '' he told CNN affiliate WCCB .
