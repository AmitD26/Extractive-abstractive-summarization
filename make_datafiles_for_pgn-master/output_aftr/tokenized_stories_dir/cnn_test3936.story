-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew aboard a commercial passenger jet last week , despite the person 's presence on a `` do-not-board '' list maintained by federal health authorities , officials said Tuesday .

The patient , who has not been identified publicly , flew Saturday aboard US Airways Flight 401 from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , to San Francisco , California , airline spokesman Morgan Durrant told CNN .

An investigation involving US Airways , the Transportation Safety Administration -LRB- TSA -RRB- and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is under way , he said .

The CDC gives the do-not-board list to the Department of Health and Human Services -LRB- DHS -RRB- , which notifies TSA . It in turn notifies the individual airlines , according to a U.S. government official who asked not to be identified .

In this case , the official said , the government notified the airline at 10 p.m. Friday , more than 14 hours before the passenger checked in for the flight , which departed at noon Saturday .

The CDC told USAirways that there is little to no risk that another passenger would contract the disease on a flight of fewer than eight hours , Durrant said .

Because the flight lasted less than six hours , the airline has not tried to contact any of the other passengers , he said .

The person was stopped in San Francisco after trying to board another flight for a location outside the country , said Dr. Martin Cetron , CDC 's director for global migration and quarantine .

`` We do n't think anyone with active tuberculosis should get on a plane , '' he told CNN in a telephone interview .

Cetron said the patient has a contagious form of tuberculosis but he would not divulge whether it is a multiple-drug-resistant strain of the bacteria , which can prove fatal . The patient is being treated for the disease , the doctor said .

It is not the first time the list has failed to keep a passenger with contagious tuberculosis off a jetliner in the roughly 30 months of its existence , he said .

The list was created in June 2007 after Atlanta , Georgia , lawyer Andrew Speaker traveled abroad with a drug-resistant case of tuberculosis . He set off an international health scare by flying to Europe . and then Canada , before driving back to the United States . He insisted he had not been told he was contagious ; public health officials disagreed .
