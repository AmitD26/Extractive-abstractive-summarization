The Washington Redskins , stinging from a letter by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and dozens of fellow Democrats calling on the league to force the team to change its racist name , apparently fumbled a desperate Twitter appeal to fans .

`` This team has ZERO self-awareness . lol , '' one person tweeted .

`` Lifelong ` Skins fan and I strongly believe it is time to change the name , '' wrote another .

`` How do you not see what a bad idea this is , '' said another tweet .

Faiz Shakir , Reid 's digital director , said the majority of responses favored a name change .

`` In the five to 10 minutes following it , we were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming outpouring of opposition to the team , '' he said . `` It was 50 to one at one point . ''

`` They declared victory within the hour and as the night went on , more and more momentum swung our way , '' he said . `` That 's the good thing about our country . People can express themselves and have a healthy dialogue . ''

`` I would hope that the team does reflect on why there was so much organic opposition to the name , '' Shakir said Friday . `` I do n't know if they 're living in bunker mentality over there and do n't realize that this name has caused so much anger . But if they are in that bunker mentality , hopefully -LRB- Thursday 's Twitter response -RRB- causes them to climb out of that and see the fact that there is a lot of deep-seeded opposition and anger to the name . ''

Responding to the senators ' letter , Redskins President Bruce Allen invited Reid to a game to `` witness first-hand that the Washington Redskins are a positive , unifying force for our community in a city and region that is divided on so many levels . '' Allen said the term Redskins originated as a Native American expression of solidarity , and that the team logo was designed by Native Americans .

`` This is a complete disregard for those that are calling for a change , '' he said . `` It 's a fundamental misreading of the issue at large . ''

They asked Goodell to follow the lead of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver , who took tough measures against Sterling after the longtime owner of the league 's Los Angeles Clippers was recorded making comments offensive to African-Americans .

`` Today , we urge you and the National Football League to send the same clear message as the NBA did : that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports , '' the letter said .

`` The intent of the team 's name has always been to present a strong , positive and respectful image . The name is not used by the team or the NFL in any other context , though we respect those that view it differently , '' the league statement said .
