The rat-a-tat of a hundred green sewing machines . The hypnotic hum of spools spinning brightly colored threads . The hiss of a thousand clothing irons .

Set aside for a moment what you think you know about the garment factories in Bangladesh : grimy , sweaty , children sitting in dimly lit , sweltering rooms sewing shirts you buy at your box store for $ 12 .

Here at Lakhsmi Sweaters , the only children are in its in-house day care .

At this factory in Gazipur , on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka , workers sit in long , orderly rows , under bright neon lights , with fans blasting full speed .

`` The atmosphere should always be healthy , friendly and livable . We do n't need buyers to tell us that , '' said Safina Rahman , director of Lakhsmi and one of just a handful of female owners in what is predominantly a male-run industry .

Retailers in the West are rethinking their partnerships as customers threaten to shop elsewhere .

United Students Against Sweatshops , a labor rights group , is planning protests against clothiers it believes are n't committed to strict standards in Bangladesh .

And the Obama administration may take away the tax breaks Bangladesh get for goods that the United States imports .

All of which would have devastating consequences for Bangladesh .

The garment industry has been a boon for this South Asian nation of 160 million . It pumps $ 20 billion a year into the economy . In a country where 31 % of the population lives below the poverty line , the industry has been a salvation for 4 million people working in more than 4,500 factories .

`` More than 2 million people are working in this trade ; maybe more , '' Rahman said . `` If one -LRB- worker -RRB- has four people to look after in the family , that 's almost 8 million people who are living off this trade . ''

`` If we are bloodsuckers , who is contributing to this economy ? '' she added . `` It 's become a big-time challenge for us . People like us . ''

Contented workers

Poppy Begum is a stitcher here , one of 2,000 workers spread across four floors . She works nine-hour days , six days a week , helping create sweaters and other knitwear bound for Europe , Canada and Australia .

In an industry where the turnover is extremely high , many of the workers such as Begum have been here for almost a decade .

They are trained in first aid . And they appoint a representative who airs their grievances to management .

In other words , the accusations that bedevil the industry now -- safety issues , workers rights , low pay -- are addressed here .

We spoke to several workers at Lakhsmi and asked them to speak freely about their conditions . They seemed content .

It turns out that medium-sized factories such as this are n't the ones creating the headlines .

They are tailored for the task , they meet safety standards and they pass inspections .

The problem children are the many , many factories that have mushroomed in and around Dhaka that rent space in facilities where they have no business being : shopping malls or office buildings that are n't equipped to handle the heavy machinery the trade requires .

These facilities do n't directly deal with Western clothiers .

Changes afoot ?

The shopping mall in the Dhaka suburb of Savar was built on swampland , with the owner adding four more floors to what was once a five-story structure , officials said . It housed five garment factories and generators on the fourth floor to keep them buzzing .

It collapsed April 24 , killing more than 1,100 and ranking as the deadliest industrial disaster in the country .

Until now , it had standards for workplace safety but not for the structural safety of a building .

`` Before this Rana Plaza incident , BGMEA did not have the technical know-how people to check the structural design . We did n't have any civil engineers , '' said Reza Bin Mahmood , vice president with the association .

Those inspections have now begun . But with more than 4,500 factories , the task is daunting .

Some international retailers are doing just that . More than a dozen European clothiers signed on to a plan to help prevent fire and building collapses in Bangladesh .

The five-year plan calls for independent safety inspections and for companies to publicly report the findings . It also requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in factories with which they work .

Companies who sign on will have to terminate business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety upgrades .

Over at Lakhsmi , the changes for the industry are welcome ones . Here , workers are assigned as fire wardens and extinguishers hang on the walls on each floor .

`` This is just not done . It should not be repeated again . ''
