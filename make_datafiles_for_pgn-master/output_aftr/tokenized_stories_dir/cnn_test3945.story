When R&B singer Seal and Heidi Klum met in a New York City hotel lobby , the supermodel told CNN 's Piers Morgan , `` it was kind of like two magnets . ''

The model-turned-mogul , TV superstar and mother of four is a guest on Friday 's `` Piers Morgan Tonight . ''

Klum described the igloo as `` a full-on igloo with a bed inside with pillows and blankets and candles and rose petals . ''

Klum , 38 , admitted that she had to forgo her propensity for controlling things and `` learned how you have to , like , let him do his creative thing , because I am quite bossy in my industry . ''

When Morgan asked if the couple was planning on having more children , Klum answered , `` No , we have four children , and we 're complete now . ''

With the ninth-season finale of `` Project Runway '' coming up , Klum told Morgan she never imagined the series would last so long .

`` No way , '' she said . `` No . You just do n't when you get into something like that . You know , when we first created ` Project Runway , ' it was Harvey Weinstein , Desiree Gruber , my publicist for the last 15 years and myself , and we just shopped it around . We went to all these different networks and tried to explain to them what we wanted to do was a show about fashion . ''

Klum told Morgan that audiences love the show `` because it 's really about talent . ''

Klum called her entr√©e into fashion modeling `` pure luck '' and likened it to `` winning the lottery '' when she told Morgan the story .

Klum , who also host 's `` Germany 's Next Top Model '' in her native country , told Morgan that she counts getting `` Project Runway '' on the air among her most cherished business successes . She also called designing her real passion and said she continues to design : There 's a Heidi Klum for New Balance line of apparel and sneakers , Wildlife by Heidi Klum is sold on QVC , Heidi Klum on AOL , Shine by Heidi Klum , a fragrance with Coty , and more . Klum , who has lived in the United States since 1994 , became an American citizen before the 2008 presidential election so she could vote for Barack Obama . She holds dual citizenship and remains a German .

`` I 've been paying quite a few taxes in this city -- in this country , '' she said . `` And I felt that it would be right for me to vote for the next president . ''
