China has no wine-making tradition but the country now uncorks more bottles of red than any other .

It 's home to a growing middle-class thirsty for new tastes , international vintners trying to win their share of the market and Chinese winemakers working to find their own identity .

Here , four wine experts , who appear on the latest episode of CNN 's On China show that airs this week , examine some of the myths that have grown up about wine drinking in China .

Myth ? Chinese do n't know much about wine

`` They talked about Bordeaux of course and some talked about Burgundy , '' she tells CNN 's On China .

Judy Chan , chief executive of Grace Vineyard in Shanxi province that produces 400,000 bottles of wine a year , says China is not an easy place to grow grapes , with summer rains and winter frosts .

`` This restricts our growing season -- we usually bury the vine in November and unearth in early April -- and not to mention the cost incurred as a result , '' she says .

Myth ? People do n't drink the wine they buy

Instead , bottles of premium Bordeaux costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars were intended to impress as lavish gifts but this custom has come under scrutiny as part of a government anti-corruption campaign .

`` There was a lot of gift giving six , seven , 10 years ago , '' he says . `` Today , that market is not as important as it used to be . ''

More often , he says `` it 's about friends , it 's about getting together with a group of people to share the experience of wine . ''

Although he adds that it 's still rare to find people who drink a glass of wine by themselves or a husband and wife sharing a bottle at home .

Myth ? Chinese like to mix their wine with cola

There 's an often-shared notion that the Chinese wine drinker buys a bottle of Bordeaux and mixes it with Coca-Cola . Is this fact or urban legend ?

Twenty years ago , it might have happened , says wine consultant Walker , but it 's a thing of the past and Chinese palates are increasingly sophisticated .

Myth ? China will never produce a truly top tier world class wine

`` But I have n't yet found a Chinese wine that would be worth , on its own merits , serving at my dinner table , I 'm afraid . But I 'm sure it will happen . ''
