That 's just one of the four lessons we take away from this calamity in our capital .

We love our parks . Boy , do we love our national parks . That was evident in a public outcry , on social media and elsewhere .

The Grand Old Party is n't so grand

Cruz wo n't rule out another shutdown

McConnell : Further shutdowns ` off the table '

Can the GOP heal an internal rift between establishment conservatives and the new conservatives of the tea party ? For the moment , the Republicans are cited as the top cause for the shutdown , evidenced by a CNN/ORC poll showing the GOP is the biggest target of American anger , with 63 % of respondents venting their ire at them . Democrats fared only slightly better , however , with 58 % expressing anger at them , too . And 53 % were angry at President Barack Obama .

For a country fresh out of a great recession , the 16-day shutdown was costly : It took $ 24 billion out of the economy , Standard & Poor 's says .

As a result , the United States will grow 2.4 % -- instead of 3 % -- this quarter , meaning there wo n't be as many new jobs that many American families desperately need in the post-recession era .

A sequel

As difficult as this drama was , there will be a Part II .

The government is funded until January 15 -- meaning Americans will be forced to witness another round of Democrat-Republican budget negotiations .

It gets better , or worse , depending on your viewpoint : The debt ceiling will have to be revisited , too , by February 7 .

Perhaps John Chambers , managing director of Standard and Poor 's rating service , put it best :

`` We think that we 'll be back here in January debating the same issues , '' Chambers said . `` This is , I fear , a permanent feature of our budgetary process . ''

Playing nice : Budget talks may start with an extra-friendly tone
