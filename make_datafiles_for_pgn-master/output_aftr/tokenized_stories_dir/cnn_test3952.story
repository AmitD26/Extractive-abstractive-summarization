Huffman said African-Americans are disproportionately affected by the criminalization of marijuana which makes passing the law a civil rights issue .

`` We have empirical proof that the application of the marijuana laws has been unfairly applied to our young people of color , '' Huffman said in an official statement .

Police departments in California have made more than 60,000 marijuana possession arrests in 2008 , three times more than in 1990 , according to a recent study released by the Drug Policy Alliancean organization that says it promotes policies to end the war on drugs . Although blacks and Latinos make up less than 44 percent of the state 's population , together both ethnic groups constitute up to 56 percent of arrests that are made for marijuana possession in California , according to the study . Furthermore , the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has found that African-Americans use marijuana at lower rates than white Americans across the country .

The study said arrests in California are `` racially-biased '' and have led to a `` system-wide phenomenon , occurring in every county and nearly every police department in California , and elsewhere . ''

`` We are usually conservative in terms of the issues that we support , but disproportionate prosecution of -LSB- African-Americans for -RSB- drug-related offenses for marijuana has called us to fight for decriminalization in our community . ''

`` Sadly , that 's not the picture . ''

Bishop Ron Allen , an outspoken leader of the International Faith-Based Coalition and member of the NAACP , is outraged by the endorsement .

`` If you think you are a civil rights leader , you should know better than anyone not to open the door to laws that will poison our community , '' Allen said .

But Huffman 's endorsement has been backed by other organizations that support civil rights , including LEAP , the Law Enforcement Against Prohibition .

However , Allen believes that by supporting this initiative , Huffman is giving the NAACP `` a black eye . ''

`` We agree that the disproportionate arrests should change , but legalizing marijuana is not the way , '' Allen said .

`` What it will create is for more incarceration , more drug babies , and more crime on the street . This is not a civil rights issue . ''

Allen , a former drug addict , said marijuana is a gateway drug that causes violence in poor communities and impedes the education of African-American youth .

The California NAACP `` does not speak for the majority of the African-American community in this country , '' Allen said .

`` How do you educate a mind that is intoxicated ? ''

`` To raise the $ 100 billion that would be needed to fund education in this state , the use of marijuana would have to increase by 20 to 40 percent , '' he said . `` This is a smokescreen and it 's blood money . ''

The decision on Proposition 19 will be made in California in November .
