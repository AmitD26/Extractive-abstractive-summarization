The tribunal investigating the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri orders generals ' release .

`` This never happened since the Ottoman times , even during the Syrian time , that people were just locked in jail for no reason and no charge , '' Sayyed said after being met by top lawmakers from the opposition party Hezbollah .

He called for supporters to remember them in parliamentary elections scheduled for June , and `` let justice take over . ''

Sayyed was the director of Lebanon 's internal security services at the time of the car bombing , which killed 22 others along with Hariri . Hajj was the country 's domestic security chief ; Azar was the head of military intelligence and Hamdan was in charge of President Emile Lahoud 's security force .

The U.N. tribunal convened to investigate Hariri 's February 2005 death ordered the men released earlier Wednesday , declaring the evidence against them was `` not sufficiently credible to request the maintenance in detention of those persons . ''

The assassination sparked widespread protests that led to the election of an anti-Syrian bloc in parliament and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon .

He added , `` We do n't want any scapegoat . We want justice . ''

The U.N. tribunal opened in March , and the prosecution could take as long as 10 years , sources close to the probe said .

Hezbollah , the pro-Syrian Shiite movement that maintains its own militia , took up the generals ' cause and hailed their release .

`` Their detention was a disgrace to the Lebanese legal system and everyone who was involved in their detention , '' Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Amin said .
