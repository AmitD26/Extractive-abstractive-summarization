An unlikely ally is offering a glimmer of hope that President Barack Obama can make good on his vow to close Guantanamo Bay before leaving office .

Republican Sen. John McCain , a fierce critic of Obama 's foreign policy , is about to take the chairmanship of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee . He says it 's still possible the war on terror camp in Cuba could be shut down -- but warns that the administration will have to come up with a clear plan to overcome Republican opposition .

But he warned that ever since he started talking to the administration about Guantanamo Bay in 2009 , it had `` never come forward with a plan as to how we treat those individuals that have been judged as too dangerous to ever be released , and that is the hangup . ''

McCain said he thought that Republican opposition could be overcome , if the administration laid out exactly how it believed it could close Guantanamo .

`` If I went to the members of the committee today and said , ` Look they are going to be moved to a maximum security prison in some location in the United States of America and we have a plan for that transfer , I think most of them would be perfectly happy about that , '' McCain said .

Last weekend , the Obama administration sent six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay for resettlement as refugees as part of its plan to depopulate the camp prior to its closure .

Four of the former detainees -- Ahmed Adnan Ahjam , Ali Hussain Shaabaan , Omar Mahmoud Faraj , and Jihad Diyab -- are Syrian nationals , while Abdul Bin Mohammed Abis Ourgy is Tunisian , and Mohammed Tahanmatan is Palestinian , according to Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby .

Republicans complain that released detainees are not sufficiently monitored when they leave Guantanamo Bay , and cite figures saying that nearly 30 percent of those released are back in the fight against U.S. forces .

But that leaves the most problematic prisoners , including those who the administration says are too dangerous to be released , and can not be tried in civilian courts as they are considered enemy combatants or the evidence against them is seen as tainted because it was obtained under duress .

The Wall Street Journal reported in October that Obama remained determined to close Guantanamo Bay , and was prepared to use executive power to do so if Congress would not go along .

Nearly all Guantanamo prisoners are being held without charges , and while about half of those are considered high-level threat detainees , the remainder were determined to be low-level threats by a task force of top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies . Those in the latter group could gain their freedom , provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries .

In December 2010 , Congress amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any Guantanamo detainees to the United States . That defeated the Obama administration 's plans announced a year earlier to try several Guantanamo detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in U.S. federal court .
