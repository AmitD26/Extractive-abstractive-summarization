The parents of Michael Brown , a Missouri teen killed by police , testified before a U.N. committee Tuesday because they want the world to know `` what 's going on in Ferguson . ''

`` We need the world to know what 's going on in Ferguson and we need justice , '' McSpadden told CNN in Geneva , Switzerland .

`` We need answers and we need action . And we have to bring it to the U.N. so they can expose it to the rest of the world , what 's going on in small town Ferguson . ''

What happened when Michael Brown met Officer Darren Wilson

The document says Brown 's killing and force used by police officers during protests that followed the killing `` represent violations of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . ''

It requests that the U.N. panel recommend the immediate arrest of Officer Darren Wilson , who killed Brown , as well as an end to `` racial profiling and racially-biased police harassment across the jurisdictions surrounding Ferguson . ''

The statement also calls for recommendations that would apply to the entire United States , including that the attorney general and Department of Justice `` must conduct a nationwide investigation of systematic police brutality and harassment in black and brown communities , and youth in particular . Methodology and findings of this investigation must be made publicly available . ''

Attorneys : Time for ` global intervention '

In a statement , the Browns ' attorney 's office said the couple planned to `` testify on behalf of many supporters who join in the appeal for global intervention in the way policing currently functions in America . ''

`` We 've been received very well , '' McSpadden told CNN . `` They 've given us a lot of love and support since we 've been here . Everything seems to be positive . It 's a great experience . ''

Speaking of what life has been like since the killing , he said , `` It 's a situation where I 'm surprised we have n't even lost our mind yet over this . But we 're being strong . Hopefully , justice will prevail . ''

The Committee Against Torture `` is the body of 10 independent experts that monitors implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment by its State parties , '' the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights says on its website .
