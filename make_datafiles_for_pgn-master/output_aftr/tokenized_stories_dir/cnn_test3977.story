Four days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded its investigation into June 's accidental anthrax exposure , more details are being released about the government health agency 's mishandling of potentially dangerous pathogens .

The CDC concluded its investigation into the anthrax incident last week , saying that no lab workers had been infected with the disease . But the public health agency 's report also detailed other instances in which lab workers had not followed protocol .

USDA inspectors also found that `` select agent materials '' were transferred using Ziploc bags , which do not meet CDC requirements for carrying these materials .

The problems date to 2011 , according to the USDA memo . A report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services `` found weaknesses in inventory records and expressed concerns about the lack of biosafety and security training for workers with access to these labs . ''

The CDC report says the potential exposure happened between June 6 and June 13 . A lab that had been preparing the anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the CDC 's Atlanta campus `` may not have adequately inactivated the samples . ''

Procedures in two of the three labs may have exposed workers to the anthrax , the CDC said . Hallway and lab areas have since been decontaminated .

The leader of one of the labs was reassigned shortly after the incident was revealed . CDC spokesman Tom Skinner would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned .

Bottom line , `` the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated , '' CDC Director Tom Frieden said Friday . It `` should have happened , and it did n't . ''

As a result of these problems , the CDC has created a high-level group of leaders who will work on lab safety issues . It has also started putting together an external advisory group to take a closer look at lab safety . And the CDC is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens , and it has put together a rapid-response command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents .

`` I will say that I 'm just astonished that this could have happened here , '' Frieden said .

He stands by his labs , which are considered some of the best in the world , and he stands by his scientists . But he added that he is `` upset '' and `` angry '' and has lost sleep over the incidents , and he is `` working around the clock '' to make sure it never happens again .
