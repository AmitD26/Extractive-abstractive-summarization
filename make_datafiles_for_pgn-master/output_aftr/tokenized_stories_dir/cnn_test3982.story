Albuquerque police shot a homeless man in the back and killed him , and it was all caught on gruesome detail in a police video .

It is just one more in a long line of police killings that has the city 's Police Department on the verge of federal oversight .

James Boyd , a mentally disturbed man who friends say was attempting to camp out in the foothills above Albuquerque one night in March because city homeless shelters had closed , was holding two small camping knives . Officers negotiated with him for five hours , eventually winning agreement from Boyd to leave the makeshift -- and illegal -- campsite .

Then a police stun grenade went off , Boyd , 38 , turned his back and three shots were fired .

Police video shows Boyd on his stomach on the ground , wheezing for breath as officers sic a dog on his legs and fire bean bag rounds at him .

The horrific encounter , routinely recorded as part of police protocol , is now a key part of an ongoing drama in New Mexico 's largest city -- a series of protests against the police and city officials . Federal officials are close to a deal that would have them supervising the Albuquerque Police Department .

Police Chief Gordon Eden has been on the job for only about three months . Initially , he called Boyd 's shooting `` justified '' but tells CNN that he spoke `` prematurely , and I should n't have . ''

Eden says he is `` holding people to a higher degree of culpability , '' but he is also facing Justice Department oversight .
