Queen Ella ? King Terry ? What 's in a royal name ?

`` Both my wife and I are overjoyed at the arrival of my first grandchild . It is an incredibly special moment for William and Catherine , and we are so thrilled for them on the birth of their baby boy , '' Prince Charles and wife Camilla said in a statement .

Earlier Monday , the duchess and Prince William traveled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary 's Hospital .

The hospital , next to Paddington Station in London , is where William and his brother Prince Harry were born .

The baby 's name may be announced when the family leaves the hospital , CNN 's Foster reported . Prince William 's name was announced a few days after birth , his brother Harry 's on departure from hospital .

Some British parents have delayed naming their newborns in recent days in hopes of either copying or avoiding the royal name , he said . British bookmakers favor the names James and George .

The child 's title will be His Royal Highness Prince -LRB- the baby 's name -RRB- of Cambridge .

The baby is third in line for the throne now occupied by the queen . Her son , Charles , will succeed her , followed by his son , William .

The queen returned to Buckingham Palace on Monday from Windsor Castle , another of her official residences .

World chuckles about #RoyalBaby

Previously , boys automatically trumped female siblings . So a first-born daughter could be pushed out of line by a younger brother .

The British monarch is also head of state in 15 Commonwealth countries , including Australia , Canada , New Zealand , Belize and Jamaica .

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his country 's congratulations .

`` The arrival of the newest member of the Royal Family , a future Sovereign of Canada , is a highly anticipated moment for Canadians given the special and warm relationship that we share with our Royal Family , '' he said in a statement .

Barack and Michelle Obama also gave their best wishes .

The UK-based Centre for Retail Research estimates retailers will sell $ 121 million worth of royal-related baby toys and souvenirs . Merchandise ranges from diaper covers and clothing to a `` prince potty chair , '' which of course is in the shape of a throne .

On Twitter , topics related to the royal baby jumped to the top of the trending list in the United Kingdom Monday morning . Worldwide , hashtags such as #RoyalBabyBoy and #Will & Kate were trending later in the day .

The baby was the only topic on the radio talk show hosted by Vanessa Feltz on BBC London 94.9 on Monday morning .

But not everyone was thrilled . Feltz read on air a message from `` Gary '' asking , `` Please , please please , I implore you not to devote too much of the morning 's show to the royal baby . ''
