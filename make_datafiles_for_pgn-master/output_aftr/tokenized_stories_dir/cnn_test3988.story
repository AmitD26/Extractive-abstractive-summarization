A conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a Mississippi nursing home to photograph U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran 's ailing wife , who is suffering from dementia .

`` It 's the worst , '' says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary , not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger , Chris McDaniel , trying to stir up voter disgust .

This race , one of the nastiest so far this election year , has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that .

Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran 's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide , Kay Webber .

Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber 's D.C. home , and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer 's dime .

McDaniel 's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list , while the Cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist .

New ads in nasty Mississippi primary

This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP : a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending , out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington .

The next Ted Cruz ?

But what gave ammunition to Cochran allies is that McDaniel 's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent .

When we asked for clarification , McDaniel would n't go there , replying , `` Look , we 're going to focus on his record . ''

`` I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals . I 'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution . We do n't have time to waste . So with all due respect I would suggest they join me in this fight because they 've been silent far too long , '' he told us .

`` He and I are very different with our ideology . He 's a guy that believes in big government . He believes in big spending . He believes in increasing taxes . He believes in increasing his own pay . I am not that guy , '' McDaniel said .

The Sunlight Foundation , a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics , says outside groups have spent $ 7.6 million on the race , much of it for McDaniel and against Cochran .

Fighting back against tea party challenges

Henry Barbour , nephew of former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour , formed a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives to help Cochran . They have been airing aggressive ads slamming McDaniel as extreme , inconsistent and out of touch with Mississippi 's needs .

Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran , like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year .

Still , Cochran 's four decades in Washington have won him loyal supporters .

`` He 's a leader ; he 's a statesman , and he 's what we need in Washington . So stay as long as he wants to stay , '' Flagg said .

`` Seniority can be a plus . People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I do n't think that 's the case with Senator Cochran . He 's been responsive to the needs in Mississippi for many years , '' Hopson told CNN .

When we put those bipartisan sentiments to McDaniel he responded with an emphatic , `` come on ! ''

`` Look , there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to Washington . Maybe when Richard Nixon was president that was the thing people did . Those days are over . ''

But Cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us .

We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg , but when an aide came out and saw us waiting , they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him , while he snuck out another door and left in another car , leaving reporters in the dust .
