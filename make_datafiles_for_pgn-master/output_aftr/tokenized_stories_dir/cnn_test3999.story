If the 37-year-old still makes career moves by her tried-and-true process , then she 's likely anticipating something great to occur in her new role as Yahoo 's CEO .

Mayer 's hiring last summer , which accordng to Fortune made her the youngest head of a Fortune 500 company , came as a surprise , and her high-wire decisions since have spread far wider than Yahoo 's campus .

What they saw instead was a businesswoman eager to get back in the office and who said that having a new baby in her life was n't as difficult as she 'd been told .

But the real critiques came last month when Yahoo 's HR department issued an e-mail telling staff that they will no longer be able to work from home , prompting an angry backlash and leading some to question Mayer 's judgment .

While some found her position just , others hoping the new mom would create a more reasonable corporate culture interpreted the move as unfair , noting that Mayer approved the edict while building a nursery next to her office -- not an option for most working parents .

But over her nearly 14-year career in the tech world , Mayer has consistently shaken up expectations . If we 've learned anything about this influential computer engineer-turned-corporate executive , it 's that she plays the game of business by her own rules .

Part of the legend of Marissa Mayer is that she does n't fit into our assumptions of what it means to be a tech geek .

Much has been made of her looks , which defy popular culture 's assertion that the best computer scientists are `` people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night , '' Mayer told Glamour magazine jokingly in 2009 . `` I do code all night ! I am the stereotype , but I also break the stereotype . ''

Soon she was climbing Google 's ranks , from programmer to vice president of local , maps and location services . But the press and public focused more on her posing for Vogue and reportedly shelling out $ 60,000 at a charity auction for lunch with Oscar de la Renta . A geek who loves fashion ? Who would 've thought ?

But as Mayer told The New York Times in 2009 , `` I refuse to be stereotyped . I think it 's very comforting for people to put me in a box . ` Oh , she 's a fluffy girlie girl who likes clothes and cupcakes . Oh , but wait , she is spending her weekends doing hardware electronics . ' ''

2 . Passion can trump gender

With two degrees from Stanford , including a master 's degree in computer science , and a successful career in a male-dominated industry , Mayer is often held up as a woman to emulate . During her tenure at Google , Mayer 's been described as being a key influencer on products such as Gmail , Google Maps and Google 's minimalist search page .

Her advice to other women seeking to follow in her footsteps is to find something that drives them and push past their preconceptions about gender roles .

And when it comes to feminism , Mayer shies away from the phrase .

`` I do n't think that I would consider myself a feminist . I certainly believe in equal rights , I believe that women are just as capable , if not more so , in a lot of different dimensions . But I do n't I think have sort of the militant drive , and sort of the chip on the shoulder that sometimes comes with that , '' she said in PBS and AOL 's `` Makers '' documentary , launching a debate about her remarks .

3 . Burnout ? She 's not really buying it

Mayer has long been seen as the employee who can outwork you on your most caffeinated day . But she 's said that she does n't believe in burnout in the typical sense .

`` I 've really been focused on the products , what we need to do , '' Mayer said last month . `` There are so many great people at Yahoo , and so many great users that we want to serve well , that I really put my energy there . ''

4 . She welcomes challenges

One of Mayer 's mantras for making decisions in life is to a -RRB- work with the smartest people she can find , and b -RRB- go for a challenge that makes her feel like she 's in over her head . Say , for example , taking over struggling Web giant Yahoo .

Yahoo 's undoubtedly hoping for a turnaround in both its finances and its products , one worth that $ 1.1 million bonus that Mayer was given . Optimistic observers are waiting to see Mayer apply some of the smarts and aesthetic sense she showed at Google .

`` If Mayer were just another savvy Silicon Valley executive who 'd spent most of her career at one outfit and never run a company , she might feel like a quixotic choice for a big , troubled public company like Yahoo , '' Time magazine 's Harry McCracken wrote last July .

5 . If she needs to test 41 different shades of blue , she will

Former staffer Douglas Edwards , who wrote `` I 'm Feeling Lucky : The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59 , '' recalled feeling perturbed by Mayer 's emphasis on testing and data . He remembered one occurrence when he said she changed the results Google provided so they 'd appear in a sans-serif font , because she 'd seen research that those were easier to read .

Time will tell if this obsessive attention to detail pays off for Yahoo , and Mayer -- or whether her company 's problems are too big .
