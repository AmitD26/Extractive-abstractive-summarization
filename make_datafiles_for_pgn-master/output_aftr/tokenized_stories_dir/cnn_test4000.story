In the wake of an alleged terrorist attack on one of its soldiers , Britain is forming a task force that will examine the dynamics behind extremist groups in the country , Prime Minister David Cameron 's office announced Sunday .

The group , led by Cameron , will `` have a general focus on extremist groups , but accept that in practice the greatest threat is from Islamist extremists , '' a statement from Downing Street said .

The Muslim Council of Britain said the task force needs to look at `` extremism from all quarters '' while forming an effective strategy .

The brutal slaying Wednesday of British soldier Lee Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in a working-class neighborhood in southeast London shocked people across the United Kingdom .

Late Sunday , a mosque caught fire in the city of Grimsby on the country 's east coast , and police arrested two men on suspicion of arson . The blaze coincided with inciting messages on social media `` by a small minority of individuals , '' according to Humberside County police .

Woolwich arrests

Nine people have been arrested in connection with the Woolwich attack , including three men who were taken into custody Saturday and another on Sunday . The three arrested Saturday were released early Monday on bail , police said .

The men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder , the Metropolitan Police said in a statement .

Two men arrested at the scene of the killing are now under guard in South London hospitals after being shot in a confrontation with police .
