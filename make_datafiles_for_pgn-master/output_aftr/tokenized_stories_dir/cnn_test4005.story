-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lavish weddings on soap operas are commonplace -- beautiful , wealthy characters united amid copious tears , heaps of flowers and exquisite attire .

Monday 's ceremony on ABC 's `` All My Children '' was much the same , except for the couple : Bianca Montgomery and Reese Williams , both wearing designer dresses , united in daytime television 's first lesbian wedding .

`` When my character did first come out of the closet , there was a lot of negative reaction , '' said Eden Riegel , the actress who plays Bianca . Her character is the daughter of Erica Kane , a longtime mainstay on the show played by Susan Lucci .

`` People were very protective of Erica Kane 's daughter , and I think that the beauty of the show is that we were able to reach people and get people sort of used to the idea , '' Riegel said . Watch the actress talk about her character and the wedding ''

`` I think it is really important to understand that there are a lot of things that people do n't really want to see and do n't want coming into their homes , and lesbian weddings are certainly one of them , '' said Glenn Stanton of the group Focus on the Family .

`` It 's reality , '' said Neil Giuliano , president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation -LRB- GLAAD -RRB- . `` So when we see a lesbian couple getting married on daytime drama , it simply reflects what 's happening in the real world . ''

The state was one of several to ban same-sex marriage in the November 4 elections . But unlike the others , California had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since a May 15 ruling by the state Supreme Court legalized the unions .

However , California 's Proposition 8 , the measure outlawing same-sex marriage , passed with about 52.5 percent of the vote .

Three groups -- the American Civil Liberties Union , gay-rights group Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights -- filed a legal challenge to the vote , asking the state Supreme Court to rule the ballot-initiative process was `` improperly used '' to strip away a right protected by the state constitution .

The court has said it will hear the appeal , but will not block the implementation or enforcement of the law in the meantime . Arguments in the case could be heard as early as next month .

Same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts and Connecticut . Rhode Island recognizes same-sex marriages from other states , and Vermont , New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions .
