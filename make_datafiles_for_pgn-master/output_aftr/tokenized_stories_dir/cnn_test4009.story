He has seemingly succeeded everywhere he 's landed , but now , with the Ebola crisis on his hands , CDC Director Tom Frieden is being questioned at every turn .

If anything , Frieden has been consistent since the epidemic broke out in West Africa , and then eventually spread to the United States .

`` Ebola is scary . It 's a deadly disease . But we know how to stop it , '' he said last week .

Frieden has repeated this line many times : `` We know how to stop Ebola . ''

But then a Liberian national in Dallas was diagnosed with the virus . And last week , a nurse who cared for that man was confirmed to have Ebola .

In his role , Frieden has to thread the needle : acknowledge fear , while appealing for calm .

Frieden , described by friends as shy and hardworking , has had success virtually everywhere he 's been . His track record reflects well on him , though he has faced criticism from conservative voices who viewed his efforts to ban smoking and trans fat from restaurants in New York as the creation of a `` nanny state . '' The general distrust of government that the political right holds has been on display as the Ebola fight is on .

The insinuation that maybe the nurse did something wrong brought new criticism against Frieden , this time without a political agenda .

The group National Nurses United spoke to reporters after Frieden 's remarks , some holding up signs that said , `` Stop blaming nurses . Stop Ebola . ''

Zenei Cortez , a nurse and vice president of the group , told CNN 's Jake Tapper that in cases such as this , the nurses always get blamed unfairly .

`` And in this particular case , they said it was a breach of protocol . But what was the protocol ? '' she said . `` Was it enough that the nurse and the patient is protected ? ''

`` It 's not enough that they put out guidelines . It has to be fully enforced , '' she added .

`` The real challenge is -- first and foremost -- basing decision-making on data , '' Frieden said . `` You know it sounds wonky and uninteresting , but when it comes down to it , that 's what we want to do . ''

New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett , who worked with Frieden when he held that role , said she witnessed Frieden 's faith in the numbers .

When Frieden arrived in New York as health commissioner , there were about a thousand cases of TB in the city , Bassett recalled . It was Frieden 's specialty , but he went in a different direction with his resources .

`` He did n't say , ` I 'm going to halve the cases of TB , ' '' Bassett said . `` He said , ` I 'm going to drive down tobacco use . ' ''

That was a decision based on data , she said . `` Tobacco was and continues to be a leading preventable cause of death in New York and the country . ''

The impact of Frieden 's work in India helped about half a million people , so `` that 's not a strange answer from him because he 's very interested in numbers . And he 's going for the largest numbers for the larger impact . ''

What data has resulted in Frieden 's confidence in the ability to stop Ebola ? Will the recent cases change his calculus ?

The blog is hardly remarkable , but because it allows comments , it is ostensibly one way for the public to put their opinions in front of him .

`` As a registered nurse , I 'm here to tell you that I am losing confidence in your ` expertise ' ! '' one commenter wrote .

Another person wrote , `` For a guy who is so sure about ` stopping Ebola in its tracks , ' I see the disease spreading . ''

It 's unlikely that the CDC director will see these comments , but what if he did ? Could these voices of concern influence him ?

One thing that Bassett recalled about working with Frieden in New York is that he `` soaks up information from anybody . ''

If the director is interested in hearing suggestions , they are piling up from other health care professionals and members of the public interested enough about the Ebola outbreak to post a message on his blog .

In his career , Frieden , a graduate of Oberlin and Columbia , has undoubtedly over-achieved and saved thousands of lives .
