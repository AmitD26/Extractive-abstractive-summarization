Singapore 's pollution standards index -LRB- PSI -RRB- tipped the scales at 401 at noon on Friday , the highest ever recorded , as the government warned that the lingering haze could last for weeks .

The National Environment Agency warned the elderly , pregnant women , children and those with heart and lung conditions to remain indoors as the index hit an historic high . An index reading above 300 is defined as `` hazardous '' and is regarded as potentially life threatening to the ill and elderly .

Meanwhile , Singapore 's Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong warned residents angry about the smoke wafting in from Indonesia that they may have to learn to live with it , for now .

`` We ca n't tell how this problem is going to develop because it depends on the burning , it depends on the weather , it depends on the wind , '' he told a press conference on Thursday .

`` It can easily last for several weeks and quite possibly it could last longer until the dry season ends in Sumatra which may be September or October . ''

While schools remained closed in Singapore for the summer break , more than 300 were shut temporarily in nearby Malaysia due to the haze . Many office workers in the city-state , meanwhile , struggled to get to work through the haze-shrouded central business district .

`` It looks like footage of London smog in the 1950s , except that it smells like a day-old hearth , '' a British expat energy sector analyst , who did not want to be named , told CNN .

Singapore 's Minister for the Environment , Vivian Balakrishnan , flew to Jakarta on Thursday evening to meet with his Indonesian counterparts in a bid to coordinate a response to the smoke problem . The haze , caused by seasonal burn off in Sumatra , has strained relations between the two countries which normally share friendly ties .

`` Singapore should not be behaving like a child and making all this noise , '' senior Indonesian minister Agung Laksono told a press conference on Thursday . `` It 's not what Indonesians want , it 's nature . ''

`` Singaporeans have lost patience , and are understandably angry , distressed and concerned , '' Balakrishnan said on his Facebook page . `` No country or corporation has the right to pollute the air at the expense of Singaporeans ' health and wellbeing . ''

Jakarta , meanwhile , has pointed the finger at Singaporean palm oil ventures which it says have caused the smog by clearing land to make way for plantations that provide the feedstock for city-state 's refining industry .
