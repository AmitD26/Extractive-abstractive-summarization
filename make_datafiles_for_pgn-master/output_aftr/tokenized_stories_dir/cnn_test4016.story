Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- Conrad Hilton , the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton , allegedly threatened and intimidated flight attendants on a British Airways flight from London to Los Angeles last summer , using profanity , smoking in a bathroom and calling passengers `` peasants , '' federal authorities said this week .

The federal charge alleges that Hilton `` knowingly assaulted and intimidated flight attendants of the aircraft and , in doing so , interfered with the performance of the duties of the flight attendants and lessened the ability of the flight attendants to perform their duties . ''

If convicted , Hilton could face up to 20 years in prison , authorities said .

On the July 31 , 2014 , flight , a flight attendant told the FBI that Hilton appeared to be `` under the influence of drugs because of his erratic behavior while walking through the cabin , '' court papers said .

Hilton left his seat five minutes after takeoff , even though the `` fasten seat belt '' sign was still on , authorities said . Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10 1/2 - hour flight , court documents said .

Passengers became frightened and disturbed , authorities said .

He also allegedly told a flight attendant that `` I could get you all fired in five minutes . I know your boss ! ''

`` My father will pay this out , he has done it before . Dad paid $ 300,000 last time , '' Hilton allegedly told a flight attendant , according to court papers .

Hilton 's father is Rick Hilton -- who is a grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire 's founder , Conrad Nicholson Hilton -- and is a partner in a real estate development firm in Beverly Hills , California . Rick Hilton and his wife of more than 30 years , Kathy , are parents of four children , Paris , Nicky , Barron and Conrad , making them the great-grandchildren of the hotel empire , according to Rick Hilton 's webpage .

At some point during the flight , the attendant saw Hilton go into a bathroom and smelled cigarette smoke coming from it , authorities said .

The flight 's pilot , who was second-in-command to the captain , `` noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels , apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding , '' court papers said .

The pilot later confronted Hilton , and Hilton surrendered a used pack of cigarettes and a lighter , authorities said .

Hilton returned to his seat and fell asleep .

He awoke while being restrained and began screaming obscenities , court documents said .

`` As Hilton was being restrained , he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were ` going to ruin my career , ' '' the affidavit said .

Hilton allegedly told the FBI agent : `` I told all of them I could get all of their jobs taken away in less than thirty seconds , '' the affidavit said .

When Gates , the FBI agent , read federal law to Hilton , he interrupted him and stated : `` I did intimidate . But , through defense . He came up to me with his nose , '' referring to a crew member , the affidavit said .
