The 2012 London Olympics end Sunday with a music-filled closing ceremony at the Olympic Stadium , but there are still plenty of medals to be won . Fifteen events in 10 sports will take place across the capital on what is the last day of the competition .

Here are five things to watch for Sunday .

1 -RRB- The closing ceremony : Goodbye London , Hello Rio

Among the British acts rumored to be taking part are the Spice Girls and the Pet Shop Boys , singer Jessie J. and rapper Tinie Tempah . George Michael says he will be performing , too , tweeting over the past week that he is `` a bit nervous '' and has been `` rehearsing like crazy '' for the ceremony .

At the end will be the traditional Olympic flag handover to the next summer Olympic hosts , Rio de Janeiro . Artistic Director Cao Hamburguer said we 'll see `` eight minutes of Brazil '' with music , dancing and performances by musicians Seu Jorge , Marisa Monte , and BNegao .

In a rematch of its gold medal match in Beijing four years ago , the USA men 's basketball team will play Spain , the current world No. 2 , in the Sunday afternoon final .

The game will pit several NBA players against each other . Spain 's Pau Gasol is playing against his Los Angeles Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant of the USA , while Spain 's Serge Ibaka will play against his Oklahoma City Thunder teammates , Kevin Durant , James Harden , and Russell Westbrook of the USA .

3 -RRB- The men 's marathon : A scenic tour through London

A Kenyan win could pay tribute to Sammy Wanjiru , the 2008 Olympic gold medalist who died in a fall from his balcony last year .

Five of the 10 gold medals in men 's boxing were awarded Saturday , and the other five will be given out Sunday in men 's fly , light , welter , light heavy , and super heavyweight . Kazakhstan and Great Britain each have two athletes vying for gold .

5 -RRB- Women 's modern pentathlon : An all-day affair

The first event to start Sunday will also be the last to finish . The women get going at 8 a.m. -LRB- 3 a.m. ET -RRB- in the modern pentathlon , starting with fencing and swimming at the Olympic Park .

They move south of the river to Greenwich Park for riding and the combined event , in which the athletes begin at handicapped time intervals based on their results from the previous events . They must run to the shooting range , hit five targets in 70 seconds , then run 1,000 meters -- and do it three times over .

The first athlete to cross the finish line at the end wins the gold .
