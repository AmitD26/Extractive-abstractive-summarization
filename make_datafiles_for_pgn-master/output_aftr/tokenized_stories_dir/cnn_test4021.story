Elevated hopes that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 might soon be found were tempered Friday , when the joint search agency said the latest signal probably is n't from the missing plane .

`` On the information I have available to me , there has been no major breakthrough in the search for MH370 , '' Houston said .

`` Further analysis continues to be undertaken by Australian Joint Acoustic Analysis Centre . ''

But Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in China on Friday that authorities are `` very confident '' the signals picked up by acoustic detectors are coming from the black box of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , CNN affiliate Sky News Australia reported .

It 's unclear whether Abbott was referring to four signals detected earlier this week .

As planes and boats scoured the Indian Ocean for more signals and signs of wreckage , a senior Malaysian government official and another source involved in the investigation divulged details about the flight to CNN on Thursday , including new information about what radar detected , the last words from the cockpit and how high the plane was flying after it went off the grid .

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from military radar for about 120 nautical miles after it crossed back over the Malay Peninsula , sources say . Based on available data , this means the plane must have dipped in altitude to between 4,000 and 5,000 feet , a senior Malaysian government official and a source involved in the investigation tell CNN .

But former U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo was not convinced . She said the reported dip could have occurred in response to a loss of pressure , to reach a level where pressurization was not needed and those aboard the plane would have been able to breathe without oxygen , or to get out of the way of commercial traffic , which typically flies at higher altitudes .

That would have been necessary had the plane 's transponder been turned off and it lost communications . `` If you do n't have any communications , you need to get out of other traffic , '' Schiavo said .

New flight details revealed

`` There were no third-party voices , '' the source said .

But the air force did not inform the Department of Civil Aviation or search and rescue operations until three days later , March 11 , a source involved in the investigation told CNN .

The possible signal heard by a search plane was picked up through sonar buoys equipped to receive such electronic data and was detected near the Australian ship Ocean Shield , said the Joint Agency Coordination Centre .

The Australian Defense Force source said the signal detected was not at the 37.5 kHz frequency consistent with the pingers from flight data recorders but in a range that suggests strongly that it is from something that is man-made . Commodore Peter Leavy of the Royal Australian Navy said Wednesday in Perth that existing technology in RAAF P3 aircraft had been modified to allow the acoustic processor to pick up sounds in the frequency range . Using the technology in this way is experimental , according to the source .

The source said four RAAF P3 Orions have been modified with this technology , with the sonar buoys expiring and sinking about eight hours after they are deployed from the aircraft . On Wednesday , Leavy said that each P3 is capable of deploying 84 buoys , laid in a pattern or grid coordinated with the Ocean Shield .

Although Leavy said the buoys have sensors that can detect signals `` at least '' 1,000 feet below the surface , the source is confident that the technology has been tested at a `` much deeper depth . ''

Imagining the search underwater

There were no sightings reported by search aircraft or objects recovered by ships on Thursday , the Joint Agency Coordination Centre said .

Friday 's search area was about 18,000 square miles -LRB- 46,700 square kilometers -RRB- , centered 1,436 miles -LRB- 2,312 kilometers -RRB- northwest of Perth .

`` It 's pretty incredible , if you look at where we started , which was virtually the entire Indian Ocean , now getting it down to what 's essentially a couple hundred square miles -LRB- where the pings have been detected -RRB- is pretty miraculous , '' Marks said .

The Ocean Shield first picked up two sets of underwater pulses on Saturday that were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons . It heard nothing more until Tuesday , when it reacquired the signals twice . The four signals were within 17 miles of one another .

`` I believe we are searching in the right area , but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of MH370 , '' Houston said Wednesday .

The USNS Cesar Chavez will help supply Australian naval ships involved in the search `` in the coming days , '' the Navy said in a statement .

`` I think they 're getting ready for the long haul , '' Goelz said . `` Even if they do get four or five more pings , once they drop the side-scanning sonar device down , that is going to be painstaking and long . So I think they are settling in for the long search . ''

Friday is Day 35 in the search . Time is of the essence : The batteries powering the flight recorders ' locator beacons are certified to emit high-pitched signals for only 30 days after they get wet .
