Schaefer was sentenced to 18 years in prison for battering von Wiese-Mack to death in room 317 of the St. Regis Bali Resort .

Schaefer had claimed he killed his girlfriend 's mother in self-defense after a violent argument erupted over the young couple 's relationship .

The beaten body of von Wiese-Mack was found in a large silver suitcase that the couple had loaded in a waiting taxi outside the resort . They told the driver they 'd be back soon , but after a lengthy wait he alerted hotel staff who inspected the bag , noticed blood and called police .

The lovers were arrested after being found the following morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers -LRB- nine miles -RRB- away .

Described as a Chicago socialite , von Wiese-Mack was reported to have a troubled relationship with her teenage daughter .

Schaefer denied that the murder was premeditated . He told the court that he acted in self-defense when his girlfriend 's mother started strangling him during an argument in the Bali hotel room .

The prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder , because Mack 's mother disapproved of their relationship .

Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for Schaefer and 15 years for Mack .

Under Indonesian law , Mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years , after which she can nominate who should take custody .
