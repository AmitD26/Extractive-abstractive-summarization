New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday endorsed an upgraded U.N. status for the Palestinian Authority , despite intense opposition from the United States and Israel .

Its leaders had been working with dozens of supporting nations to develop a formal draft , enlisting the backing of European countries such as France and Spain .

It comes on the heels of an eight-day conflict that raged between Israel and Hamas fighters , where a series of airstrikes and rocket launches drew international attention and threatened regional stability .

This resolution `` does n't pursue peace , '' Prosor said , criticizing Abbas for being unable to represent the Gaza Strip , where a Hamas-controlled government presides .

`` It pushes it backwards , '' he said .

He called for the establishment of a Palestinian state `` with Jerusalem being its capital '' on land that includes what is Israel .

The observer status resolution needs only a majority of the U.N. 's 193 members to approve .

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said American leaders could not support a measure that circumvents direct talks and cautioned that Thursday 's decision did `` not establish Palestine as a state . ''

Rice urged both sides to the resume direct negotiations without preconditions .

`` Israel is prepared to live in peace with a Palestinian state , '' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday . `` But for peace to endure , Israel 's security must be protected , the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state and they must be prepared to end the conflict with Israel once and for all . ''

Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev called the resolution `` political theater . ''

Opinion : Why U.S. , Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N. .

The last round of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority was in 2010 .

But Israeli officials disagreed .

`` No decision by the U.N. can break the 4,000-year-old bond between the people of Israel and the land of Israel , '' Netanyahu said .

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , however , threw his full support behind the new status for the Palestinian Authority .

`` What the Palestinians moved to do today in the U.N. , I think is in basic line with the strategy of a two-state solution , '' Olmert told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday .

`` I urge the parties to renew their commitment to a negotiated peace , '' Ban said .

`` I do n't believe that these kinds of sanctions will bring them to a moment of truth where they sit around a table and look at each others eyes and decide that the game is over , they ca n't stand it anymore , they are going to give up their nuclear intention , '' Barak said .

Barak was visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , who noted how the Israeli defense chief announced his retirement from political life . Panetta praised Barak 's `` brilliant strategic mind '' and `` warrior heart . ''
