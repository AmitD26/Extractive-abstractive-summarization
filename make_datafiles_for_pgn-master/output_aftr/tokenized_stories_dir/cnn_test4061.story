-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aruban authorities questioned Joran van der Sloot in the Netherlands about the disappearance of Natalee Holloway , the Aruban prosecutor 's office said Friday .

It happened less than a week after a Dutch television program aired video footage showing the young man saying he was with the missing Alabama teenager when she died .

During the two-hour interview with Aruban investigators , van der Sloot again denied any role in Holloway 's vanishing , the prosecutor 's office said in a written statement .

Van der Sloot said that he was under the influence of marijuana when he was secretly videotaped saying that he was with Holloway when she died , and that he arranged for a friend to dump her body in the ocean , the statement said .

Patrick van der Eem , a man who feigned friendliness toward van der Sloot , recorded the conversations on hidden cameras installed in the Range Rover he was driving , according to the report that aired Sunday . Watch how the video has renewed interest in the case ''

Shortly after the video was made public , an investigative judge said that enough evidence exists to reopen the inquiry against the Dutch college student , but denied a prosecution 's request that van der Sloot be detained .

Earlier this week , Dutch authorities executed several search warrants at van der Sloot 's current and former residences , a source close to the investigation said . They took a hard drive and a laptop computer , the source said .

The college student is willing to answer `` any questions '' investigators ask , Tacopina said .

Earlier this week , he told ABC that much of what was on the video is `` easily disprovable based on corroborative evidence . ... The fact of the matter is he still is not responsible . The evidence -- not Joran , the evidence -- says he 's not responsible for Natalee 's death . ''

Holloway , 18 , was last seen in the early hours of May 30 , 2005 , leaving an Oranjestad , Aruba , nightclub with van der Sloot , Deepak Kalpoe and his brother , Satish . Mos dropped charges against the three men in December , saying he could n't be sure of a conviction . See a timeline of the case ''
