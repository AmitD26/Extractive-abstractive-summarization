NEW DELHI , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President George W. Bush called India 's prime minister Thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the Indian leader this week , a White House spokesman said .

`` Both leaders expressed their desire to see the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible , '' Gordon Johndroe said .

The phone call took place two days after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament . The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. .

The plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology .

The plan was approved by India 's Cabinet last year , and does not have to be ratified by the parliament .

A no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign , and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed . The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004 .

Tuesday 's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh 's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers .

`` It 's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need , one that is nonpolluting and one that does n't emit greenhouse gas emissions , '' she said .

`` And we think that we can move forward with this . If their legislature lets it move forward , then we can do the same here and then we 'll be able to get this wrapped up . ''
