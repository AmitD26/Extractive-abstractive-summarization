ISLAMABAD , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police tightened security at airports across Pakistan Thursday after receiving reports of a possible suicide attack at the international airport that serves Islamabad .

Officers emptied the parking lot at the Benazir Bhutto International Airport , on the outskirts of Islamabad , said Parvez George of the country 's Civil Aviation Authority .

Flights were going out of the airport , but police cleared the terminal building of the large crowds that usually gather to see relatives arrive or depart , George said .

Muhammad Asghar of Islamabad Police told CNN that authorities placed the airport on high alert after intelligence reports indicated it was under threat of an attack .

On Thursday , the Danish intelligence service said one of its employees , Karsten Krabbe , was among the victims of the blast .

Krabbe , a 53-year-old married father of two , was a security adviser at the Danish Embassy in Islamabad , which was targeted by a suicide bomber in June . That attack killed six people and wounded more than 20 .

`` Karsten Krabbe lost his life in a cowardly and ruthless terror attack , '' the Danish intelligence service said in a statement .

The Embassy took the measures because of general security concerns , said spokesman Lou Fintor Thursday . He did not comment on a specific threat .

And it said a travel warning issued on August 7 still stands : U.S. citizens should defer nonessential travel to Pakistan due to continuing security concerns .
