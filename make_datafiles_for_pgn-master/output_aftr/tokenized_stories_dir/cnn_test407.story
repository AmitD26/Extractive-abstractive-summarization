-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After a dust-up last week , Rihanna says she does n't want her performance of the song `` Run This Town '' to air on `` Thursday Night Football '' this week .

`` Beginning this Thursday , we will be moving in a different direction with some elements of our ` Thursday Night Football ' open , '' CBS said in a statement .

`` Run This Town '' will be replaced by theme music -- apparently for the rest of the season , not just for this week .

The network 's decision was announced Tuesday morning , a few hours after Rihanna criticized the network on Twitter .

`` Due to the misuse and misrepresentation of Rihanna 's name and participation in connection to CBS ' TNF , CBS was not allowed to license and utilize the song ` Run This Town . ' Roc Nation made the decision to not grant the song 's usage , '' the company said in a statement .

But CBS scrapped the opening video last week in light of its news coverage of the Ray Rice scandal that has engulfed the NFL . Holding off on the video gave CBS more time for somber discussion of domestic violence and the league 's treatment of it .

Rihanna , who was a victim of domestic violence during a 2009 incident with then-boyfriend and fellow music star Chris Brown , indicated in her tweets that she felt the network was punishing her .
