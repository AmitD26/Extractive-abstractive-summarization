Jiverly Wong , 41 , has been identified by police as the gunman in the Binghamton , New York , rampage .

`` No decisions by the police had any bearing on who died , '' Broome County District Attorney Jerry Mollen told reporters Sunday .

The first officers arrived at the American Civic Association about three minutes after the first emergency calls were made Friday , according to a timeline by the Binghamton Police Department .

Police said Jiverly Wong , a 41-year-old Vietnamese immigrant from an ethnic Chinese family , fatally shot his victims and then turned his gun on himself . City officials on Sunday released a list of all the victims .

A receptionist at the American Civic Association called 911 at 10:31 a.m. Friday while she hid under her desk , said Binghamton Police Chief Joseph Zikuski .

She was shot in the stomach and pretended to be dead before crawling under the desk , he said . Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting ''

Four people , including the receptionist , remained in serious condition in local hospitals but were expected to survive , the chief said .

Zikuski said the first 911 calls were in `` broken English , '' and dispatchers `` could not determine what was the problem . '' But two minutes after the first calls , officers were being dispatched to the civic association , and the first units arrived one minute later , the chief said .

Mollen said the issue of the police response was `` an obvious question '' that will be investigated , but `` now 's not the time . ''

`` We need a lot more information before any reasoned , intelligent response can be given to you , '' he said .

Those who knew Wong said they were not surprised by his actions , Zikuski said Saturday .

`` Apparently people were making fun of him . He felt he was being degraded because of his inability to speak English , and he was upset about that , '' Zikuski said .

Wong came to the United States in the late 1980s and lived in Binghamton before moving to California in the early 1990s , police said . He returned to Binghamton in July 2007 , Zikuski said .

Police found at the center two semi-automatic handguns , a .45-caliber and a 9 mm , licensed to Wong . The guns were purchased locally , and Wong made trips to a firing range `` at least once a week , sometimes more than that , '' Zikuski said .

Wong had attempted to purchase `` a number of firearms , '' the chief said . Purchasing a gun in New York takes about two weeks , Zikuski said , and Wong would return to a store during that period , `` cancel that order and purchase another one . ''

Wong was wearing body armor during the shooting . Investigators are `` looking into that '' because New York limits body armor purchases to law enforcement , Zikuski said .

An interfaith memorial service for all the victims was held Sunday evening , and hundreds of people took part in a candlelight vigil afterward . Watch relatives remember one of the victims , Roberta `` Bobby '' King ''

`` We are a good community , a nonviolent community , '' Ryan said earlier of the city of about 50,000 people about 140 miles northwest of New York City . `` And we are going to spread the word that this is a community that will come together and heal . ''

More details emerged over the weekend about the shooting .

Wong used his car to barricade the center 's back door and entered through the front of the building , authorities said .

Ryan said the car belonged to Wong 's father .

Wong lived with his parents in Johnson City , near Binghamton , the site of a law enforcement search Friday .

He crossed his arms and his eyes to the ground .
