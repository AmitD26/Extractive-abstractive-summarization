-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter and dumping her body in Texas ' Galveston Bay went on trial Tuesday on capital murder charges in the child 's death , court officials said .

The body of Trenor 's daughter , Riley Ann Sawyers , was found in October 2007 in a large plastic blue container on an uninhabited island in Galveston Bay .

Riley Ann 's case drew national attention after a fisherman found her body . Authorities were unsure of her identity , and police dubbed her `` Baby Grace . ''

The disposal of the girl 's body led to the evidence-tampering charge . A medical examiner said Riley 's skull was fractured in three places , injuries that would have been fatal .

A capital murder charge carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison , the Chronicle reported .

A cross has since been erected on the island where the toddler was found , which was named Riley 's Island in her honor , according to the Houston newspaper .

Trenor and the girl moved to Texas from Ohio in May 2007 to be with Zeigler , whom Trenor had met on the Internet . While in custody , Trenor gave birth this summer to another child , who is now in the care of relatives , her attorney , Tom Stickler , said .
