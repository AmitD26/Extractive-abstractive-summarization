Male cellists of the world can breathe easy again .

A senior British lawmaker confessed to making up the condition known as `` cello scrotum '' -- which relates to chafing from the instrument -- after reading about another musically-related ailment called `` guitarist 's nipple '' in the British Medical Journal in 1974 .

She said : `` Perhaps after 34 years it 's time for us to confess that we invented cello scrotum .

`` Reading -LRB- Dr -RRB- Curtis 's 1974 letter to the BMJ on guitar nipple , we thought it highly likely to be a spoof and decided to go one further by submitting a letter pretending to have noted a similar phenomenon in cellists , signed by the non-doctor one of us .

`` Anyone who has ever watched a cello being played would realize the physical impossibility of our claim . ''

Fiona Godlee , editor of the BMJ , told Britain 's Independent newspaper : `` It seems the BMJ has been deliciously hoaxed . It is wonderful it has been going all these years and no one realized .

`` We frown on misconduct and medical fraud is taken very seriously . But in this case I hope I am right in saying that no harm has been done . ''
