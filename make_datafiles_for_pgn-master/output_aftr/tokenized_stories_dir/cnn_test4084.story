Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm .

Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure , says while the purpose of the worm is unclear , its unique `` phone home '' design , linking back to its point of origin , means it can receive further orders to wreak havoc .

`` On Tuesday there were 2.5 million , on Wednesday 3.5 million and today -LSB- Friday -RSB- , eight million , '' he told CNN . `` It 's getting worse , not better . ''

Hypponen explained to CNN the dangers that Downadup poses , who is most at risk and what can be done to stop its spread .

It is the most serious large scale worm outbreak we have seen in recent years because of how widespread it is , but it is not very serious in terms of what it does . So far it does n't try to steal personal information or credit card details .

We have large infections in Europe , the United States and in Asia . It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks . There are very few reports of independent home computers affected .

What does it do ?

It is a complicated worm most likely engineered by a group of people who have spent time making it very complicated to analyze and remove . The real reason why they have created it is hard to say right now , but we do know how it replicates .

How can I prevent it infecting my machine ?

The best way is to get the patch and install it company-wide . The second way is password security . Use long , difficult passwords -- particularly for administrators who can not afford to be locked out of the machines they will have to fix .

Machines can be disinfected . The problem is for companies with thousands of infected machines , which can become re-infected from just one computer even as they are being cleared .
