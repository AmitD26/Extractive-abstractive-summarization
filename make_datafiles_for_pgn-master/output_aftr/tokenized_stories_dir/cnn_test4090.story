NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yet another scale Il Divo has mastered : scaling the heights of success .

The quartet was formed in 2004 after a global search .

The operatic quartet 's new album , `` The Promise , '' debuted atop the UK charts , their third collection to hit the No. 1 spot .

According to Syco Music , Il Divo 's UK-based label , the quartet has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide . It seems Cowell knew what he was doing .

Carlos Marin : -LRB- laughs -RRB- It 's a mix of everything . I mean at the end -LSB- of the day -RSB- we are just a pop act . We just sing pop songs , and we just converted mostly the big endings into operatic style . But we are just us , Il Divo .

Marin : In a way , yeah . I still remember the first time we went to number one -LRB- in the UK -RRB- . We knocked out Robbie Williams and it was just like `` Wow ! ''

CNN : How involved is -LSB- Simon Cowell -RSB- with the day-to-day Il Divo operation ?

Buhler : With the day-to-day operation , I would say his involvement is next to nothing . He 's only involved in the actual A&R - ing and the executive producing , which means we meet him about twice a year for an hour .

CNN : How many languages do you sing in ?

CNN : Do you speak the language of love ?

Marin : Yes , we do !

Buhler : That would be the ninth language .

CNN : Who is the biggest diva in the group ?

Marin : We are really four divas . Four captains , one ship .

Sebastien Izambard : We have very strong personalities , and we 're the producers of our tour and we sit down -- the four of us -- and decide what we 're going to do , what set , what choice of the music or lighting . We 're four grown-up people and we make that very possible . -LSB- In the beginning -RSB- everyone had their own opinions . Now we just know what 's best for Il Divo . It 's easy . Everything 's easy .

Miller : I think in America it 's more of a slow burn . I think it 's more difficult to put us on the radio because we fall between the cracks in a way . We 're a little bit too pop for the classical stations , we 're a bit too classical for the pop stations . And right now hip-hop and rap sort of reign supreme on the airwaves . But there is a big following and it 's growing all the time .

CNN : If there was someone you could collaborate with who you have n't yet , who would it be ?

Izambard : Beyonce . Christina Aguilera .

Marin : Tina Turner .

CNN : These are all pop acts . So you really do want to stay within the pop realm ?

Buhler : Yeah , definitely . I mean that 's a very conscious choice . I do n't think we 're all opera purists , but for me personally , a `` Nessun Dorma '' -LSB- Puccini aria -RSB- is as good as it is and I do n't see the point of adding a breathy voice , or adding harmonies to it . While the pop repertoire ... it 's just more out there for everyone to take it and do with it whatever without offending people . All you want to do with a pop song is somehow transmit emotion .

So far there 's -LSB- been -RSB- much more freedom in pop music and that 's why we stay in there ... we pretty much can do whatever we want . And as Simon Cowell just said recently , `` Nobody owns music . ''
