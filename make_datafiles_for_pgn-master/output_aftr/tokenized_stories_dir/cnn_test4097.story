-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three years ago , the film based on Dan Brown 's novel `` The Da Vinci Code '' was the focus of protest and controversy , with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points .

`` Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not , '' Hanks said of the film . `` I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it 's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it . And there is really not . ''

It also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard , who helmed `` Da Vinci , '' and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer .

While `` The Da Vinci Code '' centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants , the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the `` Illuminati . ''

Both films , like the Brown novels they 're based on , have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling .

`` I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction , '' said Bill Donohue , president of the Catholic League . `` You 've got -LSB- Dan -RSB- Brown , -LSB- Ron -RSB- Howard and -LSB- Tom -RSB- Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s . ''

Director Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission `` to paint me and the movie I directed , ` Angels & Demons , ' as anti-Catholic , '' a claim Howard emphatically denies .

The director told CNN that he attempted to reach out to the Catholic Church regarding the film , but had no success . He also downplayed reports that Rome and the Vatican tried to hinder filming .

Hanks said shooting the movie in the ancient city was complicated given the vibrancy of Rome . At one point , Hanks said , make-believe collided with one woman 's fairy tale .

`` We had a lady showing up who was getting married at the Pantheon and she had to get married and we had to get our shot , '' Hanks said . `` She showed up right between shots , when we were moving cameras . ''

Fortunately , both the wedding and the day 's filming were able to be completed , Hanks said .

McGregor said Howard was to be credited for how well the production came together . Howard 's background as an actor undoubtedly helped enhance the actors ' performances , McGregor said .

`` A lot of directors are able to tell you what they 're after , but Ron 's able to tell you what he 's after and help you for how you might play that ... which is kind of total directing , '' McGregor said .

Zurer said she had a blast being the only female lead in the film .
