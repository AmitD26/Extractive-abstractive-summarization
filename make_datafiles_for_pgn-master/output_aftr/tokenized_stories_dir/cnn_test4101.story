-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- First it was instant messaging during office hours that gave us the thrill of passing notes in class . Then it was ogling ourselves on Web cams , ranting our minds on blogs , uploading our baby photos on Flickr and poking each other on Facebook . These days , as corporate records show , we choose to spend our lunch breaks watching YouTube , if not chatting over Skype .

CSL 's flagship One2Free shop stands at the corner of Hong Kong 's trendy Causeway Bay district .

The bad news is the Web 2.0 revolution is over . The good news is now we can take it with us .

Over the past two years , well over a dozen startups have sprung into action , bringing everything from IM to VoIP -LRB- Voice over Internet Protocol -RRB- to our mobile phones , in a quest to conquer the cellular fourth screen .

Winner of Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal 's 2007 Emerging Technologies Awards in the category of Social Networking , Mig33 is confident about the viability of its future : `` The next wave of Internet growth is mobile . The number of mobile devices worldwide has exceeded three billion , and the next billion subscribers will have their first Internet experience using a mobile phone . ''

Like the Rotterdam-based Nimbuzz , Mig33 also offers instant messaging , photo sharing and VoIP for cheaper telephony , in addition to social networking via profiles , chatrooms and , of course , friends .

The softwares are fully functional on both 3G and any smart -LRB- Internet-enabled -RRB- 2.5 G phones running such platforms as Java , Symbian , Windows Mobile , Blackberry , S60 and the iPhone OS .

Nimbuzz in particular boasts compatibility with Skype , Google Talk , AOL Instant Messenger , Windows Live Messenger , Yahoo! Live Messenger , Jabber , MySpace and Facebook . But it is hardly alone in partnering with traditional desktop live chat sites , as well as industry partners around the world .

Fierce competition

Meanwhile in the mobile marketplace , VoIP competition is getting fierce . While SIPphone 's open-source Gizmo Project was heralded by early beta testers as `` the first viable Skype alternative '' in July 2005 , it 's clear today that Skype itself is the big winner in the VoIP game .

`` In the near future , there will be a hyper-convergence solution , '' predicts A2Aworld 's Michael Liu . `` However , WiFi/WiMax to cell/IMS will be playing a bigger and bigger role . In the long run , there will be all-in-IP IMS solutions . ''

Insecure communications also pose a new threat to VoIP , as Liu points out : `` In the early days of VoIP , people were mostly concerned with its cost , functionality and reliability . Now that VoIP is gaining wide acceptance and becoming one of the mainstream communication technologies , security has become a major issue . ''

And to satisfy the YouTube generation , applications such as myZen Mobile encourage the circulation of photos and viral videos optimized for mobile viewing in real time , with an all-in-one interface featuring YouTube , Facebook , Flickr , Yahoo podcast , etc , with the possibility to add other community sites such as ifilm and blogger .

`` Technically , new handsets already integrate hardware acceleration for 3G , and battery life is increasing rapidly . Now the only remaining factor is availability or higher-speed affordable mobile bandwidth , which is already emerging in advanced mobile markets such as South Korea , Hong Kong and Japan . ''

Hong Kong 's largest mobile network carrier CSL introduced Asia 's first 3G video-sharing service in 2005 , launched Hong Kong 's first 3G interactive mobile TV in 2006 , and partnered with blogging site Xanga in early 2008 .

`` We try to ` replicate ' any desktop experience to the mobile phone . You can call it replicating , extending , adding value , '' continues Teo . `` And with every new partnership , we need to make sure that the application works on each new handset we launch ... With mobile phones -LSB- as opposed to desktop computers -RSB- there is still some concern , stigma , so we need to educate people to get over that hurdle . It 's the faster we can get it at the click of a button . ''

More and more , the mission of the mobile industry is to make seamless that virtual space between desktop and handset .
