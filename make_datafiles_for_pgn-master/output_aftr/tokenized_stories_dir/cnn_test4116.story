A police computer image of some of the facial injuries suffered by baby Peter .

The child 's -- originally known as Baby P -- horrifying death caused a furor in Britain , with the media , public and politicians united in demanding to know how his terrible injuries were missed by social workers , police and medical staff .

Baby P 's mum has to serve a minimum of five years . She and her boyfriend can not be named .

Baby P -- he could not be known by his first name , Peter , until the recent lifting of a court order -- was only 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot in August 2007 .

Judge Kramer told Peter 's mother that she was `` a manipulative and self-centered person , with a calculating side as well as a temper . '' Watch more on the case ''

`` Your conduct over the months prevented Peter from being seen by social services . You actively deceived the authorities ... you acted selfishly because your priority was your relationship , '' he told the court , PA reported .

Judge Kramer 's comments echoed the country 's response to the case .

Graham Badman , the chairman of Haringey Local Safeguarding Children Board , which conducted the review said : `` I believe the most important lesson arising from this case is that professionals charged with ensuring child safety must be deeply skeptical of any explanations , justifications or excuses they may hear in connection with the apparent maltreatment of children .

Badman said the review found that if `` doctors , lawyers , police officers and social workers had adopted a more urgent , thorough and challenging approach , the case would have been stopped in its tracks at the first serious incident . ''

`` Baby Peter deserved better from the services that were supposed to protect him , '' Badman said .
