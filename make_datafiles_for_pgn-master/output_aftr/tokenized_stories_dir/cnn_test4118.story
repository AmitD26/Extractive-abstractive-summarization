Brazilian pilots and a medical team bring one of the first bodies ashore at Fernando de Noronha island .

The 16 bodies were taken to the Legal Medical Institute in Recife for identification , the statement said . Police will perform DNA tests at their lab in the capital , Brasilia , if necessary , they said .

A French nuclear submarine joined the hunt Wednesday for the flight data recorders and other wreckage from Air France Flight 447 as Brazilian air force and navy crews continued to pull bodies from the Atlantic . Bad weather and poor visibility are expected in the search area , Brazilian Air Force spokesmen said .

The French nuclear submarine Emeraude began patrolling the area Wednesday morning , the French defense ministry said .

The `` towed pinger locators , '' which help search for emergency beacons on downed aircraft to a maximum depth of 6,000 meters -LRB- 20,000 feet -RRB- -- will be placed aboard the French tugs . Watch challenges faced by search crews ''

Brazilian officials emphasized earlier this week that finding bodies was their main priority . The French are in charge of finding the voice and data recorders .

The first bodies were recovered about 320 kilometers -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- northwest of the Brazilian archipelago of Saint Peter and Saint Paul ; Tuesday 's recoveries were 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- away . See photos of bodies arriving at Fernando de Noronha ''

It was not clear whether the bodies had drifted in the 1-2 knot currents or whether their separation suggested that the jet may have broken apart in the air .

The location of the crash has not been determined , because ocean currents have moved the bodies and debris . The search area covers 200,000 square km -LRB- 77,220 square miles -RRB- , Brazilian officials said . Map of Flight 447 's flight path ''

The cause of the crash is still not known , but investigators are looking at the possible role of airspeed sensors known as Pitot tubes , among other factors . Did plane 's tail fin snap off ? ''

Air France has agreed to replace the sensors on its Airbus A330 and A340 jets , a pilots ' union said Tuesday .

Union spokesman Eric Derivry added that there is no indication that the Pitot tubes caused the accident .

Air France said over the weekend that it began to notice in May of last year that Pitot tubes sometimes briefly iced up at high altitude on A330s and A340s . That caused `` a loss of airspeed data , '' according to the airline -- that is , the pilots did n't know the plane 's speed .

Air France decided to replace all its probes starting April 27 , following laboratory tests earlier in the year , the airline said .
