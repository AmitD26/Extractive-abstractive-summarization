-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North West , the 1-year-old daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West , is already a social media darling due to her mom 's active presence on Instagram . Now the child 's new look is sparking some controversy online .

Recent photos of North wearing what appear to be diamond stud earrings have appeared online , sending the social media universe into overdrive .

Piercing Pagoda , a jewelry kiosk found in malls across America , has been piercing ears since 1969 , and its website boasts of 20 million piercings . Some parents opt to have their babies ' ears pierced at birth , but Piercing Pagoda offers services to children 2 months and older , provided they are with `` an identified parent or legal guardian , '' according to its site .

By then , `` your baby can have three tetanus shots , along with more mature earlobes , '' she said .

Swanson also recommends finding a pediatric office to do your child 's piercing as the staff there is trained in sterile technique and is likely to use a pain reliever or topical anesthetic .

It 's unclear where North received her piercing , or if it 's even a real piercing , but the procedure would be medically safe for a 1-year-old , according to Swanson .
