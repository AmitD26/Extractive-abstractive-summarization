The right side of Michelle Mack 's brain rewired itself to take over functions controlled by the left .

Born with only half a brain , Mack can speak normally , graduated from high school and has an uncanny knack for dates .

Mack 's parents , Carol and Wally , realized shortly after her birth that something was wrong .

Ten years ago , Dr. Jordan Grafman , chief of the Cognitive Neuroscience Section at the National Institutes of Health , finally diagnosed the problem . Watch how Mack 's brain healed itself ''

`` We were surprised to see the extent of the lesion in her brain , which basically took away the left side of her brain , '' said Grafman . `` There 's some very deep structures remaining , but the surface of her brain , the cortex is 95 percent gone and some of the deeper structures , structures that control movement , are missing . These are all structures that are important for movement , behavior , cognition . ''

`` Michelle has fairly normal language abilities , certainly basic language abilities , she can construct a sentence , she can understand instructions , she can find words when she 's talking , but actually she has some trouble in some aspects of visual-spatial processing , '' said Grafman .

`` It 's quite possible that in her learning , in her development , when the right hemisphere either took over or developed some of the language abilities that it cost her in some of the skills that are normally mediated by the right side of the brain , '' added Grafman .

The diagnosis explained why Mack had experienced a lifetime of difficulty controlling her emotions .

Mack will always have some problems , but dad Wally Mack said that Grafman 's diagnosis and treatment answered a lot of questions and gave him hope .

`` Dr. Grafman explained that the right hemisphere is taking over , and it might take her a little while longer to get there with all the rewiring that has to take place , '' he said . `` But that told us all these bad days are behind us and there are nothing but good days ahead . ''

Michelle Mack is now 37 and lives with her mother and father . She works from home doing data entry for her church . She is fairly independent , pays rent and can do most household chores . She realizes she 'll need help for the rest of her life but wanted to tell her story to make it clear that she is not helpless .
