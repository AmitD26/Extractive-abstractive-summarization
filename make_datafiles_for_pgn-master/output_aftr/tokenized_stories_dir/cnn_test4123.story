-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manor GP are to be rebranded Virgin Racing ahead of their Formula One debut next season .

Manor team chief John Booth and Virgin supremo Richard Branson are due to announce the long-awaited sponsorship tie-up on Tuesday .

The issue of the 13th entry remains unresolved , although Sauber are widely expected to be granted a place on next year 's grid following a meeting of the World Motor Sport Council in Monaco on December 11 .

`` I am very relieved about that development , '' the 66-year-old Swiss , who is hopeful the FIA will now look favorably on the team 's entry , told reporters .

`` It would have been a crying shame had one of the best Formula One factories closed down . Regarding the slot on the grid , I am very confident we will be given a final confirmation very shortly . ''

Speculation has surfaced of late regarding a potential takeover , yet it is unclear whether a buyer would automatically be granted an entry on the basis of Toyota 's signature on the Concorde .

`` An announcement will be made regarding this entry in due course . ''
