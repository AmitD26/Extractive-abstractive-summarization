PRETORIA , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The president of Athletics South Africa has admitted that he lied about gender tests on runner Caster Semenya before her gold-medal win at the World Athletics Championships last month .

Caster Semenya celebrates her gold at the world championships in Berlin .

But after South Africa 's Mail & Guardian newspaper printed e-mails on Friday showing that ASA President Leonard Chuene was aware of the tests , he held a news conference to apologize .

`` I now realize that it was an error of judgment and I would like to apologize unconditionally , '' Chuene said on Saturday , according to South Africa 's SAPA news agency .

But Chuene said he refused to do it because the sport 's international governing body did not request withdrawal . He also said withdrawing Semenya might have looked bad .

The e-mails printed by the Mail & Guardian are an exchange between team doctor Harold Adams and ASA General Manager Molatelo Malehopo , with Chuene copied in .

An e-mail response from Malehopo to Adams , sent the same day , says : `` I will suggest that you go ahead with the necessary tests that the IAAF might need . ''

The controversy over Semenya erupted after she crushed her rivals in the 800 meters and secured victory in one minute , 55.45 seconds -- the best women 's time in the world this year .

Semenya 's masculine build and dominant performance fueled existing questions about her gender , and the International Association of Athletics Federations -- which oversees the sport worldwide -- ordered tests on her .

South Africans have rallied behind Semenya , angrily dismissing reports about her gender . Semenya 's relatives and the South Africa team manager have maintained she is female .

This week , South Africa 's minister for women , children and people with disabilities wrote to the United Nations to complain that Semenya had not been treated in line with international protocols on gender and quality .

Noluthando Mayende-Sibiya sent a letter to the U.N. Division for the Advancement of Women , urging it to investigate , SAPA reported .

`` The questioning of her gender is based on a stereotypic view of the physical features and abilities attributable to women , '' she wrote in the letter , according to SAPA . `` Such stereotypes demonstrate the extent of patriarchy within the world 's sporting community . ''

There were too many uncertainties with mouth swabs , so the IAAF abandoned them in 1991 and the International Olympic Committee discontinued them in 2000 .
