The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan 's Darfur region to neighboring Chad , still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government .

This latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa .

Before the latest flight into Chad , the UNHCR and its partner groups `` were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country . '' Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting .

The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting . The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children .

The United Nations says `` more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces , rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed . ''
