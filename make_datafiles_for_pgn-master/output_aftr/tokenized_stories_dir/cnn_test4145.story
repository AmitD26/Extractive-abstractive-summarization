Federal workers and schoolchildren in the nation 's capital were told to stay home for a second consecutive day .

The National Weather Service predicted another 10 to 20 inches of snow for northern Virginia , eastern Maryland and Washington beginning Tuesday afternoon and continuing through Wednesday .

In last weekend 's blizzard , a record 32.4 inches of snow fell on Washington 's Dulles International Airport over two days , breaking the January 7-8 , 1996 , record of 23.2 inches .

If as severe as predicted , the new storm will be the third major snowfall to hit the nation 's capital and surrounding region in slightly more than seven weeks .

In Washington on Tuesday , out-of-towners Susan Martin and Robert Travers told CNN affiliate WJLA they had just flown to the city for a conference , but learned when they arrived that the conference had been canceled . Flights that would take them home from Reagan National Airport had been canceled , too .

`` We probably wo n't get a flight back out of here until Thursday . That 's what they 're telling us , '' Martin told WJLA .

Southwest Airlines was expecting to resume its normal schedule Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. , he said .

Travelers should confirm the status of their flights by checking their airline 's Web site before departing for the airport , he advised .

Snow causes more headaches for travelers

`` So , you can imagine , that 's costing even more , '' he said . `` We 've had people working around the clock . ''

The city , whose fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30 , generally budgets $ 790,000 annually for snow removal . That covers the costs of equipment , personnel , contractors , materials and supplies .

For the 2009 year ending in July , Routt said , the city spent only $ 485,000 .

All Washington National Guard full-time personnel were asked to report for duty Tuesday morning and expect to stay for two or three nights , helping with emergency response operations .

Elsewhere , crews worked 24-hour shifts to clear roads and repair power lines , warning that it might take days to restore electricity to some customers from Pennsylvania to Virginia .

Dave Swope , who has worked at Leinbach 's Hardware in Mount Penn for 25 years , said Tuesday he has never seen so many people wanting to fix their snowblowers at the same time .

`` We got people yesterday asking us how to start them , how to turn them on , '' Swope told WFMZ . `` They just have n't used them in years , and then the knowledge goes away . ''
