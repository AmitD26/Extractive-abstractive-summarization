-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A flat-faced frogfish , bug-eating slug and carnivorous sea sponge are some of the top new species named by scientists .

They appear on a `` top 10 '' list of new species released Saturday amid warnings from the United Nations that the world is not doing enough to protect vulnerable eco-systems .

`` Biodiversity loss is moving ecological systems ever closer to tipping point beyond which they will no longer be able to fulfill their vital functions , '' said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the International Day for Biological Diversity , which is being marked in 11 countries .

A report released in late April by researchers from the United Nations Environment Program showed that world leaders had failed on a 2002 commitment to reduce the global rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 .

It found that since 1970 animal populations had dropped 30 percent , the area covered by mangroves and sea grasses was down 20 percent and the coverage of living corals had fallen 40 percent .

A number of events were held around the world Saturday to mark the International Day of Biodiversity . A garden was created along Paris ' Champs-Elysees , children in Brazil were encouraged to dress up as animals , and the European Environment Agency unveiled a `` living wall '' at its headquarters in Copenhagen , Denmark .

The new discoveries include a golden orb spider able to spin webs of more than a meter in diameter . It is the first of its species named since 1879 .

`` Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth 's species is or the steady rate at which taxonomists are exploring that diversity , '' said Quentin Wheeler , director of the International Institute of Species Exploration .
