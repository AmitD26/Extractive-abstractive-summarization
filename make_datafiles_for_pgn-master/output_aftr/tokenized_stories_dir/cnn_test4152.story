-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request Thursday to temporarily stay the execution of death row inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner , who is set to die before a Utah firing squad early Friday .

The Supreme Court 's rejection ended the last legal maneuver for Gardner , 49 , who is scheduled to face execution shortly after midnight Friday -LRB- 2 a.m. ET -RRB- for the shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a Salt Lake City , Utah , courthouse . He would be only the third person to die by firing squad in the United States in 33 years .

`` Upon careful review , there is nothing in the materials provided this morning that has not already been considered and decided by the Board of Pardons and Parole or numerous courts , '' Herbert wrote in a letter to the attorneys rejecting the first appeal . `` Mr. Gardner has had a full and fair opportunity to have his case considered by numerous tribunals . ''

Gardner testified before the board he is a changed man , and his sentence should be commuted .

That was the issue before the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver , which concluded the clemency hearings were conducted fairly and did not violate the inmate 's civil rights .

He is set to become the third person to die by rifle fire , all in Utah , since the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976 . He had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot Burdell on April 2 , 1985 . He was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom , who was killed at the Salt Lake City bar where he was working to earn extra money .

The execution will be held at the Utah State Prison in Draper , about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City .

Corrections officials announced Gardner had consumed his last meal Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. , and has elected to fast prior to the anticipated execution . His dinner included steak , lobster , 7-Up , apple pie and vanilla ice cream .

As he awaited execution , Gardner watched the `` Lord of the Rings '' trilogy in an observational cell and read a novel by David Baldacci entitled `` Divine Justice , '' said Utah Department of Corrections spokesman Steve Gehrke .

In the hours before the scheduled execution , Gardner met with a bishop from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , Gehrke said .

State lawmakers made lethal injection the default capital punishment in 2004 , but at least three inmates who already had chosen the firing squad were grandfathered in under the new law .

The marksmen fire from a distance of 25 feet . The inmate is blindfolded , strapped to a chair and a target pinned to his chest .
