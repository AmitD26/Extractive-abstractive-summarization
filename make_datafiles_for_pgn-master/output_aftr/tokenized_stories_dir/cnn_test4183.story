He said Edwards ' work had created a market for human eggs and created problems of embryos being frozen , the news agency said .

Edwards , known as the `` father of the test tube baby , '' won the Nobel Prize for medicine on Monday .

`` As early as the 1950s , Edwards had the vision that IVF could be useful as a treatment for infertility , '' which affects about 10 percent of all couples worldwide , the committee said .

`` He worked systematically to realize his goal , discovered important principles for human fertilization , and succeeded in accomplishing fertilization of human egg cells in test tubes -LRB- or more precisely , cell culture dishes -RRB- . His efforts were finally crowned by success on 25 July , 1978 , when the world 's first ` test tube baby ' was born , '' the committee said .

His work has led to the birth of about four million babies , the committee said in praising his work .

The prize is worth 10 million Swedish kronor -LRB- about $ 1.5 million -RRB- .
