CAIRO , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 'm traveling with a chunk of gold -- the World Cup Trophy -- from Zurich , Switzerland to Cairo , Egypt .

CNN 's Ben Wedeman checks the World Cup is not getting a better seat than him .

When CNN Johannesburg Bureau Chief Kim Norgaard suggested I fly from Zurich to Cairo to cover the arrival of the World Cup trophy in Africa in the lead-up to the games in South Africa next summer , I thought he was joking .

But variety is the spice of journalism , you might say , and Kim is a friend with whom I needed to settle an old debt from Turkey , so I agreed to give it a try .

As it turned out I did n't have much time to prepare because someone broke into our house in Cairo the day before I was scheduled to depart . Rather than study World Cup football , I had to deal with the police , change locks , etc. .

Whoever it was did n't steal much , but here 's an odd aside : the thief left behind his -LRB- or hers ? -RRB- battered black running shoes , making off with my 15-year old son Christopher 's brand-new trainers . Preparing , perhaps , for a career in football ? Watch CNN 's journey with the World Cup . ''

The trophy is made of more than five kilograms of 18 carat gold , with two bands of malachite running around the bottom .

According to FIFA regulations , only heads of state and members of teams that won the World Cup have that privilege . The trophy 's guard can handle it , but must wear special white gloves .

But the trophy on tour in Africa is not the first -- it 's a replacement created after Brazil were allowed to keep the original when they won the tournament for a third time .

While on tour the trophy is under constant guard , though as we passed through security at Zurich Airport to board the charter flight to Cairo I saw it go through the x-ray machine -- a big black mass of metal on the screen .

The airport security personnel asked the guard to open the box , and that was the closest Christian or I came to it .

We resisted the urge to get our grubby hands all over it , however .

There is one African capital it probably wo n't be going to , however , and that 's Mogadishu , in Somalia . The city has been a battlefield on and off for the last 20 years , the airport often bombarded by mortars and artillery .

FIFA and Coca Cola have yet to officially turn down the request by the interim Somali government to bring the trophy to Mogadishu . If peace suddenly breaks out , they might actually do it .

If Italy had won there would have been celebratory chaos in the streets until sunrise , and my wife would have ended up delivering in the back seat of the car .

As it was , the streets were empty . Italy was in mourning . And I was relieved .
