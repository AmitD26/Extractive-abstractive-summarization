First Up : Egypt in Crisis

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-

BARBARA STARR , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT : With unrest now sweeping across Egypt and neighboring countries , new questions about whether it 's a security crisis here at the Pentagon . A quick look at the map tells you how deeply tied the U.S. military is to regimes across the Middle East and Persian Gulf .

In Egypt , the U.S. provides around $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid . In return , the U.S. gets vital military air , land and sea access . U.S. warships transit the Suez Canal on their way to and from the Persian Gulf . Loss of the canal could lead to catastrophic delays and a crisis .

In Yemen , where President Saleh is facing demonstrations and has already said he wo n't run for re-election , the U.S. has been quietly training Yemeni forces to go after a rising threat from al Qaeda . The U.S. has conducted drone and missile strikes inside Yemen . The question : will a new government cooperate with U.S. counterterrorism efforts ?

Three key Gulf allies provide other assistance . Qatar is home of the regional headquarters of the U.S. Central Command , which oversees the region and keeps a close eye on Iran . Kuwait is a staging area for U.S. troops moving in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq . And Bahrain is home to the U.S. Fifth Fleet , which patrols the Persian Gulf and pirate-infested waters off Somalia .

Is This Legit ?

AZUZ : In Super Bowl XLV yesterday , you saw it , the Packers and the Steelers . You know what happened in the game . We want to talk about the commercials ! Whether you thought these were good or bad , all of them had something in common . They were expensive . The average cost of a 30-second ad in this year 's Super Bowl was three million dollars .

One industry that was a big part of yesterday 's ads : car companies . Nine of them paid to run commercials . Some experts think that could be a good sign for the economy . Here 's why : If the companies are willing to spend millions for Super Bowl ads , it might mean they think viewers are willing to go out and buy the cars . And if people are willing to buy big items like that , that could mean people are feeling more confident about the economy .

Tree Octopus ?

AZUZ : Your teacher tells you about an endangered species : the tree octopus . Your assignment is to go learn more about the animal , and there 's a web site with all the information you need for your report . Only problem ? The entire thing is a hoax ! That really happened . The Department of Education sponsored a study run by researchers at the University of Connecticut . They set up this fake web site about the tree octopus filled with all kinds of facts . None of them true ; there is no such thing as tree octopus . The researchers wanted to see what kind of impact the internet can have on students ' ability to think critically . These were seventh graders . And not only did they accept all the facts on the web site as they were written , after the students were told it was all made up , some of them still refused to believe it was a hoax .
