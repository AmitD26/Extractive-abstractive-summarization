-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Real Madrid 's hopes of European success were boosted on Monday with the news that Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka have been passed fit for Tuesday 's first leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against English club Tottenham .

`` This is a match that a lot of people want to play in but are unable to , '' Mourinho told reporters on Monday . `` It has been several years since Real Madrid have played in the quarterfinals of the Champions League .

Tottenham have also been hit by injuries , but former France international William Gallas may make a surprise return from a knee problem to boost a defensive line-up lacking club captain Ledley King , Jonathan Woodgate , Younes Kaboul and Alan Hutton .

Mourinho loses long unbeaten record

Young Wales winger Gareth Bale is expected to return from a hamstring injury after training at the Bernabeu on Monday , and will give Spurs an attacking threat that was missing in the last-16 elimination of AC Milan .

`` I was one of the first people to say that Gareth Bale would be an excellent player , and I said it when he still was n't a familiar face in European football , '' Mourinho said .

`` I know he is a great player , but he is young and has a lot of room for improvement . I think he will be the best of the best . ''

Coach Harry Redknapp said his team have every chance of reaching the last four .

`` I do n't feel any pressure . No one expected us to be here at the start of the season and we have a big chance of winning , '' he told reporters . `` We are not just coming here to turn up . We want to keep progressing .

In Tuesday 's other quarterfinal first-leg tie , Mourinho 's former club Inter Milan continue their title defense against German club Schalke at the San Siro .

Schalke beat Inter on penalties in the 1997 UEFA Cup final at that venue , but go into the match with new coach Ralf Rangnick -- who failed to take the club past the group stage in 2005-06 in his first spell in charge .

Inter coach Leonardo has yet to win a Champions League match at home , and his side must bounce back from Saturday 's demoralizing 3-0 defeat in the Milan derby which put a big dent in Inter 's hopes of retaining the Serie A crown .

`` The way we qualified has brought confidence , proving that we never give up , '' the Brazilian said of his team 's elimination of Schalke 's fellow Germans Bayern Munich in the previous round .

Schalke 's last game against St. Pauli on Friday was called off after an assistant referee was hit by a full beer cup thrown from the crowd , but by that stage defender Christoph Metzelder had already broken his nose and Mario Gavranovic and Peer Kluge also picked up injuries .

Inter striker Diego Milito , a two-goal hero in last year 's final , returned from a two-month injury absence against AC Milan but the Argentine may again start on the bench .
