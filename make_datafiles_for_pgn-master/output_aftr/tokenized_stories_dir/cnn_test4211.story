-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a shaky videotape released Tuesday , the couple who kidnapped Jaycee Lee Dugard can be heard discussing how to operate their new camera as they zoom in to capture images of children in a playground .

In another , taken some years later , Phillip Garrido accompanies a parole agent who is searching their home as his wife , Nancy Garrido , films the search , mere yards from the outbuildings where Dugard is hidden .

Dugard and her children do not appear in the videos released Tuesday .

Dugard was just 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from the street in front of her South Lake Tahoe , California , home by Phillip Garrido , a convicted sex offender who had served 11 years for rape . Despite the fact that as a parolee he was regularly visited by police , he and his wife held Dugard and her daughters in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until 2009 .

A statement from Dugard , read by her mother at the sentencing hearing , called the Garridos `` evil '' and described her kidnapping by them as a `` sexual perversion . ''

Then , Phillip Garrido stands against a tree , and begins playing the guitar and singing while the camera pans to either side , pushing his face to the margins and centering on the children in the background .

`` You got me real good ? '' he asks at one point while barely on camera .

`` Yeah , '' she responds , `` I can see you really good . ''

Nancy Garrido appears onscreen briefly , affecting a grin .

`` Ma'am , you can come to the office and we 'll discuss that at an appropriate time , '' the parole agent responds . `` Right now I 'm doing a search , and I 'd really -- uh , if you 'll stay in this front room , then I do n't have to place you in restraints . ''

CNN 's Cameron Tankersley contributed to this report .
