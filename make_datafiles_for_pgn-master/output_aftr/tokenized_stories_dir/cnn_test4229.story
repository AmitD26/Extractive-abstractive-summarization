Golf 's Solheim Cup is the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup , but it has yet to garner such a big reputation , despite a rich history and intense competition over the years .

With this in mind , CNN gives the lowdown on a great sporting event that deserves your attention ...

From humble beginnings :

To trace the origins of the competition , we need to go back to 1959 and a garage in Redwood City , California .

From these humble beginnings , the world famous PING brand of golfing equipment was born .

The inaugural tournament , bearing Solheim 's name , was held in 1990 at the Lake Nona club in Florida . Two teams of eight players faced each other , with the American side running out comfortable winners 11 1/2 to 4 1/2 .

In 1996 the tournament was increased to 12 players per side , a number that stands to this day and it has become the leading team event in women 's golf , with players earning their place either through their own tour money lists , or as a captain 's pick -- exactly the same as in the men 's Ryder Cup .

Davies is a phenomenon in women 's golf . As well as her achievements on the course -- which include winning four majors amongst her 81 victories -- she has been a flag-bearer for promoting the game , most notably when , in 2004 , she became the first woman to compete on the men 's European Tour .

It did n't seem to hamper her game -- she won that particular tournament by four strokes !

Swedish legend Annika Sorenstam appeared in eight Solheim Cups , winning 22 of her 37 matches , while compatriot Sophie Gustafson , another member of the current side , and European captain Alison Nicholas have also starred in eight tournaments .

Breaking the mould :

The Solheim Cup has never really seen a player like Christina Kim before . Not only is the 27-year-old Californian a lucky charm for the United States , appearing in the winning teams of 2005 and 2009 -- claiming five out of eight points in the process -- her infectious personality , undiluted enthusiasm , larger-than-life character and wacky dress sense has been a highlight of recent competitions .

Kim is known for her bawdy sense of humor and occasional bouts of bad language that occasionally land her in hot water with golfing authorities .

Describing her fist-pumping celebrations in the 2009 Solheim Cup , former LPGA star Dottie Pepper wrote in a column for Sports Illustrated : `` I know Christina Kim loves the galleries and is a ham , but she should be a little more respectful of the game . In the NFL , she would have been given 18 excessive celebration penalties . ''

Chaos and controversy :

Scotland 's Catriona Matthew secured victory for Europe on the 17th green , resulting in wild scenes of celebration .

However , there were still quite a few singles matches still out on the course , including Norway 's Suzann Pettersen against American Cristie Kerr .

Kerr missed the putt and Pettersen won the hole . But , sensing her opponent 's annoyance , Pettersen turned to Kerr on the 16th green and conceded the match , before joining the European celebrations .

The same thing happened between the aforementioned Laura Davies and opponent Meg Mallon on the 14th hole but , as the match was all square , the pair both walked up to the tournament referee to concede at the same time , causing confusion .

The Beth Daniel-Mhairi McKay match also came to an abrupt end with the score in the balance resulting in American captain Patty Sheehan telling reporters : `` I have never seen that before . All of a sudden , everyone just quit . It was n't quite right . ''

Appropriately enough , as the tournament is in Ireland this year , the Solheim Cup trophy is made of Waterford Crystal glass , which originates just down the coast from the Killeen Castle resort .

Following the men :

The competition is now a complete mirror image of the men 's prestigious Ryder Cup , involving the same amount of players , format , points on offer and rivalry .

But with the American team bidding for a fourth successive victory , the pressure is on for the Europeans to stop the rot , especially as another defeat will increase the clamor for the tournament to be changed to allow Asian players to compete .

The change completely altered the nature of the event , making it closer and more exciting . Another American victory , taking their overall lead to 9-3 , will certainly intensify that particular debate .
