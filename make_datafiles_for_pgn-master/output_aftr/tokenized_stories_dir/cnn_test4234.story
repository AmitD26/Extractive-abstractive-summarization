Dreamworks Animation 's `` Puss in Boots '' was the top cat this weekend , clawing its way to a $ 34 million debut , 51 percent of which came from 3-D screens , and 7 percent of which was from IMAX theaters . On paper , that number sounds good -- and , to be clear , it is by no means a disaster -- but the result comes with a `` Real Steel '' - ish caveat . `` Puss in Boots '' cost $ 130 million to produce , and it earned Dreamworks ' third-worst debut for a computer animated film , beating only `` Flushed Away '' and `` Antz , '' which started with $ 18.8 million and $ 17.2 million , respectively . The 3-D `` Shrek '' - spinoff , cost as much as Dreamworks ' `` Megamind , '' which opened in early November 2010 , but that film began with $ 46 million , and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $ 148.4 million total .

Johnny Depp 's latest , `` The Rum Diary , '' stumbled out of the gate with just $ 5 million . `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' this was not . The disappointing opening fell in line with Depp 's other substance abuse picture , 1998â € ² s `` Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas , '' which debuted to $ 3.3 million and earned $ 10.7 million total . `` The Rum Diary 's '' edgy story was always going to be a tough sell , and FilmDistrict 's President of Theatrical Distribution Bob Berney admits : `` While we all wish the numbers were better , we 're proud of the film and its loving tribute to Hunter S. Thompson . ''

The $ 50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict , the young distributor that found success with Insidious -LRB- $ 54 million -RRB- earlier this year . The studio has since struggled with both `` Do n't Be Afraid of the Dark '' -LRB- $ 23.9 million -RRB- and `` Drive '' -LRB- $ 33.7 million so far -RRB- recently . Unfortunately for FilmDistrict , audiences , which were 88 percent above the age of 25 , gave `` The Rum Diary '' a harsh `` C '' CinemaScore grade , so it 's not likely to hold well in future weeks . Talk about a bad hangover ...

In limited release , Sony 's Shakespeare tale `` Anonymous '' started with $ 1 million out of 256 theaters . That was good enough for a $ 3,774 per theater average , which does not merit huge expansions in the coming weeks . Young romance `` Like Crazy '' fared better , grossing $ 120,000 out of only 4 theaters , resulting in a $ 30,000 average . Richard Gere 's latest , `` The Double , '' was D.O.A. , pulling in only $ 27,545 out of 11 theaters . It 's not likely to platform much further . Zeitgeist-y Wall Street thriller `` Margin Call '' continued to play fairly well , grossing $ 713,000 out of 140 theaters . It has earned $ 1.5 million so far .
