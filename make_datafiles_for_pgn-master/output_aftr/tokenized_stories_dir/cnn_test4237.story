Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The federal government recovered almost $ 4.1 billion stolen in health care fraud schemes during fiscal year 2011 , Obama administration officials announced Tuesday . The figure is up 58 percent from 2009 .

`` We 're regaining the upper hand in our fight against health care fraud , '' said Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .

The numbers are contained in the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program Annual Report , which is sent to Congress .

Holder and Sebelius credited their Medicare Fraud Strike Force teams for tracking down crime in areas with `` hot spots '' of unexplained Medicare billing . The strike forces include prosecutors and investigators from the FBI , the Justice Department and the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General .

Health care fraud has attracted both organized crime organizations and street gangs , according to Kevin Perkins , the FBI 's assistant director for the Criminal Investigative Division .

`` We 're making an impact , '' Perkins said .

Sebelius said aggressively pursuing health care fraud is a great investment .

`` Over the last three years , for every dollar we 've spent , we 've put more than seven dollars back in the hands of American taxpayers , '' she said . The money goes into the Medicare Trust Fund , the U.S. Treasury and state treasuries .
