-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You just ca n't tell with Rupert . According to his friends -- and there are still many in journalism , even if British politicians are for once giving him a very wide berth -- this is Rupert Murdoch at his back-to-the-wall , defiant , unpredictable best : pulling rabbits out of hats , raising rock-bottom morale and announcing the launch of a new Sunday tabloid to replace the defunct News of the World . And not just `` some time soon , '' but this coming Sunday .

According to his enemies -- and there are still as many of those as there have ever been -- this is Rupert at his cynical , death-defying , manipulative worst , seeking to convince the world that his Augean Stables have been swept clean and that his commitment to tabloid newsprint remains undimmed , even as rumors abound of more imminent arrests of Sun journalists for bribing police and other public officials .

So is the Sun on Sunday a last hurrah or a phoenix from the ashes ? Probably a bit of both . There is no question that the announcement of its launch , coupled with reinstatement of those journalists who had been suspended following their arrests -LRB- unless and until charged -RRB- , has raised morale at Murdoch 's Wapping base in London . Proof , they say , that he still has newspaper ink running through his veins and -- while still committed to rooting out past criminal activity -- is intent on demonstrating that there is still a market for good , old-fashioned , raucous , tub-thumping Sunday tabloid journalism .

For anyone who cares about journalism -- and jobs for journalists -- that must be good news .

But even the less cynical must be asking themselves a difficult question about the new creation : Since it wo n't be paying private investigators for confidential information , or putting celebrities under surveillance , or hacking phones for gossip , or covertly paying police officers for scoops , what sort of newspaper will emerge from Wapping ? And in a market of declining circulations , where the Sun brand is in danger of becoming almost as tainted as its now deceased News of the World sister , will it really make its owner any money ?

Perhaps Rupert really does n't care that much , and really does want to indulge his favorite child while demonstrating that even at the age of 80 he can still run a successful newspaper . And perhaps he still sees his newspapers as the route to that political clout that he had become accustomed to wielding so effortlessly in Britain and which -- conceivably -- may not be quite as enervated as some commentators assume and most detractors hope .

The Sun is currently selling around 2.7 million copies a day , slightly less than the 2.8 million circulation of the News of the World when it closed . Like all British newspapers -- and especially the tabloids -- it is on a steep downward curve : Ten years ago , the Sun was selling 3.5 million and the News of the World over 4 million .
