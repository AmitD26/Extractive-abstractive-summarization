Its automotive industry is among the most successful in Europe , and stands as the third largest in the world .

But with an aging population , the country is struggling to meet the demand for a skilled workforce which can continue to propel manufacturing forward .

Cue the `` Factory of the Future '' , a 17,000 square foot innovation hub in the city of Chemnitz where researchers experiment with new technologies and machinery in a bid to improve the production process .

`` The processes we are developing today are so much more complex , '' says Professor Dirk Landgrebe , director of the institute . `` The machines and resources are so much more sophisticated that we will need qualified people to handle these processes in the future , '' he adds .

Virtual training

To ensure future workers are fully prepared , the lab has created a state of the art virtual environment where potential employees can test out the new technologies and intelligent systems that are set to form the building blocks of German industry .

Employees enter a 3D room which can take on the appearance of a factory or even a piece of equipment .

Fraunhofer Institute , the brains of the `` Factory of the Future '' operation , is part of the 70 institutions committed to researching and developing new ways to enhance Germany 's industrial landscape . The German government is also involved in funding work that will eventually form the infrastructure of German production .

`` Our task at Fraunhofer is to bring as much of our research as possible straight into industrial production , '' says Matthia Putz , director at Fraunhofer Institute .
