Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a city slashed by war , a tiger fights for life .

Osama , a Siberian tiger at the Tripoli Zoo , has been suffering for days . He is on his side , breathing shallowly , his huge paws motionless -- caramel , black-and-white-striped fur covered with flies that he is too weak to brush off .

A team of animal-welfare experts from Austria 's Four Paws International gently rolls the tiger over and Dr. Amir Khalil , dripping sweat , searches for a vein , then puts in an IV drip to give the animal vitamins .

Shells still litter the zoo grounds . As the zoo 's director , Dr. Abdulfatah Husni , leads a CNN crew to the mammal house , he points out bullet casings on the sidewalk . `` This is for Kalashnikov . You know Kalashnikov ? '' he asks , referring to automatic rifles .

In the mammal house , the roof is marred by a a gaping hole blasted by a rocket propelled grenade . Luckily , no animal died or was injured .

For two weeks there was no water in much of Tripoli . For the hippos at the zoo , it was a disaster .

Even as fighters shot it out on the streets near the zoo , 15 members of the staff came in every day to feed and water the animals , risking their own lives ; if they had n't , many of the animals would have died within three to four days , Husni says .

In the tiger house , meanwhile , the animal rescue team still struggles to save Osama the tiger . Dr. Khalil rushed here from Vienna to help after seeing CNN reports about the fate of these animals . He grows more quiet as his efforts seem to have little effect .

He hopes the project will continue and says the new anti-Gadhafi transitional leaders pledge to give the zoo support .
