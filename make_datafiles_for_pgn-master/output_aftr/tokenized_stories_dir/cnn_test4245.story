-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal officials say a plane crash that killed 265 people was caused in part by a rudder system design featured in various Airbus models .

American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in a residential area of Belle Harbor , New York , soon after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on November 12 , 2001 .

All 260 people onboard died , along with five people on the ground .

According to a recommendation issued this week by the National Transportation Safety Board , the plane 's vertical stabilizer likely separated because of `` the first officer 's unnecessary and excessive rudder pedal inputs . ''

Two families of Airbus planes use a system design that limits available rudder pedal deflection as airspeed decreases , according to the safety board .

The safety board notes the circumstances of flight 587 are similar to a 2008 accident involving an Airbus Industrie A319 . Air Canada Flight 190 experienced `` in-flight upset '' and landed in Calgary . Three passengers suffered serious injuries .

Safety board officials recommended the European Aviation Safety Agency review options for modifying some Airbus planes `` to provide increased protection from potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs . ''
