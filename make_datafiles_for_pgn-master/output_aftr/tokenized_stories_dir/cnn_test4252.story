-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On New Year 's Eve , husband and wife Tripp and Jessica Johnson will be wearing orange and blue and cheering their team in the Chick-fil-A Bowl -- from opposite sides of the stadium .

The two first met in neutral territory , New York , when they both found themselves at a place known as the `` Auburn Bar '' to watch a game . Jessica went by choice , but Tripp was tagging along with a friend .

With bowl season in full swing , there will definitely be friends and families divided by the Rose , Orange , Sugar and Fiesta bowls and ultimately the BCS National Championship Game . No rivalry is worth starting a long-standing feud in the family , but it 's fun to get into the spirit of collegiate loyalties .

Because of the holidays and his dad 's 60th birthday , Tripp 's family is coming to town for the game . All of Tripp 's siblings also went to UVA , so they bought tickets for the whole family . Jessica responded in kind by buying tickets so she can sit with her family on the Auburn side of the stadium .

`` Neither of us are very good losers , '' she said . `` And that can make people pretty miserable . ''

If Virginia wins , her husband will bring it up `` forever . '' `` If Auburn wins , I 'll be a little mean that night , but Auburn really should beat them , '' she said . `` If they do n't , I 'll be embarrassed . ''

Growing up in Alabama , her family watched all of the ` Bama games . But when Betsy was accepted to Auburn , things began to change . Her brothers followed suit , and soon Betsy , her father and her siblings were on the orange and blue side of the divide , while her mother and grandfather swore by the Crimson Tide .

In the Southeastern Conference , rivalries divide houses and run deep in family blood . Auburn and Alabama play each other every year in the Iron Bowl -- the week of Thanksgiving .

So each year , Betsy 's mother goes the Alabama alumni bar to watch the game , while Betsy , her brothers and father go to the Auburn alumni bar . During halftime , whoever is losing has to visit the other bar and `` eat it '' for a little while .

`` It may be Thanksgiving , but I 'm going to talk back to my mom ! '' Betsy said , laughing .

Family will still be family , tensions will ease after the Iron Bowl , and the jokes and jabbing will be swapped in good fun .

Because Virginia and Auburn have conflicting game times during the regular season , Jessica and Tripp managed to find a bar near their home in San Francisco that would broadcast both . As Jessica watched Auburn lose to the University of Georgia this year , Tripp was enjoying a game of UVA vs. Duke University .

He invited her to come watch his game because Virginia was faring well .

Despite Auburn 's possible defeat , Jessica let him know that she `` did n't care about his stupid game . ''
