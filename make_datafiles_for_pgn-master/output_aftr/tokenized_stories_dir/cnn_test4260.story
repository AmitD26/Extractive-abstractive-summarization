Havana , Cuba -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pope Benedict XVI arrived in Cuba 's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba on Monday , delivering Mass before throngs of Cubans in only the second papal visit in the island 's history .

With a red carpet rolled out to meet the pope 's airplane , Castro walked beside the pontiff to a pair of large wooden chairs . A brass band played Cuba 's national anthem and other tunes as they stood together , while artillery rounds were fired off nearby in celebration .

Benedict told the audience that he seeks to emphasize `` the importance of faith , '' highlighting the need for good relations between the church and the Marxist state .

Castro welcomed Benedict , saying his country has endeavored for peace and justice , but noted that even `` 14 years after John Paul 's visit , '' the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba persists .

Clad all in white , Benedict walked with Castro , who was dressed in a dark suit , and greeted other state officials and clergy .

Crowds of flag-waving Cubans lined the street on which Benedict 's motorcade traveled , as Cuban state television captured both ground and aerial footage of the trip .

His first stop was in Mexico , where he denounced violence in that country brought by the ongoing drug wars . Benedict also blasted Cuba 's Marxist political system Friday , saying it `` no longer corresponds to reality . ''

The pope is scheduled to meet again with Castro and Ortega in Havana , along with the president 's family , which could include Fidel Castro , who stepped down from power in 2006 after battling illness .

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez also arrived on the island Saturday , according to Cuban state television , which reported he is there to undergo further radiation treatment for cancer .

Large crowds are expected . Preparations for the visit have included fresh coats of paint splashed across buildings and posters announcing the pope 's arrival tacked on city structures .

`` For me , I 'm very happy he 's coming , '' said Juana DeArmas , a shopkeeper in the capital 's Old Havana neighborhood . `` I was here when -LRB- Pope -RRB- John Paul came , and there were always plenty of tourists that followed . ''

The visit is seen as a possible tourism boost to the island 's cash-strapped economy as many residents seek to make use of a series of recent free market reforms that have slowly swelled the number of private businesses in the country .

Fourteen years earlier , a much different Fidel Castro greeted a much different pontiff when thousands were introduced to Pope John Paul II , who made the historic first papal trip to Cuba in 1998 .

Decades earlier , Castro 's Communist revolution sought to stamp out religious influence in Cuba , confiscating church property and expelling religious workers , some of whom had supported anti-Castro forces .

The country was officially atheist until the 1990s , when the constitution was amended and references to atheism were replaced with secularism . Christmas was recognized as a holiday at that time and Communist Party members were permitted to openly practice their faith , if they had one .

Church officials now say the island is about 60 % Catholic , though few openly practice .

`` These papal visits can have an impact , '' Allen said . `` They can kind of jar things lose . And it seems that under Raul , Cuba is taking baby steps toward normalization . ''

But many on the island seem skeptical that the trip will yield lasting results .

While the country 's Roman Catholic Church has often been lauded for its role in recent reforms , it has also received heavy criticism for appearing too cozy with the government . Rights group say the nation has largely emptied its jails of political prisoners , and yet it continues to harass the country 's activists .
