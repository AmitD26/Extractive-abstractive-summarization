Mohammed was killed , but to begin with the Somali security forces had no idea who he was . Only when they discovered cell phones , a South African passport , a substantial amount of cash and a laptop did they realize this was someone of significance . So his body -- which had been rapidly buried -- was exhumed , according to Somali military officials . A sample of his DNA was sent to Nairobi , where U.S. officials confirmed it was Mohammed . They had taken DNA samples from his wife and children some years ago .

The other man in the vehicle may also have been a senior al-Shabaab figure by the name of Musa Dheere , according to Kenyan officials . Somali officials have not publicly announced the identity of the second man .

Operationally , Mohammed was one of al Qaeda 's most effective figures : a bombmaker with aliases , multiple passports and disguises that enabled him to move in and out of Somalia . The forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from South Africa , according to Somali officials .

He is held responsible for making al-Shabaab 's attacks more lethal in recent years , using an influx of foreign fighters and suicide bombings . Several hundred foreign jihadists -- from Kenya , Sudan , Europe , North America , Iraq and Pakistan -- have made al-Shabaab a more effective group . Several of the foreign jihadists have come from the United States , with at least two -LRB- one from Minneapolis and one from Seattle -RRB- carrying out suicide bombings . Mohammed was also reputed to have developed ties with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , based in Yemen across the Red Sea .

`` Fazul Mohammed was certainly one of the key members of the al Qaeda old guard , '' says Candyce Kelshall of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham in England . That structure is `` now fragmented and splintered into stand-alone operating networks that are loosely linked by association around the world , '' she says .

Ironically , the Kampala bombings may have indirectly contributed to Mohammed 's death . They prompted Uganda to inject more manpower into Mogadishu . And a recent offensive by Somali troops backed by AMISOM firepower has pushed al-Shabaab out of several districts of the capital -- for now . Mohammed appears not to have been familiar with the latest frontlines .

The United States has had some success in tracking down al Qaeda militants in Somalia -- with special forces killing Saleh Ali Nabhan two years ago . Nabhan had been involved in simultaneous attacks against Israeli tourists in Kenya in 2002 , involving a suicide bombing at a Mombasa hotel and an attempt to bring down an Israeli airliner with a SAM-7 missile .

But gathering useful intelligence in a country as large and anarchic as Somalia is an uphill struggle . And the transitional government is invariably preoccupied with clan-driven power struggles rather than taking on al-Shabaab . In recent days , a confrontation between the president and prime minister has spilled over into deadly street protests .

Mohammed 's death may deprive Shabaab of some of its international reach . His ability to move in and out of Somalia was important to the group 's ambitions to spread jihad throughout east Africa .

Kelshall says al-Shabaab `` has come of age -- its young tactical leaders are possibly more potent , more technically savvy and politically astute than any of the other networks . ''

And al-Shabaab does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by Mohammed 's death . Two days after he was killed , Somalia 's interior minister was assassinated at his home by a female suicide bomber . Al-Shabaab quickly claimed responsibility .
