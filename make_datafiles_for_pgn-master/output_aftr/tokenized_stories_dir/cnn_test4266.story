-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the roaring stopped , when the debris stopped whirling and the glass stopped breaking , the 4-foot wooden cross remained on the wall .

It was a fixture in the emergency department waiting room of St. John 's Mercy Hospital in Joplin , Missouri , a symbol of the hospital 's Catholic roots and , perhaps , a comfort to the sick and injured who sought help there .

Windows were blown out . Cars were hurled in the parking lot like toys , piled near the emergency room entrance . Gurneys were thrown blocks away . In parts of the hospital parking lot and in a parking lot just to the west , 200 - to 300-pound concrete parking stops , fastened into the asphalt with rebar , were lifted and tossed up to 180 feet , the weather service said .

The hospital 's helicopter lay crumpled , some distance away from its pad . X-rays from St. John 's were found in driveways in Dade County , Missouri , about 70 miles away . The building looked as if it had been bombed .

`` The houses are all gone , '' Sara Ferguson , who was near the hospital when the storm struck , told The Joplin Globe newspaper at the time . `` The medical buildings are gone . -LRB- The hospital -RRB- windows have all been blown out . It was horrible . I could n't even take pictures on my phone . I was crying . ''

The hospital was very nearly the only structure in the immediate area left standing , albeit severely damaged .

Hospital officials swung into action almost immediately . About 183 patients and 200 staffers were evacuated from the building . Triage centers were set up outside . Other hospitals in the area opened their doors for St. John 's patients and others who had been injured . Doctors and nurses rushed to the scene .

Across Joplin , people were also pulling together . The injured were transported to hospitals on doors in the back of pickup trucks . Businesses loaded trucks with donations . Restaurants helped provide food to those in need .

That same day , St. John 's was beginning to see patients in a tent facility set up across the parking lot . Built to withstand 100-mph winds , the facility had an emergency department , surgical suites , MRI and CT scan capabilities , a pharmacy and 60 inpatient beds , the hospital said .

A modular hospital has since taken the place of the tent , said St. John 's spokeswoman Miranda Lewis , and a more permanent structure was built nearby . The structure can be moved , and can be used to upgrade other facilities after St. John 's moves into its new home , she said .

In the days after the tornado , Mercy was `` a blessing , '' Shaw said . They continued paying their employees , he said , and set up the temporary facilities . `` You have to admire that they did n't let it defeat them . ''

Typically , a building so large would be imploded . But underground lead mines made that an impossibility for St. John 's .

`` Joplin traces its roots back to the early miners who settled here in the late 1800s , '' said Dan O'Connor , the demolition project manager , in the statement . `` As is the case in many places throughout the city , those mines were filled in to make way for growth . While they can be made safe to build on , we do n't want to take any chances that demolition charges and crashing debris could create an uplift pressure that might cause damage to surrounding properties . ''

Instead , a wrecking ball will demolish the hospital 's west tower , and grappling equipment will be used to take down the east tower . The demolition process should take about six weeks , officials said .

But before it began , crews searched the hospital for anything in good condition -- Bibles , artwork , memorial plaques , stained glass and marble . Teams began cleaning out and salvaging in December , the hospital said .

Three time capsules were recovered -- one buried when the current hospital was built in 1968 , one when the east tower was completed in the 1980s and a third that marked St. John 's 100th anniversary in Joplin in 1996 .

And , of course , the cross .

Other pieces -- plastic piping from the sprinkler system , windows -- will be studied and tested to see how they weathered the storm .

Meanwhile , officials are making efforts to limit the amount of debris that winds up in landfills from the demolition . Steel , aluminum and copper from the buildings is being salvaged and recycled , hospital officials said . Concrete and asphalt will be crushed into small pieces and used as backfill to ready the site for redevelopment .

`` The devastation from the tornado was bad enough , '' said John Farnen , executive director of planning , design and construction for Mercy . `` We really want to take all the measures possible to care for this site throughout the demolition process . ''

After the buildings are torn down , the land will be readied for development by Mercy . Twelve acres have been donated to the Joplin school district for a new elementary school that will replace two schools destroyed by the tornado ; construction is set to begin in May .

`` The future is just so bright , '' Shaw said , as Joplin 's new hospital will be `` one of the most up-to-date facilities in the country . ''

Asked what the ceremonies might mean to Joplin residents , he said , `` Maybe the word is ` hope . ' ''

`` To me , you can dwell on all the debris , or you can think about what 's going to rise up out of the debris , '' Shaw said . `` I kind of have a tendency to want to concentrate on the future . ''
