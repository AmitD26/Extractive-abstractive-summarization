-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health coverage is easy to get if you 're healthy . The problem is when you 're sick or have a history of illness .

The patient protections enacted into law in 2010 are changing that , enabling more Americans to afford lifesaving care . These protections provide patients with the best chance to beat their illness . When fully implemented in 2014 , they will require insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions , eliminate dollar limits on the coverage a patient can receive and ban the practice of inflating premiums for people with health concerns .

Opinion : Health reform could survive loss of individual mandate

Our organizations , which represent tens of millions of people across the country with life-threatening chronic diseases , together submitted a friend-of-the-court brief asserting that the individual responsibility provision is essential to preserving the protections that patients desperately need and deserve .

We already know what a health care system without such a requirement looks like : Many healthy Americans opt not to buy health coverage until they are ill , and costs skyrocket as insurance pools fill with people in urgent need of treatment and care . People with pre-existing conditions are charged exorbitant rates for health coverage , putting critical care out of reach for many American families . As a result , many people with a chronic illness must resort to emergency room care , which lowers their chances of surviving their illness and drives up costs system-wide .

Many of those who want the individual responsibility requirement struck down also express support for the patient protections that the provision makes possible . Several states have tried such an approach by enacting insurance protections for patients with pre-existing conditions without compelling healthy people to enter the insurance market as well . These states are now among the most expensive in the country in which to buy insurance , and two of them , Kentucky and New Hampshire , ended up repealing those protections because of increasingly unaffordable premiums .
