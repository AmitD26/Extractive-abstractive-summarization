-LRB- Rolling Stone -RRB- -- On a recent afternoon in Toronto , Queen 's Roger Taylor was checking out rehearsals for Queen Extravaganza -- a 25-date tribute tour with a lineup hand-selected by him and his bandmate , guitarist Brian May -- when singer Marc Martel belted out a few notes from `` Bohemian Rhapsody , '' stopping the 62-year-old drummer in his tracks .

`` We had such a fantastic response , '' said Taylor . `` We were n't just looking for copies of us . We were looking for great musicianship , great charisma and the right people , the right sort of personalities that fit into the band . What we were n't looking for were lookalikes . ''

The tribute tour is just one of the projects that Queen have planned for 2012 . Taylor and May will also play five Queen shows in Europe later this year with singer Adam Lambert on lead vocals . According to Taylor , Queen will perform in Moscow , Ukraine and London . He described the Ukraine show as a `` very big outdoor '' co-headlining gig with Elton John ; the London gigs will take place at the Hammersmith Apollo .

`` We were hoping to do a festival in London , but for various reasons that did n't happen , '' Taylor said .

Lambert , who performed with Taylor and May on the 2009 `` American Idol '' finale , has long been on the duo 's radar . `` Brian and I have seen quite a lot of his shows , '' Taylor added .

The Extravaganza , Taylor said , was conceived as a way to present Queen 's music as the band originally intended . Complex tunes like `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' will finally be performed in their entirety .

`` We will be able to do what we could n't do before -- all the harmonies , all the little parts we put onto the record , '' said Taylor . `` This will give us the tools to do that . ''

`` I do n't want our music to be represented in any average kind of way , '' Taylor said . `` We look to excel with this and really teach other bands how to really do a show properly . ''

While Martel 's vocal resemblance to Mercury is striking , Taylor noted that there 's no replacing Queen 's iconic singer , who died in 1991 . And Taylor firmly dismissed the notion that he would ever perform with a `` hologram '' of Mercury , the way that Dr. Dre did with one of Tupac Shakur at Coachella .

`` I do n't want to sit up here with a hologram of my dear friend , '' said Taylor . `` Were somebody to use a hologram of Freddie , I do n't think I would have an objection . But I do n't want to . It just did n't sit too well with me .

`` When Freddie died , we were in shock , '' continued Taylor . `` And it did n't go away for five years . We would have probably remained together . We were very tight and very close . We never saw the need to break up . I think he 'd love -LRB- these shows -RRB- . I think he would have been really flattered . He would have loved the idea of keeping our musical flag flying . Brian and I always sort of imagine he 's in the room . ''
