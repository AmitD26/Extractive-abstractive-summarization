Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday said it was studying a federal judge 's order that it consider withdrawing two popular antibiotics from use in livestock .

In a ruling issued Thursday , U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz said that the FDA must issue notices to drug manufacturers that the drugs will be withdrawn unless the companies can prove they 're safe . Katz did n't issue a full ban -- suggesting the manufacturers should be given a hearing to make their case .

The suit was originally brought by the Natural Resources Defense Council , which argued that the FDA has allowed livestock producers to use popular antibiotics penicillin and tetracycline in feed for more than 30 years for purposes other than treatment of illnesses .

The NRDC claims `` the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in animal feed can lead to the growth and spread of drug-resistant bacteria capable of infecting people . '' Antibiotic resistant bacteria are fast-moving , can be deadly , and can infect otherwise healthy individuals .

In subsequent years , new medical evidence suggested that treating livestock with antibiotics increased risks to human health . But according to the judge 's ruling , the FDA never changed its position .

In May , two petitions circulated urging the FDA to finish what it started in 1977 . When the FDA did n't respond , the NRDC filed suit .

Meanwhile , the ruling is n't sitting well with beef producers . The National Cattlemen 's Beef Association noted its dissent in a statement saying its members were `` disappointed with the decision , '' and that practices include the `` judicious use of antibiotics to prevent , control and treat any cattle health issues . ''

If drug manufacturers fail to show that using the antibiotics in livestock is safe , the FDA commissioner must issue a withdrawal order . But the judge noted that if the drugs are deemed safe , the FDA can not withdraw them from use .
