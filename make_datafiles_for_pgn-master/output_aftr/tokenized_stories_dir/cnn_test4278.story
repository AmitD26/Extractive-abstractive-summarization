Players pray for Muamba 's recovery

Muamba , who is from the Democratic Republic of Congo and has represented England at under-21 level , fell to the ground in the 41st minute with no other players near him .

Referee Howard Webb consulted both teams before calling off the match at Tottenham 's home ground in London , which was a quarterfinal tie in England 's prestigious knockout competition , the FA Cup .

A member of CNN World Sport 's London staff was at the match at White Hart Lane and described the situation .

`` We realized quite quickly that this was serious because the medical staff all rushed on and they were waved onto the field by the Tottenham players . From what we saw they were trying to resuscitate Fabrice Muamba . ''

Muamba 's peers have been quick to show their support on micro-blogging website Twitter .

`` For all those asking , I know as much as you do , '' wrote clubmate Stuart Holden , a U.S. international . `` Waiting anxiously for updates from teammates . Fab is a fighter ! prayforMuamba . ''

There have been two similar incidents more recently in Spain , involving Sevilla 's Antonio Puerta in 2007 and Espanyol 's Daniel Jarque in 2009 .

Muamba grew up in Kinshasa , the capital of what was then known as Zaire . After moving to the UK in 1999 he began his football career with Premier League club Arsenal in 2005 but did not make a first-team appearance in the top division and was loaned out to Birmingham .

`` Fabrice has played 33 times for England Under-21s , captaining Stuart Pearce 's side during this time , and is a player -- and more importantly -- a person we care greatly for , '' Bernstein said .

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore praised those at the game for the way they reacted to the situation .

Those sentiments were echoed by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy , who in a club statement , thanked both sets of fans for their support and behavior .

Levy said : `` Too often we read the negatives about football and yet last night , at a time of intense emergency and uncertainty , we saw the true humanity and empathy of the footballing family . ''
