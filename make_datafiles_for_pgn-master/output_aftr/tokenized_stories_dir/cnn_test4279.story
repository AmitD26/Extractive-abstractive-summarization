Turkey moves forces to Syrian border amid tensions , official says

However , the relations surprisingly changed for the better in the first decade of the new century . Bashar al-Assad , who replaced his father in 2000 , seemed to promise a more open and friendly Syria . In Turkey , the Justice and Development Party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan , which came to power in 2002 , initiated a foreign policy of `` zero problems with neighbors . '' This led to a fruitful Turkish-Syrian rapprochment : Erdogan and Assad became friends , trade between the two countries was boosted , and borders were opened for visa-free travel . Just two years ago , the two countries looked like the core states of a would-be Middle Eastern Union modeled after the EU .

But this honeymoon came to an abrupt end with the Arab Spring . The Erdogan government , whose claims include democratizing Turkey by saving it from the tutelage of the country 's overbearing military , intuitively sympathized with and announced support for this democratic wave in the region . Yet while this proved to be a winning game in Tunisia , Egypt and Libya , Syria turned out to be a tougher case .

Inside Turkey , this engagement in the Syrian crisis has supporters and critics . The supporters are mostly Sunni conservatives who strongly identify with the Syrian opposition , which include the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood . -LRB- The massacre of thousands of Sunnis in Hama in 1982 by Hafez Assad had been a tragic memory in the minds of these conservative Turks , who now believe that the Syrian leopard has simply not changed its spots . -RRB-

Other voices in Turkey , ranging from hardcore secularists to pro-Iranian marginal Islamists , accuse the government for being naively involved in a conflict cooked up by `` Western imperialists . ''

The Turkish government said the plane violated the Syrian airspace `` mistakenly and very briefly '' but was hit by a Syrian missile despite immediately having reverted to international airspace . The plane 's two pilots , who apparently fell to the sea , are missing .

The Turkish reaction to the incident was outlined by Erdogan in an address in the parliament that came four days after the incident . In a very strident tone against the `` bloody dictator of Syria , '' Erdogan announced that Turkey now sees its southern neighbor as a `` clear and present danger '' and will change its rules of engagement : `` Any military element that approaches the Turkish border from Syria by posing a security risk will be regarded as a threat , and will be treated as a military target . '' The very same day , some Turkish tanks on the Syrian border were repositioned , implying that Ankara meant business .

Yet almost no one in Turkey seems enthusiastic for war . Many here point out that Turkey 's ascendance in the past decade has been thanks to its `` soft power . '' That mainly rested on the country 's economic boom and democratic reforms , which seemed to present a synthesis of Islam , free-market capitalism and political liberalism .

But should Turkey now consider putting some `` hard power '' on the table , without which it might become ineffective in its region ? This is a question that Turks are passionately discussing these days , and the answer seems to matter a lot for the Syrians as well .
