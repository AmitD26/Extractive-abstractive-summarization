As tens of thousands of people marched in favor or against the bill , Republican Gov. Scott Walker indicated he has the votes to pass it .

`` We 're going to stay firm on it , '' he said on the fifth day of large protests and political wrangling in the capital , which saw the arrival of conservative groups .

`` Wisconsin is ground zero , '' said Tim Phillips , president of Americans for Prosperity . `` I think it is going to determine largely whether the pampered nature of these public employees is finally reined in . ''

Walker has called on 14 Democratic state senators , who fled the state rather than allow a quorum permitting a vote on the bill , to return to Madison .

Bill opponents say they wo n't allow a vote unless Walker negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for everything but wages . The legislation also would require most employees to pay more for their pensions and health insurance benefits .

Walker , who says the state is `` broke , '' is asking legislators to pass his Budget Repair Bill to combat a $ 137 million shortfall through June 30 . An upcoming two-year budget for 2011-13 must address a pending $ 3.6 billion deficit , he said .

Opponents say the proposed legislation is an attack on workers ' rights .

There were no reports of major incidents or arrests by late Saturday afternoon , and authorities expressed their gratitude .

Teachers and other public employees kept the pressure on the governor to go to the bargaining table .

`` These are many of the same senators who , two years ago , rammed through a billion dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input , '' the statement said . `` The quickest way to resolve the current situation is for the Democratic senators to stop shirking their responsibilities and debate the bill in Madison . ''

The conservative group American Majority helped organize the `` I Stand With Walker '' campaign evident this weekend in Madison .

But he added , `` He also feels very strongly that we need not to make this an assault on the collective bargaining rights of workers in any given state .

`` He understands public employees need to make sacrifices just like everyone else . ''

Walker 's proposed legislation requires workers to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions , although supporters say local governments will decide on health care contributions for their employees

It also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification , a costly procedure , and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks .
