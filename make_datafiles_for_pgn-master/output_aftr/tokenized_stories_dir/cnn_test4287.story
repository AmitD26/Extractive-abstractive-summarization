Woburn , Massachusetts -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cars and commercial airplanes move the vast majority of us around , but as any frequent traveler knows , both of these modes of transportation have their limitations .

Cars are restricted to highway speeds and the sometimes circuitous routes of our road infrastructure . Commercial airlines , with their high security , fixed schedules and hub-and-spoke system , offset their fast point-to-point speed with large amounts of waiting , and you still have to drive on each end of the flight .

Personal aviation , where pilots operate small private aircraft , offers an alternative with the potential to get you where you need to be quickly , safely and on your own schedule , but it , too , comes with limitations . We founded Terrafugia in 2006 to develop a solution to many of the barriers to the more widespread use of personal aviation : Our work led to the development of a new kind of aircraft , which we call the `` Transition . ''

We used the resources that were available at MIT and with our local Experimental Aircraft Association chapter to start building a team and a business while doing early conceptual design on the Transition itself . Since the beginning I 've enjoyed applying engineering problem-solving skills to the challenge of company creation : In many ways , starting a company is just a big systems engineering design-within-constraints problem .

In describing the Transition , we use the phrase `` roadable aircraft '' instead of `` flying car '' to help set expectations for what it is and how it will be used . As a light-sport aircraft , the Transition must be operated in and out of designated airports by certificated pilots . -LRB- Because this aircraft is easy to fly , the appropriate pilot license can be earned in weeks , instead of months or years . -RRB-

Unlike any other airplane on the market today , the Transition can fold its wings on command , shift power from the propeller to the rear wheels and drive as a fully street-legal vehicle on any road in the United States . Designed to meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards , it is the first light airplane to incorporate automotive-style safety features such as dash-mounted airbags , a passenger safety cage and energy-absorbing crumple zones . For added safety in flight , there is a full vehicle parachute for use in case of emergency .

And what about the weather , something that often halts small airplane travel ? With a Transition , if the weather gets bad , fold the wings without leaving the cockpit and continue the trip safely on the road . If the weather clears later in the trip , drive to a nearby airport and get back in the air .

As of early 2012 , Terrafugia is conducting an extensive set of tests on our two production prototype aircraft . These aircraft incorporate all of the improvements that we were able to make following the completion of flight and drive testing of our proof of concept aircraft in 2009 .

While it is not the `` flying car '' of `` The Jetsons , '' the Transition is a state-of-the-art solution to improving personal mobility today . From the reactions we get to the aircraft whenever we have the opportunity to share it , it 's clear that even with its practical approach , the Transition is rekindling a shared dream of more personal freedom .

As with many disruptive products , it is difficult to predict where this technology will take us in the future , but I believe that the Transition is the next major step in improving how we navigate our world . I would encourage you to think about where you 'd like to go once you have an airplane in your garage .

Anna Dietrich : We depend on cars and planes for most transportation

@highlight

She says the highway system and commercial plane network limit mobility , choices

Dietrich and her colleagues are developing a plane that can drive legally on roads

If the prototypes succeed , people will be able to park airplane in garage , she says
