`` It was really hard because we -LRB- did n't -RRB- speak the language , '' Yohana said . He was often so discouraged by his poor English that he would n't even try to do his homework .

The social isolation was worse .

`` It was really hard to find friends , '' Yohana said . `` I was just sitting at home . ''

While working as a refugee case manager for a nonprofit , Mark Kabban saw many families like Yohana 's struggle to find their footing in the United States .

`` You lose a lot of your dignity when you become a refugee , '' Kabban said . `` You have to flee your country , depend on others . You lose your self-esteem . ''

Kabban said the transition can be particularly challenging for children , who face educational and social barriers . The stress they endure often puts them at risk of getting on the wrong track .

To help support young refugees , Kabban started the YALLA program in 2009 . The name is an acronym for Youth And Leaders Living Actively , but in Arabic it simply means `` Let 's go . '' YALLA provides free tutoring and soccer training to 200 boys and girls in the San Diego area .

According to the U.S. State Department , more than 10,000 refugees from around the world have moved to the San Diego area legally since 2007 , making it one of the largest refugee resettlement areas in the country .

Most of the players in the program are Iraqi , but the group has players from across the Middle East , Africa and Asia . Sometimes ethnic and religious differences can lead to conflict , but Kabban says that as the soccer season progresses , the differences fall by the wayside .

`` Their families have endured the same struggles , '' Kabban said . `` When they realize that ... they become like brothers and sisters . ''

Some children have lost more than their homeland . Some have witnessed one of their parents being killed , or they 've been kidnapped and tortured themselves . Kabban , who helps run many of the practices , tries to keep the atmosphere serious but fun so that time on the field is a much-needed escape .

`` Soccer is -LRB- the -RRB- best therapy , '' Kabban said . `` They have an hour or two to forget about everything and just be kids . ''

Kabban cares deeply because he faced many of the challenges the refugees are experiencing . He was never officially a refugee , but his family left Beirut during Lebanon 's 15-year civil war , a conflict in which three members of his extended family were killed .

That changed when he discovered American football , scoring a touchdown the first time he got the ball .

`` Sports was the way I got confident , made friends and felt I was like other kids , '' he said . He went on to earn a football scholarship at Baker University , a small private school in Kansas where he studied foreign relations .

`` I started thinking to myself , ` Why am I going halfway across the world to learn about refugees when they 're all here in my own hometown ? ' '' he said .

Instead of going to graduate school , Kabban got a job with Catholic Charities , helping refugees settle into their new lives . He was troubled to see so many children sitting at home , alienated , but he also noticed how they lit up when they saw a soccer ball .

Although the organization is relatively new , YALLA has managed to get funding from local foundations and businesses . Everything -- tutoring , soccer and occasional field trips -- is provided at no cost , something the kids appreciate , as nearly all of them know that money is tight at home .

Kabban has also made it a priority to reach out to those who are n't refugees .

When refugees started arriving in the area , there was tension in schools between them , Latinos and African-Americans . To counteract this , Kabban started the Peacebuilders League , a soccer league open to everyone in the area .

Ultimately , Kabban hopes to build a `` peace-building '' charter school for refugees , immigrants and marginalized youth that would use soccer in a formal college prep program .

Kabban 's commitment to the organization is so strong that for more than a year he has worked full-time without a salary , living off his savings . The kids at YALLA know he quit his job for them , and they 're quick to acknowledge the huge difference he has made in their lives .

Stories like that are what push Kabban to keep going .

`` This country gave my family the chance to succeed , '' he said . `` I want to help these kids do the same thing . ''
