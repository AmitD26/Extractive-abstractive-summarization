And -- inspired by his son -- he has raised millions of dollars for research into autism .

`` Having him back home means so much to us , '' says foundation member Kim Daniels .

Els ' own sporting ambitions were supported every step of the way by his father Neels , who owned a transport business , and mother Hettie .

Known as the `` Big Easy '' for his languid style , he won the U.S. Open at the age of just 24 in 1994 and has been among the game 's elite ever since .

`` I had golf clubs , golf shoes -- all these things cost a lot of money . The equipment in golf is very expensive . There are a lot of kids in South Africa , and around the world , that have talent . I 've seen these kids not make it because of their inability to pay for good equipment , '' he told CNN .

`` The gods were smiling on us to have a kid like Louis come to the foundation , '' said a proud Els .

`` I feel like that was something I wanted to do because I am so fond of South Africa , so fond of the country and the people . I just felt it was my duty to give something back to the less fortunate . ''

`` It 's very special to have spent three years on the foundation , and it 's great what Ernie is doing for the kids , '' he told CNN .

Autism foundation

Since going public with his son 's problem in 2008 , Els has campaigned on behalf of Autism Speaks and used his sporting connections to raise millions of dollars for his Els for Autism Foundation .

Els uprooted his family -- wife Liezl , daughter Samantha and Ben -- from their main home on Wentworth Golf Course in southern England to Florida to get better treatment for his son , who is `` quite severely affected '' by the condition .

With his worldwide fame and influence , Els knows that he is in a position to make a real difference in tackling autism .

`` I 've seen families where three kids have autism . Now that must be one of the hardest things in the world , because just to do your normal everyday stuff would be almost impossible if you do n't have extra help , '' he said .

`` We have the resources , we have the money to actually cope with it . There are people and families who do n't have that , so we want to try to better their lives . ''

Els spends the majority of his time based in Palm Beach , but every winter returns to South Africa to check personally on his private and commercial interests .

They include a thriving golf course design business and the realization of a dream to build a signature layout in an area of the Cape where he used to hang out with friends and enjoy barbecues on the beach .

Oubaai at Herold 's Bay is now established , with the 18 holes taking in rugged surroundings near the Indian Ocean .

It was voted `` Best Golf Resort in South Africa '' in a 2007 survey .

Having met his wife on a farm in Stellenbosch , which is famous for its vineyards , he developed a love of the grape and , at the turn of the century , set up Ernie Els Wines .

He partnered expert Louis Strydom to develop a range of five red wines , and in 2011 added a white to the collection .

Golfing ambitions

With all these commitments , Els might be expected to slowly slide down the world rankings as he nears the latter stage of his career .

But the former No. 1 is still desperate to add to his near 70 victories worldwide and to his majors tally .

`` I want to really concentrate on America and get some wins early on and hopefully get some real confidence going ahead of the first major at Augusta , '' said Els , now ranked 71st .

And how long can he continue to play at the top level ?

`` Well . I do n't want it to end now , '' he smiled . `` I 'm 42 and in pretty decent shape for a golfer . I want to continue to win tournaments , the desire still burns bright . ''

Els added : `` Fifty has always been kind of the mark . At 50 you go onto the Seniors Tour and so forth . My good friend Vijay Singh is 48 this year , he 's also had a bit of a quiet year , so I feel there 's many years left in me .
