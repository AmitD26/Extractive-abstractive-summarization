-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills has narrowly won Ghana 's presidential election , the Ghana Electoral Commission said on its Web site .

John Atta Mills , left , of the opposition NDC has defeated Nana Akufo-Addo , right , of the ruling NPP in the runoff .

The chairman of the Ghana Electoral Commission , Kwadwo Afari-Gyan , said Mills had garnered about 4,521,032 votes , or about 50.2 percent of the total votes cast .

Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo , of the incumbent New Patriotic Party , won about 49.77 percent of the total valid votes cast , Afari-Gyan said , according to the commission 's Web site .

Both parties had alleged irregularities in voting in the Ashanti region and Volta regions , but Afari-Gyan said the commission did not find evidence in `` purely electoral matters '' that invalidated the results .

Mills , 64 , will replace John Agyekum Kufuor as Ghana 's president on January 7 . Kufuor is stepping down after serving two four-year terms , the maximum allowed .

Ghana , a country about the size of England , is the world 's second-biggest cocoa and gold producer . In 2007 , leaders announced the discovery of oil off its shore .

Part of a former British colony , Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence in 1957 . It endured a series of coups before military dictator Rawlings took power in 1981 .
