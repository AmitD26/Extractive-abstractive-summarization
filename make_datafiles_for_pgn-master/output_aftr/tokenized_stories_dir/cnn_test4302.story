-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bayern Munich made short work of opponents Greuther Furth as the Bavarian giants made it a miserable Bundesliga debut for their less illustrious neighbors with a 3-0 win on Saturday .

Xerdan Shaqiri was handed his debut for Bayern , and tasked with replacing the ill Franck Ribery , with Brazilian defender Dante also making his first start in defence .

It was one of Bayern 's regulars who opened the scoring , however , with Thomas Muller lashing the ball into the net from close range after a header from debutant Dante . Bayern dominated throughout and doubled their lead in the 59th minute when Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic -- signed in the summer from Wolfsburg -- headed his first goal of the season past goalkeeper Max Grun .

`` We were very composed , smart and clever too , '' Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes told the club 's website .

`` Once you fall behind to Bayern it 's always hard . If you give them space just for an instant , they 'll free up Robben with a first-time pass , and suddenly it 's 2-0 , '' he told the Bayern website .

In the 33rd minute , Juan Arango delivered a dangerous free kick into the box that tall striker Mike Hanke was able to head into the net to open the scoring .

The goal did n't ignite the game , with neither side creating any clear opportunities . However , in the 66 minute Gladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen struggled to hold a shot from Eren Derdiyok and Roberto Frimino pounced to prod the ball home .

Bayer Leverkusen suffered a poor start to life under new full time manager Sami Hyypia .

Things looked to be going well for the former Liverpool man , with Stefan Kiessling giving Leverkusen the lead on the half hour mark . Kiessling did well to pounce when Kevin Trapp spilled a shot from Carlos Zambrano .

After the equalizer the game opened up as the two teams went for a winner . Leverkusen went close , and should have taken the lead when Gonzalo Castro fired wide .

Frankfurt 's Martin Lanig finally settled it in the 82nd minute when he perfectly connected with a cross from Stefano Celozzi to fire an unstoppable header into the Leverkusen net .

Fortuna Dusseldorf have signed 18 players over the summer , but only gave debuts to five of them in their starting eleven . The newly promoted side looked the more impressive of the two teams , and a brace from Dani Schahin -- who arrived from Furth this summer -- ensured they took their first points of the season .

Both Frieburg and Mainz enjoyed wins in the DFB cup last weekend , but neither could take the three points as the Bundesliga got under way .

The two sides were evenly matched , but it was Freiburg 's new signing Max Kruse that made the breakthrough in the 48th minute . Mainz attacked from the restart , and eventually got the equalizer in the 65th minute when Nicolai Muller was fouled in the box . The lively Andreas Ivanschitz stepped up to convert the spot kick .
