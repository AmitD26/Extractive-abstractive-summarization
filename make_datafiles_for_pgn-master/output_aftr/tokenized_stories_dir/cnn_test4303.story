Police said at least 12 gunmen were involved . Pakistani Information Minister Sherry Rahman told CNN the attackers were still at large .

Up to eight players , one coach and 10 security staff were reported hurt , with two players suffering bullet wounds .

Tharanga Paranavitana , 26 , was hit in the chest while Thilan Samaraweera , 32 , suffered a leg injury , according to Chamra Ranaveera , a Sri Lankan embassy attache . Both men are in a stable condition .

Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said the squad would be flown home to Colombo later Tuesday . Bogollagama is traveling to Pakistan for talks with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani .

Witnesses who saw the attack praised the response of security officials .

Pakistan , which is battling Islamist and Taliban insurgents in its North West Frontier Province , has struggled to attract visiting cricket teams in recent years because of security concerns . Watch how attack strikes at legitimacy of Pakistani government ''

Last year Australia canceled a proposed tour in the wake of a series of suicide bombings . The International Cricket Council was also forced to postpone the high-profile ICC Champions Trophy after five of the eight participants pulled out .

Pakistan is due to co-host the Cricket World Cup in 2011 with India , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka , although the extent of its involvement in that tournament now appears to be under scrutiny .

`` Pakistan has been struggling for a while . They had n't played a test match in the entirety of 2008 , '' Stern told CNN . `` I do hope the cricket world will rally around Pakistan to find a way for the team to play outside of the country . ''

He said one possibility was for the team to play its matches in the UK , which has a large Pakistani community .

Former Pakistani Waqar Younis bowler said : `` I do n't see the International Cricket Council now allowing the World Cup matches in Pakistan . It 's gone . ''

`` This has really damaged Pakistan , '' former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV . `` Already some teams did n't want to come to Pakistan . Now who will come after this incident ? ''

In a statement , ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said the attack was `` very upsetting for the wider cricket family . ''

`` I have confirmed with both member boards that the remainder of the tour has been canceled and we are working hard to get our match officials out of the area as safely and as quickly as possible . ''

Sri Lanka agreed in December to visit Pakistan after India called off a tour following November 's terror attacks in Mumbai . Indian authorities blamed the attacks on Pakistan-based militants .

Pakistan 's Cricket Board had hoped Sri Lanka 's tour would help it recoup some of more than $ 16 million it was set to lose as a result of India 's cancelation .

The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture . Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to play in Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament after other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns over the country 's civil war with Tamil separatists .
