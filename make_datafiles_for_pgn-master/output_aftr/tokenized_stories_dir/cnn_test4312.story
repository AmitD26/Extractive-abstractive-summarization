-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Cy Young Award winners as Major League Baseball 's best pitchers in 2012 could n't be more different .

In the American League , a young left-hander with a blazing fastball , entering the prime of his career , narrowly topped the 2011 recipient .

The Tampa Bay Rays ' David Price garnered just enough votes from the Baseball Writers ' Association of America to win the AL prize . Price , 27 , tied for the American League lead with 20 wins , against only five losses , and led the AL with a 2.56 earned run average . Both those marks were career bests for the former Vanderbilt University star , whom the Rays chose with the top pick in the entire 2007 amateur draft . Price also struck out 205 batters , sixth-most in the league .

The writers ' association says the contest was the closest since writers first started listing more than one pitcher on their ballots in 1970 .

R.A. Dickey and the Zen of the knuckleball

Price 's teammate , relief pitcher Fernando Rodney , garnered the final AL first-place vote and finished fifth in the overall AL voting , among nine pitchers who gained mention .

Mirroring the AL , the 2011 NL Cy Young Award winner was this year 's runner-up . Los Angeles Dodger Clayton Kershaw was rewarded for his outstanding season , which included a league-best 2.53 ERA and just one fewer strikeout than Dickey , with two first-place votes and second place overall .

The Baseball Writers ' Association of America is comprised of two beat writers representing each of the 14 teams in the American League and each of the 16 teams in the National League . Each writer ranks his or her top five pitchers in order , with points allocated on a 7-4-3-2-1 basis .
