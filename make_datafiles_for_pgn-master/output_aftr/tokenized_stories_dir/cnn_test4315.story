-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After dealing with porcupine creatures , shape-shifters and planes full of crystallized bodies over five seasons , star John Noble is still having the time of his life on `` Fringe . ''

The cult favorite sci-fi series is in the midst of its final season on Fox , and classic episodes premiere Tuesday night on the Science Channel .

Noble : My goodness , yes . We start filming our penultimate episode Tuesday morning . We 're very close to the end , mate .

CNN : This season , do you feel that Walter is bearing the weight of a tremendous amount of pressure to put together this plan to fight the Observers ?

Noble : Yes , but I think the pressure 's on everyone . All the key players have to come to some sort of conclusion , and that 's the gift of these last 13 episodes . Every character is under pressure , if you can call it that .

But it 's a good journey . Every episode takes us further on the track to the finale . It 's like writing a novel and having the chance to write the final chapter . The stakes are lifted every week for us . It 's kind of exciting .

CNN : We 've seen so many major twists just this season . What was your reaction to learning that Peter was going to utilize the tech of an Observer and sort of become one himself ?

Noble : I 'm doing very well , mate . We decided we needed to address an ongoing issue , which been going on a long time for me , which is that I do n't sleep . Ultimately , given the load of travel , I was starting to hit a wall . We did what we could to correct that . We probably really did n't need to take as much time as we did . The management was terrific and said , `` Get it sorted out . '' We 're still going strong at this stage , so something worked .

CNN : Have you enjoyed discovering Twitter ?

Noble : I thought it was time I got with it . -LRB- Laughs -RRB- I resisted for so long . I have no idea , to be honest , what I 'm doing . I just go on every once in a while and say something , and it gets retweeted 6,000 times .

It 's an astonishing way of communicating . Thank God for that , because it takes away the tyranny of those who would withhold information .

CNN : Walter is famous for his love of junk food . Do you have a favorite junk food on or off set ?

Noble : To survive , I try not to eat junk food . I hate to destroy the myth !

On a film set , if you eat junk food , you 'd finish around 400 pounds at the end of the first season . That 's just the nature of the work .

CNN : And what can fans expect as it comes to a close ?

Noble : I have n't read the final episode yet , but I know that -LRB- executive producer -RRB- Joel Wyman has put everything , and I mean everything , he 's got into this . He 's directing the last episode . I think it will be a masterpiece . I have n't read it , but I ca n't imagine anything less with the amount of heart he 's put into it . Fingers crossed , but that 's my prediction . I think it will be a masterpiece .
