Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anti-Gadhafi forces Saturday claimed a new military advance into the deposed Libyan dictator 's hometown Sirte , while a fuel storage warehouse fire at the port of the country 's capital city Tripoli in the west sent plumes of smoke into the air .

National Transitional Council forces took a neighborhood previously held by remnants still loyal to Moammar Gadhafi , according to a spokesman . Twenty-four hours of NATO aerial bombardments preceded the advance .

NTC security arrived at the scene and secured the surrounding area , blocking roads leading to the burning site and firing into the air to drive back dozens of onlookers . Journalists ' access was limited .

Sporadic explosions could be heard in the Libyan capital for an hour as the fire spread . The blaze has since been extinguished and the explosions ceased .

Libya 's NTC is to hold an urgent meeting Sunday to discuss the formation of an interim government , a senior council member told CNN Friday .

Mohammed Naser , the council member , said the formation of a government could take up to one week , but NTC members agreed that the interim government would include a premier , a vice premier , and 22 ministers .

Earlier in the week , Elamin Belhaj , a senior member of the NTC , told CNN the formation of a Libyan government would not be announced until anti-Gadhafi forces controlled the borders of the country and liberated three cities that still remained under loyalist control -- Bani Walid , Sirte and Sabha -- a task that could take up to one month , he said .

The NTC , he said , will expand as cities are liberated in order to give representation to all regions of the country . Ultimately , the council could have approximately 80 members ; it currently has 43 .

Elections for a National Congress is slated to take place in eight months . At the creation of the congress , the interim government will cease to exist .

Journalist Mohammed Fahmy and CNN 's Thomas Evans contributed to this report .
