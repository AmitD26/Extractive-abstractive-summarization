-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been almost 20 years since the first `` Toy Story '' debuted in 1995 , but the franchise is still going strong .

On Thursday , Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger revealed that `` Toy Story 4 '' is coming in June 2017 to the delight of pretty much everyone -- well , except those still grieving from `` Toy Story 3 . '' -LRB- Our hearts seriously may never recover . -RRB-

But everyone else ? Totally losing their minds .

Yeah , we know you 're excited . But as this fan perfectly summed up the news , we 've still got a looooong way to go until June 2017 .

So let 's take a trip down memory lane and revisit the movie that started it all , shall we ? Here are five things you may not know about 1995 's `` Toy Story '' :

With that Oscar-winning short , Pixar 's John Lasseter first started playing with `` this notion of a juxtaposition with the audience , '' as Lasseter puts it in the documentary `` The Making of Toy Story . ''

Pixar then played around with the idea of the `` Tin Toy , '' Tinny , being one of two stars of a toy-focused buddy movie . But when the animation studio landed on the idea of the movie being set in a kid 's bedroom , where one new toy would come to join the older ones , it did n't quite add up that a kid would be that excited about such a simple plaything .

2 . Buzz Lightyear was originally called `` Lunar Larry ''

Tim Allen also was n't the only actor under consideration for the part . In 2001 , Billy Crystal admitted that he too had been offered the role .

`` It 's the only regret I have in the business of something I passed on , '' Crystal said .

3 . `` Toy Story '' was n't supposed to be the movie 's title

`` Toy Story '' was supposed to just be the working title for the project , and not what it was supposed to be called when it arrived in theaters .

Back in 2011 , `` Toy Story 3 '' director Lee Unkrich turned to Twitter to reveal some of the options that were floating around back in the '90s . -LRB- Unkrich served as an editor on the first `` Toy Story . '' -RRB-

4 . The movie almost did n't happen

According to Entertainment Weekly , November 19 , 1993 was a dark day for Pixar 's creative team .

That was when the studio presented a collection of story reels to Disney , whose animation chief was not at all into it .

Among the complaints was that action figure astronaut Buzz Lightyear and quaint cowboy Woody were just unlikable and had awkward chemistry . -LRB- In the words of Joss Whedon , `` The original Woody was a thundering a ****** . '' -RRB-

5 . The license plate number on Andy 's mom 's minivan has a special meaning

According to Disney Insider , that was the room number for a class Pixar 's John Lasseter , Brad Bird , Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton were all in at CalArts . You can spot that sequence on the license plate of the minivan driven by Andy 's mom in `` Toy Story , '' `` Toy Story 2 '' and `` Toy Story 3 . ''
