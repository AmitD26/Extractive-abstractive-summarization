In the civil complaint , Caballero -- who now lives in Florida after receiving political asylum in the United States -- says he was forced to flee his home country , abandoning property and businesses , and he wants those responsible to pay .

Caballero `` has suffered and continues to suffer emotional , psychological and economic damages '' since rebel forces kidnapped , tortured and killed his father , the lawsuit says .

But the money is only part of the battle , attorney Joseph Zumpano said .

Antonio Caballero 's father , Carlos Caballero , was a former Colombian senator , political party leader and ambassador to the United Nations .

He was 76 years old when he was taken hostage in February 1999 , according to the complaint .

Records from the Colombian government 's human rights observatory also blame rebels for the death .

Although the killing occurred in Colombia , the lawsuit argues that U.S. federal laws -- including the Alien Tort Statute and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- give American courts jurisdiction in the case .

The lawsuit was filed in Florida 's Miami-Dade County Circuit Court because of the groups ' alleged drug trafficking activities in the state , and because Antonio Caballero lives there now and returning to Colombia to file a claim `` would place his life in extreme peril , '' the complaint says .

`` He 's under an ongoing threat that forces him to work within our system , '' Zumpano said .

There has been no comment on the case published on websites that the rebel groups typically use to release information .

Other lawsuits have been filed against the FARC in federal court , records show -- including a pending 2009 case seeking damages filed by three American contractors who were held hostage by the guerrilla group . That case seeks garnishment of millions of dollars in frozen assets from U.S. bank accounts connected to the FARC .

The U.S. National Couterterrorism Center describes the FARC as `` Latin America 's oldest , largest , most capable , and best-equipped insurgency of Marxist origin '' and notes that it has `` well-documented ties to a range of drug trafficking activities '' Tactics include `` bombings , murder , mortar attacks , kidnapping , extortion , and hijacking , as well as guerrilla and conventional military action against Colombian political , military , and economic targets , '' the center says .

Caballero 's lawsuit comes amid renewed peace talks between the Colombian government and FARC rebels , who have been meeting in Havana , Cuba .

Zumpano said Tuesday that the case 's goal `` is not to interject itself in the negotiations , '' but he hopes the lawsuit will bring the group 's tactics to light .

`` Terrorism is n't just something in the Middle East , '' he said . `` It 's alive and well in the Americas as well , and it cost this man his life . ''
