In recent months , Trump has touted his wealth as a possible asset -- and evidence of his business acumen -- as he considers whether to run against President Barack Obama in 2012 . He said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that his `` net worth is many , many , many times '' that of Republican Mitt Romney , a former Massachusetts governor who has announced his plans to run .

`` I have built a great company . '' Trump said . `` I have built a company that has very little debt , has a lot of cash and I have one of the best locations anywhere in the United States . ''

Eliot Spitzer , the host of `` In the Arena , '' and CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin are digging into a sworn deposition given by Trump in a 2007 libel case calling into question his net worth .

`` Hopefully you will find out , because this country is such in bad shape somebody has to do something as quickly as possible , '' Trump said .

Earlier in the day , he told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti that his accountants are already hard at work on the financial paperwork required of presidential candidates .

Trump vowed that any financial disclosure will be released `` simultaneously '' if and when he announces that he 's running for president .

In 2004 , Trump lost majority control of his casino business under a bankruptcy restructuring plan . The company cited a weak economy and burdensome interest payments as reasons for the restructuring .

Trump Entertainment Resorts filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2009 , according to court documents filed in Camden , New Jersey . Trump quit his position as chairman of that company , which had total assets of $ 2.06 billion and total debts of $ 1.74 billion . Around that same time , nine other of Trump Entertainment 's associated companies filed for bankruptcy protection , including Trump Taj Majal Associates , Trump Marina Associates and Trump Plaza Associates .
