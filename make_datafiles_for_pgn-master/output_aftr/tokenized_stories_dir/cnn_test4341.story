-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Less than a week before The Academy Awards , Scarlett Johansson had yet to make a starlet 's most scrutinized fashion decision : Her Oscar dress .

Her stylist , the renowned celebrity dresser Nicole Chavez , was n't worried . Tight deadlines are as common as paparazzi in this industry .

`` What it comes down to is -- may the best dress win , '' said Chavez , whose clients include Rachel Bilson , Kristen Bell and Katherine Heigl . `` I stay organized and maintain close relationships with designers and colleagues , so it 's more fun than stressful . ''

Johansson , who was asked to present an Oscar two weeks ago , was measured for a gown four days before the event . Chavez , who researches styles from around the globe , asked : What silhouette ? What color ? What designer ?

Chavez strives to keep her clients off the `` Worst Dressed '' lists .

Even with the pressure of the world watching , she said the `` getting ready '' process before the annual show is lighthearted .

Chavez , like a close girlfriend , will zip her flowing , complicated gown and arrange matching accessories .

`` It 's comparable to a wedding day , '' she said . `` Everyone will just be having a good time . ''

After the Oscars , the fate of an actress ' attire is often similar to a bride 's wedding dress : never to be worn again .

`` After the designers make something so special for an actress , they ` gift ' the dresses , '' she said . `` The dresses get so much press , so who could really wear them again ? ''

Chavez said there is endless action behind the scenes before and after award shows .

As for what Johansson will wear ?

`` Well , we can never say for sure until the actual show , '' Shavez said . `` So , we 'll see on Sunday ! ''

`` Very few things fit perfect off the rack and tailoring makes all the difference . It can make a $ 70 white button down from the Gap look like a $ 400 dollar fitted Prada shirt . ''

3 . Take a digital photo of yourself in the mirror before going out .

`` You will be shocked to see what the naked eye does n't ! Black fabric is see-through when a camera flash hits it . No one wants their bra showing in family photos . ''

4 . Be prepared for mini fashion emergencies .

5 . Be confident !

`` When you love the way you look , it translates and people take notice . Fashion is an extension of your personality so have fun and stay true to yourself . ''
