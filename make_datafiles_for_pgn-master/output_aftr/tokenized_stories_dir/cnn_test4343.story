China will be especially glad it does n't have Mitt Romney to deal with .

But the whipping boy is also lashing back , taking aim at America 's perceived political flaws and diminished role on the world stage .

The state-run People 's Daily portends dark days ahead for the U.S. president : `` As soon as Obama gets re-elected , he will immediately be confronted with the strangling of Washington 's political machine . ''

And on China 's Netease.com , one Netizen from Jiangsu province writes : `` I really like you , Obama ! Congratulations ! Though I hope that you 'll mind your own business in your next four years , and stop interfering in the political affairs of other countries . ''

Non-interference is a non-starter given how interconnected the two countries are .

While on the campaign trail , Obama has taken action against China -- slapping tariffs on China-made tires and solar panels as well as filing a new case with the World Trade Organization against China for unfair auto subsidies .

But such action was taken not to merely score political points . It 's a sign of more `` tough on China '' policy-making to come .

China is undergoing a leadership transition of its own with the start of the 18th Party Congress on Thursday in Beijing , designed to bring forth a new generation of leaders who will run China for the next 10 years .

It 's a November of change for China and the U.S. , and even the ardently pro-Beijing editor of the Global Times wants to see a win-win for both .

`` I hope that Obama will demonstrate great talent on China issues , encourage China to rise peacefully , and will release the world from the tragedy of great power politics forever , '' says Hu .

Hope . With Obama 's re-election , it 's being embraced in China as well .
