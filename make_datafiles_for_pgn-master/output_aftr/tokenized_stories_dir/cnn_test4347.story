`` I think what he does out there is evil , '' said Nathan `` Nate '' Phelps , during an appearance on HLN 's `` Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell . ''

Nate Phelps is the seventh of the Westboro Baptist minister 's 13 children . The younger Phelps severed ties with his family on his 18th birthday and said he has n't had contact with his father in three decades . Nate Phelps is currently writing a book about his family .

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that Westboro 's practice of picketing the funerals of fallen soldiers with offensive placards is constitutionally protected free speech . The picketing , which includes chants and placards stating `` God Hates Fags '' and `` Thank God for Dead Soldiers , '' have enraged supporters of the U.S. military and the families and friends of slain soldiers .

Nate Phelps called his pastor father `` one of the best reasons that America has been forced to get off the fence and address this issue -LRB- of gay rights -RRB- . ''

`` But at the same time you ca n't ignore the fact that he 's done a lot of damage , '' Phelps said . `` He 's hurt a lot of families , not only in the gay community , but the families of these soldiers . ''

`` If they want to call that discipline , that 's fine . But I call it abuse , '' Phelps said .

The son said Fred Phelps also hit his mother , but not with the handle of the mattock .

Phelps has also said his father abused prescription drugs when he was in law school . He did n't back down from the claim during the HLN interview .

Velez-Mitchell read a statement from Nate Phelps ' sister , Shirley Phelps-Roper , denying the claim .

`` So since the United States is taking steps to move in the direction of equality for gays in America , he says that has doomed America , '' Phelps said . `` So anyone who is connected to America , so anyone who is supporting America in any sense is subject to the wrath of God . ''

There was no immediate public response from Fred Phelps to his son 's televised remarks .
