Clifton Green learned how to care for his daughter Miriam 's hair , which is very different from his own .

For many African-Americans , having a child walk around with unkempt hair is an almost unpardonable sin .

There are naturals , weaves , chemically relaxed styles , braids and dreadlocks , to name just a few .

`` Barbershops and beauty salons are perhaps second only to black churches as institutions in the community , '' said Ingrid Banks , an associate professor of Black Studies at University of California , Santa Barbara and author of a forthcoming book on contemporary black beauty salon culture . iReporters share their hair-stories ''

`` It 's not about hair per se , it 's about what hair means , particularly for black women in terms of racial identity , identity based on gender and ideas about power , '' she said . `` On one level , hair matters because race matters in our society . For black people , our hair has been infused with these racial politics . ''

`` When we think about that , there is no other racial or ethnic group in which those ideas come to bear on someone 's politics , '' said Banks , who gathered data for her book by traveling to black hair salons across the country . `` No one is saying that about white women , Asian women or Latino women . ''

Erin Aubry Kaplan , who wrote an article about Michelle Obama 's hair and its implications for Salon.com , believes the first lady 's straightened and perfectly coiffed style helps her image .

Robert Morris can relate to the perceptions that black hair can evoke .

The CNN iReporter recently cut the dreadlocks he had been growing for years and said that along with the physical makeover came an attitude shift in how people responded to him . Check out Morris ' iReport on his change

`` I was n't as approachable when I had the locks , '' said Morris , who now sports a shorter , cropped do that he is enjoying . `` It seemed like I had the stigma of being ` the angry black man . ' ''

Tamille Johnson said her decision to get kinky twists kept her up the night before her visit to the salon . Read Johnson 's concerns in her iReport

`` It was really surprising to me because I was so afraid what people would think about them and I did n't think I would feel that way , '' Johnson said . `` Whenever I would get my hair done , I would get straight styles and I did not know if people would think that the kinky style was pretty . ''

`` When a child has straight hair , they are told they have ` good hair ' and while people are n't telling children with curly hair that they have ` bad hair , ' in essence that is what you are saying because you are saying that straight hair is good hair , '' Valdez-Simeon said .

Valdez-Simeon , whose site Mixtkids.com is billed as `` One Mom 's journey to raise empowered mixed-race children , '' said she has increasingly heard the comments because her 7-year-old sports tight , curly ringlets while her 1-year-old 's hair has yet to curl . `` I try to explain to people that good hair is not straight hair , it 's healthy hair , '' said Valdez-Simeon , who also said all of the comments have come from African-Americans .

Comedian Chris Rock saw the same attitudes in his young daughters and it helped motivate his new documentary `` Good Hair . ''

Janet Wallace , hair show manager , said as many as 50,000 attendees have come annually to each of the events to see the latest trends , services and products available .

`` People want to look good from the cradle to the grave , '' Wallace said . `` Hair is fun because there are so many adornments and things you can do with it . ''

Green acknowledges that he has not reached that level of artistry yet , but takes pride in styling his daughter 's hair well .

On weekends , the Emory University professor can be found wielding the various combs , brushes and products he has found that work for Miriam 's hair -LRB- Carol 's Daughter is a favorite at the moment -RRB- .

While he said he 's still not that good with `` rows , '' the cornrow style that braids the hair close to the scalp , he can work other braided styles , twists and an occasional French braid .

The ritual of doing Miriam 's hair is not only a time of bonding for the pair , but also an opportunity for him to honor his daughter and her heritage .

Green has kept his sense of humor about the many people who express surprise that he is so well educated about and skilled with black hair .

`` I do n't want people to look at her and tell she has white parents , '' he said , laughing .
