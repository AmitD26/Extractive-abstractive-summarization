-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North Korea 's longtime leader Kim Jong Il , the embodiment of the reclusive state where his cult of personality is deeply entrenched , has died .

He was believed to be 69 .

Regarded as one of the world 's most-repressive leaders , Kim Jong Il always cut a slightly bizarre figure . His diminutive stature and characteristically bouffant hair have been parodied by some in the West .

`` He 's a mysterious person -- I think by design , '' said Han S. Park , director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia and a frequent visitor to North Korea . `` Mystery is a source of leverage and power . It 's maintaining uncertainty . ''

This Just In : Up-to-the-minute news on the death of Kim Jong Il

Kim Jong Il was just a little boy when the Communist North invaded the American-backed South , sparking the Korean War in 1950 .

After the fighting ended , Kim became steeped in his father 's philosophy of `` juche '' or self-reliance -- the basis of North Korea 's reclusive nature .

North Korea gives Kim 's official birthplace as sacred Mount Paektu . The peak , on the northern border with Chinese Manchuria , is the highest on the peninsula and the site where Korean legend says the nation came into existence 5,000 years ago .

Researchers who are more objective place Kim 's birth in the Far Eastern region of the Soviet Union on February 16 , 1942 . His father had fled to the Soviet Union when the Japanese put a price on his head for guerrilla activities in occupied Korea .

Timeline : Kim Jong Il

Kim Jong Il 's younger brother drowned as a child and his mother died when he was 7 years old . Shortly after , when the Korean War broke out , he was sent to Manchuria , returning three years later when it ended .

Despite these hardships , Kim Jong Il was presumably surrounded by luxury and privilege for most of his upbringing . As the first-born son of an iron-fisted dictator , `` the doors were likely opening for him from a very young age , '' according to Dae-sook Suh , a professor of political science at the University of Hawaii who specializes in the Pyongyang government .

TIME : The iconography of Kim Jong Il

Kim Jong Il was given senior posts in the Politburo , the Military Commission and the Party Secretariat .

He took on the title `` Dear Leader '' and the government began spinning a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father , the `` Great Leader . ''

In 1991 , Kim Jong Il became commander-in-chief of North Korea 's powerful armed forces , the final step in the long grooming process .

Just a few years earlier , its powerful alliances had evaporated with the fall of the Soviet bloc and China 's move toward a market-based system . The economy was on the rocks and energy and food were in short supply . A series of weather disasters , combined with an inefficient state-run agricultural system , further eroded the food supply , leading to mass starvation .

The timing could not have been worse for replacing the only leader North Korea had known .

`` Heaven did n't smile on Kim Jong Il , '' said the University of Hawaii 's Dae-sook Suh .

Kim Il Sung 's unique style of Stalinism was subordinated to the more militant theme of Kim Jong Il 's `` Red Banner '' policy , introduced in 1996 .

In a news conference after his defection , Hwang warned of a growing possibility that his homeland might launch an attack . `` The preparation for war exceeds your imagination , '' he said .

Many outsiders viewed the flight of Hwang as another sign that the North Korean regime was on its last legs , but once again it weathered the storm , perhaps even benefiting from the fears of war heightened by Hwang 's warning .

Many analysts conclude that Kim Jong Il has played a poor hand of cards skillfully .

His obsession for movies led to one of the strangest incidents associated with him : The 1978 kidnappings of South Korean actress Choi En-hui and her director husband Shin Sang-ok . The couple 's account of their ordeal , given after they escaped North Korea in 1986 , sounds like a B-movie script .

And then devastating floods compounded the famine . The North Korean regime admitted almost 250,000 people perished between 1995 and 1998 , but some outside groups believe it was more like ten times that figure .

Nevertheless , an artifice of a successful state was maintained in the capital , Pyongyang , including an opulent subway -- proof that Kim would say reflected North Korea 's progress under his and his father 's leadership .

In 2000 , there appeared to be a thaw in North-South relations leading to the first-ever summit meeting between Kim Jong Il and his then counterpart from the South President Kim Dae Jung . South Korea 's so-called `` sunshine policy '' of engagement seemed to be bearing fruit .

In 2006 , the North conducted a nuclear test and test fired missiles adding extra urgency to the six-party talks designed to deal with North Korea 's nuclear program .

A breakthrough came in 2007 , when Kim Jong il finally agreed to disable the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in return for fuel and better relations with the U.S. .

But despite dramatically blowing up Yongbyon 's cooling tower , North Korea seemed to backtrack afterwards and the deal appeared to be jeopardy . In August 2008 , Pyongyang halted the disabling of the plutonium-producing plants in after a stalemate over verification measures .

Analysts say it is easy for outsiders to demonize Kim Jong Il , a dictator who spent an estimated 25 % or more of his country 's gross national product on the military while many in his country went hungry .

`` The level of reverence for Kim Jong Il in North Korea is quite underestimated by the outside , '' Park said . `` He is regarded by many as not only a superior leader but a decent person , a man of high morality . Whether that 's accurate is not important if you want to deal with North Korea . You have to understand their belief system . Perception is reality . ''

`` Yet he did not create this dictatorship -- it was his father 's but he took responsibility , and he made sure it continued for many more years . ''
