The actress faces a March 18 trial that includes charges of lying to a police officer about a car crash , reckless driving and violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction .

Lohan did face a receptive judge at a pretrial hearing Wednesday .

There are two prosecutors , including one from Santa Monica , where the car crash happened last June , and another from the Los Angeles city attorney 's office , which is overseeing the shoplifting probation . While they 've not taken a public position , several media reports -- not confirmed by CNN -- have said they want Lohan to spend at least six months in confinement .

Heller , who met with the prosecutors for the first time Wednesday , said they seemed to be `` very much interested in serving justice . ''

What would justice be in this case ?

`` Justice always has to be tempered with mercy and jail is not always the answer , '' Heller said . `` When people find themselves coming before the court , there 's usually a very serious underlying reason and cause . ''

Heller said it was premature for him to talk about a plea deal with the prosecutors since he just got the case file Wednesday .

Lohan took the bold move of firing Holley , who steered her through her many legal troubles over the past few years .

She appeared reluctant , however , in court Wednesday when Judge Sautner asked her if she wanted to replace Holley .

Sautner approved the switch to Heller , a New York lawyer for 44 years , with the exception of a five-year suspension from practicing law for bar rules violations .

`` This is not the most complex case we 've ever seen , '' Sautner said .

She caught a late flight from New York Tuesday night to be in Los Angeles for court Wednesday morning despite sending a doctor 's note that said she was too sick to travel .

Heller told the judge that her doctor diagnosed an upper respiratory condition . `` In New York , it 's the flu , '' he said .

`` No , it is n't , '' said Sautner , who was an NYPD detective in a previous career . `` The flu is the flu . ''

Still , the judge overlooked the issue , even saying that Lohan does not have to attend future hearings or even the trial , since it is misdemeanor case .

Lohan proved she can still draw a crowd of paparazzi to court . Dozens of photographers captured her walk from the limo into the courthouse . And she was dressed appropriately for a media event , wearing a Chanel dress and her traditional red-soled Louboutin stilettos .
