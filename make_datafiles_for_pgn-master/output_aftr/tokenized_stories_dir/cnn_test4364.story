Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Most Americans will feel the impact of forced budget cuts when their lives intersect with government -- trying to get through airport security to make a flight , visiting a national park , or using federal programs or assistance .

Congress can avert the automatic cuts , called sequester , if it compromises on a deficit-reduction plan before the March 1 deadline .

No deal would set in motion some $ 85 billion in spending reductions that would be phased in through the end of the fiscal year , September 30 .

Talk Back : Who 's to blame for forced spending cuts ?

Both the House and Senate are on their President 's Day break and will have four days to negotiate when they return next week .

Here 's where most Americans will feel their impact if sequester takes effect :

National parks

Expect closed gates at some national parks as the National Park Service would lose $ 110 million from its annual budget . This could also lead to shorter hours , fewer employees , and possible closure of camping and hiking spaces . Even the most popular national parks , such as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon , would n't be spared .

Airport security and air traffic

Proposed cuts to the Transportation Security Administration could mean trouble for air travel . The wait at airport security checkpoints could increase by at least an hour due to furloughed TSA screeners , who check passengers and cargo for bombs , guns and other prohibited items . It could take longer to get through customs as well .

The Federal Aviation Administration manages air traffic at more than 400 commercial airports and cuts raise the possibility of flight delays , especially at crowded airports . The agency has preemptively warned its 47,000 workers of furloughs for one day every two weeks through September . Like the TSA , any furloughs would begin in late April or early May , the start of the busy summer travel season .

Public Health

While Medicare and Medicaid will be protected , primary and preventive care , like flu vaccinations , could be closed off to hundreds of thousands of Americans . Cuts to mental health funding will leave over 350,000 Americans untreated .

Federal worker furloughs could start in April

Unemployed would lose benefits if federal budget cuts go through
