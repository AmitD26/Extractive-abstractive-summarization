Clinton said the United States ' relationship with Israel is not at risk : `` Our relationship is durable . It 's strong . It 's rooted in common values . ''

`` But we have to make clear to our Israeli friends and partners that the two-state solution -- which we support , which the prime minister himself says he supports -- requires confidence-building measures on both sides , '' Clinton told CNN 's Jill Dougherty . `` And the announcement of the settlements the very day that the vice president was there was insulting . ''

The construction , announced Tuesday , will be in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood , in disputed territory in East Jerusalem . The Israeli Interior Ministry denies that the territory is in East Jerusalem .

However , later Tuesday , after getting word of the settlement announcement , Biden said the United States condemned Israel 's decision to build 1,600 housing units in the Jerusalem neighborhood , calling it `` a step that undermines the trust we need right now . ''

The Israeli Interior Ministry said the construction plan was approved by a district committee , and the public can express objections to it over the next 60 days .

She added that she has no reason to believe that Netanyahu knew about the announcement during Biden 's visit but added , `` He is the prime minister . Like the president or secretary of state ... ultimately , you are responsible . ''

The controversy over Israel 's announcement came just a day after the Obama administration 's special envoy for Middle East peace announced that Israeli and Palestinian leaders had accepted indirect talks .

Negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis have been stalled for more than a year , despite the Obama administration 's attempt to move toward a resolution of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict .

Under current agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , Israel maintains full control over the West Bank and its borders while the Palestinian government oversees administration of major population centers .

`` We have been calling to resume the talks without prior conditions for almost a year now , '' he said . `` I hope that the proximity talks will soon lead to direct talks . ''
