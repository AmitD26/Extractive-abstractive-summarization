Their remarks after the June ruling were a contrast of competing rhetoric over a contentious piece of legislation , and a prism into how each candidate hopes to quietly change the makeup of the federal courts .

`` Americans are probably paying much more attention to the economy than the Supreme Court , '' said Thomas Goldstein , a top appellate attorney and SCOTUSblog.com publisher .

`` But they should be thinking about presidential court appointments , because they 'll make a big difference in the future of the law . You think about things like same-sex marriage , affirmative action , voting rights -- all of these are issues that have very different ideological components to them , and the more conservative justices definitely have a different view , '' he said .

But the landmark health care ruling had exactly zero impact on the presidential race at the time as a CNN/ORC poll just days later showed virtually no change in opinions on public attitudes toward Obama or Romney .

Obama has touted his successful nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan , saying they fit his overall philosophy of what a good judge should be . He has been criticized in the past for using `` empathy '' as a key criterion to nominate judges .

`` I think that 's why he 's backed off from talking about it , because ultimately the 'em pathy ' standard turns a court more into identity politics , '' said Carrie Severino , chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative legal advocacy group .

`` Ultimately , that 's actually not what Americans want . We do n't want judges that are going to vote their interest group . We want judges who are going to vote with the Constitution : what they think is the correct legal and constitutional result . And that is what Governor Romney has been emphasizing , '' Severino said .

The president 's has not talked much about the high court this election year , but he has had an uneasy relationship with its conservative majority .

Romney has said , if elected , he would `` nominate judges in the mold of Chief Justice -LSB- John -RSB- Roberts . '' But Romney told CBS News this past summer that Roberts made `` political considerations '' in authoring the health care ruling . The Republican nominee supplemented his thoughts on the kinds of judges he would appoint : `` I 'd look for individuals who have the intelligence and believe in following the Constitution . ''

For the president 's backers , one name is repeatedly mentioned : Kamala Harris , the Golden State 's elected attorney general . At 48 , the part Asian , part African-American woman has been praised for her political savvy , ethnic background , telegenic personality , law enforcement credentials , and early support of Obama 's 2008 candidacy .

Harris declined to speculate about a possible move to Washington .

For Romney , his legal advisers point to Paul Clement , the former U.S. solicitor general , as the kind of reliable , articulate conservative justice they think the Republican nominee would like .

Some conservative legal advocates want more assurances of Clement 's conservative bona fides , hoping he and other young Republican lawyers would first be named to a federal appeals court seat -- a stepping stone perhaps to the high court .

`` Clearly he 's a brilliant man . He 's clearly a wonderful -LSB- oral -RSB- advocate , '' said Severino . `` But I think particularly for a Supreme Court spot , you 're going to want to see somebody who has judicial experience , to see how they actually perform as a judge . ... But certainly , I could see him being in a lower court position so that he would have the chance to build that experience and that record and then be in a place further down the line when another opening comes up . ''

Clement was modest about the speculation .

`` I think service on the bench is a great form of public service ; I would n't want to necessarily rule it out , '' he told CNN exclusively in March . `` On the other hand , I 'm a big believer in that you sort of have to do the job that you currently have and you ca n't really worry about what you might do next . ''

Next to retire

As for which justice would be next to retire , that remains one of the last best-kept secrets .

Justice Stephen Breyer , a liberal , turned 74 last month . Justice Clarence Thomas is 64 , Alito is 62 , while Roberts , Sotomayor , and Kagan are all in their 50s .
