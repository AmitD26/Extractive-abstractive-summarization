-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When we left `` The Walking Dead '' crew in the midseason finale in December , the original survivors were coming head-to-head with the Governor and his followers in the isolated community of Woodbury .

Robert Kirkman : AMC has a really great program with building viewership . They do a tremendous amount of work , running marathons , promoting those marathons , promoting the DVDs and working with partners like Netflix and iTunes to make sure everything is available . So while people are hearing news about the show , AMC is doing a really good job at helping develop the audience . Also , we 're awesome . People seem to like the show .

Kirkman : I 'm somewhat of a pessimist . I never expected this to get made ; I never expected the pilot to get picked up ; I never expected the episodes to make it to air . I did n't really treat this show like it was happening until it premiered and until the ratings came in . There was a good 24-hour period where I was thinking , `` this is not going to last . '' I think that 's relative to its success . There 's really nothing like this on television . There 's really no comparison . I never thought it would succeed or succeed as well it has . It 's all been pretty surprising . AMC took this risk and put something really unique on television , and people are responding to it on the level where it 's having other networks try to think outside the box . As a television fan , when I see things like `` American Horror Story , '' these kind of crazy shows that you would n't expect to see on television , things like `` The Following '' -- it 's really exciting to see all this new stuff coming in .

CNN : Obviously , the story and the art in the comic books stand out . Is the aesthetic of the show taking a certain direction that you 're noticing ?

Kirkman : Not necessarily . We try to focus on the struggle of human survival . That 's really what 's at the core of this show : the appeal of watching people persevere and endure and succeed . This show is very much about trying to rebuild civilization in a micro sort of way . It 's about keeping a family together and keeping your loved ones safe . It 's much more about that heart and emotion than the more splashy stuff you see with the zombies , the action and the horror .

Kirkman : Yeah , the zombies eat people , and that 's cool and everything , but you really care about those people that are getting eaten . You feel for the other characters when they run around , and you hope that the rest of the characters do n't get eaten . That 's a very important component .

CNN : Speaking of Glen , it was recently announced that he 'd be leaving at the end of season 3 for `` creative differences . '' Where do you see the creative direction of the show going ?

CNN : Let 's talk about the rest of season 3 . What can viewers expect ? What are some of the issues and themes that manifest ?

CNN : Who do you think is the most compelling character at the moment ?

Kirkman : It 's really hard to pick . I could gush about every single character . The work that Chandler -LRB- Riggs -RRB- is doing on Carl is amazing . I think all the actors would agree : Watching his transformation over the first three seasons of this show is a really cool piece of this show . He 's been expanding his role in very cool ways , becoming this child soldier that we 've gotten to know . He 's a character that I would recommend people pay attention to and watch . It 's watching these characters grow and change over time . That 's really the core aspect , and you do n't really see that in a lot of television shows . When you look at season 3 , sure , Glenn 's there , Rick 's there , Daryl Dixon 's there -- but they 're vastly different than they were in season 1 .

CNN : With a show that 's become so engaged with its fans , do you pay attention to reactions , either positive or negative ?

Kirkman : I 've gotten the benefit of working in the comic industry for 10 years . I 've always been very tuned in to fan reactions , message boards and all that kind of stuff . I 'm pretty good at ignoring the negative comments and not letting them get me too much . There 's always going to be negative comments . Honestly , I 've learned if you do n't have negativity in fan reactions , you 're just not reaching enough fans . With `` The Walking Dead '' being as popular as it is , I actually enjoy the negative comments . We 're reaching people to a point where they care so much , they voice their opinions .

CNN : You 've written two novels about `` The Walking Dead . '' Have you had talks about turning those into films ?

CNN : In a perfect world , how many seasons do you see this show lasting ?

Kirkman : I think we 'd be incredibly fortunate if we were one of those shows that got to go seven seasons . I think that 's a good possibility in our future , the way things are going . Hopefully , we 'll make it there . At the same time , this is a very unique show . You never know . Personally , if I could wave a magic wand , I 'd make it go 20 seasons . This is the kind of story that is exciting to watch these characters grown and change over time . The comic book has been going for a decade and probably will go for another decade , I hope . I have no intention of ending that any time soon . I think there will always be a wealth of story potential in a universe like this .
