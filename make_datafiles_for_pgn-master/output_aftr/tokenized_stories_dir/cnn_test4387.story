Rich 's maiden name , Eisenberg , appeared on April 30 in the Federal Registrar 's Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen To Expatriate , though she left in November 2011 .

Rich , 68 , is the ex-wife of billionaire commodities trader Marc Rich , who was pardoned in 2001 by then-president Bill Clinton for oil profiteering and tax evasion after he fled to Switzerland . The pardon was considered controversial because of Denise Rich 's financial contributions to the Democratic Party and to the Clinton Library .

As of 2001 , Denise Rich had made more than $ 1.3 million in political contributions to the Democratic Party since 1993 , including $ 70,000 to Hillary Clinton 's Senate campaign and $ 450,000 to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas .

Investigators told CNN at the time that there were Secret Service logs showing that Rich went to the White House the last night of Bill Clinton 's presidency .

`` It may not be coincidental that some of these high profile expatriations are occurring when asset values have been relatively depressed , '' said tax attorney Dean Berry of Cadwalader , Wickersham , & Taft LLP .

But Rich is not completely off the tax hook . According to expatriation tax legislation passed in June 2008 , she is considered a covered expatriate and will therefore have to pay an exit tax on the net gain calculations of her assets . It is still far less than she would have paid as a U.S. citizen with a large estate , however , according to tax attorneys .

`` Expatriation makes the most sense when asset values are historically low and tax rates are historically low . Her timing may have had something to do with that , '' tax attorney David S. Miller of Cadwalader , Wickersham , & Taft LLP said .

According to her spokeswoman , Rich renounced her citizenship because she wanted to live in London , where her long-time partner and her two daughters live .
