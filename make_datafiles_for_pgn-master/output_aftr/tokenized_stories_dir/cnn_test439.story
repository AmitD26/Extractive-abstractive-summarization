These details come from court documents obtained Thursday by CNN related to the deaths of the five Utah family members , documents that hint at a potentially deadly cocktail including the powerful prescription drug methadone .

`` The various affidavits written so that officers could fully investigate this tragic event seem to have raised additional questions as to the events that occurred that night , '' the Utah city 's public safety department said in a statement .

Chief among those questions : Who is responsible for the deaths ? And why did they die ?

There are no firm answers yet , though the court documents made public this week do shed some light on what authorities know and believe .

Once inside , they and eventually police officers came upon the eerie scene . The parents were in their bed , while the children were around it `` covered in bedding up to their necks . ''

`` Officers reported there was a red liquid substance coming from the mouth of Kristi Strack , '' a police detective wrote in an affidavit for one search warrant . `` All of the occupants of the home were non-responsive . Next to each of the victims was a cup/drink with a liquid inside . ''

The fire department has concluded , however , that `` there was no carbon monoxide leak '' and `` no toxic levels of any kind inside the home , '' according to an affidavit . Everything in the home was found `` to be in good working order . ''

A black bag put in an outside trash can , for instance , contained `` 10 opened and empty boxes of nighttime cold and flu medication consistent with generic NyQuil '' and `` two empty boxes of allergy relief medication consistent with generic Benadryl . ''

Inside the home , authorities found empty bottles of liquid methadone -- a synthetic narcotic used in the treatment of heroin addiction . The methadone bottles had come from a drug treatment clinic , authorities said .

Methadone contributes to nearly 1 in 3 prescription painkiller deaths in the United States , according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention findings from 2012 .

Police : ` Probable ... deaths were not accidental or natural '

The official documents do n't point a finger at any person , in particular , who might be behind the deaths .

Yet authorities -- who continue to investigate , including looking intently at things likely a laptop computer and cell phones found at the Strack 's home -- believe that the entire thing was intentional .

In a statement given Thursday to KSTU , another CNN affiliate , relatives of the Strack family said the release of the documents `` was shocking to our family and unfortunately it begins to confirm our suspicions . ''

The statement did not elaborate , beyond adding : `` We are upset about this new information and are struggling as we are forced to relive this horrible tragedy . ''
