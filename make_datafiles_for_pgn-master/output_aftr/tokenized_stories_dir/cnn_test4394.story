The CIA inspector general 's report -- completed in late 2011 , but just declassified in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by The New York Times -- raises concerns about the relationship between the organizations .

The investigation found `` irregular personnel practices '' and `` inadequate direction and control '' by CIA managers `` responsible for the relationship . ''

`` As a consequence , the risk to the Agency -LRB- CIA -RRB- is considerable and multifaceted , '' said a memo from Inspector General David Buckley to David Petraeus , who was the CIA director at the time .

CIA agents are prohibited from taking part in domestic spying and the report 's release comes in the immediate aftermath of leaks by National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden .

The AP reported that the NYPD Intelligence Division dispatched CIA-trained undercover officers into minority neighborhoods to gather intelligence on daily life in mosques , cafes , bars and bookstores .

It said New York police have used informers to monitor sermons during religious services and police officials keep tabs on clerics and gather intelligence on taxi cab drivers and food-cart vendors , who are often Muslim .

The New York Police Department blasted the report as `` fictional , '' at the time .

NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne hailed the cooperation between the agencies .

`` We 're proud of our relationship with CIA and its training expertise , which is in part responsible for the fact that the 11 years since 9/11 and the anthrax attacks soon thereafter mark the first decade in the last six in which there has n't been a single casualty of a terrorist attack in New York City , '' he said in a statement . `` Not that the terrorists have stopped trying .
