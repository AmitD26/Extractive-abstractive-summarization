Jose Antonio Arias , the owner of El Asador Guadalmina , defiantly vowed a week ago that no one would close his business . But Thursday he said he had decided to obey the law out of concern for his 16 employees and their families .

`` I have decided to accept the law , '' Arias told reporters at a news conference at his restaurant , hours after regional health authorities said he had written to them , agreeing to adhere to the law that prohibits smoking in all indoor bars and restaurants .

Authorities said he still faces a nearly $ 200,000 fine for allowing smokers in his locale for nearly six weeks after the new law took effect January 2 .

Arias last week told Spanish media he would never pay the fine , and health officials sent police on February 10 to close his restaurant , located near the popular southern Mediterranean resort of Marbella .

Before the shutdown , Arias said , `` I am using my constitutional rights as a citizen and I 'm not going to be run over by this dictatorial , Marxist , terrorist government . ''

The twice-elected Socialist government won backing for a law in 2006 that essentially allowed many bars and restaurants to choose if they would prohibit smoking . But as smoking continued across Spain , parliament followed up with the tougher one that banned such indoor smoking .

The law puts Spain in line with the strictest European countries -- Britain , France and Italy -- which prohibit smoking in all enclosed public spaces .

Regional health inspectors visited Arias ' restaurant Wednesday to confirm that large signs which previously stated `` this law will not be applied in our establishment '' had been replaced with others that say smoking is prohibited , a regional health service spokeswoman told CNN .
