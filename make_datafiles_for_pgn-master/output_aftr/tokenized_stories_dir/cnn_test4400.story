-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Namibia , the question of who owns the wildlife has often been fraught with difficulties .

In 1967 -- one year after the United Nations demanded South Africa leave Namibia -- the ruling South African apartheid government gave ownership of the local fauna to -LRB- predominantly -RRB- white landowners .

When John Kasaona was a young boy , his father did what many men did at the time ; he poached .

The practice was , of course , illegal , and the landowners often came down hard on poachers .

Though the authorities arrested perpetrators , poaching remained rampant in the 1970s and 1980s as bad droughts and a war for independence ravaged local livestock . As a result , many species in Namibia were facing extinction .

`` In the private lands , wildlife was doing quite well , '' notes Chris Weaver , head of the World Wildlife Fund-Namibia -LRB- WWF-Na -RRB- . `` On the communal lands , though , it was at near historic lows . ''

The novel idea -- to protect wildlife by enlisting those most skilled at tracking it -- was the brainchild of the Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation -LRB- IRDNC -RRB- , an NGO of which Kasaona is now the director . One of the founders of IRDNC , a conservationist named Gareth Owen-Smith , formed the idea for the game guard system in tandem with the local Herero herdsmen .

When Namibia gained independence in 1990 , the government recognized the successes achieved by the game guard system , and enlisted IRDNC 's help in rolling it out on a national scale . By 1996 , the idea had matured ; rather than merely paying local communities to look after wildlife , the government used ownership as an incentive . In exchange for forming a `` community conservancy '' a community was given the rights to the animals on their land .

`` If people feel they really own a resource , if they feel they have responsibility for it , they 're going to be accountable , and they 're going to look after it , '' notes Jacobsohn . `` It 's just a very logical thing . If you rent an apartment , you 'll treat it one way . If you own it , you might treat it slightly better . ''

The initial funding came from the government and NGOs , including IRDNC and the WWF , who , with USAid , has invested $ 48 million into the conservancy program since 1993 .

Looking at the numbers today , it 's clear it 's been a huge success . The country currently hosts the world 's largest population of free roaming cheetahs and black rhinos -LRB- where once they teetered on the edge of extinction -RRB- . In the last decade , the elephant population has risen from around 13,000 to 20,000 . In the northwest of the country , where lions were down to under two dozen , they now total roughly 130 .

The goal , though , has always been for conservancies to become self-sufficient , as owning wildlife is n't enough to ensure its protection . In order for the conservation scheme to really work , people on the land had to recognize they could benefit more from the animals alive than - as Jacobsohn says - `` in their cooking pots . ''

When the conservancy system started in 1996 , there were four areas pulling in a negligible income . Today , there are over 74 earning a combined total of more than $ 4.8 million . Most of the money is derived from joint venture tourism , with trophy hunting following in at a distant second . Many conservancies have used the influx of money to better develop their local schools , provide support programs for individuals with HIV/AIDS and improve infrastructure and a range of other rural development projects .

However since then , Torra has become the first conservancy to partner with a private business . The Damaraland Camp pays rent to the conservancy and hires locals from within the community -- one from every household .

There are other effects of the conservancy program , some that do n't follow strict principals of conservation . The practice of trophy hunting has proved controversial , invoking ire from various animal rights activists .

`` From my perspective , we 're trying to conserve the species , not the individual animal , and this creates a benefit when it 's done in a well-regulated fashion , and the benefits go to the local community , '' he says .
