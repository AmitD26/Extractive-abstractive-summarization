How do those who clogged the streets of Egypt on Wednesday wanting so desperately to oust Mohamed Morsy , the now-deposed president of Egypt , feel about the future now it appears to be wide open ?

We spoke to them again Friday about how they felt when Morsy was toppled , their thoughts on what should happen next and their concerns for the future of a country they are fighting so hard to change . This is what they had to say :

I was at Tahrir Square during the announcement of the army 's statement . -LSB- The -RSB- square exploded with joy once protesters knew that Morsy was no longer the president . People were singing , chanting , singing and waving Egyptian flags . Fireworks were all over the square . Military helicopters flew over the square for hours .

I was happy that Morsy was toppled , but I was concerned , too . The fact that the army is back on the political scene makes me worry . The road map is what we have been calling for since -LSB- former Egyptian president -RSB- Mubarak 's ousting . I wish Morsy had called for early presidential elections and saved the whole situation .

iReport opinion : It 's an Egyptian revolution , not a coup

It was such an interesting day . I went to -LSB- Tahrir -RSB- Square around 4 p.m. , as I wanted to see how people would react to the speech . People started shaking hands and celebrating after hearing -LSB- the -RSB- news -LSB- of -RSB- Morsy 's ousting . I sat down in a corner of the square and observed people celebrating and tried to capture it on camera .

ElBaradei : ` Morsy 's ouster was needed so Egypt can not fail '

The army ... is very keen to make sure that their interests are protected before the country becomes uncontrollable . This army made it clear , by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before .

It is sad to see Morsy destroy the political future of the Muslim Brotherhood -LSB- Islamist movement backing Morsy that rose to power after the fall of Mubarak -RSB- by sticking to power and not allowing a smooth transition . The Brotherhood has a great grassroots structure that should be utilized to build Egypt .

Those in power now should focus on economic reform to reach the demands of the lower income brackets . Also , education and gender equality should be a priority to empower youth and women -- two factors any economy depends on to progress .

Events in Egypt : What we know so far

I was following the news from home in front of the television and on my laptop on social networks , along with my family . When the news was announced -- it was like Egypt had just won the World Cup in soccer . Everyone was happy and my parents cried from joy . -LSB- People in -RSB- cars in the street began cheering for the news .

Opinion : Get ready for the extremist backlash

I 'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country , so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling .

Nothing should happen to Morsy . He should be free to live wherever he wants and however he wants . Whoever is in power now should prepare fast for presidential elections and complete the transitional period as early as possible .

The people should observe the progress done -LSB- so far -RSB- -- and protest again if something goes wrong against their will .
