High River is one of the worst-affected areas in the flooding that began after torrential mountain rains . At one point , the entire town of 13,000 was covered in brown floodwater and all residents are under an evacuation order , Cpl. Laurel Kading of the RCMP told CNN .

There was `` substantial '' and `` extensive '' damage in the town , where waters rose so rapidly Thursday that about 1,000 people had to be airlifted or rescued by boat , the RCMP said . Kading described one man who dropped his keys when the water began rising , and when he stood up , the water was at his waist .

The local news site High River Online reported river levels down substantially on Saturday in some parts of the town , but high water remaining in others .

`` All the little towns all the way along have been affected to some degree or another , '' Kading said . `` There are reports of some farms in rural areas where some people have been stranded as well . ''

The city predicted water to spill over the banks overnight Saturday and keep rising until it crests Monday morning .

About 10,000 people in Medicine Hat , population 62,000 , were evacuated ahead of the flooding . City spokesman Brandy Calvert said officials expect the flood to eclipse the one they had in 1995 , which was the biggest on record .

`` We do n't want to anticipate the worst , but we 're going to be prepared for the worst , '' Alberta Premier Alison Redford said before visiting the city Saturday . `` We know that from what we 've seen everywhere else that this is more exceptional than we 've ever seen in Alberta before , so we 're presuming that that 's probably the circumstance that we 're looking at -LRB- in Medicine Hat -RRB- as well . ''

The home of the NHL Calgary Flames , the Saddledome , also was flooded . The team posted pictures on its website showing the darkened interior of the dome with brown water sitting at row eight , blocking the entrance to the players ' tunnel .

Downtown Calgary will be closed until the middle of next week at the earliest , said Nenshi 's spokesman , Daorcey Le Bray .

A pedestrian bridge over the Elbow River was damaged and city assessors were trying to determine the state of the dozens of other bridges , Calgary Police said .
