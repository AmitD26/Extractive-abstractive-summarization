Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States expressed concern Thursday about recent arrests in Zimbabwe of political and civil society activists and allegations by their lawyer that some of them were tortured .

On February 19 , former Movement for Democratic Change Member of Parliament Munyaradzi Gwisai and 45 other labor union and student activists `` who had gathered peacefully to discuss recent events in Egypt '' were arrested and charged with treason , State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said in a statement .

Other political and civil society activists have also been arrested , he said .

`` Gwisai 's defense attorney has reported that several of the 46 people were tortured while in custody , and we understand that the magistrate has ordered physical examinations to substantiate those claims , '' he said . `` We call on the government to provide medical attention for those who need it and , if torture occurred , to take immediate action to hold the perpetrators accountable . ''

A ruling on the charges ' merits is to be delivered March 7 .

`` On 16 February they held a meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to organize , strategize and implement the removal of a constitutional government of Zimbabwe by unconstitutional means , the Tunisian-Egyptian way , '' prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said last week in court .

At least 12 of the activists were beaten with broomsticks on their buttocks and the soles of their feet , defense attorney Alec Muchadehama told a packed courtroom on Thursday . All 46 defendants were charged with treason , a charge that carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe .
