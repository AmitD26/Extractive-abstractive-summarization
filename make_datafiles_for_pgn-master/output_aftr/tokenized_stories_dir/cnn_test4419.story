-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The possibility of sinking is the last thing you want to think about when booking a carefree vacation at sea .

Yet colorful ads depicting people having the time of their lives on cruise ships are now competing with frightening footage of Costa Concordia passengers , some still elegantly dressed for dinner , on a desperate quest to escape the ship .

The vessel struck rocks off the western Italian coast Friday night and rolled onto its side , leaving at least 11 people dead .

`` This is n't some tugboat off Italy . This is a very modern cruise ship , very similar to ships that are currently in the Caribbean , '' said Fran Golden , a cruise expert and contributor for Budget Travel .

`` It sure does frighten me , a longtime cruiser , '' wrote Carolyn Spencer Brown , editor-in-chief of CruiseCritic.com , about how quickly things went wrong on the Concordia . `` This was a systemic failure that should rock the cruise line to its core . ''

About 16 million people took a vacation at sea last year , according to the Cruise Lines International Association , which represents 26 major cruise lines .

The group called Friday 's incident a terrible tragedy , but asked travelers to keep it in perspective .

Some recent examples include the Louis Majesty , part of the Greece-based Louis Cruise Lines . In 2010 , two passengers were killed and 14 were injured when 26-foot waves crashed into the ship off northeast Spain .

To know how to survive an emergency , cruise passengers are required by law to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of embarkation . Costa Cruises says most passengers on board the Costa Concordia took part in an evacuation drill .

Nancy Lofaro , a passenger from New Rochelle , New York , said the drill was scheduled for Saturday , a day after the disaster .

`` I can only imagine the chaos of trying to communicate to passengers from , maybe , eight different languages how to get off the ship , '' Golden said .

`` People go on a cruise , and they think they 're in this protected wonderland , and the reality is you always need to have safety in the forefront of your thinking , '' Golden said .

Crew training in emergency response also is key .

A lot of the training is done by the cruise lines themselves based on international maritime standards , Golden said .

The Coast Guard inspects foreign-flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters twice a year , studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon-ship drills , said Cmdr. Buddy Reams , chief of the U.S. Coast Guard 's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise .

Still , no matter how many safety and training protocols are in place , the image of a submerged Costa Concordia will stay burned in people 's minds when they decide if they 're going to take a cruise , said Jonathan Bricker , a psychologist at the University of Washington .

To prevent any decline in bookings , the cruise industry will have to communicate how safe cruising actually is , he added .

That said , `` The vast majority of people who are planning to take a cruise are probably still going to take the cruise . And they 're going to be fine , '' Bricker said .

CNN 's Katia Hetter and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report .
