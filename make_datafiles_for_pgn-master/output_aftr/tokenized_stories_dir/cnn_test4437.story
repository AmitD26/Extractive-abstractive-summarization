Fresh from his summer break on the North Sea island of Sylt , the German finance minister effortlessly slipped back into what has now become a familiar routine : fielding questions about the eurozone

When asked if he foresaw any more bailouts , Schaeuble said `` No , no I do n't see , the problems are not solved but we are in a much better shape than we used to be some years ago . '' He pointed to the falling costs of sovereign debt and lower budget deficits across the common currency bloc and ruled out any more haircuts on outstanding government debt .

The chances of a non-Merkel win may be slim .

However , as per Germany 's political tradition , whoever emerges victorious will have to form a coalition with one of the other parties , thus clouding the policy outlook for those on the outside looking in .

`` I hope we will win , '' Schaeuble told me , then adding : `` We have to fight -LSB- but -RSB- I think the general mood is in favor of us . ''

As the dominant economy in Europe , Germany has been pivotal in helping to fund and direct troubled member states but its leader has to balance that with her nation 's reluctance to be viewed as the rich relative .

In this Schaeuble is steadfast : `` If Chancellor Merkel -LSB- is -RSB- re-elected I am confident that we will continue to work for a stronger Europe -- that 's our general position , '' he said . `` We do n't want a German Europe but we want a strong Europe and that means every member state including Germany has to increase its competitiveness . ''

That , he said was about each country doing its duty and ensuring it did `` not to ask for more money by others -- that 's the wrong way to get a strong Europe , that 's the wrong incentive . ''

Germany , which has the deepest pockets , is on the hook for the lion 's share of the support -- and as election fever sets in , so has bailout fatigue .

Schaeuble 's euro-speak is as fluent and comes from one who has both experience and economic clout . Yet up until now it 's a language that has n't dominated Germany 's campaign literature , which has instead been focused on issues like creating jobs , wages and the housing market .
