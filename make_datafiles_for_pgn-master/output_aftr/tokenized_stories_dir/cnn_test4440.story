The Chicago-based aircraft manufacturer announced over the weekend it had completed its first 787-9 Dreamliner .

Like the 787-8 , the new plane uses 20 % less fuel than other planes its size .

Pre-debut

The new plane rolled out of the factory in Everett , Washington , and is in the flight line awaiting its first flight by Boeing teams .

This year , Boeing has had a total of 82 orders to date for the 787 , with the largest order of 42 planes coming from American Airlines . Singapore Airlines has the second largest order for 787s with 30 planes ordered .

Approximately 40 percent of all 787 orders to date -LRB- not just this year -RRB- are for the 787-9 .

Boeing 's second and third 787-9 planes remain in final assembly . The company says the schedule is `` on track . ''

A troublesome year

The four-month global grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet after an ANA flight was diverted following a battery fire in January was the first such global grounding in 30 years . The grounding was lifted at the end of April .

As well as being lighter and more fuel efficient than other similar aircraft , the Dreamliner 's in-cabin experience is different too .

It has bigger , dimmable windows -LRB- out go the pull-down shutters -RRB- , it has LED mood lighting and is pressurized at 6,000 feet rather than 8,000 feet , making air sickness less likely .

`` We are working with our supplier partners to continue to introduce improvements to the 787-8 to enhance reliability , just as we do for all of our airplane models , '' said Boeing 's communications representative Julie O'Donnell . `` As the 787-8 and 787-9 share a high degree of commonality , we will apply relevant improvements to the 787-9 as appropriate .
