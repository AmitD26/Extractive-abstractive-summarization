'' ` Community ' has been a show that 's always on the bubble -LSB- to return -RSB- and we decided to bring it back again and see what a fourth season would do for us , '' Greenblatt continued . `` The reason we did 13 episodes -LSB- of Community and other shows -RSB- is we wanted to get more comedies on the schedule ... which is n't to say we could n't decide at some point to extend those seasons longer .

As for Harmon 's exit , Greenblatt said :

Asked if he would categorically rule out a fifth season , Greenblatt said : `` I would love nothing more than ` Community ' to have a following on Friday and be able to continue -LSB- beyond season 4 -RSB- . ''

NBC is premiering several new comedies this fall , including broad and wacky titles like `` Animal Practice '' and `` Guys With Kids , '' as well as potentially more risky shows like the Matthew Perry therapy sitcom `` Go On `` and Ryan Murphy 's unconventional family comedy `` The New Normal . ''

`` We 're in this awkward stage , '' said NBC 's entertainment president Jennifer Salke . `` Some of our new comedies might seem more commercial to you ... it 's kind of an evolving comedy brand . ''
