Surveillance video from Sunday shows Estell talking on the phone and then bolting through a 12-by-30-inch reception window at the Garland County Detention Center while another prisoner distracts deputies .

The vehicle was driven by Tamara Upshaw , who had been staying with Glenda Estell and was with her the day of Derrick 's escape , according to the affidavit laying out probable cause for Glenda 's arrest .

The same document details the Sunday phone call between Glenda and Derrick Estell , while the latter was in the detention center 's booking room .

At the beginning of the conversation , Glenda Estell says `` it 's all good , '' then asks if his shackles are off and questions `` is there two or three in there ? ''

The video shows Estell suddenly dropping the phone , jumping up on the counter , then escaping .
