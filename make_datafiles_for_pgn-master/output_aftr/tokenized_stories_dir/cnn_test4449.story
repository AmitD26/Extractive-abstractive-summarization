-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The psychiatrist treating the accused Colorado movie theater gunman was so concerned about his behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues , saying he could potentially be a danger to others , CNN affiliate KMGH reported Wednesday , citing sources with knowledge of the investigation .

Why Holmes was charged in ` unusual ' way

The `` BETA '' team consists of `` key '' staff members from various university departments who have specific expertise in dealing with assessing potential threats on campus , the school says on its website .

Holmes was a doctoral student at the university 's Anschutz Medical Campus until June , when he withdrew from the program .

`` Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team '' in `` the first 10 days '' of June but it `` never came together '' because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members , Holmes began the process of dropping out of school , a source told KMGH .

Sources told the station that when Holmes withdrew , the BETA team `` had no control over him . ''

KMGH said sources did not know what Holmes told Fenton that sparked her concern .

`` He would have to tell her he had taken steps to make it happen , '' another source told the station .

One source also told the station that the team may not have been convened because while Fenton had `` serious concerns , there may not have been an immediate threat . ''

It 's not clear if Fenton continued treating Homes after he dropped out of school , whether she referred him to another medical professional or had any further contact with him , KMGH reported , citing sources familiar with the investigation .

`` It 's the first I 'm hearing about this , '' he reportedly told the station .

During the week of November 12 , attorneys expect a preliminary hearing and an evidence hearing that will include several days of testimony .
