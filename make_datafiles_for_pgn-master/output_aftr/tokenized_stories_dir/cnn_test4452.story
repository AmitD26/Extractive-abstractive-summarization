San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway at San Francisco International Airport , the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday .

The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact , Deborah Hersman said .

The news came as the NTSB began to wrap up its investigation at the airport , where officials have begun cleaning up the debris left by the crash . Investigators turned over the runway , which had been shuttered since Saturday 's crash , late Wednesday , Hersman said .

How does an air crash investigation work ?

It will likely take a year before it establishes a cause for the accident , Hersman said . But , she said , it considers the investigation a priority and can make safety recommendations before its final report if necessary .

The NTSB has declined to give a preliminary finding of cause , but investigators have said the Boeing 777 came in too low and too slow .

The cockpit recorder shows there was no discussion of the flight 's speed during final approach to the airport until nine seconds before it crash-landed , Hersman said .

The NTSB chief spent several minutes during a news conference on Thursday clarifying reports that have shown up in South Korean media , including one where the pilot flying the plane reported being temporarily blinded by a flash of light .

Hersman said the pilot at the controls of Flight 214 told investigators that at about 500 feet before crash landing , he briefly saw a bright light `` that could have been a reflection of the sun , '' but he was n't sure .

The pilot told investigators he did not believe the light affected his ability to fly the plane , as it did n't affect his vision and he could see inside the cockpit , she said .

Shortly after Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed , passengers and witnesses pleaded with 911 responders to send help -- some frantically , some insistently .

`` I 'm reporting an airplane crash at SFO -LRB- San Francisco International Airport -RRB- , '' an early witness said in calls released by the California Highway Patrol .

`` We are responding , trust me , '' the operator responded .

Moments before , the 777 's main landing gear slammed into a seawall between the airport and San Francisco Bay , spinning the aircraft 360 degrees as it broke into pieces and eventually caught fire .

First responders were on the scene two minutes after the crash to tend to the injured , Hersman said Wednesday . About a minute later , there were firefighters equipped to douse the flames .

The dispatcher asks : Which runway ?

`` I do n't know what runway . We just literally ran out of the airplane . ''
