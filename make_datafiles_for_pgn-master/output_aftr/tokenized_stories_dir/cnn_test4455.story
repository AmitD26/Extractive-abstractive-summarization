Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AEG Live lawyers rested their defense case in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial , setting the scene for closing arguments to be delivered in a Los Angeles courtroom starting Monday .

Katherine Jackson and grandchildren Prince , Paris and Blanket contend AEG Live executives negligently hired , retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter .

Murray , who is set to be freed from jail next month , did not testify in the five-month-long trial because he indicated he would invoke his constitutional right to refuse to answer questions while his appeal is pending for his criminal conviction .

While the trial has been held in a small courtroom with seating limited to just 60 by the fire marshal , the judge decided Wednesday that the three days of closing arguments will be delivered in a larger courtroom that can seat hundreds .

Lawyers for Jackson 's mother and three children will call two more witnesses before resting their rebuttal case Thursday . Dr. Allan Metzger , who treated Jackson for nearly three decades , is set to take the stand Thursday morning .

Jackson 's pain was real , doctor testifies

AEG Live lawyers played video of Metzger 's deposition testimony as their last witness Wednesday , but Jackson lawyers say they want to ask him questions not covered when the deposition was recorded last year .

Murray told investigators that he gave Jackson infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for the last two months of his life to treat his insomnia . The coroner ruled Jackson 's June 25 , 2009 , death was caused by a propofol overdose .

`` Michael would seek out avenues of sleep helpers and that 's another aspect of his secrecy , '' Metzger testified . `` I never did know what he did when he was n't in L.A. ''

Jackson was `` secretive about medicine , secretive about procedures , secretive about all kinds of stuff , which was part of his mystique , '' he said .

Jackson was `` fearful because this is it and he needed to do a lot of perfectionizing , '' Metzger said . `` He wanted it to be something that had never been done before and it had to be great , so he had a lot of pressure from himself . ''

Odd twist in trial

`` He was one of the most recognized names in the world and he wanted it to stay that way , '' Metzger testified .

The doctor said he suggested they find a sleep expert in London , where his first 50 shows were scheduled , who would use `` safe modalities for sleep . '' Metzger conferred with other doctors in Los Angeles , hoping for recommendations to help Jackson .

`` I batted zero , '' he testified . `` Nobody had any specific people for me to call . ''

`` I told him it was dangerous and potentially life threatening , '' Metzger said . He warned Jackson that it should only be used in a hospital because he could overdose , have an allergic reaction in a hotel , be given a wrong medication or develop an infection .

`` It just is n't the right thing to do , '' he said he told Jackson .

A nurse who tried to help Jackson find sleep with vitamin infusions testified last month that Jackson became convinced that propofol was the only cure for his insomnia . Cherilyn Lee said Jackson asked her on April 19 , 2009 -- a day after his meeting with Metzger -- to find an anesthesiologist who could put him to sleep him with propofol .

Jackson lawyers contend it was around the same time that Dr. Murray agreed to take to job . Just over two weeks later -- on May 6 -- an AEG Live executive wrote in an e-mail saying that it was a `` done deal '' that Murray was being hired for $ 150,000 a month to serve as Jackson 's full-time physician .

Jackson lawyers began their rebuttal case Wednesday afternoon by calling Los Angeles Police Detective Scott Smith , who testified that he concluded Murray 's motive in Jackson 's homicide was the $ 150,000 monthly salary he was to get from AEG Live .

Jackson 's fatal search for sleep

`` Information was obtained that revealed that Dr. Murray financially was in ruins , was losing his house in Las Vegas , had a lien against his pool , was arrears in child support for multiple children to multiple women , '' Smith said . `` Financially , he was just a mess . ''

The key reason Jackson lawyers called Smith was to refute a statement made by Kathy Jorrie , the lawyer who helped negotiate and write the contract between AEG Live and Murray .

In court Wednesday , Smith testified that `` she did state that there was going to be a world tour that would last two to three years . '' He said it was reflected in his handwritten notes , as well as the typewritten summary of his interview with the lawyer for AEG Live .
