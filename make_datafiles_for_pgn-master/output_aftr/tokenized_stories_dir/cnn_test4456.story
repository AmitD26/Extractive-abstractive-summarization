The 14-time major winner has an ongoing left elbow injury which he first picked up on his way to winning last month 's Players Championship .

Woods ' decision means he will not defend the title he won in 2012 .

`` I was examined after I returned home from the U.S. Open , and the doctors determined I have a left elbow strain , '' the 37-year-old told the PGA Tour 's official website .

The British Open , which will be held at Muirfield , begins on July 18 . The American will be looking to win a first major title since the 2008 U.S. Open .

`` I have been advised to take a few weeks off , rest and undergo treatment , '' he added . `` I 'll be ready to go for the British Open , and I 'm looking forward to playing at Muirfield .

`` The AT&T National means a lot to me and my foundation . It 's especially difficult not defending at my own tournament . It 's going to be a great event , and I look forward to being there to provide my support . ''
