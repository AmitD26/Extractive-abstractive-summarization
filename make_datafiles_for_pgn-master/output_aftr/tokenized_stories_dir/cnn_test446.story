At issue was a balancing test between timely gathering of accurate evidence and privacy interests .

The high court struck down Missouri 's guidelines giving police broad discretion to forego getting a judge 's prior approval before executing a search .

`` We hold that in drunk-driving investigations , the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant , '' said Justice Sonia Sotomayor .

Law enforcement wants flexibility to conduct such `` searches '' -- saying alcohol dissipates over time and that delays getting a magistrate to sign off on a blood sample can mean justice denied .

But civil rights advocates say these kinds of `` invasive '' medical procedures are unnecessary and unconstitutional , absent any extraordinary circumstances negating the warrant requirement .

McNeely then refused a portable Breathalyzer test on the scene , and was placed under arrest . The corporal then transported the suspect to a local hospital when McNeely said he would not consent to a breath test at jail .

The motorist 's blood-alcohol content was 0.154 percent , nearly twice the state 's legal limit . Court records show the time lapse between the initial stop and the blood test was about 30 minutes .

State courts subsequently divided over whether the test could be admitted as evidence , prompting the Supreme Court appeal .

The Fourth Amendment protects `` the right of the people to be secure in their person ... against unreasonable searches and seizure , '' and that `` no warrants shall issue , except under probable cause . ''

But the court has also said state intrusions into one 's own body generally require prior review and approval by a judge .

The Obama administration is backing Missouri , saying there is a strong federal interest in deterring drunk driving .

Indeed , the per se threat of a needle -- with or without a warrant -- may be enough of an incentive for suspected drunks to agree to less invasive breath tests . Both sides concede that dynamic already exists in many cases .

But Chief Justice John Roberts issued a separate `` concurrence '' to the ruling , lamenting the lack of the court 's specificity .

The decision will likely mean police may be required to adopt more extensive guidelines on its testing policies , narrowing the emergency exceptions to the warrant requirement .

The practical effect may be to force officers to streamline and speed up the warrant process , so that drunk drivers are tested before it is too late to preserve the evidence .

Sotomayor acknowledged that in her opinion .
