At its annual meeting in July , the International Whaling Commission passed a resolution calling on its member countries `` to cooperate to prevent and suppress actions that risk human life and property at sea . ''

Sea Shepherd claims it saved 800 whales by its actions during last season 's hunt . Japanese whalers killed 171 minke whales and two fin whales during the Antarctic hunt , according to IWC figures .

In a statement issued last Friday , Sea Shepherd vowed to take on the whaling vessels again .

Kano said Japan wants to continue research whaling with the aim of establishing that whale stocks are sufficient to resume a full commercial hunt in the future , according to Japanese media reports .

Australia 's government condemned Japan 's decision to resume its research hunt and its plans for future commercial hunts .

`` The Australian government remains opposed to all commercial whaling , including so-called ` scientific whaling . ' We will keep working to achieve a permanent end to all commercial whaling , '' Environment Minister Tony Burke said in a statement .

`` Australia believes Japan 's whaling is contrary to international law and should stop , '' Australian Attorney General Robert McClelland said .

Japan also hunts whales in the Northern Pacific , taking 100 sei whales , 50 Bryde 's , 119 minke and three sperm whales last season , according to the IWC .

Iceland and Norway also conduct whale hunts . Aboriginal whale hunts are permitted in the Danish territory of Greenland , the United States , Russia , and St. Vincent and the Grenadines .
