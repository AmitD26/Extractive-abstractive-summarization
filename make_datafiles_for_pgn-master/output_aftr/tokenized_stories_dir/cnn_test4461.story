Two years ago at the same tournament , Dufner led by five shots in the dying stages but he crumbled and eventually lost in a playoff to pal Keegan Bradley .

His 68 , two under par , was n't as sizzling as his 63 on Friday that tied a low score at a major . However , it marked his third consecutive strong final round at a major -- he hit 67s at the British Open and U.S. Open . Overall he registered a 10-under-par 270 .

His lone two bogeys came on the last two holes , when he could afford be cautious .

`` To come back from a couple of years ago , when I lost to Keegan in the playoff , feels really , really good , '' Dufner said in a televised interview . `` I 'm privileged to play in these tournaments and it is a great feeling to win one . ''

Dufner 's celebration was typically low key . He hugged wife Amanda and received a congratulatory hug from Bradley .

Bogeys on the last two holes did n't help .

He also could n't maintain his lead at last year 's U.S. Open , although Furyk at least owns a major .

Swede Henrik Stenson came third , three shots behind Dufner , with Jonas Blixt , another Swede , a further shot adrift .

Woods , still stuck on 14 majors , finished with an even-par 70 .

`` Is it concerning ? No , '' he told the Golf Channel . `` As I 've said , I 've been there in half of them . So that 's about right .

`` If you are going to be in there three quarters or half of them with a chance to win on the back nine , you have just got to get it done . ''

Woods dealt with an elbow injury earlier in the summer and said he played Sunday with a stiff back .

`` It 's been tight all day , '' the world No. 1 said . `` Just one of those things . ''

But if it was any consolation , Mickelson concluded with a 72 , six shots better than Saturday . He tied for 72nd , better than a mere two players who survived the cut .
