Canada 's ice shelves are also retreating fast . And as the Arctic warms , both glaciers and ice-shelves are launching floating islands into the sea that may threaten shipping , the fishing industry and off-shore oil and gas platforms .

Halliday noted in a paper presented at the Arctic Technology Conference in Houston last week that while `` management of a 3.5 billion-tonne ice island away from offshore structures may theoretically be possible , putting it into practice would be logistically very challenging . ''

One option , she said , would be to cover the surface of the ice island with carbon , which would accelerate its melting , but `` the challenge then would become dealing with numerous smaller ice fragments as opposed to one large one . '' And even a small one could be the size of a football stadium .

Scientists are only now beginning to research these ice islands and the rate at which they melt and divide , especially as the Arctic waters warm and the restraining effect of sea ice disappears . They have been using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles -- the undersea equivalent of surveillance drones -- to map the underside of ice islands .

Uncovering the secrets of Greenland 's ice

Derek Mueller , a researcher at Carleton University in Ontario , has been following one 12 million-tonne fragment that was one of the progeny of the 2010 calving of Petermann Glacier . Nicknamed Berghaus , it was still wandering around a year later near Bylot Island in Baffin Bay before finally disintegrating in the fall of 2011 .

Mueller will be presenting his research at the ArcticNet conference in Vancouver next week .

Mueller told CNN that that Canada 's ice shelves have been diminishing for the past century . But the rate has accelerated dramatically in recent years , and today they are just half the size they were only seven years ago .

As a graduate student , Mueller discovered a major crack in the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf in 2002 . On a visit six years later he was surprised to see the shelf riven with fissures . Since then it has largely disintegrated .

`` The ice shelves are on their way out , '' he told CNN . `` In several decades they may be gone altogether . ''

Ice islands may pose a greater threat than icebergs because they have a relatively shallow draft , Mueller says , which is often about 40 meters -LRB- 130 feet -RRB- .

`` This poses a significant risk to offshore platforms that are usually protected from massive icebergs by being situated in shallow waters , '' he said , especially as exploration for oil grows in areas such as offshore Greenland , and the Beaufort and Chukchi seas .

Along with the decline in sea ice , the disappearance of ice shelves that are thought to be thousands of years old is rapidly changing the Arctic landscape .

Ice shelves harbor surprisingly diverse collections of organisms in pools of sediment , organisms that might have value as enzymes capable of functioning in extreme cold and harsh light , Mueller said .

They have also acted as a sort of barrier , protecting huge glaciers from exposure to warming waters . Now that the ice shelves are disintegrating , these glaciers -- which are up to 10 kilometers -LRB- 6 miles -RRB- wide -- are thought to be melting more rapidly , and contributing to rising sea levels .

In the Scientific American blog last July , researcher Ben Linhoff wrote : `` In the four years our camp has existed on this glacial river , more meltwater is spilling out from beneath Leverett Glacier than we 've ever seen . ''

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , in its annual Arctic Report Card , published this week , said dramatic melting of the Greenland ice sheet had occurred in July , `` covering about 97 percent of the ice sheet on a single day . ''

All the evidence says that what in effect is the world 's source of air conditioning is getting weaker , with consequences that will be felt far below the 48th parallel .

Greenland 's glaciers and Canada 's ice shelves are diminishing fast , scientists say

@highlight

Giant ice islands are breaking off , sometimes floating into shipping lanes

@highlight

Yet the number of icebergs surviving south of the 48th parallel has declined

Scientists are just beginning to research the rate at which ice islands melt and divide
