-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Airports are n't exactly stress-free zones -- not yet at least .

It 's an irksome feature that may soon become a relic , thanks to the advent of mobile tracking technology .

Once inside , when they pass partnered shops , they can get pinged with offers .

Rather , it uses iBeacons and Wi-Fi routers to collect unique identifier numbers -LRB- or MAC addresses -RRB- , and only from devices with the Wi-Fi settings turned on .

`` The MAC addresses we use are scrambled , which means no one can be traced , '' he says .

EasyJet is trialing similar technology at London Gatwick , Luton and Paris Charles de Gaulle airports , also using iBeacon .

The carrier is starting small -- placing the devices at baggage drop offs and security areas .

The EasyJet app also uses the technology to alert passengers to ready their documents at key points .

Though still in its early stages , James Millett , EasyJet 's head of digital , anticipates it could have father-reaching uses .

The European low-cost carrier has been at the forefront of utilizing the newest technology .

In May , it started trialing inspection by drone on its fleet of Airbus A319 and A320 planes .

The airline is also looking into the use of virtual reality glasses to allow engineers and pilots to capture pictures of potential issues , and send them directly back to base .

Not everyone is comfortable with the new technology .

`` Who would n't be creeped out by the idea of having your phone tracked ? If I tell you someone 's tracking you , and do n't tell you why , of course you 'd be upset , '' says Jules Polonetsky , executive director and co-chair of the Washington-based think tank Future of Privacy Forum .

Transparency is key , says Polonetsky , and airports need to make sure to alert passengers to the when , how and why of this technology , and provide them with an option to opt out -- which both EasyJet and√Ç Helsinki Airport do .

Passengers who do n't wish to be tracked can either switch off Wi-Fi on their devices , or provide their MAC address to walkbase.com and smart-places.org . -LRB- In doing so , the tracking systems knows to ignore the address in the future . -RRB-

Mainly , though , he recognizes the many potential uses of this technology at the airport .

`` It 's a big space , and anything the venue can do to help me navigate it easily and quickly is useful . ''
