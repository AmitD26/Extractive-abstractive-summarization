LONGYEARBYEN , Norway -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment Tuesday .

Dubbed the `` Doomsday Vault , '' the seed bank on a remote island near the Arctic Ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management .

The inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world . In all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault Tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes .

The Norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near Longyearbyen , in the remote Svalbard islands between Norway and the North Pole . Building began last year .

`` The seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , '' said Cary Fowler , executive director of the trust . `` At these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years . ''

`` We believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , '' said Magnus Bredeli Tveiten , project manager for the Norwegian government .

The vault sits at the end of a 120-meter -LRB- 131-yard -RRB- tunnel blasted inside the mountain . Workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees Celsius -LRB- just below 0 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 C -LRB- 25 F -RRB- .

Svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world .

The Norwegian government says it has paid 50 million Norwegian Kroner -LRB- $ 9.4 million -RRB- to build the seed vault . E-mail to a friend
