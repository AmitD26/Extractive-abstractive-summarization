-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Variable wind , thunderstorms and the loss of 35 helium-filled balloons within a few hours of liftoff put an end to the flight of two lawn-chair-seated adventurers who never got out of Oregon .

`` They 're a little rattled , '' said Knowles . `` We are glad that they are safe . Kent is very disappointed they did not get what he set out for . ''

Couch and Lafta , seated side-by-side in a specially built rig , went aloft at Couch 's service station in Bend , Oregon .

At about 11,000 feet , the craft struggled to reach higher elevations , where it could catch air currents that would push it toward its destination , said Schliep .

That never happened .

The pair circled for three hours near Prineville , about 35 miles northeast of Bend .

The weather then became a larger factor as thunderstorms moved in .

`` Fareed said it was hailing and snowing on them , '' said Schliep . `` They got real concerned about that . They wanted to get down . ''

After attempting a first landing , the balloonists brought their craft down in a farmer 's field .

The flyers used balloons and the release of water to control their flight . `` The only way you can steer it is to get up or down to get in different air currents , '' according to Schliep .

After the rough landing Saturday , the rig took off again , sans adventurers . Knowles described the surreal sight while talking with CNN .

According to the team 's website , Lafta and Couch plan to launch a cluster balloon craft to raise awareness of the plight of Iraqi orphans later this year . Knowles said he did not know the status of the Baghdad flight .
