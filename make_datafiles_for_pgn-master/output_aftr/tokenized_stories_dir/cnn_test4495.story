-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A heavyweight tome of 536-pages `` On China '' was described by the New York Times as `` fascinating , shrewd and sometimes perverse '' .

The eclectic selection forms part of the elite football division 's campaign to encourage children to take up reading .

`` I encourage everybody to read as much as possible because knowledge is power and makes you a more rounded person , '' said U.S. midfielder Clint Dempsey , Tottenham Hotspur 's representative in the Reading Stars program .

`` Not every story will interest you but when you find one that does it can be really fun to get wrapped up in the story .

Dempsey , who has 94 caps for the U.S. national team , chose Alice Schertle 's `` Little Blue Truck '' as his favorite kid 's book and J.R.R. Tolkien 's magical epic `` The Hobbit '' as his adult selection .

Sports biographies featured heavily on the list .

Manchester City midfielder Scott Sinclair opted for Pele 's autobiography while Arsenal 's German defender Per Mertesacker picked out `` A Life Too Short '' -- the story of his former international teammate Robert Enke who committed suicide in 2009 .

`` On China '' was the choice of Ryan Nelsen , a New Zealander who recently left Queens Park Rangers to become coach of Canadian Major League Soccer team Toronto FC .

`` The schools we work in are those that have the most to gain from the program ; they have low achievement in literacy and high numbers of children from poorer homes .
