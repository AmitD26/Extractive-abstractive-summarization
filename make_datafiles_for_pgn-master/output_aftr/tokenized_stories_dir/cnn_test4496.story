-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the 4x100 sprint relay , it is the handoffs that decide the winner . Speed is important , but without a top-notch changeover , you 're out . The maneuver is a perfectly orchestrated move performed in a split second without looking .

It 's all about teamwork , something Tianna Madison knows a thing or two about . She was part of the U.S. team that won gold in the relay at the London Olympics , shattering the world record in the process .

As a role model , she is not shy to share her experiences -- including the downs in her life : `` I went from being World Champion long jumper in 2005 , to nothing in the last seven years , to now being an Olympian .

`` I dealt with a bankruptcy ; I had my home foreclosed , and these were things that happened and I was not honest with myself about why I was in that situation , '' she said .

Building on this experience , she started Club 360 , to give young women love and support , which they might not find elsewhere .

Tianna Madison : Club 360 is a personal development program for girls aged nine and up . We teach girls and young women the importance of living with integrity , honor , and self-respect and we do that through both online and offline activities . They can learn good habits , take their weaknesses and make them into strengths .

CNN : Why did you decide to incorporate your ideals of `` honor , integrity and self-respect '' into Club 360 's platform ?

I learned to be very honest with myself so I know exactly where I am . I can take those weaknesses and turn them into my strengths .

Honor means that if I say I am going to do ten reps , I will do ten reps. Sometimes 12 . It is important to me to bring honor to my sport , to the people I work with , and to my husband . I can only do that by setting the course .

CNN : How does teamwork play into it ?

TM : In a relay , you have to be trusted and you have to trust the next runner . That is what made our team successful . Allyson Felix trusted me to hand her the baton and I trusted her to give me a good target to give her the baton . In school when you have group projects or at work when you have to come together as a team , you have to trust that each person is going to deliver and you have to be trustworthy

TM : I had to deal with being molested in high school and what that did to my self-esteem and my ability to trust . I overcame this with the love and support of my husband .

But this is definitely not a sob story ! I also went from being World Champion long jumper in 2005 , to nothing in the last seven years , to now being an Olympian . I dealt with a bankruptcy ; I had my home foreclosed , and these were things that happened and I was not honest with myself about why I was in that situation . It was n't until -LRB- last -RRB- September that I was able to do that .

It took someone like my husband to give me the love and tools to help me change it . It was not something I could do on my own . That is why I wanted to start Club 360 -- so we could give these young women love and support as well .

CNN : What 's the biggest lesson you 'll take away from your experience in London ?

TM : No matter what stage you 're on , no matter where you are , it always comes down to your ability to execute . On the other side , the Olympic Games showed me that I was a part of a larger movement . While my role in that movement was in sports , the whole world was involved in a unity that was amazing to see .
