A team of 800 people has spent three weeks converting 11 acres of playing fields into the world 's most prestigious horticulture show , as famous for attracting royalty and celebrities as garden enthusiasts .

Over five days each May , 157,000 visitors troop into the Royal Hospital Chelsea in west London to see 550 exhibitors displaying magnificent show gardens , new plants and new trends in gardening .

After 30 years in the travel industry , Biggs became director general of the Royal Horticultural Society -- the charity behind Chelsea Flower Show -- in 2010 , and has already attracted a record number of members to the organization .

`` Whether you love the tiny detail of a plant or the great vistas of an elaborate garden , there 's always something you 'll find eye-wateringly beautiful . ''

Chelsea Flower Show takes between 15 and 18 months to prepare , so even as the final touches are being added to this year , a team is well into planning for the 2014 show .

Extravagant displays at Chelsea in the past two years have included an 80ft `` Magical Tower Garden '' and a `` Sky Garden '' with a suspended `` flying boat '' , both by the Irish garden designer and television personality Diarmuid Gavin . This year Gavin is not exhibiting , and Biggs says the focus is more on plantmanship , although she has promised at least one surprise .

However , she was not trained in horticulture and had never worked in the industry until three years ago . Instead , Biggs went into the travel industry where she worked for 25 years for the upmarket operator Kuoni , rising to become managing director .

In 1999 , when she joined the board of Kuoni , she became the youngest ever director , the first female director and the first non-Swiss director .

Biggs has worked on ridding the 209-year-old society of its exclusive image , promoting its charity work and has pushed membership numbers over 400,000 for the first time .

`` It was never intentional , but it was seen as a gardening club for posh people . We have tried to be much more open and engage people . It 's helped us to achieve a record number of members , '' she says .

She has overseen the sale of one of the society 's properties in London and used the money to invest in charity work , from promoting horticulture as a career option and funding plant research to opening an urban garden .

`` It 's one of my frustrations that people do n't know the RHS is a charity , '' she says . `` We need to make people aware of the scientific research , the work in schools , prisons and communities that we do . All of that work is funded by the success of shows like Chelsea . ''

Back at Chelsea , Biggs is preparing for another busy day from media interviews to overseeing the start of planting once all the structures , from pavilions and marquees to rocks , boulders and hedges are in place . She is wary of treading a fine line between tradition and innovation .
