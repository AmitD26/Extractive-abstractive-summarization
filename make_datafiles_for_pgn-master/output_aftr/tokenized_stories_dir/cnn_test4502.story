-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tourists become volunteer rescue workers . The connected provide power outlets and Wi-Fi . Performers lift spirits . Photographers preserve images . Doctors work overtime to keep hospitals running and patients alive .

Many offered their services in traditional ways -- donating money to relief efforts or helping to rebuild homes on the weekend . Others , though , found unorthodox but equally beneficial ways to help .

Here are just a few of those stories :

Going on with the show

The day after Sandy hit , New York actor Jacob Brent thought about what he and his fellow performers could do for the city . Broadway shows had been canceled , but Brent , who played Mr. Mistoffelees in `` Cats , '' had the idea to do a little singing and dancing anyway . So he got a message out to the theater community via Twitter :

Among the attendees was theater critic and student Sarah Taylor Ellis , who called it `` a total delight '' and shared several photos on CNN iReport .

`` Everyone was so glad to get out of their apartments and gather for a communal activity , '' she said . `` The tourists and residents alike were enjoying the unexpected musical entertainment , especially since Broadway shows have been canceled the past three days . ''

Hey New York , what 's up with the niceness ?

Salvaging a lifetime of memories

Photographer Limor Garfinkle walked through the hard-hit coastal Staten Island neighborhood of South Beach the weekend after Sandy made landfall , wondering how she could help .

Everywhere she looked , she saw photo albums in the debris . She knew she could n't replace the moments on film now sitting in piles of garbage , corroded with seawater . But perhaps she could help them make new memories . She gave her card to several families and offered them free photo sessions when they were ready .

Then she found Victoria Beckman , a Russian immigrant laying out family photographs and documents in the cold air along the two stone railings leading from her front door to the sidewalk . Inside , she had thousands more damaged photos to go through .

Her home had flooded with 6 feet of water .

Finding joy among the wreckage

She researched photo restoration techniques on the Internet and spent weeks rinsing the muck-covered images and album pages under cold water and laying them to dry on paper towels .

Beckman , who is living without heat in her gutted home , asked Garfinkle to keep the photos until she has a spot to put them .

`` These are pictures from all my life , my children , and I am very appreciative of her help , '' Beckman said .

And Garfinkle 's offer of free photo sessions to families affected by Sandy still stands . She can be reached through her website , 4mothersphoto.com .

Putting life 's problems in perspective

`` As I interviewed some of the people affected and companies trying to come back to life , I realized how each individual makes their own problem the biggest one of the moment . Part of my motivation was to show how easy we had it , '' he said . `` Four days without power or showering is not a big deal . Losing your house is another story . ''

Kennedy told her story on camera and showed Chiossone what little remained of her property . Kennedy 's emotions were raw as she described what it 's like to face starting your life over .

`` My husband died three years ago , we were hit with Irene last year , and now this . I 've got ta leave . I 'm done , '' she said , her voice shaking . `` We 've lost everything . I got married in this house . My son grew up in this house . There 's nothing left . ''

`` What was chaos almost a month ago here in New Dorp Beach now has gained a little sense of normalcy . '' he said .

` Spitting rhymes ' for Sandy relief

The storm flooded Eduardo Ramos ' apartment on Avenue C in Manhattan , but he feels lucky . He and his roommates had time to save all their belongings as the water was coming in , and his roommate 's family welcomed him to stay in their home on the Upper East Side .

They wanted to find a way to help on the days they could n't physically be in Queens , which led them to rapping for victims . The friends , who had recently begun performing freestyle hip-hop on the streets for fun , set up their amp and microphone and performed raps on demand for $ 1 , with the money going to Sandy relief efforts .

So far they 've rapped in Times Square , the Meatpacking District and Astor Place in Lower Manhattan , where iReporter and friend Chris Luna found them and recorded a video .

`` I feel like they 're going to need more help as people start to forget and life continues as usual , '' Ramos said .

Arriving by bus , train and plane , thousands of Mormons from across the country canceled their church plans one Sunday to help with Sandy relief . One of those volunteers , Joshua Brown , documented the day on video .

The Manhattan wedding photographer heard stories of loss , devastation and even some of hope from the people of Rockaway , New York .

He accomplished his goal . Between Vimeo and CNN iReport , his video received about 270,000 views .

`` I 'm hard-wired to tell stories , '' he said . `` I thought that this was the best tool to get more people . ''

Although he got his message across , Brown still worries .

CNN 's Daphne Sashin , Rachel Rodriguez , Henry Hanks , Christina Zdanowicz and Katie Hawkins-Gaar contributed to this story .
