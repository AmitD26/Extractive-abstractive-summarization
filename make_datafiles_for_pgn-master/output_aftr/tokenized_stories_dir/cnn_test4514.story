-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A news anchor and four other people were killed on Monday in a suicide bombing after armed militants stormed a TV complex in Tikrit , Iraq , police said .

At least two attackers wore explosive vests .

Political and sectarian violence has plagued Iraq throughout the year , with thousands of deaths reported . Tensions have pervaded the Sunni community , which has felt marginalized by the Shiite-dominated government .

`` Violence against media workers undermines the ability of journalists to carry out their work freely as well as the right of citizens to receive the independent information they need , '' Bokova said .

`` These killings are a significant deterioration from 2012 , a landmark year in which no journalists were killed for their work in Iraq for the first time since the 2003 American invasion , '' the report said .

`` That brief reprieve was part of a larger decrease in overall political violence , but that reprieve now seems to be over . And just as the underlying causes of political violence in Iraq were never resolved , neither have the underlying drivers of violence against journalists . There are simply too many triggermen ready to silence journalists , knowing full well that there is little that can stop them . ''

Other violence

Violence occurred in other regions of Iraq on Monday , police said .

At least six soldiers were killed when mortar rounds landed on a military base near Baghdad .

Four people died when gunmen attacked pet stores in southern Baghdad , and three people died when a bomb exploded in an outdoor market in the northwestern part of the Iraqi capital , police said .
