-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Dawie van der Walt said capturing the Nelson Mandela golf championship was `` special , '' you can believe him .

It was subsequently shortened to 54 holes due to persistent rain .

`` Winning The Nelson Mandela at this time , when it 's sad for everyone , everyone is mourning and tomorrow 's the big day , it means a lot and it 's something I can keep close to my heart forever , '' the world No. 337 told the European Tour 's website .

`` I have n't been in that good form , I 've been struggling with an injury , so this is almost overwhelming . To win the last event of the year is going to make Christmas a lot more fun . ''

Van der Walt won his first title in South Africa in March but slumped thereafter , missing the cut at the majority of his tournaments .

`` I was pretty relaxed coming home , '' said van der Walt . `` It helped that I had been in that position before . ''
