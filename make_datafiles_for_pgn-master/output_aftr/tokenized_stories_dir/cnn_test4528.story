But thousands of protesters , alleging electoral fraud , surrounded government buildings , camping in the snow and waving orange flags . Eventually , Putin 's Ukrainian allies capitulated . The Supreme Court called another round of voting , and voters dumped Yanukovych in favor of a politician , Viktor Yushchenko , who called for Ukraine 's rapid admission to NATO .

Skip ahead ten years and Yanukovych , elected president in a reasonably free election in 2010 , again finds himself facing angry crowds in Kiev 's Independence Square , or `` Maidan . '' This time the protesters demand he sign an association agreement with the EU that Putin has opposed . As before , Putin makes clear his disdain for the demonstrators and his support for Yanukovych .

Yet , when his client is forced out of office , this time -- after violent street fighting between heavily armed Berkut riot police and protesters hurling stones and Molotov cocktails -- Putin does not sit on his hands .

Opinion : How Putin carries out power grab

By contrast , Russian troops in Crimea was the one thing certain to unite Kiev 's factions , mobilize Ukraine 's population and prompt rapid Western action on economic aid . At the same time , military intervention promised a string of unwelcome repercussions : Western sanctions , visa bans for members of the ruling elite , asset freezes , diplomatic embarrassments , even perhaps exclusion from the G8 . For Russia , already facing a stagnant economy , such moves could only accelerate capital flight and scare international investors .

Even more perverse , invasion would throw away in one day two years ' worth of reputational capital , accumulated from a string of unexpected foreign policy successes . From isolation over Syria , Putin had managed to emerge as peacemaker in late 2013 , persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to pledge to surrender his chemical weapons .

By granting asylum to NSA leaker Edward Snowden , the Russian president could claim -- implausibly -- to be on the side of citizen privacy and transparency . Despite a chorus of gloom in the Western press , the Sochi Winter Olympics had passed without terrorist attacks or other disasters and with Russian athletes dominating the medals count .

If Putin-2014 was a militant expansionist , why did Putin-2004 hold back ? What to make , then , of Putin-2000 who , when asked whether Russia might one day join NATO replied : `` Why not ? I do not rule out such a possibility . '' Later there was Putin-2002 who said that the Baltic states joining NATO was `` no tragedy . '' Over the years , Putin acquiesced to U.S. bases in Central Asia after 9/11 , shared intelligence with Washington , agreed to cut nuclear arsenals by two thirds , and defied his own Communist protesters to establish a route through Russia for U.S. military supplies to Afghanistan .

In a poll one month ago , 73 percent of Russians opposed intervention in Ukraine 's politics . Comparable nationalist rallying points in the past such as Russia 's 2008 invasion of Georgia produced a spike in Putin 's ratings , but one that had completely reversed within a few months . The costs of the Crimean intervention , in reduced investment and international isolation , will last longer than the immediate rally behind the flag . So will the heightened tensions with other neighboring states that contain large Russian-speaking minorities , such as Kazakhstan and the NATO-members Estonia and Latvia .

That after 14 years the leader of an increasingly authoritarian state should start to make mistakes is not surprising . Such leaders tend to become trapped in an information bubble of their own creation .

They forget that the media they have censored tells them only what they want to hear , and that the `` experts '' they have cultivated are those that reinforce their own prejudices . They start to believe the verdicts of the courts they have politicized .

The result can be decisions that put the leader 's own position at risk . Gen. Augusto Pinochet , after ruling Chile for 15 years , came to believe he was extremely popular . To his dismay , a plebiscite he called in 1988 revealed that most Chileans would rather have a different leader . Other authoritarian leaders , such as Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua , have lost power after calling elections that they were sure they would win .

Yet , the information filter around Putin will make it hard for him to evaluate what is going on . Rather than recognizing his own mistakes , he will tend to believe stories of betrayal and external hostility . Unless the dissonance rises to such a level that it provokes a major rethink -- and he proves flexible enough to question his own action -- he is likely to continue miscalculating as the crisis unfolds .

Ten years ago , Vladimir Putin tolerated a Ukraine uprising , ultimately seeing things go his way

Daniel Treisman : Why did Putin take the bold step of sending forces into Crimea in 2014 ?

He says the costs will almost certainly outweigh the benefits for the Russians

Treisman : Like many authoritarian leaders , Putin may now believe his own rhetoric
