-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The sea of signs and flags held with defiant pride may have said `` 31 '' -- but the history books will note that Juventus clinched a record-extending 29th Italian league title Sunday , with three matches to spare .

The `` Calciopoli '' match-fixing scandal which saw the club stripped of its 2005 and 2006 scudettos and relegated to Serie B still looms large in the history of the `` Old Lady '' of Turin , but successes in the last two seasons have restored Juve 's fortunes as Italy 's top football team .

`` It was n't easy for us to reclaim our title this year , '' said coach Antonio Conte after the 1-0 win over Palermo that ended the hopes of second-placed Napoli and prompted Juve fans to invade the pitch at the Alps stadium to get keepsakes of the day , with some even cutting up the goal nets .

`` Starting out as favorites does n't do you any favors and we knew that the Champions League would take it out of us on a physical level , '' said the 43-year-old , whose team reached the quarterfinals of Europe 's top club competition .

It was his 10th Serie A goal this season , and 15th overall , making him Juve 's top scorer .

The victory , which came despite the 83rd-minute red card to Paul Pogba , put Juve 14 points clear of Napoli , who then beat Inter Milan 3-1 later Sunday to reduce the deficit again .

Meanwhile , Ajax clinched a third successive Dutch league title on Sunday , beating bottom club Willem II Tilburg 5-0 to earn a 32nd Eredivisie crown overall with one match to play .

Coach Frank de Boer emulated the feats of Rinus Michels -LRB- 1966-68 -RRB- and Louis van Gaal -LRB- 1994-96 -RRB- in winning a treble of titles , having also won five as a player .

It kept Ajax four points clear of second-placed PSV Eindhoven , who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-2 .

PSG had key defender Thiago Silva sent off after Gael Danic put the midtable visitors ahead , but Brazilian Alex netted a late equalizer .

Marseille had earlier ensured PSG could not wrap up the title this weekend by beating Bastia 2-1 on Saturday .
