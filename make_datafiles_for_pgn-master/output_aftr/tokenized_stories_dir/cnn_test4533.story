-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thirty one countries have abolished the death penalty but China , Iran , Saudi Arabia , the United States and Yemen remain amongst the most frequent executioners , according to a new report from Amnesty International released Monday .

The leading regions for executions , according to Amnesty , are Asia and the Middle East , with eight of the top 10 nations from those areas .

The totals in the Amnesty report exclude China , which carries out the death penalty more than the rest of the world combined .

Chinese authorities could not immediately be reached for comment .

The human rights group flagged China , along with Egypt , Indonesia , Iran , Laos , Libya , Malaysia , Thailand , United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia and Yemen , on imposing death sentences for drug-related crimes .

The level of public support for capital punishment in the United States has stayed relatively steady during the last decade , according to Gallup . Five out of the last 10 years , 64 % of Americans have backed the death penalty in cases of murder . About three in 10 oppose executions .

Amnesty sees hope in the 25 % decline in executions as the group pushes for abolishment .

`` Any country that continues to execute is flying in the face of the fact that both human rights law and UN human rights bodies consistently hold that abolition should be the objective , '' Shetty said .
