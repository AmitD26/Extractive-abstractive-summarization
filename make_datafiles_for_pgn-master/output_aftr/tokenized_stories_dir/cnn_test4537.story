`` The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas , '' NATO said in a statement .

On Friday , fighting continued in the western town of Yefren , where NATO-allied aircraft destroyed government tanks and personnel carriers , officials said .

NATO reported that government forces were continuing `` to attack the peoples of the western highlands , '' Lorimer said .

Talhat al-Jiwayli , a rebel on the front lines in Zintan , also said that anti-Gadhafi forces were surrounding the town of al-Rayyana , more than 7 miles northeast of Zintan .

In other measures against Gadhafi 's forces Thursday , NATO airstrikes hit four surface-to-air missile launchers near Tripoli ; a tank , two armored personnel carriers and an ammunition storage facility near Mizdah ; more ammunition storage facilities near Hun and Qaryat ; two armored fighting vehicles near Sirte ; and a command and control node in Brega and nearby radar , according to NATO .

The resolution approved by the U.N. Security Council in March authorized member states `` to take all necessary measures to protect civilians under threat of attack in the country , including Benghazi , while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory . ''
