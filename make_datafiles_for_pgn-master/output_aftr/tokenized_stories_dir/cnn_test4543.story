TBLISI , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian forces launched an airstrike against a military airfield near the Tbilisi International Airport early Sunday , despite international calls for Russia to stand down from the escalating conflict , Georgian officials told CNN .

The attack near the Georgian capital city came after a day of intense fighting in the former Soviet republic , with dozens of Russian warplanes bombing civilian and military targets in Georgia on Saturday .

Tskhinvali residents who survived the bombardment by hiding in basements and later fled the city estimated that hundreds of civilians had died . They said bodies were everywhere , according to The Associated Press .

Alexander Lomaia , secretary of Georgia 's National Security Council , said dozens of Georgian troops had lost their lives . Watch Georgian minister describe fighting in South Ossetia ''

Lomaia said Georgian troops in Tskhinvali were engaged in fierce ground battles on Saturday with Russian troops , whom he said were engaged in a full-scale military operation .

The operation included tanks , armored vehicles , heavy artillery , soldiers and paratroopers , Lomaia said .

He said he could n't confirm whether Georgia 's capital , Tbilisi , had been hit .

`` From the legal point of view , our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate , '' Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in Vladikavkaz , the capital of the Russian region of North Ossetia . `` Moreover , they are necessary . ''

He arrived in the region that borders South Ossetia on Saturday night .

Putin 's press secretary told Interfax that the premier was concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia . Russian officials said that more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days , Interfax reported .

`` The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime , of course , primarily a crime against their own people , '' Putin said .

Russians struck several major targets Saturday , including the Black Sea port of Poti , an airport , a major pipeline and a military base and train station in Senaki in western Georgia , Lomaia said . Georgian officials said that a center housing civilians had also been hit . Eight Georgians died in the port town , Georgian officials said .

The Kodori Gorge in upper Abkhazia -- a second breakaway province in Georgia -- was also bombarded by at least 12 Russian jets , Lomaia said .

Military bases at Vaziani and Marneuli also came under attack , the British Foreign Office said , and Russian aircraft bombed the Georgian town of Gori , about 35 miles northwest of Tbilisi , Georgian officials said .

An Associated Press reporter who visited Gori shortly after the Russian airstrikes Saturday saw several apartment buildings in ruins , some still on fire , and scores of dead bodies and bloodied civilians . The elderly , women and children were among the victims .

A Russian naval fleet was anchored in the Black Sea port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia province , Lomaia added .

`` We have managed to down 10 Russian jets , and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital , '' Lomaia said . `` We have also destroyed up to 30 Russian tanks and heavy military -LSB- vehicles -RSB- . ''

Russian tanks began rolling into Georgia on Thursday night .

The order is not a formal declaration of war and stops short of declaring martial law , according to Georgian officials .

U.S. President Bush , speaking from Beijing , China , called for an immediate halt to the violence , a stand-down by all troops and an end to the Russian bombings . He urged the sides to return to `` the status quo of August the 6th . '' Watch Bush express concerns over situation ''

`` The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia . They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis , '' Bush said in a statement while attending the Olympic Games , according to The Associated Press .

`` This unprovoked , long-time-ago-planned invasion and aggression must stop , '' he said .

It was unclear which side controlled Tskhinvali on Saturday . The Georgians said fighting raged , but the Russians said they had `` liberated '' the city .

`` Battalion task forces have fully liberated Tskhinvali of Georgian armed forces and started pushing Georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces , '' General Vladimir Boldyrev , commander of the Russian Ground Forces , told Interfax .

Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry , said that Georgians had shot down two Russian aircraft , contradicting Georgian claims .

Georgia , a pro-Western ally of the United States , is intent on asserting its authority over South Ossetia and Abkhazia . Both have strong Russian-backed separatist movements .
