Monson , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In California , water flows uphill toward money and power . That 's a well-known maxim out here , especially in the Dust-Bowl-ready Central Valley -- that forgotten stretch of California that grows 40 % of U.S. fruits , nuts and other table foods .

Meet a few people and it 's easy to see why .

There 's Joel Sampedro , 56 , whose garden hose started spitting out sand , not water , about this time last year ; or Simona MagaÃ ± a , a 70-year-old former farm worker who stores water in buckets in the back of a rusty yellow pickup truck because her well is busted and there 's no reliable public system for her to hook up to ; she uses that nonpotable water to wash dishes , take showers and `` flush '' the toilet ; or Eunice Martinez , 48 , who , like many here , makes a distinction between `` water , '' which is the stuff that comes from her tap , and which is usually too polluted to drink , and `` drinking water , '' which is the stuff she buys in plastic bottles .

It 's the same California John Steinbeck chronicled in `` The Grapes of Wrath , '' the epic book about `` Okies '' who left the Great Plains during the Dust Bowl and fled to farms here . Some of them are still around . On Tuesday , I went to the town of Tooleville -LRB- nickname : `` Little Okie '' -RRB- ; and the unincorporated town of Monson . There , I met Clarence Harms , whose family came to this supposed promised land from Kansas and Oklahoma when the dust storms made life back there unbearable .

I want to get to know this river , at a river 's pace , on a river 's terms .

I 'm hoping to end beneath the Golden Gate Bridge in early July .

You can follow the journey on Twitter , Instagram and Facebook . Or , to make it easier , there 's a page on CNN.com that will collect all that stuff for you .

Both are about a river , but they 're slightly different .

Version1 : The water is clean and pure . Someone is struggling to swim , but Sampedro is able to grab this anonymous person and pull him or her out to safety .

Version2 : The river is polluted , which makes it not unlike the water that comes out of her tap . She and her husband use a $ 900 water filter/robot -LRB- it looks like a miniature version of Eve from WALL-E -RRB- to remove the nitrates from the water that comes out of their sink . They both work on fruit orchards , picking crops in the 100-degree heat , paid by the weight , and making about $ 26,000 , together , per year .

In that second dream , again , the person in the river is drowning .

The unnamed figure drowns .

She wakes up to a life where she and her husband would have no water at home if it were n't for the generosity of Clarence , their neighbor , who gives them water from his well . They 're all worried his well could go dry , too .

There are potential fixes for all this , and state programs that are trying to bring safe water to more people in the Central Valley and elsewhere .

But there 's just not enough water to go around .

That 's the history . And , if more 's not done , it 's looking like the future .
