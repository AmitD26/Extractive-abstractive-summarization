-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Can the media get over their collective obsession with weight ?

Fat chance .

It 's easy , it 's fun , it 's good for clicks and ratings . It 's also kinda cheap .

But this is national news ? Really ?

This is an uncomfortable reminder that the media business celebrates models bordering on anorexic , making perfectly proportioned young girls and women feel heavy because they do n't have superthin -LRB- and often airbrushed -RRB- celebrity bodies .

The governor showed he had lost none of his feistiness after Connie Mariano , a former White House physician , said on CNN : `` I worry that he may have a heart attack , he may have a stroke . ... I worry about this man dying in office . ''

Christie upbraided her Wednesday for diagnosing him without an examination : `` She must be a genius . She should probably be the surgeon general of the United States . '' He said she was just another hack seeking `` her five minutes on TV . ''

If I never read another word about Michelle Obama 's behind , I may go celebrate with a Krispy Kreme .
