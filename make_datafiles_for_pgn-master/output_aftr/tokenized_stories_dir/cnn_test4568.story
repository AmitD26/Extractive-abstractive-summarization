Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Insurgents were able to use a mass-market software program to view live feeds from U.S. military Predator drones monitoring targets in Iraq , a U.S. official indicated to CNN Thursday .

The inexpensive software , created by a Russian company called SkyGrabber , is downloadable off the Internet . It allows users to take advantage of unprotected communication links in some of the UAVs .

A senior defense official who was not authorized to speak about the security breach said , `` This was an old issue for us and it has been taken care of , '' but he would not elaborate on what specifically had been taken care of .

The official said that many of the UAV feeds need to be sent out live to numerous people at one time , and encryption was found to slow the real-time link . The encryption therefore was removed from many feeds .

Removing the encryption , however , allowed outsiders with the correct tools to gain unauthorized access to these feeds .

Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman would not comment on any of the article 's details but said that any security breaches that arise are addressed .

`` The department constantly evaluates and seeks to improve both the performance as well as the security of various intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance systems and platforms , '' Whitman said . `` If and when we identify any shortfalls we obviously correct them as a continuous process of seeking both improved capabilities as well as improved security . ''

Lt. Gen. David Deptula , who is in charge of the Air Force 's UAV mission , said the military is trying to fix vulnerabilities with improved encryption on UAV feeds .

`` Those kinds of things are subject to listening and exploitation , '' he told reporters Wednesday when asked about vulnerabilities of UAV systems .

One U.S. official said special operations troops identified the threat `` years ago '' in Iraq and over the past two years have been `` vastly improving '' encryption on their various communications systems , including full-motion video .

The official said the United States generally can operate these systems with impunity in third-world countries that do n't have the technology to tap into open satellite feeds . However , according to the official , Iran has been pushing the SkyGrabber-like technology to Shiite militants in Iraq essentially to see what the United States is looking at because Iranians believe they will be invaded next .

The vulnerability could date back to the 1990s , said Peter Singer , a military technology analyst for the Brookings Institution .

The official said the drones employed by the intelligence community in Pakistan , which use state-of-the-art encryption technology , are used in a much more limited capacity than the military drones .

He said the U.S. military has not contacted him about the reported security breach .

Solonikov insisted the software was not developed for the use it has been put to in Iraq .

'' -LSB- It seems that -RSB- somebody has invented a way to use this program outside of its intended purpose , '' he said . `` But generally speaking , this points to a large security gap that the American military has missed . ''
