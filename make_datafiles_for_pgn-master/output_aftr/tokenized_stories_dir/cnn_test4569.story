In just over two weeks , the multibillion-dollar Federal Highway Trust Fund will hit a financial wall . Yes , another fiscal crisis . This time with the account that funds road and bridge projects .

But unless Congress extends more funding by August 1 , the Department of Transportation says the account balance will dip too low and the agency will start pulling back on money paid to states for transportation infrastructure .

The House on Tuesday approved a nearly $ 11 billion proposal to keep the money flowing for about a year , and the Senate appears ready to follow up .

Take in five ways this highway crisis could affect you :

1 . Your car repair bill : Seriously . According to AAA , the average American spends $ 324 a year on additional repairs and maintenance caused by poor road conditions . And that 's just average . People in Los Angeles pay an estimated $ 832 a year because of bad roads , according to the nonpartisan TRIP organization which is funded by a variety of transit industry groups . It 's $ 673 in New York City , $ 784 in Tulsa .

It 's a lot of money . And now , because of the uncertainty with the Highway Trust Fund , many states have delayed repair projects slated for coming months .

Take New Hampshire , unhappy owner of massive cracks and potholes from the overly long winter . Thanks to congressional indecision , the state put off seven major paving projects and 11 other projects -LRB- including bridge repairs -RRB- . That bump you feel from the road could be a crack in the Highway Trust Fund .

Just last month , tax-averse New Hampshire enacted its first gas tax increase in 23 years . Even conservative Texas lawmakers are seriously considering it .

3 . Traffic problems : Here 's where things get really interesting . For some , the highway funding tangle could briefly improve their traffic situation . For others , it means a longer wait for help .

Where will traffic improve ? In a few places where road construction crews have derailed the usual traffic patterns . In those places , in the very short term , a freeze in funding could also freeze the hassle and bottlenecks caused by construction .

Where will traffic take a hit ? Places that need road or bridge expansions . Like southeast Iowa . A new $ 1 billion fertilizer plant is under construction near Ft. Madison and the state was planning to expand the nearby highway -- US 61 - from two-lanes to four .

Instead , Iowa DOT spokesman Stuart Anderson said the start of that work is delayed at least until October . So , the heavy trucks going back and forth to the fertilizer work site share the road , a smaller road , with everyone else .

Or Oklahoma , which is holding its breath , waiting as long as it can before delaying any work . Spokesman Terri Angier of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation said the state is planning to take bids for new road projects next week , but wo n't act on the bids until Congress agrees to a trust fund deal .

5 . Congress keeps acting badly , operating in crisis mode : Perhaps worst of all , lawmakers could walk away from this crisis , like they have from others , without any significant change in the impending fiscal problem . That 's true whether they meet the August 1 deadline or not .

But there appears to be movement toward a rare bipartisan solution .

Regardless of what happens with this deadline , the next Congress is likely to face another Highway Trust Fund crisis next May . Just in time for your Memorial Day .

With deadline looming , Obama to push infrastructure

No action could worsen road conditions , traffic congestion
