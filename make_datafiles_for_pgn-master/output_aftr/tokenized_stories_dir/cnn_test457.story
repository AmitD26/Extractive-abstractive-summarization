The signing came hours before the President 's office announced a three-day extension of a cease-fire . This is the latest step suggesting Ukraine may be moving back from the brink of full-fledged civil war -- though the situation remains volatile , with continued violence and the constant fear of yet more , cease-fire or not .

Sealing the deal may be the second-most important moment in Ukraine 's history , Poroshenko said , after its independence from Russia .

And he paid tribute , on what he described as a `` great day '' in the nation 's history , to Ukrainians who lost their lives when protests over closer ties with Europe turned bloody .

`` It is a tribute to people who gave their lives and health to make this moment happen , and it is the strongest reminder that today 's Europe is and must be about people 's determination to live in a better and safer world . ''

Poroshenko said that in signing the Association Agreement , he was making a unilateral statement that his country has underlined its choice of future membership in the EU .

He used the same pen intended for use in November before Yanukovych turned his back on the agreement in favor of Moscow .

Russian reaction

Speaking at a Brussels news conference after the signing , Poroshenko said what was needed more than sanctions was a `` real dialogue '' with Russia . The EU and the United States have repeatedly warned Moscow that more economic sanctions could be imposed if it does n't act to defuse the crisis .

`` I really hope that finally now this dialogue will take place and we will have a real cease-fire and the implementation of my peace plan , '' Poroshenko said .

Speaking in Moscow , Putin also emphasized the need for a lasting truce , according to Russia 's state-run news agency ITAR-Tass .

`` Ukraine should embark on the path of peace , dialogue and accord . The priority is to conduct substantial talks between the authorities in Kiev and the southeast , '' Putin is quoted as saying .

`` We stand for the complete termination of bloodshed on the whole territory of Ukraine , including along our borders , '' he said , adding that Russia is doing its best to contribute to the peace process .

The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement calls for a free trade zone and for Ukraine to adhere to European values such as democracy and human rights . It will allow for the country to participate in common border protection and security processes .

`` In Kiev and elsewhere , people gave their lives for this closer link to the European Union , '' he said . `` We will not forget this . ''

He also expressed the EU 's solidarity with the three nations in the face of Ukraine 's `` very difficult '' security situation , and the `` uncertainties '' looming over Georgia 's and Moldova 's relationships with Russia .

He stressed that Russia had nothing to fear from those nations ' closer ties with Europe , adding the EU would engage with Moscow to work for peace .

Putin -- pragmatic or emotional ?

As Ukraine 's government works to quell the violence in the east , Poroshenko has said that negotiations with Russian separatists there will continue Friday .

Peace is possible if Putin is in the right mood , he told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview Thursday .

`` Sometimes , the position of Mr. Putin is quite pragmatic , sometimes it is very emotional , '' Poroshenko said . `` I just try to find out the time when he is more pragmatic than emotional . ''

Putin has agreed to negotiations that will include an EU representative , Poroshenko said . `` We do not expect any immediate negative reaction , '' he said . `` I 'm ready to make a peace deal with anybody . ''

He is also ready to fight if necessary but said , `` I hate the idea not to use the last opportunity to bring the peace to the region . ''

Peace plan

`` All the troops on Ukrainian territory are Russian , they are Russian citizens , '' he alleged , adding that separatist leaders were from the Russian secret service . `` If that continues , it is a real war . ''

Poroshenko said that Ukraine had seen 18 soldiers killed and 33 injured in the past week , while the separatists had shown `` no negotiation , no sign of compromise . ''

At the same time , he made clear that in his mind , the Russian annexation of Crimea -- which has an ethnic Russian majority -- can not stand . Crimea is Ukrainian , he said .

Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since the annexation in March when Russia also massed troops along its western border with Ukraine .

That means that , by late Monday night , the Kiev government expects that all hostages will be released , all international border checkpoints will be taken out of separatists ' hands and the militants ' recruiting offices in Russia will close down .

At the same time , the Ukrainian government says it still reserves the right to use force in any areas where the cease-fire is not being universally accepted .

In fact , there have been plenty of examples of violence since the original cease-fire was declared .

Two days earlier , Ukrainian authorities said pro-Russia militants shot down a military helicopter in eastern Ukraine , killing nine .

Kiev and the West have accused Russia of failing to take concrete steps to ease the crisis .

NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged Moscow this week `` to create conditions for the implementation of the peace plan , to end its support for separatist troops , and to stop the flow of weapons and fighters across its border . ''
