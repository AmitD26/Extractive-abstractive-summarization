Battered and bruised , and knowing that the All Blacks ' other iconic star player , Dan Carter , had already been ruled out for the rest of the 2011 Rugby World Cup , McCaw soldiered on for three crucial matches -- four hours of on-field punishment

He hid the extent of his injury from fans , media , his coaches and teammates to keep alive his dream of being the first New Zealand captain to lift the Webb Ellis trophy for almost a quarter of a century .

`` We had a team that was good enough , but it does n't mean anything when you get to a tournament like that , if you do n't put it on the field where it counts .

When it comes to rugby , New Zealanders expect victory . Nothing else will do . Defeat is rare -- and as painful as the body blows that are routine for those who play one of the world 's most physically demanding sports .

The traditional Maori war dance that the All Blacks perform before every match -- known as `` the Haka '' -- is one of the most fearsome , and highly anticipated , sights on the international rugby stage .

`` It is something very unique to New Zealand , '' McCaw said . `` It 's who we are and were we come from ... a little island way down south , a long way from anywhere . It 's a pretty powerful symbol of what the All Blacks and New Zealand is all about . ''

So it was a matter of great national hurt that the All Blacks had not been world champions since winning the inaugural tournament in 1987 , also at home .

He suffered heartbreak in 2003 , losing in the World Cup semifinals to arch-rivals Australia , and in 2007 the All Blacks crashed out ignominiously against France in the quarterfinals , leading McCaw to reconsider his future as captain .

`` I did n't know what to say to Dan , '' McCaw recalls in his autobiography `` The Open Side . ''

`` Here 's a guy , a decent humble man , acknowledged to be the best of his generation , perhaps of any generation , who 's been crocked at the top of his game just when he 's about to perform on the biggest stage .

`` If I have to jump or run or push or tackle , I can do it -- adrenaline 's a great painkiller . But when play stops and I have to walk or jog to a lineout or scrum 20 meters away , I 'm really struggling . '' he says in his book .

McCaw played the full 80 minutes in a 20-6 crushing of Australia , then held on to the bittersweet end in a nerve-wracking 8-7 win over France in the title decider -- a rematch of the 1987 final that he had watched as a boy .

`` I was about age 6 and watching it on TV . The image that I have in my head is John Kirwan scoring one of the tries , '' he said .

`` That sort of stuck with me I suppose . I thought it would be pretty cool to be like him . ''

While Kirwan was one of New Zealand 's star backs , McCaw would go on to follow in the rugged boot prints of legendary forwards such Wayne Shelford , Michael Jones and Josh Kronfeld .

Having finally landed New Zealand 's holy grail , McCaw is hoping to play at the next World Cup in England in 2015 , when he 'll be 35 .

But after a long career as one of the most dynamic and influential forwards in rugby , it 's time to take a break -- a six-month sabbatical in which he plans to get away from it all .

McCaw has hinted that he will head to the U.S. and indulge his other passion -- flying .

His grandfather was a fighter pilot during World War Two , and he has continued the family interest , being named an honorary squadron leader in the New Zealand Air Force .

He flies planes , helicopters and gliders , and has even narrated an aviation TV program .

`` Dad flies , his brothers fly , a couple of my cousins fly , my aunty flies . We 've got flying in common . When I go home to the old man we sit and talk way more about flying than rugby , '' McCaw says in `` The Open Side . ''

`` You have the tag of world champions for four years -- you try to live up to that every time . I know what it 's like , I 've tried to knock off the world champs the following year .

`` If we have that sort of goal , that sort of attitude , hopefully we will keep that level where it needs to be . ''
