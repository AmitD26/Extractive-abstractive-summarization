The judge ordered that same-sex marriages be allowed starting October 21 . But the date could be delayed on appeal , and the office of Gov. Chris Christie indicated the case would be appealed to the New Jersey Supreme Court .

Read Friday 's ruling

After the DOMA ruling , some federal agencies are extending benefits to legally married same-sex couples , but denying them to same-sex couples in `` civil unions , '' Judge Mary Jacobson of Mercer County Superior Court wrote in her ruling Friday .

`` If the trend of federal agencies deeming civil union partners ineligible for benefits continues , plaintiffs will suffer even more , while their opposite-sex New Jersey counterparts continue to receive federal marital benefits for no reason other than the label placed upon their relationship by the state , '' Jacobson wrote .

Jacobson ruled on a lawsuit that six same-sex couples and their children , as well as gay-rights group Garden State Equality , filed against the state .

The group 's executive director , Troy Stevenson , said the ruling is `` amazing news . ''

An attorney who represented the plaintiffs also hailed the `` thrilling '' ruling .

`` We argued that limiting lesbians and gay men to civil union is unfair and unconstitutional , and now the court has agreed , '' said Hayley Gorenberg , deputy legal director of Lambda Legal , a gay rights organization .

New Jersey has recognized civil unions between same-sex couples since 2007 , after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state must allow same-sex couples all the rights and benefits of marriage . As far as state rights and benefits went , civil unions and marriages differed only in label , Jacobson noted .

Friday 's ruling came more than a year after Christie vetoed a bill that would have legalized same-sex marriage in the state .

On Friday afternoon , Christie 's office said it had wanted the `` issue of marriage equality '' to be on the ballot this November , but said the Legislature scuttled the effort . It also indicated that Jacobson 's ruling would be appealed .

Same-sex marriage is legal in 13 U.S states and the District of Columbia : California , Connecticut , Delaware , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Hampshire , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington .
