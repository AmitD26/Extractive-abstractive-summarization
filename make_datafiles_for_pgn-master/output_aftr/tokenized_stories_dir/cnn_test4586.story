-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Who was Robin Williams ?

In the wake of his death from an apparent suicide , that question looms large as fans and friends try to grasp how someone who brought so much happiness to the world could leave it under a cloud of such despair .

It 's the dichotomy of fame in that while a celebrity can be so well-known there are parts of their lives and selves they never share with the public .

And while only his loved ones truly knew the private aspects of the Oscar-winning actor whose performances could elicit tears as easily as they could giggles , Williams did allow us to see how multifaceted he could be .

These are just some of them :

The last image Williams left for the world on his Instagram was a poignant one : a black and white image of the actor holding his then toddler daughter with the caption '' #tbt and Happy Birthday to Ms. Zelda Rae Williams ! Quarter of a century old today but always my baby girl . Happy Birthday @zeldawilliams Love you ! '' He posted a similar image earlier in honor of his son Zachary 's birthday .

He often spoke lovingly of being father to the pair and another son , Cody . `` My children give me a great sense of wonder , '' Williams said . `` Just to see them develop into these extraordinary human beings . ''

The prankster

The actor was married three times . His union with Valerie Velardi from 1978 to 1988 produced his son Zachary . Williams was married to Marsha Garces from 1989 to 2010 , with whom he had Zelda and Cody . In 2011 , he married graphic designer Susan Schneider .

The breakups were costly for Williams , he told Parade magazine .

There was a good reason Williams has been so deeply mourned by his show business colleagues . He showed himself to be incredibly loyal to friends such as Jay Leno and the late Christopher Reeve , who came to love Williams before he was famous .

After Williams ' death , Leno said , `` I saw him on stage that very first time he auditioned at the Improv in Los Angeles , and we have been friends ever since . It 's a very sad day . ''

It was while students at Juilliard in New York City that Williams and Reeve -- who would find fame in the role as Superman in the '70s and '80s -- cemented a bond . In fact , after Reeve was paralyzed in a riding accident , he credited Williams with making him laugh again .

Reeve was about to undergo a serious operation when Williams showed up dressed in surgical scrubs and speaking in a Russian accent , saying he needed to do a rectal exam . `` For the first time since the accident , I laughed , '' Reeve said . `` My old friend had helped me know that somehow I was going to be OK . ''

The mentee

`` Williams ' finely calibrated performance was utterly free of the tics and affectations that are so tempting to someone who has come to count on and crave the audience 's love , '' Washington Post critic Ann Hornaday writes . `` Rather than seek his fans ' approval with the actorly equivalent of ingratiating winks , Williams was willing to completely inhabit a character who was somehow terrifying , pathetic , creepy and vulnerable all at once . ''

The philanthropist

As one of the co-hosts for Comic Relief 's debut in 1986 , he helped raise both funding for and awareness about the homeless . But that was just one of the many charities to which Williams gave his time and resources .

The sports enthusiast

Williams involvement with sports went beyond that time he dressed up a as Denver Broncos ' cheerleader for an episode of `` Mork & Mindy . ''

Die-hard fans remember his hilarious stand-up routine about the origins of golf , and he would often end up on the cam at various sporting events . The actor was a close personal friend of then-professional cyclist Lance Armstrong , who he would join in training .

Perhaps it was playing an alien that did it .

It turns out that Williams was a bit of a sci-fi geek who when asked his favorite book said , `` Oh my God , Isaac Asimov 's Foundation trilogy . It 's one of the greatest books of all time , and the greatest character is The Mule . ''

`` You know , I was shameful , and you do stuff that causes disgust , and that 's hard to recover from , '' Williams told The Guardian in 2010 . `` You can say , ` I forgive you ' and all that stuff , but it 's not the same as recovering from it . It 's not coming back . ''

Robin Williams and the dark side of comedy

Even then it seemed that Williams was trying to find his way . Asked whether he was happier in his life , he responded `` I think so . And not afraid to be unhappy . That 's OK too . And then you can be like , all is good . And that is the thing , that is the gift . ''
