Their reputation for being easygoing and adventurous is often expressed in clothing .

Gaudy colors and bad leisurewear are n't the thing in St. Petersburg -- here fashionistas are more likely to mix designer threads with Grandma 's castoffs .

St. Petersburg is n't about grabbing something boring off the peg , its about experimenting .

Best street market

Good street markets are hard to find in St. Petersburg , but a 30-minute subway trip to the northern suburbs takes you to a clothing goldmine where you can find just about anything .

These are best ignored en route to the main attraction : a huge field where on weekends hundreds of locals gather to sell attic plunder .

Vintage Soviet clothes , furniture , cameras , antiques , musical instruments , vinyl , old military outfits , pins and medals are all on sale -- as are weirder items such as breast enlargers .

Best garage sale

During summer , the monthly `` Garage Sale '' occupies the whole building , but the best finds can be made in the yard or on the terrace .

Even if there 's no market , it 's worth a visit Etagi to check out art and photo exhibitions and cupboard-sized shops such as Milnaya Belka -LRB- 2/F , Loft Project Etagi +7 812 980 11 66 -RRB- , which sells Russian and Asian designers .

Best retro shops

When the markets are n't on , you can still bag a bargain .

Off is located in a popular loft called Tkachi , where locals come to lay their hands on bicycles , furniture , shoes and musical instruments .

They 're not particularly stylish , but when it comes to handling the St. Petersburg rainy seasons -- all three of them -- it 's hard to beat a pair of Soviet gumboots .

These can still be picked up at the vast Red Triangle factory -LRB- 136 Obvodnogo Canal Quay -RRB- that once produced them .

If you 're not interested in the boots , it 's still worth a trip for a glimpse into St. Petersburg 's industrial communist past -- one that 's slowly being reclaimed by its capitalistic future .

Leonid Alexeev -LRB- 4 , Veselnaya Street , 4 , +7 812 322 08 96 -RRB- , the engine of the local fashion scene and one its most productive designers , sells haute couture and pret-a-porter clothes , plus accessories and perfumes .

Sticking with Asya Malbershtein , her accessories can also be found in 8-Store -LRB- Dvortsovaya Quay 20 -RRB- , one of several designer outlets in Taigaspace -- a beautiful 18th-century merchant house that also houses creative start-ups .

This clothing , accessories and flower shop is owned by a St. Petersburg socialite who , in addition to making the clothes himself , also runs a chic Sixties-style barbershop around the corner .

Best places to people-watch

For those who have mastered St. Petersburg style , there are plenty of places to show it off .

The best people-watching can be found in the large-windowed cafes on Nevsky Prospekt , a central street that 's busy and crowded day and night -- particularly in summer when the day is almost indistinguishable from night .

In the fashionable Rubenstein Street , party animals , foodies and local celebrities can be found mingling among the dozens of bars , upscale restaurants and coffee bars that include Mitte CafÃ © -LRB- 27 Rubenstein St. ; +7 812 416 14 16 -RRB- .

A more highbrow scene can be found at the art house foreign language film screenings in the elegant Angleterre hotel -LRB- Malaya Morskaya , 24 ; +7 981 870 7757 -RRB- .

And because this is the city Dostoevsky once called home , there 's St. Petersburg 's best independent book retailer , Word Order -LRB- Fontanka Quay , 15 -RRB- .

Offering more than just books , and surrounded by popular bars such as Produkty -LRB- Fontanka Quay 17 ; +7 812 312-57-54 -RRB- this tiny shop has long been the unofficial center of the city 's intellectual activities and regularly hosts discussions on contemporary Russian cinema , philosophy and media .
