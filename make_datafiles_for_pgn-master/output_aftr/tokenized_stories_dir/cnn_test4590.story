-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The secrecy surrounding `` Man of Steel , '' due June 14 , is pretty extraordinary , but composer Hans Zimmer was able to give CNN a glimpse of what to expect when we caught up with him this week regarding the score he did for `` The Bible . ''

`` Both stories are passions , '' Zimmer continued , `` about a struggle to do the right thing . For Superman , it was a really simple question for me . What does it take to become a good man ? To be good ? And what does that mean in our more and more complex society ? Do any of these values still resonate with us ? ''

His way around this , he said , was to look at the Superman story in a `` very different way . '' `` I kept thinking of the story as , What if you are extraordinary , and your entire ambition is to join humanity ? To become human ? What does it mean to become human ? What does it mean to be an outsider who really wants to join the human race ? ''

`` Man of Steel , '' which replaces Brandon Routh with Henry Cavill , is the origin story of Superman , starting with a young Clark Kent discovering that he has extraordinary powers and is not from planet Earth . As he grows up , he learns where he came from and what he was sent to this planet to do , as he becomes a symbol of hope for humanity . The film also stars Russell Crowe as Jor-el -LRB- Kal-el 's birth father on Krypton -RRB- , Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Martha and Jonathan Kent -LRB- his adoptive parents -RRB- , Michael Shannon as General Zod -LRB- so expect some trouble there -RRB- , Laurence Fishburne as Daily Planet editor Perry White , and Amy Adams as reporter/love interest Lois Lane . -LRB- `` She 's fun and sassy , in control , getting into trouble , and always looking for a headline ! '' Adams enthused earlier -RRB- . While it remains to be confirmed , the latest rumor is that Mackenzie Gray is playing Lex Luthor , although he does n't appear in the trailer .

Coming off three Dark Knight films directed by Christopher Nolan -LRB- `` Batman Begins , '' `` The Dark Knight , '' and `` The Dark Knight Rises '' -RRB- , Zimmer also did n't want to do `` another really dark '' superhero movie . `` Everything 's tinged with irony and sarcasm and bitterness and darkness these days , '' he said . But this Superman is something lighter , he said , `` celebrating everything that was good and fine about America , '' such as small towns `` where people do n't lock their doors , neighbors get together , and families are families . ''

`` What was important for Superman was the simple fact that none of us pay much attention to the Midwest , '' Zimmer said . `` I know America mainly by the big cities , but if you go into the Midwest , there is a people there and there is a country there . And I thought it was important that the decent folk , simple folk be the heart of the story , and a character who is guileless , who is n't complicated in the sort of flawed way our Dark Knight is , and is n't political in any way . He 's just striving to become a better part of humanity . ''

This perspective on Superman , the German-born composer said , is something that he came by in part because he 's a foreigner . `` I think partly what we foreigners are good at is looking at America , not in a judgmental way , but wide-eyed , and seeing the things you take for granted and presenting them in a new way , '' he added . `` Like for ` Thelma and Louise ' and the Grand Canyon , most American kids would n't want to go there for their holiday , but to us it 's a magical , magnificent place .
