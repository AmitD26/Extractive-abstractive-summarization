All are catnip for the political left , and all were highlighted by President Barack Obama this week as he informally launched the November election campaign for 36 Senate seats and a new House of Representatives .

By flying the Democratic banner so high in Tuesday 's State of the Union address and subsequent road show to four states , Obama tried to signal unity with his liberal base and provide the party 's candidates with ammunition for elections certain to be `` spirited '' -- the Washington euphemism for fierce and nasty .

`` The president wants to highlight differences between the parties and show that Democrats are on the side of ordinary people , '' said Darrell West , the vice president for governance studies at the Brookings Institution . `` That 's how he won in 2012 , and that 's the strategy in 2014 . ''

Hence the emphasis on policies that benefit women and minorities and appeal to younger voters .

On Tuesday and in subsequent speeches in Maryland , Pennsylvania , Wisconsin and Tennessee , Obama called for equal pay for women and made sure to include references to the popular first lady .

`` When women succeed America succeeds , '' he said Thursday in Waukesha , Wisconsin . `` And by the way , when women succeed , men succeed . I do n't know about all the guys here , but you know when Michelle is doing good and happy , I am happy , too . I 'm just sayin ' . ''

The President also called in his State of the Union speech for raising the minimum wage from $ 7.25 an hour to $ 10.10 , taking the first step himself by announcing he will unilaterally give the raise to workers under federal contracts . Republicans oppose the move in allegiance to their business supporters .

According to Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller , Obama is focusing `` on all the things that can help folks immediately , even if the impact is small . ''

`` When both the Democratic and Republican members of Congress stood up and applauded after the famous ` Mad Men episode ' quote , it was clear that each party sees women as the crucial swing factor in the 2014 elections , '' Schiller said .

On the GOP side , she described the choice of Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington to deliver the party 's formal response Tuesday night as `` smart politics . ''

Now a concerted Republican outreach to women voters means Democrats `` ca n't just count on another Todd Akin to save the Senate in 2014 , '' Schiller said , adding that `` they all have to work to produce federal policies that help working families in order to sustain that advantage . ''

West said Republicans must follow stated intentions with action when it comes to diversifying their policies and supporters .

While specifying issues advantageous to Democrats , Obama also has jabbed at Republicans this week on another matter that resonates with voters -- the perception that political intransigence led by tea party conservatives stymies progress in Washington .

Republicans got the blame for last year 's highly unpopular 16-day government shutdown when conservatives led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tried to link a funding measure to dismantling the 2010 health care reforms they detest .

In what he depicted as a presidential declaration of independence from congressional dysfunction , Obama said `` I want to work with them , but I ca n't wait for them . ''

Another topic : reforming the immigration system , with Obama and Democrats seeking a path to legal status for the millions of people living illegally in the country .

`` I will not send our troops into harm 's way unless it is truly necessary ; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts , '' he said . `` We must fight the battles that need to be fought , not those that terrorists prefer from us . ''

Democratic unity ?

Schiller said Democrats need to remain unified on Obamacare and other issues , to run as a national party as much as possible even though the November elections are at the state and district level .

`` When Obamacare was brought up in the State of the Union , they all stood up and applauded , even Democratic senators who could be in trouble on the issue in their re-election races , '' she said . `` If there are any cracks in that united front for the Democrats as champions of middle class and working folks , it undermines not only their 2014 chances , but the remainder of the Obama presidential agenda . ''

While unity may exist in policy , some Democratic candidates facing tough elections do n't want to campaign with Obama due to public opposition to Obamacare and slower-than-desired economic growth and job creation .

Republicans believe they can win control of the Senate by taking six seats from Democrats in November . The House is likely to remain in Republican hands , with the outcomes of 90 % of the races considered safely predictable and Democrats needing to win most of the others to regain the majority , according to West .

`` It 's an uphill battle for Democrats to retake the House , '' he said , calling the situation `` pretty much a matter of arithmetic . ''
