-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the elite basketball stars of the NBA and WNBA , winning Olympic gold is a given . Silver is for the losers .

`` Second place is unacceptable , '' says legendary center Hakeem Olajuwon , who was in the U.S. `` Dream Team '' that topped the podium in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics .

With teammates such as Shaquille O'Neal , Charles Barkley and Scottie Pippen , the Nigerian-American , who was born in Lagos , quickly came to realize that reality .

`` Coming to the United States , being there for so long , then it becomes -- you are expected to win gold , '' he told CNN 's Aiming for Gold show .

`` We ca n't go anywhere -- we were n't even free to go to the -LRB- athletes ' -RRB- village . So it was a different experience from that perspective .

Olajuwon retired in 2002 but is still involved in the game , acting as a mentor for the likes of current superstars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant .

Argentina 's Luis Scola followed in Olajuwan 's footsteps at Houston Rockets and to the top of the Olympic podium .

The Nightmare Team

`` I take a lot of pride in the gold medal because of the whole experience that happened behind it , '' he told CNN .

He will be in an Argentina squad attempting to cause another upset at the 2012 Olympics in London , but believes U.S. success is almost inevitable .

`` There are three big sports here : baseball , American football and basketball . Basketball is really the only one that 's played in the Olympics . So I think that plays a role too .

`` There 's a lot of talent in the U.S. , a lot of talent . There 's 10 different teams you can pick players from and that will be a very good team and eventually you can win a medal or a gold medal , no question about that . ''

Women 's star

For WNBA legend Lisa Leslie , defeat at the Olympics just was n't an option . She played in four Games and won four golds with an all-conquering U.S. squad from 1996 to 2008 .

`` I really loved that moment of being on the podium and having the gold medal placed around my neck , just listening to the chants and listening to our national anthem -- that always gives me chills , '' she told CNN .

`` That was my favorite sports moment . ''

Boosted by her record 488 points , 241 rebounds and 36 blocked shots in Olympic competition , Leslie and her teammates had a remorseless winning attitude .

Leslie , who retired from the Los Angeles Sparks in 2009 , will go down in history as the first woman to complete a slam dunk in a professional game .
