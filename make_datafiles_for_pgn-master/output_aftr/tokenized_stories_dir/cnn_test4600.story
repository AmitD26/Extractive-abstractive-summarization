`` We have a clear and focused goal : to disrupt , dismantle and defeat al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan , '' he said .

Last month , Americans were almost evenly divided between those who support the war and those who oppose it , the poll showed , with 47 percent in favor and 51 percent opposed .

Opposition to the war in Afghanistan is more muted than opposition to the war in Iraq , but it 's not so muted among Democrats . Two-thirds of Americans overall oppose the war in Iraq , but 64 percent of Democrats oppose the war in Afghanistan .

The anti-war movements in Vietnam and Iraq helped define what the Democratic Party stands for . Watch : Is Afghanistan Obama 's Vietnam ? ''

`` If we do n't learn from our Iraq experience , we are doomed to repeat it , '' Rep. Lynn Woolsey , D-California , said on the House floor Thursday .

Why are Americans wary about Afghanistan ? The recession . Iraq War fatigue . And frustration .

Last month , when President Obama said he would send 17,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan , the public was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt .

Democrats were willing to go along with the president , but they were less enthusiastic than Republicans

A solid majority of Americans believe the United States can win a military victory in Afghanistan , but Afghanistan has become a political war . Winning depends , not just on what the United States can do , but also what Afghanistan and Pakistan can do .

Americans have far less confidence in them .
