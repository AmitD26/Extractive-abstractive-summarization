The bill would give the FDA the authority to require the posting of larger warning labels on tobacco products

The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act , which now moves to the Senate for further consideration , would allow the FDA to restrict the marketing of tobacco and ban candy-flavored cigarettes .

It would also allow the agency to regulate nicotine and other ingredient levels , as well as force greater disclosure of the contents of tobacco products .

Among other things , it would give the FDA the authority to require the posting of larger warning labels on cigarette cartons and other tobacco products . Tobacco companies could be barred from running ads implying , critics say , that `` mild '' or `` low-tar '' cigarettes are less harmful .

`` We applaud the House for passing the bill and hope that the Senate will move it through quickly so that President Obama can sign it into law as he has already indicated he would . Swift action could prevent tens of thousands of future deaths . ''

`` It 's a legal product , '' Hagan said in a recent interview with the Charlotte Observer . `` I do n't want to do anything that would harm the industry in North Carolina . ''
