The `` navigation hall '' as such establishments are called here , is one of 118 government-run Internet access points that Cuban authorities opened in June , marking a small step towards greater connectivity in a country with some of the lowest percentages of Internet penetration in the Western hemisphere .

`` For a while now I have been trying to find a way to get online , which was n't that easy to do , '' he said . `` Now that the government 's done this , it 's a convenient way to find information . ''

Convenient , but at $ 4.50 an hour , hardly cheap .

While Cubans who work in the island 's small but growing private sector or receive remittances from abroad might be able to afford to go online in the navigation centers , it remains an unimaginable luxury for a state employee who typically makes about $ 20 a month .

`` You have to get the money together , it 's not easy , '' said Lisbet Rodriguez , a chef in training who said the high cost of going online meant she could only get online twice each month .

`` If it could be just a little faster , '' Rodriguez said as she glanced back at the on-screen clock , which was slowly counting down the time she had left . `` But I 'd rather pay four bucks here than $ 10 to get online in a hotel . ''

Before the navigation halls opened , Cubans had to enter -- often sneak -- into hotels to use expensive Internet outlets set aside for foreigners . Or they had to ask a favor of a friend who had access through his or her job . Or give a thumb drive full of e-mails to a tourist and hope they would send them once they left Cuba .

While that would appear to woefully insufficient for a country of 11 million people , Tania Velazquez Rodriguez , an assistant director with the state-run ETECSA telecommunications company , said so far government officials say they are meeting the relatively small demand for Internet access .

But Velazquez said usage is expected to surge should the price drop , a possibility she said Cuban officials were `` studying . ''

`` Today there is news in every direction , '' Miguel Diaz-Canel , Cuba 's first vice president and presumptive successor to Raul Castro , said in May . `` People receive it , they know about it . So then the worst thing is to remain silent . ''

Cubans who use the navigation halls can access social media , foreign news publications and even blogs written by some of the island 's dissidents who are highly critical of the government .

But before they do , any user of the government Internet has to sign a contract promising not to engage in any subterfuge online that could harm Cuba 's `` economy , sovereignty or national security . ''

`` Obviously , our government promotes certain conduct regarding ethical and moral behaviors , '' said state communications official Velazquez .

`` I thing it 's significant in a kind of cat-and-mouse game between the government and the people of Cuba , '' he said , `` Regardless of their political ideology -LRB- they -RRB- really want to be connected to the 21st century and that means the Internet . ''

At a Havana navigation hall , retiree Raul Fernandez said he was n't interested in politics or societal change but in keeping in touch with a brother living in Costa Rica and a son who had moved to Spain .

`` It would be more convenient , '' he explained . `` Then I could communicate whenever I feel like it . ''
