-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Do you suffer from FOMO -LRB- otherwise known as `` fear of missing out '' -RRB- ? Does the idea that some infinitely intriguing person/place/thing is currently flitting through your general sphere of being -- WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE -- cause your heart to constrict with terror ?

Well , friends , we hear you . Having just returned from the liquor - -LRB- and other liquid - -RRB- soaked climes of Austin and SXSW , we 're pretty sure we only experienced about 1.3 % of all `` Cool Things '' present at that havoc-wrecked fest .

Basically , all we gathered was that people really like Skrillex , and , mysteriously , Train -LRB- thanks Monstro ! -RRB- and that the most-flogged apps at SXSW Interactive were undoubtedly those who aim to kill FOMO dead .

Enter : Sonar , Highlight and Banjo , a new wave of social apps designed to keep you abreast of all the interesting people around you -- without requiring that you look up from your smartphone -LRB- my Precious ... -RRB- ! These apps were , by far , among the most buzzed-about at SXSW , with Highlight taking the coveted top spot -LRB- according to Mashable -RRB- .

That 's why we 've provided a handy scale for you below , which should be instrumental in finding the level of `` Creepy '' you FOMO-sufferers are comfortable with .

Kind of creepy : Sonar

If you see someone you might want to stalk -- I mean , TALK to , you can tweet at them from within the app . You can also check into that location if you manage to leave your cave and become an object of stalkage -- I mean , talkage -- as well .

The app also features a `` People '' tab , listing which friends -LRB- pulled from your social networks -RRB- have currently checked in near you , as well as other people of interest . Use that to hook up with your pals next time they `` forget to tell you '' about karaoke . It 's not your fault the only lyrics you know are `` Wub wub wub wubwubwubwub wub Pzzzzzzz . ''

Creepy : Highlight

You 're just your average tech-savvy businessman , all pimped out in front-pleated khakis , your startup-emblazoned T-shirt of choice , and , of course , your ubiquitous SXSW Interactive Platinum Badge swingin ' around your neck .

When you first install the app , you 'll be asked to connect via Facebook , thus porting all your friends and interests into Highlight .

From there on out , you 'll be alerted via push notifications every time someone of interest is nearby -- you know , folks with a lot of mutual friends , hobbies , taste in TV , etc. .

These interactions will also be stored in a kind of in-app log . From there , you have the option to check out their profiles and send them a message if you feel keen on meeting .

You can also `` Highlight '' people for future reference , which is kind of the equivalent of a `` wink '' on an online dating site -LRB- IE a complete wuss move -RRB- . That 's right , tech-savvy businessman , now you can meet all kinds of interesting people -- mere feet from your nervous self -- without the hassle of the initial awkward introduction .

Highlight now , message one Mojito later . Meet IRL if they deign to answer you .

If only you could discover some brand new friends -- complete with dossiers -LRB- like the books that come with those American Girl dolls -RRB- -- with whom to maybe , possibly , someday but not likely hang out with . Well , you 've got a friend in Banjo !

When a friend posts content or checks in using any of those services near you -LRB- you can change the distance from one-fourth mile to 10 -RRB- , you 'll get an alert .

If they 're using Banjo , you can send them a message in-app , and if they 're not , you can post a message to whatever content or check-in they shared , asking them to join the service . -LRB- We do n't recommend doing this unless you 're OK with someone putting cheesy words in your mouth like : `` How cool ! Banjo tells me we 're close by , so let 's connect ! -RRB-

If the whereabouts of your friends are less than thrilling -LRB- `` Jesus Christ , who the F cares that you went to the bodega and bought dish soap ?! '' -RRB- , you can toggle over to the `` Explore '' map or the `` People '' box to check out a graphical representation of people in your area .

That info is collected via check-ins/content as well , so users do n't have to be Banjo members to show up on your map . From there , you can click through whatever content they 're sharing -- tweets , Instagram photos , etc -- and live vicariously to your heart 's content .
