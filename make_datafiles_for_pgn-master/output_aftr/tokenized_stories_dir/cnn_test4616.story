-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You do n't necessarily need a vintage Les Paul or a shiny Stratocaster to be a guitar hero .

A Cape Town-based company is crafting eye-catching electric guitars out of re-purposed oil cans , striking a chord with music fans around the world .

Dubbed `` Township Guitars , '' the hand-made six-strings are inspired by the traditional can instruments that have long been played by the resourceful residents in South Africa 's poorest areas .

`` When we were kids we could n't afford to buy a guitar so we used to make our own guitars , with a can used as an acoustic kind of body -- but these -LRB- Township Guitars -RRB- are just purely electric , '' adds Ngwenya , an accomplished guitarist himself .

`` The idea of the oil can guitar is very much a South African thing , '' explains Roy Bermeister , chief executive of Township Guitars .

Hear the guitar in action

`` Some turned them into drums ; some turned them into bass guitars ; and some turned them into what 's called a ramkiekie , '' says Bermeister -- a ramkiekie is an early-style four-string guitar that features an empty oil can as its body .

`` So now this ramkiekie is a 21st century guitar that you can hear in Carnegie Hall , '' says Bermeister .

Played by rock stars

Here , near the end of a long line of stalls packed with colorful wares and intricate handicrafts , Ngwenya can be heard strumming away , his fluid playing and distinctive sounds attracting throngs of curious onlookers .

`` There is a number of really famous guitar players who 've come and played the guitar here and bought them later , '' says Ngwenya from inside the market .

`` I 've got people like Peter Gabriel buying the guitar , with his guitar player David Rhodes , '' says Ngwenya . `` Just recently somebody bought one for David Gilmour , '' he adds . `` Chris Rea is one who 's using them a lot ; Roger Taylor bought two guitars a few years ago ; Paul Carrack too . ''

All this would n't be possible , however , if it was n't for a friend of Bermeister , a guitar enthusiast named Graeme Wells .

Back in 2002 , Wells decided to make an oil can guitar for himself . A few weeks later , clutching his creation , he met up with Bermeister at a popular Cape Town cafÃ © .

But Bermeister was not the only one impressed by Wells ' creation . Famous South African musician Jimmy Dludlu also happened to be at the same cafe . Fascinated by the oil can guitar , he asked if he could play it and , moments later , ordered one for himself .

This prompted Wells and Bermeister to go into business together , setting up a workshop and starting manufacturing the aptly named Afri-Can Guitars . But a few years later , the two split up the business and in April 2008 Wells , who suffered from asthma , died .

Unlike Wells ' striking creations , which were mostly designed to be collectors ' items , Bermeister says the company 's focus today is to create solid , affordable guitars with a `` local flavor . ''

`` We see a lot of opportunity in expanding our product range , '' he says .

`` Eric Clapton , '' he says with a smile . `` I 'd really love it if he comes around the shop . ''

So , if `` Slowhand '' is reading , how about an oil can guitar version of Layla ?
