London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New information has emerged from an intelligence operation about the possibility of an attack being planned in or near London , with subway stations and airports of particular concern to officials , a British security source told CNN Thursday .

The action is not connected to terrorism arrests last month in Stoke , Cardiff and London , the source said .

Increased security precautions have gone into effect at train and subway stations and Heathrow Airport , though an attack is not considered imminent , a second British security source said .

Britain 's emergencies team , which is composed of senior politicians and police officials , met Thursday morning to discuss the situation , the second source added .

`` Security at our airports remains at a high level , and we remain vigilant at all times , '' said a spokesman for the British Aviation Authority , which is responsible for Heathrow .

Last fall , counterterrorism officials in Europe and the United States told CNN that al Qaeda was planning coordinated , Mumbai-style attacks in Europe , with the United States also possibly being targeted .

That discovery led the United States to issue an unprecedented travel advisory in October for citizens traveling in Europe .

It was not clear whether Thursday 's information was related to last fall 's al Qaeda threat . At the time CNN reported the story in November , European counterterrorism officials were saying they believed the aim was to carry out the attacks before the end of the year .
