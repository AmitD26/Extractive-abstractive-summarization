-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sixteen Emmy Awards .

That 's how many trophies the cast and crew of `` Breaking Bad '' have hauled home after five seasons of groundbreaking TV , with six of those honors being earned at Monday 's 66th Primetime Emmy Awards . The three-hour ceremony , hosted by `` Late Night 's '' Seth Meyers , nearly doubled as one long standing ovation for the AMC series , which ended its run in September 2013 .

Emmy Awards : ` Breaking Bad ' goes out on top

In September , Latin America will get its own , Spanish-language version of `` Breaking Bad '' called `` Metastasis . '' The premise is the same -- a science teacher decides to cash in on his specialized knowledge by entering the drug trade , to devastating consequences -- but the setting is Bogota , Colombia .

The series debuted in the States on the Spanish language network UniMas in June , and has also made its way to Mexico . But `` in Colombia , not many people know about ` Breaking Bad , ' '' Trujillo explained in an interview from Bogota . `` There 's not a great cable culture here , people watch open television on the basic channels that we have . ` Metastasis ' is going to be a great surprise . ''

While adapting shows to another language is commonplace -- Trujillo previously worked on Latin American versions of `` Grey 's Anatomy '' and `` Desperate Housewives , '' and the U.S. turned Colombian series `` Betty La Fea '' into `` Ugly Betty '' -- producing `` Metastasis '' was no easy task . The cast had to film the entirety of `` Breaking Bad '' nearly shot for shot in just six months , and they did n't know how the story was going to end because the final season of `` Breaking Bad '' was still in development at the time .

Despite those challenges , the story does n't get lost in translation . Well-crafted symbolism , such as the noteworthy pink teddy bear that falls from a plane , appears in `` Metastasis , '' as do other scenes well-known to `` Breaking Bad '' viewers .

`` The themes that it touches are very universal , '' Urbina said . `` To me , the show is a moral question about how far you would go while exploring the complex character like that of Walter . ''

`` That 's Walter and that 's what all the characters are , '' Trujillo said . `` Every scene is full of contradiction , it 's full of humanity . ''

While both Trujillo and Urbina were certainly influenced by Cranston and Paul 's portrayals of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman , they made an effort to break away from the original and make the characters , and the show , their own .

`` When you start working with a different language , with a different director , a different cast , and our own traditions , at the end you really do your own version , '' Trujillo said . `` Characters come alive by themselves . You forget very soon what you saw , and the reference you have of the other actor . ''

Although they 're sharing similar material , there 's no competition for the actors . Quite the opposite , actually : Urbina and Trujillo were both rooting for `` Breaking Bad '' to win at the Emmys on Monday .

`` Cranston 's performance is absolutely wonderful . He deserves all the awards , as well as the rest of -LRB- the cast -RRB- , '' Trujillo said . `` I think they are just great actors , and they did a great , great job . ''

There is only more to come , as the much anticipated season finale airs on UniMas in mid-September , and `` Metastasis '' comes to Latin American audiences with Fox Live on September 1 .

`` The story is really well-adapted to our conditions here , '' Trujillo said . `` People are going to believe it , believe the people . It 's an amazing story , and I 'm sure it 's going to be really well received . ''
