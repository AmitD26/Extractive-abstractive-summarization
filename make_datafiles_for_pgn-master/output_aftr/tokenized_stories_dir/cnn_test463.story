Paul Kitterman , 53 , was found safe Tuesday night in Pueblo , Colorado , about 110 miles south of Denver 's Sports Authority Field at Mile High .

Pueblo police got a report Tuesday that a man fitting Kitterman 's description was in a Kmart parking lot . Police found him in good health , and he `` was speaking and answering questions intelligibly that were asked of him , '' according to a police statement .

Asked why he vanished , he told an officer that he had `` had his fill of football and decided to go for a walk , '' the statement said . He wanted to walk `` somewhere warmer , '' it said .

Kitterman further told police he 'd ditched his Broncos hat so no one would recognize him and `` mentioned sleeping in treed areas and in bushes during his journey to Pueblo , '' the statement said .

Before Kitterman was found in Pueblo , Tia Bakke , one of the friends with whom he attended the game , told CNN this type of behavior was not customary of him .

He was not intoxicated , and he had no mental health issues , she said .

`` Paul is the best guy you could ask for . They do n't make them like Paul anymore , '' said Bakke , who met Kitterman through her boyfriend , who has known Kitterman for a decade .

The family is not releasing any details , according to stepdaughter Tawna Tonneson 's Facebook post , which also said that Kitterman was safe and back with his family .

`` We thank everyone again for everything y' all did to help us , '' the post said . `` I knew God was walking by our side . ''

CNN 's Ana Cabrera , Justin Lear , Steve Almasy , Jean Casarez and Amanda Watts contributed to this report .
