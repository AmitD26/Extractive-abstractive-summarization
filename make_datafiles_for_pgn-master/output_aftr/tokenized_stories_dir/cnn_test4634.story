-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sharia stood immobile in front of the television , transfixed by its images , unaware of the world around her . Her family called her name over and over again , but she did not respond . It was that moment when they knew something was wrong .

Initially , they thought it was a hearing problem . When they found nothing wrong , they decided to take 2-year-old Sharia to a specialist at an early detection center in 2009 .

Siddiqui , 38 , and his wife , Ayza Sheikh , were under the impression that Sharia was simply a late talker . Originally from Pakistan , the Siddiquis had no relatives to advise them on their first child .

Speech , occupational and behavior therapies helped some . But Sharia still struggled with communication .

Siddiqui , a Columbia , Maryland , resident who shared his daughter 's story on iReport , said that before having the iPad , Sharia 's only way of communicating was crying . She was non-verbal and had no way of expressing what she wanted or how she was feeling .

Apple 's touchscreen gadget was n't the first tablet computer and is n't the only one now . But it quickly emerged as the overwhelming market leader , introducing millions of people worldwide to the concept of a computer that dwells somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop and offers a large screen full of images and icons with which the user can interact with a single touch .

`` What the iPad has done has given her a sense of control that she never had before , '' Siddiqui said . `` She knows when you touch it , something is supposed to happen . She knows she does n't need to cry , she needs to point . ''

A communications revolution

Proloquo2Go was Sharia 's first app and the first real augmented communication app , released first for iPhones in 2009 .

AAC , or augmentative and alternative communication , is a series of interventions used to help children with severe communication disorders communicate . Many apps are designed based on this method of therapy .

David Niemeijer , founder and CEO of Amsterdam-based AssistiveWare , creator of Proloquo2Go , said that 90 % of AAC users use an iPad for communication , and more than 25 % use an iPhone or iPod Touch , according to the company 's surveys . About half of them reported improved speech abilities .

Similarly , dozens of assistance and education autism apps have sprung up on tablets and other devices running Google 's Android operating system .

Estrada said the most appealing facet of the iPad is its mobility . Before , when Evan needed to learn a new concept in the middle of soccer practice or while at a restaurant , she had no way of showing him until the therapist gave him a card or bought a DVD weeks later . With the iPad or iPhone , it 's immediate .

`` I think -LRB- the iPad -RRB- is revolutionizing the augmentative communication field , '' said Dr. Oliver Wendt , assistant professor of speech , language and hearing sciences at Purdue University . `` It 's a very cost-effective system . Before , we had these expensive , bulky items , which now can be replaced with an iPad . ''

The equipment that was used previously could cost $ 9,000 to $ 15,000 .

The app has two visible parts on the screen : a top row and a bottom row . The top has pictures and symbols , and the bottom is a storyboarding strip where kids can drag and drop the pictures to create sentences . These pictures can include objects , feelings or anything relevant to the child .

`` It is very important to put symbols on that are truly reinforcing for the child , symbols that match something the child really wants , '' Wendt said . The app allows parents to take pictures on the spot and add them to the existing bank of symbols .

Removing `` extra baggage ''

Martha Herbert , a pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital of Harvard Medical School in Boston , said the iPad allows individuals to bypass many difficulties they have in communicating .

Herbert explains that apraxia or dyspraxia is what makes communication difficult . Apraxia means that although your brain can develop an intention of doing something , it is physically difficult to do it . You may want to speak but ca n't move your lips .

`` I think it 's opening a whole interesting way to be creative about giving people assistance , '' she said . `` You can measure somebody 's stress level and somebody can feed it back into their app and tell you if they 're about to fall apart or have a meltdown . ''

Khengwah Koh is managing partner with Hearty SPIN , a new startup in Singapore that also recently released an app for low-functioning individuals with autism called Picture AAC .

Although Apple did not create the iPad with the intention of helping children with autism , the company does try to build in features for people with disabilities .

`` Steve Jobs did not realize he was giving a voice to the voiceless , '' Tucker said .

That voice is exactly what Siddiqui feels has been given to Sharia . She is now able to speak in broken sentences and is aware of the world around her . Her family sees small triumphs every day .

For the first time in three years , the Siddiquis are thinking of taking Sharia to Pakistan to see their extended family . Sharia was diagnosed shortly after their first visit , and the family there only recently came to know of her diagnosis after watching Siddiqui 's iReport video of Sharia .

`` I often tell my wife I think of it as Sharia before the iPad and Sharia after the iPad , '' Siddiqui said . `` It was that significant . ''
