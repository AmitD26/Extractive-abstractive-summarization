Benaissa admitted not telling sexual partners she was HIV-positive but denied intending to infect anyone , according to AFP . `` I am sorry from the heart , '' she told the court , according to media reports .

One of the three men Benaissa allegedly slept with has since been confirmed as having HIV , prosecutors told an earlier hearing , AFP reported .

German newspaper Bild reported that Benaissa 's attorney read a statement in which she said she believed there was little chance of her passing on the virus and did not want it made public because of the harm it might cause her daughter and the band .

He told Benaissa : `` You have borne so much suffering in the world , '' according to the newspaper .

No Angels became Germany 's most successful all-female group after being formed on the international television show `` Popstars '' in 2000 .

Benaissa is appearing in youth court because she was 17 at the time of the first alleged offence .

The trial is expected to last five days and hear from witnesses including fellow members of No Angels .
