BP used the chemicals to break up oil after the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion sent millions of gallons of crude gushing into the Gulf .

Despite a federal directive restricting the use of dispersants , the Coast Guard routinely granted exemptions , said Rep. Edward J. Markey , chairman of the House Energy and Environment Subcommittee .

In May , the Environmental Protection Agency , along with the Coast Guard , ordered the oil giant to stop surface application of the chemicals during the oil spill except in rare occasions , according to a House subcommittee on energy and environment .

Allen dismissed Markey 's allegations during a conference call with reporters Sunday .

`` I 'm satisfied that we only use them -LSB- dispersants -RSB- when they 're needed , '' he said .

Allen said field commanders on a case-by-case basis have decided to use dispersants when oil has been spotted by surveillance aircraft and no other method of cleaning it up is available in the area .

`` We 're going to accept some impact on the water column '' rather than having the oil reach the beach , he said .

The Coast Guard approved more than 74 exemptions in 48 days , Markey said . In one instance , Coast Guard officials allowed the oil giant to use a larger volume of dispersants than it had applied for , he said .

Dispersants are `` a toxic stew of chemicals , oil and gas , with impacts that are not well understood , '' Markey , a Democrat from Massachusetts , said in the letter to Allen .

BP issued a statement Sunday saying it has worked closely with the EPA and the Coast Guard over the use of dispersants `` since the very beginning '' of the disaster .

`` Furthermore , we 've complied with EPA requests regarding dispersants which are an EPA-approved and recognized tool in fighting oil spills , '' the statement said .

`` Right now we have n't seen anything that shows us to be concerned , but we 're going to keep looking , '' he said .

Markey said the findings are based on an analysis by the Energy and Environment Subcommittee .

BP 's use of disperants peaked at 70,000 gallons on May 24 , the EPA said . It was after that the EPA ordered the halt on its use , except for rare occasions . From the time that directive was issued , dispersant use dropped 72 percent , Gilfillan said .

Initially , the EPA was not involved in the day-to-day decisions about which exceptions were granted , but that changed in late June .

Markey said the subcommittee also found contradictions on how much chemical dispersant was being used . On other occasions , BP used more than the amount approved by the Coast Guard , Markey said in his letter .

The report brings into question the total amount of dispersants used in the Gulf . BP says it has used 1.8 million gallons to break up oil flowing from the Deepwater Horizon 's ruptured well .

Meanwhile Sunday , Allen announced that the first of two efforts to seal the ruptured well once and for all could begin as early as Monday night .

That will be followed by a final `` bottom kill '' after a relief well intercepts the crippled well -- a step that Allen estimated Sunday to begin a minimum of five to seven days after the static kill is complete .
