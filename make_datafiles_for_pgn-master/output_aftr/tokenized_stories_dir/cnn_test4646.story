-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As same-sex marriage has become accepted in a way that would have been unthinkable a decade ago , the media have -- perhaps unwittingly -- played a crucial role .

But that 's hardly true everywhere , as a stunning backlash in Mississippi makes clear .

The result : A torrent of angry calls , canceled subscriptions and outraged comments on the paper 's website and Facebook page .

As recounted by Deep South Progressive , one person wrote : `` This is what we have to put up with on the world news every night . Never thought I would open my local paper and see such . Insulting !!! ''

Said another : `` It 's a sad day for traditional family values when this is printed on the front of a newspaper . ''

The paper 's owner , Jim Cegieklski , responded in an op-ed :

`` You do n't have to like something for it to be historic . The holocaust , bombing of Pearl Harbor , and the Black Sox scandal are all still historic . I 'm in no way comparing the downtown wedding of two females to any of these events -LRB- even though some of you made it quite clear that you think gay marriage is much worse -RRB- , I 'm just saying that whether you liked the story or not , the first known gay wedding to take place in Jones County is still historic . ''

He added : `` I ca n't help but be saddened by the hate-filled viciousness of many of the comments directed toward our staff . ''

The Leader-Call deserves credit for standing by a legitimate story that infuriated part of its readership . There was no attempt to glorify gays ; the piece simply recounted the wedding , which was purely symbolic , since Mississippi does n't allow same-sex marriage . What was stunning was the way some critics simply ignored the fact that one of the women is fighting for her life .

Maybe this resonates more deeply for taking place in the South , where many leading newspapers once staunchly defended racial segregation in a way that is now embarrassing -- and which prompted some of them to apologize decades later .

At the same time , a column in Sunday 's Washington Post makes clear that those who believe the press tilts too far toward same-sex marriage have a valid point .

Ombudsman Patrick Pexton reports on an e-mail dialogue he facilitated between a reader and a Post reporter he declines to name . The reader complained that the Post minimizes `` the millions of Americans who believe in traditional marriage and oppose redefining marriage into nothingness . ''

The reporter said : `` The reason that legitimate media outlets routinely cover gays is because it is the civil rights issue of our time . ... The true conservative would want the government out of people 's bedrooms , and religion out of government . ''

That is bias , pure and simple . Yes , it is a civil rights issue , but the reporter simply ca n't understand why anyone would have a different viewpoint other than that the government should not interfere on such issues as same-sex marriage and perhaps , by extension , abortion .

There was a time when most gay journalists remained closeted for fear of being penalized . A decade or two from now , as today 's younger people move into positions of power , opponents of same-sex marriage may seem as wrong-headed and their views as antiquated as those of people who defended keeping blacks at the back of the bus .
