Rafid Alwan says he wants to return to Iraq to work for his people and his country .

Trying to get details from him was difficult -- he spoke at length , often launching into a flowery history of Iraq or a description of Hussein 's crimes , and in Arabic , which meant we had to wait after each answer for a translation .

In the run-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 , Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a dramatic presentation to the U.N. Security Council . The United States had first-hand accounts , he said , detailing how Hussein was secretly creating biological agents using mobile laboratories in `` road-trailer units and rail cars . ''

`` The source is an eyewitness , an Iraqi chemical engineer , who supervised one of these facilities . ''

Just days after Powell 's presentation , U.N. weapons inspectors presented evidence they said disproved those claims . But six weeks later , on March 20 , 2003 , the United States launched its invasion , toppling Hussein 's government in three weeks but locking itself in a war against an insurgency that has cost more than 4,000 American lives .

Alwan brought with him to our meeting documents to prove his identity , certificates saying he has a degree in chemical engineering from Technical University in Baghdad and a student ID card from a German college . Multiple intelligence sources told CNN that the man we spoke with was , indeed , Curveball .

But Alwan told us he never told the BND that Iraq was producing weapons of mass destruction , and he said many other things said about him were false .

`` There are many wrong statements made about me , and I want to declare it one by one . I have documents proving that everything said about me is false , '' he said .

`` No , '' he said , `` I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction . ''

He said that as long as he is living in Germany , he will never tell the full story of what information he passed on to the BND .

`` It is not true that I am the only person who said things about Iraq , '' he said . `` There are so many other people who gave information as well . Right now I am trying to protect my children . They have been through hard times with me . ''

And then Alwan got nervous . He wiped his face often and lit a new cigarette after almost every question . He seemed uncomfortable in front of the camera .

Alwan had brought with him a second man , introduced only as `` Mr. Ali . '' Mr. Ali was also wearing a flashy suit with a peach-colored shirt , and he seemed to be coaching Alwan , making strange signals behind my back .

When he was n't prevented from talking by Mr. Ali , Alwan answered questions in a roundabout manner , sometimes backtracking and correcting himself , sometimes telling completely different stories in the same sentence .

Alwan came to Germany in 1999 seeking asylum and was picked up by the German intelligence service , which questioned him . According to intelligence sources , Alwan told the BND that Hussein had a secret biological weapons program , and that the cover was a seed purification plant in Djerf al Nadaf , a site just north of Baghdad , where mobile weapons labs in truck trailers would pick up the biological agents .

It begs the question : How could the BND and CIA trust Alwan 's information with the stakes so high ?

Norbert Juretzko , a former BND officer who is familiar with the Curveball case , now criticizes the German intelligence service for its handling of the matter . The BND wanted so badly to believe Alwan , Juretzko said , that the case officers did n't notice inconsistencies in his story .

Alwan , however , claims he was never `` an agent or spy for any intelligence agencies in the world . And I never got paid by anyone . ''

Tyler Drumheller , the CIA 's station chief in Europe at the time , said he tried to warn his superiors at the agency about using Curveball 's information . Drumheller said he thinks the Curveball case is one of the lowest points in the history of the CIA , but he does not believe Alwan was at fault .

Bob Drogin , who wrote about the case in `` Curveball : Lies , Spies , and a Con Man Who Caused a War , '' called the episode `` arguably the biggest intelligence failure in history . ''

But Alwan made clear in our meeting that he does not feel remorse . He said he wants to return to Iraq to work for his people and his country . And , he said , he feels the Iraq war was justified .
