-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn released news of their relationship to limit paparazzi intrusion on their romance , the world 's No. 2 golfer said Wednesday .

`` I 've had situations where it 's been very dangerous for my kids , the extent that they 'll go to . We basically devalued the first photos .

`` Unfortunately that 's just the way it is in our society right now and we felt it was the best thing to do and we 're very happy about it . ''

The pair 's relationship has been big news since Monday 's confirmation but Woods is now focused on trying to wrest golf 's world No. 1 crown back from friend , rival and Nike stablemate Rory McIlroy .

It would mark a significant transformation for Woods , whose stuttering form in recent years saw his ranking slump past the 50 mark at one point .

But after victory at the Cadillac Championship in Doral last week -- his 17th World Golf Championship title -- Woods can now reach golf 's pinnacle if he can secure his 77th PGA Tour triumph .

`` I feel like I 'm headed in the right direction , '' he said . `` I 'm very pleased where I 've come from . Like I said , 50â€‘plus to where I 'm at is no small task .

`` It 's been a long process . I was hurt for a long time , I had to make swing changes that were drastically different than what I was doing before . It 's taken some time . ''

Woods is defending champion at Bay Hill , beating 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme Dowell by five shots last year to secure his first tournament win since 2009 .

He has won four more times in the last 12 months and he puts a large slice of his resurgence down to the fact that he has remained injury free during that period .

Woods ' game attracted praise from Palmer himself , who won seven major titles during a glittering career that has seen him regarded as one of the finest to play the game .

`` I think right now looking at him and watching him play , he looks probably as strong and as good from a golf perspective as I 've ever seen him , '' the 83-year-old told reporters .

`` I give him a chance . I suppose that every year it 's a little more fleeting , however , and he 'll have to really work hard to keep himself up and keep his mental attitude if he 's going to do it . ''
