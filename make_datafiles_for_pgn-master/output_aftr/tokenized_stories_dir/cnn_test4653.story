-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's hard for me to choose the greatest African films of the 21st century as the genres and styles of African cinema have evolved in a big way over the past 20 years or so . Movie makers are now showing a more vibrant Africa than the Francophone filmmakers did before them .

This movie is very real and deals with the subject of terrorism -- based on the events surrounding the bomb attacks on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi in 1998 . I liked Ken Ambani 's realistic acting and I loved the music . Wanuri Kahiu is a good director who will go on to make greater films . The cinematography on this film was exceptional and although for me it had plot issues , I think in the end it all came together .

This is simply a sophisticated gangster movie . It has raw energy and puts a human face to all that is happening in the Congo . Sometimes just too real , it is gritty , fun and a must-watch thriller .

Sinking Sands - dir . Leila Djansi , Ghana , 2011

This film deals with domestic violence , but based on the personal journey of a man disfigured in an accident , which makes him turn against his wife .

Actors Jimmy Jean-Louis and Abebrese made this film a must watch and Djansi chose the right cast to make her directing look beautiful . The camera work on this film was excellent -- a bit dark and grainy , but one thing is for sure : you can not watch `` Sinking Sands '' and not be affected .

`` White Waters '' was a very good movie . It tells the story of a disadvantaged boy who is discovered as gifted runner . I loved the feel , the music and the fact that it was about achieving something from nothing .

I loved the cinematography . Izu Ojukwu , the director and my colleague , is going to shout as I say this , but I believe he is one of the best cinematographers Nigeria has and actor O.C. Ukeje was sensational and made this movie for me .

This is one of those films that makes Africa great . By showcasing the talents of the children who make up its cast , it shows off Africa 's apparent talent . It 's not just the cast that I enjoyed -- it has lovely directing too .

Coming from Sembene it was important , visual and professionally made -- and it pulls at the viewers ' heart strings .

Otelo Burning - dir . Sara Blecher , South Africa , 2011

This is one movie I love , just because of the story line of young black South Africans in the 1980s excelling in surfing -- a sport that was reserved for the whites . The sound and picture quality was also excellent , as was the acting . `` Otelo Burning '' is one of the best African films I have ever seen and I feel it should have had a lot more accolades than it did .

Benda Bilili - dir . Renaud Barret , Florent de La Tullaye , DR Congo/France , 2010

This is a great musical documentary telling the story of Staff Benda Bilili -- a group of disabled Congolese musicians . The band members start out making a living on the streets of Kinshasa , before becoming world-famous musicians .

I love anything to deal with African myths and mysticism . This movie may not have the best sound quality but the storyline was interesting , and it was the first Nollywood film to make it to mainstream film festivals -- including the London Film Festival and Pan African Film festival in Los Angeles -- after winning an AMAA -LRB- Best Indigenous Film -RRB- in 2007 .
