-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- Imagine this : It 's a gorgeous spring day in Miami and you 're thoroughly tempted to lower the top of your rental car and push the power pedal a little too hard in a bid to break free from the traffic crush on the Palmetto .

But , though there may not seem to be a heavy police presence on the freeways on this particular day , you can be pretty sure that someone up in the sky is keeping a close eye on speeding vacationers and the massive traffic tailbacks they 're trying to avoid .

Welcome to Florida and aviation law enforcement from the state 's Highway Patrol . It 's one of the few states in the U.S. that employs aircraft to monitor speeders , reckless drivers and , sometimes , soon-to-be felons fleeing a police pursuit -LRB- Nevada and Minnesota are among a dozen others -RRB- . And if you never quite realized what those strange white lines along the side of the highway mean , well , now you will .

Flight Captain Matt Walker , the Florida Highway Patrol 's chief pilot , says his job primarily involves monitoring motorists ' speed between these painted white lines , which are placed a quarter-mile apart in frequent intervals .

Occasionally , the driver will head home , or even go shopping , completely unaware that his movements have been tracked from the air . Planes , after all , operate much more quietly than the helicopters often employed in other states in such pursuits . When the driver is quickly apprehended on the ground , usually they 're shocked to hear they 'd been tracked from high above .

`` It takes the fleeing portion out of the pursuit . Sometimes he 'll still drive recklessly but the majority of the time he 'll operate within speed limits if he thinks nobody is chasing him . '' AOL Autos : Caught at 100 mph -- now what ?

Walker says that a fleet of seven Cessna fixed-wing aircraft operates in the skies above Florida . The combined fleet delivers some 45,000 citations on average each year , and speed will be a factor in about 38,000 of these citations .

`` The primary use of aircraft is for traffic enforcement , '' Walker said . `` The pilot has a stopwatch and observes traffic going down the roadway . He activates the stopwatch on the first line and calculates the average speed over the quarter mile . AOL Autos : How police catch you speeding

Impact of weather

The most challenging days for Walker and his team of pilots are busy holidays with heavy traffic and when the weather takes a turn for the worse . He says in those situations , or when a storm is looming , the fleet will be grounded . `` We do not fly in inclement weather , '' he says .

Walker was a trooper for five years before he took to the skies , and now spends about five hours a day in the air . He also has to testify in court should a motorist decide to challenge a citation .

David Haenel , a defense lawyer at fightyourticket.com , has gotten to know many of the FHP pilots well in his long career fighting speeding tickets in Florida courts . He says he has won many cases challenging the basic equipment used to issue a citation -- including radio and the three stopwatches that pilots may use to clock a vehicle -- and discrepancies in the timing of an issued ticket .
