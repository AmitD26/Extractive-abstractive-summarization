The Grammy-winning singer must report to prison on July 8 to begin serving the sentence for failure to pay federal income taxes for three years , followed by three months of home confinement and a year of supervised probation , the judge said . Hill must also pay penalties and taxes still owed and a $ 60,000 fine .

Hill pleaded guilty last year to three counts of failing to file tax returns on more than $ 1.8 million between 2005 and 2007 .

The artist appeared Monday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo in federal court in Newark , New Jersey , for sentencing .

Hill told the judge she lives `` very modestly '' considering how much money her music -- she has sold 16 million records -- earned for other people .

`` This was n't a life of jet-setting glamour , '' she said . `` This was a life of sacrifice with very little time for myself and my children . ''

The income in question was mostly from music and film royalties paid to companies she owned between 2005 and 2008 , according to the U.S. attorney 's office .

`` I think the government has let a number of celebrities off and never criminally prosecuted them , Willie Nelson being at least one example , '' he said . `` I think that the court took that into account as well . Ms. Hill did not get a slap on the wrist and let off with just paying a certain amount of money but has had to go through this entire criminal prosecution . ''

Hill also used her sentencing to talk about her music .

`` I did n't make music for celebrity status , '' she told the court . `` I made music for artistic and existential catharsis , which was not just necessary for myself but it was also necessary for the generations of oppressed people who had n't had their voices expressed like I was able to do it . Music is not something I do from 9 to 5 . It 's a state of being , and like a doctor who delivers babies , I 'm on call all the time because that 's the kind of work this is . ''

Hill revealed in a message posted to her Tumblr account last month that she 's been working on new music .

`` It has been reported that I signed a new record deal , and that I did this to pay taxes . Yes , I have recently entered into an agreement with Sony Worldwide Entertainment , to launch a new label , on which my new music will be released , '' Hill wrote . `` And yes , I am working on new music . ''
