Both vessels , HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant , were armed with nuclear warheads and suffered damage but were able to return to port under their own power following the collision .

In an earlier press release issued on February 6 , the Ministry of Defense said the vessel 's sonar dome had been damaged in a collision . The vessel was able to return to its base at Ile Longue in Brittany , northwest France , accompanied by a frigate .

The UK 's Ministry of Defence also confirmed the incident . In a statement , the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathan Band said the collision occurred during `` routine national patrols . '' Watch Band describe `` slow-speed impact '' ''

`` Both submarines remained safe and no injuries occurred . We can confirm that the capability remained unaffected and there has been no compromise to nuclear safety , '' Band said .

`` Either one of these submarines was doing something different or somebody made a mistake -- but we do n't know that , '' Cobbold said . Watch why the collision is an embarrassment for both the British and the French ''

Both submarines were equipped with state-of-the-art sonar technology , but Cobbold said it was possible that neither was aware of the close proximity of the other vessel .

`` Modern submarines are very , very quiet . In many types of water conditions they might not hear the approach of another submarine , '' he said .

In a statement issued Monday , the UK-based Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament described the incident as `` a nuclear nightmare of the highest order . ''

`` The collision of two submarines , both with nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons onboard could have released vast amounts of radiation and scattered scores of nuclear warheads across the seabed , '' said CND chair Kate Hudson .

Hudson said the incident was the most serious involving a nuclear submarine since the sinking of the Russian Kursk in 2000 with the loss of the vessel 's entire 118-man crew .

The 150-meter vessel carries a crew of 141 and is powered by a uranium-fueled pressurized water reactor . Vanguard Class submarines routinely spend weeks at a time underwater on patrol in the North Atlantic .

But contact with naval commanders and government officials , including the defense secretary and the prime minister , is maintained at all times by a `` comprehensive network of communications installations , '' the Royal Navy Web site said .

Le Triomphant was launched in 1994 and entered service in 1997 with a crew of 111 , according to the GlobalSecurity.org Web site . Its weapons include 16 M45 missiles capable of launching multiple nuclear warheads .

The UK has maintained a nuclear arsenal since 1956 , with at least one nuclear-armed submarine somewhere at sea continuously since 1969 .

In 2006 the government approved plans to develop a new generation of nuclear weapon-carrying submarines which is due to be ready to replace the Vanguard Class by 2024 . But the program , which is expected to cost around Â£ 20 billion -LRB- $ 29 billion -RRB- , has been heavily criticized by anti-nuclear campaigners .
