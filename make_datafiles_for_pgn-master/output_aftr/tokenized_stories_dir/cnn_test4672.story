Kyle Best was behind the wheel of his pickup in September 2009 driving down a rural highway when Shannon Colonna sent him a text .

The two were teens at the time . He was 18 ; she was 17 , and they were dating . They sent each other 62 texts that day , according to court documents .

The teens were having a text chat , volleying each other messages every few moments .

Seventeen seconds after Best sent a text , he was calling a 911 operator .

His truck had drifted across the double center line and hit the Kuberts head-on .

The scene Best described to the emergency operator was most certainly gruesome .

`` The collision severed , or nearly severed David 's left leg . It shattered Linda 's left leg , leaving her fractured thighbone protruding out of the skin as she lay injured in the road , '' the court document said .

The court did not publish the contents of their messages .

The Kuberts both lost their legs . They sued .

But they did n't just go after Best . They included Colonna in the lawsuit .

In their minds , she was distracting him and was also responsible for their pain and loss .

They settled with Best and lost against Colonna , but they appealed that decision .

The plaintiffs ' attorney , Stephen Weinstein , argued that the text sender was electronically in the car with the driver receiving the text and should be treated like someone sitting next to him willfully causing a distraction , legal analyst Marc Saperstein told CNN affiliate WPIX-TV .

The argument seemed to work .

The ruling

They ruled that if the sender of text messages knows that the recipient is driving and texting at the same time , a court may hold the sender responsible for distraction and hold him or her liable for the accident .

`` We hold that the sender of a text message can potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting , but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted , '' the court said .

She had a habit of sending more than 100 texts a day and was oblivious to whether recipients were driving or not .

The judges ' decision has elicited a similar response from the state 's governor , Chris Christie .

The driver is ultimately responsible , he said . Not someone sending him a text .

Other New Jerseyites agreed .

`` Even talking to the driver can distract them , so they are going to arrest for someone who simply talked to someone who is driving ? '' Louise McKellip asked .

The future

New Jersey has been cracking down hard on texting and driving in recent years , implementing new laws and regulations that treat it in a similar manner as drunken driving if it involves an injury accident .

The state passed a law last year based on the fate of the Kuberts and others who had been killed or maimed by texting motorists .

The `` Kulesh , Kubert and Bolish 's Law '' makes distracted driving a crime if the driver causes an accident . Fines for bodily injury run as high as $ 150,000 , and the driver can go to jail for up to 10 years .

And new legislation proposed by state Sen. James Holzapfel would let police thumb through cellphones if they have `` reasonable grounds '' to believe the driver was talking or texting when the wreck occurred .
