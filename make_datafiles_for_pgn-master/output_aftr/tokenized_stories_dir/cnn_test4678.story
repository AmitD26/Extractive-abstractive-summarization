-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The remarkable display of civil disobedience by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens reflects a profound sense of desperation that has grown as China has closed off all political options and made it increasingly clear that it intends to call the shots .

The Basic Law envisioned gradual progression to universal suffrage by 2017 . But as that date got closer , Beijing sought to restrict that outcome . In June , China released its first-ever White Paper on Hong Kong , which stresses how Hong Kong 's autonomy has limits .

Beijing defined what those requirements mean in a decision on September 4 , namely that all candidates must be chosen by a `` nominating committee '' comprised of pro-Beijing local elites . The disappointment in Hong Kong was palpable , sparking the `` Umbrella Revolution '' that reached record numbers of tens of thousands in the streets on China 's October 1 National Day holiday .

Beijing has been largely silent , preventing the Chinese media from even reporting the protests , with state-run media charging that the clearly homegrown protests are fueled by `` foreign forces . ''

Protestors are calling on Chief Executive C.Y. Leung to resign . Typically , Beijing prefers local leaders to deal with such crises . The ruling Communist Party sees its legitimacy as fragile and President Xi Jinping can not afford to show any weakness . But Leung appears to have few options . There may be a potential middle ground of compromise , but many doubt that Leung has the flexibility to negotiate with Hong Kong protestors .

But Beijing 's Hong Kong problem has implications well beyond the former British colony . As China 's former paramount leader , Deng had introduced the `` One Country , Two Systems '' formula with Taiwan in mind . China 's Communist Party-led state has always made the Taiwanese uneasy . Their skepticism has only deepened as they 've watched Beijing 's unelected rulers circumscribe Hong Kong 's freedoms .

Still , popular protests in Taipei against new cross-straits trade accords , and more recently in sympathy with Hong Kong , suggest that the next Taiwan presidential elections in 2016 could result in a Taipei with which Beijing is uncomfortable . In his first statement on Taiwan upon taking office , Xi said , `` The issue of political disagreements that exist between the two sides must reach a final resolution , step by step . These issues can not be passed on from generation to generation . ''

Enlightened self-interest would suggest that China find an accommodation within the framework of the Basic Law . But given the stakes perceived by Beijing , China is less concerned about its global image and far more concerned with maintaining control . This leaves Leung between a rock and a hard place .

One way forward , without having Beijing 's fingerprints on it , could be to allow Leung to seek a middle ground and negotiate with key opposition figures to end the protests in exchange for broadening the committee that vets candidates and/or offering a means for candidates to run if they attain a petition with a substantive number of signatures .

In the event of an outcome that leaves the status quo in place in Hong Kong , the U.S. administration needs to address its own China dilemma with a China policy that seems to be tilting less toward cooperation and more towards competition : how to impose costs on Beijing for unacceptable behavior .
