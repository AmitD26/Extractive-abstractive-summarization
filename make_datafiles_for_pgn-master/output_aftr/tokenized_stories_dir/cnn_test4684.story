`` New techniques in biology allow us to characterize bacteria and viruses leaving our bodies . -LSB- This is -RSB- the microbiome of us , '' explains Ratti . His team is currently designing prototype smart platforms that collect sewage , filter it and use computational techniques to analyze any genetic material present to identify any viruses and bacteria , as well as spotting specific chemicals using a technique known as mass spectrometry .

Ratti aims to characterize a city 's microbiome -LRB- the vast community of microbes that lives in the human body -RRB- and ultimately `` see epidemics before they happen . ''

Detecting infections

The main benefits lie in the real-time aspect of the technology , providing insight into the diseases circulating in a community before the people affected know for themselves . `` The steps involved in disease diagnosis are slow , '' Ratti explains . First , people need to notice symptoms of illness , and then they have to begin the process of doctors ' appointments and tests to get a diagnosis . Testing sewage could be a faster way to predict the presence of infections among the population .

To begin with , the project will primarily look for influenza and gastroenteritis-related outbreaks , such as salmonella and rotavirus infections , but the potential public health benefits go beyond outbreak prediction and surveillance .

The water in our sewers is a mix of water from showers , toilets and rain , and the resulting chemicals and microorganisms will vary depending on the source . `` The second challenge is , who has contributed to that water ? '' explains Alm .

But he believes his team can build a robust platform to not only monitor changes in health , but also see what chemicals are being released into the water by industries , as well as monitor chemical security threats and even assess the impact of health policies by looking at other biological factors . `` There 's a whole host of applications we can use , '' says Alm .

Live trials

`` Some organisms are more fragile than others and will die in the sewers , some are difficult to detect in small numbers and some are more numerous than others , '' he says . Cairncross recalls a cholera study that took swabs of sewage from manholes in Dhaka , Bangladesh , but failed to find a single one these bacteria . `` It has potential but will take a lot of trial and error to find which results are reliable or meaningful , '' he adds .

The concerns are shared by the team at MIT . `` We need to figure out how far down from somebody 's home or business you can still see organisms , '' explains Alm , who also suggests they may need to time sampling to `` peak poop hours '' during the day , such as the morning .

Smart toilet

`` We will be able to monitor the microbiome individually , and tell you about your body , '' says Ratti about the overall vision for the technology , `` to monitor and detect this before you fall sick . ''

The immediate future , however , remains the glamorous task of mining sewage to visualize urban health patterns . `` Sewage is the most logical start point , '' concludes Alm about his goals to find the bugs infecting a city . `` You never know until you go out and find it . ''
