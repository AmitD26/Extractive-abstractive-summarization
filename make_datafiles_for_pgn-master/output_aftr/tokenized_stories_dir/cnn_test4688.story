-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Approximately 44 million people live with dementia worldwide , according to the Alzheimer 's Association . By 2050 , that number is expected to more than triple to 115 million .

Nevertheless , the study does n't promote hypertension in the elderly , given that high blood pressure is related to other bad outcomes .

`` I do n't think it says if I find somebody who 's doing well at age 90 , whose blood pressure is 120/80 , we should feed them salt to bump their blood pressure up , '' says William Klunk , vice chair of the Alzheimer 's Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council .

Seniors can lower their risk for late-life cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease with a number of lifestyle changes , new research suggests .

A two-year clinical trial from Karolinska Institutet and the Finnish Institute for Health included 1,260 participants aged 60 to 77 . One part of the group received a `` lifestyle-package , '' including nutritional guidance , physical exercise , management of heart health risk factors , cognitive training and social activities . The control group received standard health advice .

After two years , the lifestyle-intervention group did much better in tests of memory and thinking .

We know from past studies that implementing those lifestyle factors in midlife can hedge against Alzheimer 's disease later on , says Ralph Nixon , chairman of the Alzheimer 's Association Medical and Scientific Advisory Council . `` The good news from this particular study is that these kind of changes can be implemented in your 60s and 70s . ''

Middle-aged people who were avid game-players -LRB- think crosswords , checkers , cards -RRB- tended to have bigger brains than people who did not play games , according to a recent study that looked at brain scans .

`` It 's like looking at someone 's muscle mass , '' said Dr. Laurel Coleman of the Maine Medical Center Geriatric Assessment Center . `` It 's bad when it 's smaller , good when it 's bigger . ''

Researchers looked specifically at certain parts of participants ' brains . The volume among game-players was greater in areas that tend to be damaged by Alzheimer 's disease , suggesting the potential for delaying -- maybe even avoiding -- the disease . People who kept their brains pumped scored higher on tests of their thinking ability .

Coleman suggests mixing it up : Try potentially stimulating activities like learning a new language or switching from reading nonfiction to fiction -- anything that poses a cognitive challenge .

Exercise benefits the mind too

Exercise seems to slow the descent toward dementia as well .

In one group of patients with mild cognitive impairment , exercising seemed to protect against developing dementia . Data on a different group of healthy patients who exercised -- either lightly or vigorously -- showed they were less likely to be diagnosed with cognitive impairment .

`` We would never say that these things totally prevent Alzheimer 's , that they will cure you , '' said Coleman , a geriatrician . `` But they 're going to help your brain . ''

A smell test may detect Alzheimer 's

In two separate studies , scientists found that people who were unable to identify certain odors were more likely to experience cognitive impairment . The researchers believe that brain cells crucial to a person 's sense of smell are killed in the early stages of dementia .
