About 28,000 customers , most of them in Humboldt County , were left without power Saturday evening , said Jeff Smith , spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. . One gas leak in the county was also reported .

Nearly a dozen aftershocks followed , the strongest at 4.5 magnitude .

Calls from concerned citizens were pouring into police and fire departments . Gary Bird , spokesman for the 28,000-population Eureka , said 25 responders were surveying the scene .

`` We 've got isolated water line breaks , power lines down , broken windows , unreinforced buildings that had some bricks fall off into the street , '' he said , adding that residents have been asked to stay inside .

Chris Durant , a reporter for the Times-Standard of Eureka , said he was working on the second floor of the newspaper 's concrete building when he and his colleagues felt the quake .

`` We are used to feeling small ones , '' he said , `` but after the first few seconds , we looked at each other and said this is not a small one . ''

He said small chunks of plaster peppered the floor . Still , he said reports from the area indicate minor damage .

iReporter Andrew Parent of Eureka was driving home from work when he saw people running out of their homes and power lines down .

He rushed home to find a state of disarray -- dishes everywhere , a bookshelf toppled over .

`` The fridge moved . Everything moved , '' said parent , 20 . `` I guess it 's not really a big deal , but it was kind of scary . ''

Eureka resident Cole Machado told CNN he was talking on the phone when he felt the ground shake .

He said the quake had a `` strong shaking to it and was rather lengthy . ''

He said his department has received numerous calls about broken glass , emptied shelves , and stucco and plaster knocked off walls . However , he added that the damage is cosmetic and that no buildings have collapsed .

Grinsell said officials have asked residents to stay off the roads because of debris and to conserve water until it 's certain there is no damage to the water system .

There was no tsunami warning issued .

A 6.5-magnitude quake is considered a `` strong '' temblor , according to CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras , who noted that about 120 are recorded worldwide each year .

Dave Magni , owner of the Ivanhoe Hotel in Ferndale , said , `` We are sitting in a sea of booze '' after the quake . He felt an aftershock while talking with CNN . `` My employees are out in the parking lot right now , '' he added .

CNN 's Nick Valencia , Samira Simone and Greg Morrison contributed to this report .
