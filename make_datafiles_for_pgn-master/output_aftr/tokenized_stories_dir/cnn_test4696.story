Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The National Republican Senatorial Committee pushed its first TV spot in a $ 1 million ad campaign in South Dakota to attack the Republican nominee 's top two opponents in what has become a competitive three-way race for the seat .

The 30-second spot , which hit South Dakota airwaves Tuesday , links Democratic opponent Rick Weiland and Republican-turned-Independent former Sen. Larry Pressler as holding the same positions on gun laws , energy and Obamacare and comes less than a week after Democrats announced their own $ 1 million campaign to attack Republican nominee former Gov. Mike Rounds .

For now , Rounds still leads the four-man pack , which also includes Independent Gordon Howie , a social conservative running to Rounds ' right who barely registers in the polls .

Country-singing Senate hopeful ` rocks ' South Dakota race

A SurveyUSA poll released last week showed the race is a three-way split with Pressler trailing the Republican nominee by just three points , with Weiland another four points behind the independent .

Until Pressler gained traction , Rounds was considered a shoe-in for the Senate seat in what is traditionally a red state .

By taking on both candidates , the Republican Senatorial campaign arm is gearing up to deflect Democratic ads against Rounds , which could be a boon for either Pressler or Rounds .

Pressler has n't said who he would caucus with if elected back into the Senate -- after a nearly 20-year hiatus -- but has been open and unabashed about his support for President Barack Obama , first endorsing Obama in his 2008 run .
