After finding it nearly impossible to get a job he decided to forge his own future . Now , over 20 years since he kicked his drug-habit , the Singaporean is the successful owner of a chain of restaurants called Eighteen Chefs .

While the restaurants focus on providing quality food , from the beginning Teo was determined that his business venture would also concentrate on helping those marginalized by society .

`` I realized that in society there is this gap . Where once you have a criminal record you are unable to live a normal life , you are unable to integrate back to society , '' he says .

However , Teo found that the high number of ex-offenders was too difficult to manage . His first Eighteen Chefs establishment started off with a smaller proportion , 35 % in 2012 , and now 50 % of his employees are troubled young people and people with criminal records .

There have been a number of success stories among staff , one of Teo 's employees began as a server and is now a regional manager at an international restaurant earning more than $ 6,000 a month .

While his new life is free of his old habits and addictions , his restaurants retain an allusion to his former ways : the number 18 refers to a well-known Singaporean street gang .
