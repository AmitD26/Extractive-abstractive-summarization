-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With a climate that ranges from desert dry to tropical lush to freeze-your-North-Face-off in the Andes , Peru packs a ton of diversity between its sea level elevation Pacific beaches and the 22,204 foot top of its highest mountain , Nevado Huascaran .

While most international travelers land in Peru 's current capital , many immediately continue on to the country 's former capital , Cuzco , in their rush to get to Machu Picchu .

That 's a mistake .

Fresh , raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chili peppers and sometimes other tongue-tingling spices , ceviche is Peru 's most popular dish , a must-try for any visitor .

In Lima , internationally famed La Mar is a great place to try it , but ceviche is prepared differently throughout the country , from humble street stalls to elegant restaurants .

Was the Incan era a highlight of Peruvian history ? Unquestionably .

But when Peruvian museums boast artifacts from before Christ , focusing exclusively on Atahualpa and his predecessors is akin to being so impressed by books that you conclude world history began with the Gutenberg press .

Peru 's beverage of choice is pisco , a brandy made from grapes . It 's also adored in Chile , inspiring an epic rivalry over which nation is its true birthplace .

Available in numerous brands at varying prices , pisco is usually consumed in cocktail form , meaning other ingredients largely hide its nuances , which can be a good thing for novices unaccustomed to pisco 's blowtorch nuances .

The most famous cocktail is the pisco sour , consisting of lime juice , simple syrup , egg white , ice and Angostura bitters . There are assorted variations , such as the coca sour for those who feel the pisco sour requires more bitterness .

If you 'd rather just have a beer , you 're in luck -- the local brews are good , with CusqueÃ ± a being a particularly refreshing option .

5 . Cash is king , ideally in small bills

Travelers in less trafficked areas of the world often find businesses that wo n't take MasterCard or Visa , much less American Express . Peru offers an extra twist : occasionally shops refuse these cards despite displaying signs advertising them .

In general , Peruvians like their soles -LRB- the currency is the nuevo sol -RRB- in small denominations : a fifty -LRB- roughly $ 20 -RRB- is OK , but denominations of twenty and under are better to ensure merchants can make change .

6 . Altitude adjustment amounts to common sense

Peru is a mountainous land , and you have to handle heights if you 're going to Cuzco , Machu Picchu and other landmarks of Incan culture .

How to prepare ? The easiest method is drink lots of water , get plenty of sleep and ease off the booze -- just imagine how your mother would like you to conduct your life at every elevation and you 'll be fine .

7 . The plumbing requires some TLC

Expect to see trashcans in bathrooms next to the toilet . While Peruvian plumbing handles your waste , it does n't do toilet paper , which must be put in the bin next to the bowl .

8 . The Inca Trail is genuinely difficult

Along the famed trail you 'll often be reminded of the Peruvian proverb : `` When the road is long , even slippers feel tight . ''

If just reading this makes your knees swell , you may be in trouble .

In addition , while altitude sickness tends to be exaggerated , there 'll come a moment when you 're going up a hill and find that your lungs have betrayed you .

Throw in the chance of heavy rains -- test your `` waterproof '' gear pretrek to make sure it 's just that -- and the trail can feel less like vacation than boot camp .

Depending on the company guiding you on the Trail , it 's possible to get porters to carry your tent , sleeping bag , food and ... well , they 'll essentially carry everything , including you , should your body completely fall to pieces .

10 . Porters are the toughest guys in the country

If you feel like racing your fellow hikers , great . Do not test the porters : They 're pros , and you 're at best a promising amateur .
