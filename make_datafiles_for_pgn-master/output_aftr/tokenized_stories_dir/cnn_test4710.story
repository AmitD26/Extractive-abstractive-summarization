While her success could be brushed off with the industry motto `` all publicity is good publicity , '' those who 've closely watched the 20-year-old 's development say that 's not the whole story .

In CNN 's `` The Life of Miley Cyrus , '' which examines Cyrus ' music , message and personal journey , insiders who 've intimately come to know the singer/actress say that her transition from a childhood of ATVs and cheerleading to adult superstardom was no accident . Instead , Cyrus has executed her transformation with total control .

After all , Halperin says , `` there was a time when people thought Miley Cyrus would never be on Top 40 radio , because Disney was too squeaky clean . Well ... she 's certainly turned that around . ''

According to Josh Eells , the Rolling Stone writer who went skydiving and to a tattoo shop with Cyrus for Rolling Stone 's recent cover story , believes the beginning of this transition happened at 17 , when Cyrus was filming the comedy `` LOL '' in Detroit with Demi Moore .

According to Steven Peterman , an executive producer on Cyrus ' old show , `` Hannah Montana , '' that sort of risk-taking is nothing new .

`` The thing that makes you wonder , ` What 's she gon na do next , ? ' I 've been asking that about her since the day I met her , '' Peterman said .

When Cyrus was first auditioning for the part , `` she was the least likely person to get this job , '' Peterman continued . But with her combination of vocal talent and that unpredictability , she wound up winning the creative team over to her side .

And then there 's that tongue .

But , Eells suggests , `` the things that we see that seem crazy are very calculatedly crazy . Pharrell -LRB- Williams -RRB- phrased it in a very long text message that he wrote to her : ` You 're not a train wreck , you 're the train pulling everyone else along . ' -LRB- Cyrus -RRB- seems to be totally together and with it and knows exactly what 's going on . ''

Halperin agrees , noting that it is n't easy to simply wake up and decide to aim for the top of the hot singles chart .

In order to build any longevity , Halperin explains , `` we need to see her go through these musical phases and these stylistic changes , too . We can look back at any -LRB- act -RRB- -- Justin Timberlake or 'N Sync -- and laugh at what they wore , what they sang . But at the moment , it was perfect for what the audience was looking for . -LRB- Cyrus -RRB- knows what her audience wants .

Right now , Cyrus knows that her audience wants honesty -- sometimes of the naked variety . And with `` Hannah Montana '' getting farther in her rear view , frank vulnerability is what the pop star can offer .
