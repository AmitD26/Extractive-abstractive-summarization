That 's why Martin Romero asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to donate his wish to improve the local baseball fields that were his second home .

Originally , he wanted to skydive for his wish .

When his condition worsened in January , Martin decided he wanted to upgrade the Albuquerque , New Mexico , fields where he had played baseball since he was 6 years old .

Make-A-Wish donated $ 2,000 for improvements at South Valley Little League Baseball Field .

Martin died in January , before he could see the renovated fields .

His father said the new asphalt between fields makes it easier for people using wheelchairs , walkers or strollers to watch the games up close and support their teams . A painting of the young man was also added at the park .
