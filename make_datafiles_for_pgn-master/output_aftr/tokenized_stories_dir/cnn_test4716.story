An American doctor and a North Carolina missionary working with Ebola victims were the first to bring the deadly virus to the United States when they contracted the virus in Liberia and were flown home for treatment .

While the Texas nurse remains in isolation , a nurse in Spain who contracted the virus after treating a patient in that country is struggling for her life .

Every single move they make in treating a patient must be perfect . One slip-up -- a torn glove or the smallest splat of infected fluid that gets on them -- could cost them their lives .

One provider in West Africa spoke of waking up every morning with a sore throat from constantly breathing in the fumes from chlorine that must be constantly sprayed to kill the virus that is capable of thriving not just in living organisms but on surfaces for some time if conditions are right .

Health care workers battle not just a disease but rumors among patients in Africa that Ebola is a myth the government is perpetrating . In a profession that already demands much emotionally and physically , these caregivers are pushed to the edge in both respects . They have lost friends , colleagues and patients .

All this as they beat back their own understandable paranoia and fear . Have I done everything correctly ? Could I be next ?

Caregivers ' cry for help

Doctors Without Borders said it 's repeatedly asked for help from the international community but `` to this date , very little has materialized in concrete action on the ground , '' its website says . The organization 's teams , composed of 3,058 staff working in Guinea , Liberia , Nigeria , Sierra Leone and Senegal , are seeing `` critical gaps in all aspects of the response , including medical care , training of health staff , infection control , contact tracing , epidemiological surveillance , alert and referral systems and community education and mobilization . ''

Just days ago , CNN 's cameras captured crowds of caregivers yelling outside Liberia 's largest Ebola treatment center in Monrovia .

Underscoring the serious consequences of a Liberia without health care workers , President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf arrived to try to calm the crowd .

`` We 're trying to meet all their needs , and we 'll continue to do that , '' she told CNN , struggling to be heard above the shouting .

`` I do n't want to strike , '' one caregiver said , telling CNN that he foresees deaths increasing several thousand-fold if facilities ' conditions do n't improve .

`` But the President has to listen to the massive health care workers out there , '' he said . `` There are angry people . You do n't want to have angry people knocking on your doors during this kind of emergency situation . ''

A legacy of self-sacrifice

The mother of modern nursing , Florence Nightingale , suffered for her dedication to treating patients during the Crimea War . It 's believed that she also contracted a bacterial infection as she treated the wounded , dealing the effects of the illness for much of her life .

Just as Nightingale was revered as a hero , so too was Dr. Sheik Umar Khan , a top doctor from Sierra Leone who specialized in Ebola . He died in late July from the virus .

He had been overseeing Ebola treatment at Kenema Government Hospital , about 185 miles east of Sierra Leone 's capital city , Freetown . Doctors Without Borders was treating him .

Even before the Ebola outbreak , Sierra Leone had already been suffering from a shortage of doctors , nurses and infrastructure , he said . The jobs of health care workers were made all the worse when they attempted to track and monitor the contacts of infected people because roads were difficult to traverse . Crowded housing made the effort even more difficult , he said .

The nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas who has Ebola had `` extensive contact '' at the same hospital with an Ebola patient who died last week , health officials said .

The woman had on a gown , gloves , mask and a shield when she visited the patient multiple times , they said , but there was a breach in treatment protocol .

Dr. Tom Frieden , the director of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , did not detail what that breach might have been .

Her voice rising as she spoke , Katy Roemer , a 20-year nursing veteran , said that colleagues throughout the United States . have reported to the union that they are not being adequately trained to recognize and care for Ebola patients even though they have asked employers for that .

What does it feel like to know you 're going to treat a patient with a disease that kills 90 % of its victims ?

`` There was no way to fully prepare for the pressure , the national focus , the immensity of being responsible for curing a patient whose deadly disease was at the center of global debate , '' wrote Angela Hewlett in The Washington Post . The infectious disease physician is an assistant medical director for the Nebraska Biocontainment Patient Care Unit at the Nebraska Medical Center where she treated American Dr. Richard Sacra .

She wrote about going through drills and training and about feeling nervous before he arrived . She talked with her family about what they might experience from people judging or making comments born of ignorance and fear about the virus .

She also illuminated the difference between a doctor who able to connect and comfort a patient through touch by placing a hand on an arm . Establishing that calm and assurance is a vital and human part of being a caregiver . But Ebola takes that from nurses and doctors . It is interrupted by bulky gear . The key to not getting Ebola , after all , is to keep those suffering separate from others .

And yet nurses and doctors continue their work out of practical necessity and because it 's their commitment and passion and because , as Hewlett noted , they are fascinated by how medicine might defeat a virus that 's considered a global threat .

And for some in West Africa , it really is a matter of survival .
