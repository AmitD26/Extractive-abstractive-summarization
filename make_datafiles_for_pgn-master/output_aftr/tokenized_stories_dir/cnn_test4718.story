-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The American held in North Korea , Matthew Miller , begins his six-year sentence of hard labor on Thursday .

A North Korean government official released a photo of Miller , taken on Wednesday . Dressed in a blue-gray prison garment with the number 107 and his head shaved , Miller is seen with his eyes downcast , staring away from the camera .

Details about where he 'll serve his sentence or what labor he will be required to do were not released .

Miller was convicted of committing `` acts hostile '' to North Korea and sentenced earlier this month . North Korea has accused him of ripping up his visa on arrival to the country so he could go to prison and expose human rights violations there , according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency .

`` He perpetrated the above-said acts in the hope of becoming a world famous guy and the second Snowden through intentional hooliganism , '' state media said .

He has also written a letter imploring U.S. officials for help . The letters have been sent to Miller 's family in which he addressed Speaker of the House John Boehner , Sen. Mitch McConnell , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , Sen. Barbara Boxer , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and first lady Michelle Obama .

Miller told CNN 's Will Ripley in a brief interview earlier this month in Pyongyang that he `` prepared to violate the law of DPRK before coming here . And I deliberately committed my crime . '' But he did n't elaborate on what his `` crime '' was .
