Beijing , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the wake of a series of court scandals , an influential Communist Party legal commission issued new guidelines this week asking for fairer due process in China 's much maligned court system .

The guidelines , released by the Commission for Politics and Laws , call for interrogations to be recorded to prevent torture , defendants to have access to their attorneys , and judges , prosecutors and police to have a `` lifetime responsibility '' for their roles on each case .

`` Court cases in the past often deviate from regulations and were influenced by external causes , even though there has been clear regulations to guarantee defendants ' right , '' says Professor Zhang Qianfan of Peking University .

Zhang , a noted champion of legal reform , says courts do n't always follow regulations and the key test of reform will be implementation .

Many of the guidelines are not new . China 's legislative body unveiled a new Criminal Procedure Act in 2012 that aimed to give defendants more rights , but was criticized for increasing police power .

Rights groups regularly accuse Chinese security organs of torture and forced confessions in criminal cases . A landmark study -LRB- Criminal Justice in China : An Empirical Inquiry -RRB- completed in 2011 found that 95 % of those accused in China confess to their crimes .

During a decade in power , China 's previous president Hu Jintao put the brakes on legal reform seen in the years after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 . Several prominent legal minds in China were ostracized or sidelined .

Many Chinese , who see a legal system beset with corruption and frequently influenced by the powerful , will often turn to petitioning and protest .

`` There is clearly hope at the moment for momentum in legal reform , '' says Bequelin . `` The leadership should understand that it 's in everyone 's best interest that the judiciary not only has a functional role , but is trusted by the people . ''

`` If you recognize the rule of law as the fundamental guiding principle and the constitution as the abiding rule in China , then what does that mean for party control ? '' says Carl Minzer , a China expert at Fordham Law School .

`` There is a big discrepancy between the way China works on paper and how it works in practice , '' says Minzer .

Left out of the new guidelines altogether are the way the party deals with perceived political threats .

Bequelin says that in sensitive cases where the party feels threatened , torture , ill treatment and extracted confessions are the norm .

He does n't expect that to change .
