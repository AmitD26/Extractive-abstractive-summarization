Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The space shuttle Endeavour 's journey of 123 million miles ended Sunday afternoon when it rolled into its final resting place at the California Science Center in Los Angeles , where it will go on public display later this month .

Now , after 25 space missions in its 22-year career , Endeavour will be parked in a display pavilion built just for the shuttle .

`` Mission 26 : Mission accomplished ! '' said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .

Science center President Jeff Rudolph said everyone along the route was positive and encouraging .

As Endeavour neared the science center it had to travel down Martin Luther King Jr. . Boulevard , lined with Canary Island pine trees dedicated to the late civil rights leader that officials did not want to cut down .

Specialists were part of the convoy to make sure the Endeavour and its transporter platform , which together weigh more than 80 tons , did n't stress underground water and sewer systems . Crews laid 2,700 steel plates on parts of the route .

Gwendolyn Crews , owner of a preschool , told CNN she was bringing her entire preschool to watch the Endeavour 's arrival at the museum .

`` I think this is a history-making moment here in Los Angeles , California , and I want to be able to share this with my kids , my grandkids , my great-grandkids ... and the children of our school , '' Crews said .

Villaraigosa called the shuttle 's trip through the city a once-in-a-lifetime event .

Latasha Covington and her children , 9-year-old Skilyn and 4-year-old Amarie , brought a chair out Saturday to stand on to get a better view .

Endeavour 's final journey , are you there ?

Named for the first ship commanded by British explorer James Cook , Endeavour cost $ 1.7 billion when it rolled out as a replacement for Challenger , which exploded shortly after its 10th launch .

The museum will display the shuttle horizontally in the pavilion while it builds a new addition to its facility , the Air and Space Center . When that center opens in five years , the shuttle will be on display in its vertical launch position .
