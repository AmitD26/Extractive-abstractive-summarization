-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Redemption is not easy to attain .

Four years on and the scars still remain .

When France 's footballers left for Brazil , they were under no illusions -- it can not happen again .

Four years ago the picture was grim .

Fast-forward to the present and perhaps , just perhaps , France may get the opportunity to shock the world for all the right reasons .

It is a far cry for the disillusionment and disappointment which cast a shadow of French football during its last foray into the World Cup .

`` What happened , happened , '' coach Didier Deschamps said when he announced his 2014 World Cup roster on national television .

`` That wo n't go away . It put a stamp on our history . But we do n't need to discuss it again . ''

Deschamps and his players have spoken at length of moving on from the embarrassment of four years ago -- but few expected them to achieve much in Brazil .

But Deschamps , a World Cup hero on home soil in 1998 , has brought about a unity in the squad which has not been seen for many a year .

He commands respect -- it helps if you 've won the World Cup and European Championships as well as a host of titles at club level .

But such is the quality at his disposal , Deschamps never panicked , even when Nigeria appeared to take the game to his side in the opening 45 minutes .

Paul Pogba 's 79th minute header and an own-goal from Joseph Yobo smoothed France 's passage into the next round following a difficult afternoon .

`` There was tension out there . They are a very strong side and there were a lot of duels .

Only three African teams have ever reached the quarterfinals of the World Cup -- Ghana the last to do so four years ago .

But France , a side which won its group with a style and swagger which was so sorely lacking four years ago , hinted at a far more difficult challenge .

The Super Eagles , who won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013 , arrived in Brasilia as underdogs , not that you would have known it during the early stages of the contest .

Perhaps that piece of luck awoke France from its slumber as just moments later a fine move almost broke the deadlock .

Paul Pogba , one of the most exciting young midfielders in the game , burst into space before feeding Mathieu Valbuena .

Valbuena , free of any Nigeria pressure , then produced an inch-perfect cross that Pogba met with a rasping volley which Vincent Enyeama saved in spectacular fashion .

But that save apart , he was a mere spectator in the first half with France failing to register another shot on target .

France , which had lost two of its previous three World Cup games against African opposition , might have been expected to emerge a different side after the interval .

But that fluidity so evident in group-stage victories over Honduras and Switzerland still proved elusive .

Instead , Nigeria continued to look the more threatening of the two sides -- Peter Odemwingie 's fierce effort bringing a sharp save out of Hugo Lloris in the French goal .

U.S. referee Mark Geiger showed a yellow card -- much to the consternation of the Nigerians , who believed the challenge warranted more than just a caution .

It was only with the introduction of Antoine Griezmann in place of the disappointing Olivier Giroud up front that France began to look dangerous .

Suddenly , it was France which began to take control , with its passing game finally causing Nigeria problems .

But , with 11 minutes to go , France finally got the breakthrough it had threatened .

`` There are no words to describe this , '' said Pogba after helping his side past Nigeria .

`` I know there is a whole country behind us . Scoring that goal really liberated us . I am so happy for the team and all France . I 'm speechless .

`` To score a goal for your country , especially in an important match like this to get into the World Cup quarter finals , it 's one of the best moments of my life . ''

Pogba 's goal -- the 146th of the tournament , one more than was managed at the entire 2010 World Cup -- set up a frantic finale as Nigeria pushed forward in search of an equalizer .

The second goal appeared inevitable and it duly arrived during stoppage time when Joseph Yobo , making his 100th international appearance , deflected Mathieu Valbuena 's cross into his own net .

It was a sad end to an afternoon which had begun with such promise for Nigeria -- but for France , the chance for redemption remains .
