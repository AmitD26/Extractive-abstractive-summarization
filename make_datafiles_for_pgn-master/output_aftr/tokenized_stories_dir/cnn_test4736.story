-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the Winter Olympics roll around , Canadians pretty much always expect the national hockey team to win gold .

Sure enough the squad ultimately did n't disappoint in Sochi , claiming the finale 3-0 against Sweden on the final day of the Games .

It was Canada 's second straight men 's gold at the Olympics and third in the past four . And coupled with the women coming out on top in the women 's competition , it gave Canada a much coveted hockey double .

Canada finished third in golds and fourth overall after it blanked Sweden at the Bolshoy Ice Dome .

`` I think anyone knows the talent and ability this team has , '' centerman Jonathan Toews told Canada 's CBC . `` A huge credit goes to our commitment to playing a team game and will to win .

`` Playing behind that group of guys was a lot of fun , '' Price told the CBC . `` That work ethic that those guys brought to the ice every day made my job easier . ''

As he did following the semifinals , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper took to Twitter to congratulate the team .

Sweden entered the clash short-handed , with key centerman Nicklas Backstrom of the Washington Capitals testing positive for a banned stimulant .

`` I have n't done anything differently in the past seven years and I 've been playing internationally all that time . ''

`` In addition , the specific substance that resulted in the positive test is not currently on the League 's Prohibited Substances List .

`` Subject to confirmation of the facts as we understand them , and given the fact that the substance is neither prohibited in the NHL nor was used in an improper manner here , we do not anticipate there being any consequences relative to Nicklas ' eligibility to participate in games for the Washington Capitals . ''

Russian 1-2-3

Russia was tied with Norway for gold medals won prior to Sunday and led the U.S. by two overall . The 1-2-3 finish in the cross country ensured glory in both categories .

Alexander Legkov edged Maxim Vylegzhanin by 0.7 seconds , with Ilia Chernousov capturing the bronze in a photo finish . Legkov 's time was a shade past one hour , 46 minutes .

Alexander Zubkov added to Russia 's tally of golds in the four-man bobsleigh , his quartet squeaking past Oskars Melb√Ñ
