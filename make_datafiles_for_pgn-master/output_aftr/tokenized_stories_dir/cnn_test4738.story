-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sometimes the price of success is losing the thing you most cherish .

For Charlotte Dujardin , every triumph in the sporting arena seemingly took her another step closer to an uncertain future .

Billed as `` The Girl with the Dancing Horse '' after her heroics at the London 2012 Olympics , she feared that every time she competed would be the last waltz with her equine partner .

The mere thought of losing her `` best friend '' reduced Dujardin to tears .

Valegro , the horse on which she won double gold , on which she was crowned double European champion and on which she aims to repeat the feat at August 's world championships , was attracting big offers .

`` His future is secure -- he is never going to be sold , we have him forever , '' the British rider says of the 12-year-old horse , which is co-owned by her mentor and fellow Olympic champion Carl Hester and Roly Luard .

`` It 's an unbelievable relief . It was really , really hard knowing that every competition we did might be our last one . I never knew what was going on , I was too afraid to ask , '' Dujardin tells CNN .

`` I did n't want Charlotte to feel like he might be sold -- it 's not great to ride under those conditions . Besides , Valegro has been with us since he was two so whoever we sell him to , are they going to look after him the way we do ? Probably not . ''

Dujardin describes Valegro -- more affectionately known as Blueberry at his yard -- as a Ferrari and , to all intents and purposes , she is a Fernando Alonso as she wrestles the ultimate horsepower out of him .

`` He 's a real hot horse who likes to work , and he 's just the most willing and comfortable horse to ride , '' she says of their `` telepathic '' partnership .

`` As for me , I just do what I do . I just have a feeling inside me and I ca n't wholly explain that feeling . ''

Dujardin is the world No. 1 in dressage , which is split into two events -LRB- the set routine and the freestyle -RRB- and holds the world records in all three elements of her sport -- the freestyle , Grand Prix and Grand Prix Special .

Her most recent record came at last month 's Reem Acra FEI World Cup Final in Lyon with a score of 87.129 % comfortably beating her previous milestone of 85.942 set at the European Championships . She scored 92.179 % in the freestyle section .

Surely there is a ceiling to the records ?

`` I do n't know what the limit is although I do believe we can at least beat the freestyle record . There still feels like there 's more to come . ''

`` I 've done more than I ever dreamed of . I 've just worked hard to get to the top . I 've had so many letters from people saying I 've inspired them to take up riding and that 's an amazing feeling .

Her biggest home display will forever be the London 2012 Olympics . The British team had entered it looking for a first Olympic medal in the discipline in over a century , and she ended up picking up two golds -RRB- in the space of just a week .

`` People wanted me to do everything , and I found that really , really tough . It was a very difficult time .

`` Part of that was down to the uncertainty of not knowing Valegro 's future but obviously that 's all changed . ''

Throughout it all , the pair kept on winning and breaking records , but the complete happiness has fully returned in 2014 .

But there are no retirement plans . She and Valegro have plenty of competitions ahead of them . But she is relishing their new lease of life together .

It is a far cry from the rider that first turned up at the yard of Hester , himself an Olympic champion who described her as Edwina Scissorhands , because of her wooden riding skills akin to the character played by Johnny Depp in the 1990 movie Edward Scissorhands .

Hers and Hester 's relationship can still be a volatile one -- Dujardin admitting `` we occasionally scream and shout at each other '' -- but it is clearly stronger for the certainty over Valegro 's future .

Dujardin knows she can save the pair 's last dance for some time .
