We lost the ability to see the world through Niedringhaus ' compelling lens . We lost her insight , and we lost what would have come from her commitment to helping us understand the complexities of our world . Most of all , we lost the benefits of her unique ability to show us the connection between historical events and individual human beings .

Niedringhaus and her close friend , AP correspondent Kathy Gannon , were covering the run-up to elections when an Afghan policeman walked toward their car , shouted `` Allahu akbar '' and shot them both . Gannon , also a veteran journalist with vast experience covering the world 's most dangerous places , was injured .

The shooting , as it happens , came shortly after the Women 's Media Center released its report , `` The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014 . ''

The snapshot taken in the last quarter of 2013 found men still had almost two-thirds of all bylines and on-camera appearances in the major newspapers , television networks , newswire services and online news sites . We have seen notable improvements over the years , but the report points to `` a troubling status quo and , in some places , a slipping back in time . ''

This is not just a matter of concern to women journalists . We are all shortchanged when women are subtly edged out of reporting on major world news .

I wo n't argue here whether women are more sensitive in their coverage . But I will tell you this : Women listen to other women much more closely , and they pay much greater attention to how political and military developments affect individuals , particularly other women .

Now that the U.S. is about to leave Afghanistan , the prospect that hard-won gains will be reversed creates enormous fears for Afghan women .

To see how this is covered , I googled three words : `` Afghan Women Fear . '' The first six news stories on the subject were all written by women .

Read the six stories : Rights slipping away / Peace talk plans / Silenced by fear / More backsliding / Hope and fear / The future

Niedringhaus once wrote , `` For me it is about showing the struggle and survival of the individual . ''

You can see that clearly in her stunning pictures , especially on Afghanistan ; in the image of a little girl struggling to see through her face-covering burqa , or a boy riding a merry-go-round while brandishing a toy machine gun , or in the gallery of portraits of the women in Afghanistan 's parliament , the ones who have beaten the odds in a place where men 's grip on power has been so hard to loosen .

To be sure , a number of women journalists have strong and respected voices . CNN 's Christiane Amanpour is a major figure in international journalism , and both ABC News and the `` PBS NewsHour '' are anchored by distinguished women journalists .

On the other side of the lens , you might be surprised to find countless talented and courageous women . When I was a CNN staffer , many of the network 's top videographers were women . I still count many women friends among the people risking their lives covering conflict around the world .

When it comes to news analysis and opinion -- a topic of particular interest to me -- the situation is just as bad , if not worse . Men opinion writers , according to the new report , outnumber women 4-to-1 .

That 's barely an improvement over 2011 , when the OpEd Project found women wrote just 20 % of op-eds in the country 's top newspapers , and were `` practically absent in the debate '' on hard news topics , writing just 13 % of opinions on international politics and 11 % of opinions on the economy . Women wrote about half of all commentary on food , recreation , family and style .

We are still seeing the world mostly through men 's eyes . We are still hearing it explained to us mostly by men . And for the one-third of stories that come from women , from the pictures we were fortunate to have thanks to Anja Niedringhaus , from the stories we 've read thanks to Kathy Gannon , we know what a difference it makes to have women in the front lines of journalism .
