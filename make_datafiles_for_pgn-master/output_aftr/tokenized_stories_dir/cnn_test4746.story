And we better get used to it .

Part of the problem , of course , is us . We sit thousands of miles away , in a protected cocoon with nonpredatory neighbors to our north and south and fish to our east and west -- what one historian brilliantly called our liquid assets . And while this physical detachment is a wondrous advantage , it has also given us a very skewed view of the world .

We may have freed ourselves from the dark forces of history and geography . But the rest of the world has n't . Just ask the Russians , Chinese , Iranians , Egyptians , Israelis or many others .

For a start , our skewed view contributes to our naivete because we no longer really understand the mentality of the small power who lives in the bad neighborhood on the knife 's edge . It also explains our arrogance , because we really do n't have to listen . Our margin for error is very wide given our size , power and protected status , which helps explain our idealism and why we somehow believe we can and should find those solutions .

Even our current president believed that the Arab Spring required the United States to get on the right side of history by acquiescing in former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's downfall . But Egypt today is arguably less free and prosperous than under Mubarak . And let 's not forget President Barack Obama 's words about `` ultimately defeating ISIS . ''

Let 's get real .

Even though we killed Osama bin Laden and dismantled al Qaeda 's central core , the gravest threat to our security right now is n't ISIS at all but an affiliate of an al Qaeda we were supposedly to have destroyed , al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -LRB- AQAP -RRB- . These groups emerge from the poisonous environment that is now the Middle East . In order to defeat them permanently , we 'd have to fix the entire region . We ca n't do that .

The Middle East is a broken , angry , dysfunctional region -LRB- just make it BAD for short . -RRB- With the exception of Tunisia and perhaps Kurdistan -- both still works in progress -- and several of the Arab kings , the Arab world is melting down . It is now , and will be for a good deal longer , marked by civil war . It is dysfunctional , and it is made up of largely failed or failing states that lack good governance , respect for rule of law , gender equality , transparency , accountability and respect for freedom of conscience .

Some argue that more time is required -- they urge us not to judge prematurely . Fair enough . But even the longer term trend lines do n't look good .

Where are the leaders who are capable and willing to rise above their narrow partisan , sectarian affiliations to govern in the interests of a nation as whole ? Where are the institutions that reflect the popular will , inclusiveness and legitimacy of the public ? And where is the good governance that seeks to deliver freedom , security and economic prosperity ? Ultimately , where are the moderates within the Arab Muslim world who will denounce , fight and marginalize the extremists who have corrupted their religion ?

The politically incorrect read on all of this is that this part of the world just is n't ready for prime time . Indeed , there is not a single issue that appears on the verge of a sustainable solution . And there wo n't be for some time to come .

These are , by and large , Middle Eastern problems , and their solutions will need to be owned by those who live in the neighborhood .
