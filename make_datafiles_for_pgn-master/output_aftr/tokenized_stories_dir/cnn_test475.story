Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything , it 's how tense and strained President Obama 's relationship is with Republicans in Congress .

And in an opinion piece on Thursday , Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010 . The new No. 2 Senate Republican also suggested that '' -LSB- i -RSB- t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country . ''

Low bar for new Congress

In the White House 's relationship with Capitol Hill , `` the real negative is clearly that the relationship with House Republicans is as bad as ever , '' CNN contributor and Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer said , adding that the House GOP refuses to acknowledge any mandate from Obama after November 's election .

Zelizer : GOP faces choice -- leadership or gridlock ?

Navarrette : The real issue is runaway spending

The already difficult relationship is n't helped by unique issues on each side .

The GOP has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality .

And buoyed by his electoral success in 2008 , legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term , Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans , even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff .

At the same event , Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months .

`` Now , if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone , '' Obama said , '' -LSB- I -RSB- f they think that 's going to be the formula for how we solve this thing , then they 've got another thing coming . That 's not how it 's going to work . '' Rather , Obama declared `` it 's going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice , at least as long as I 'm president . And I 'm going to be president for the next four years . ''

The president 's recent comments are like `` an end zone dance , a celebration '' or , in the world of mixed martial arts competition , like `` putting your foot on the other guy 's neck and holding your hand up in the air , '' after you 've felled your opponent , according to Navarrette .

Democrats counter that Obama has n't had anyone to make a deal with .

`` When John Boehner comes to the table and he ca n't even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to , I think you 've got a real crisis of leadership in the House , '' former White House press secretary Bill Burton said .

`` And so the president showed that even in that case , he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country , but going forward , you just wonder , how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get ? ''

Ultimately , Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate 's deal up for a House vote . By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set , Zelizer said , Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they did n't like the Senate deal .

The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated , according to Zelizer , because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation , that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House .

In order to improve their relationship with the White House , Navarette said Republicans `` have to fix what 's broken in their own party , they have to heal the divisions in their own party ... and define what the GOP is about . ''

Boehner re-elected speaker in midst of public defections

Calling it `` a miracle '' that Boehner was re-elected as speaker , Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama 's second term . Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems , including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed ? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition ?

Both are `` not terribly attractive options '' for the GOP , Navarette said , especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama .

For Obama , moderating his triumphal , defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because , Navarette points out , gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama 's second term agenda . And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama 's liberal base on both issues .

On the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years , Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves .

`` It 's going to be rough , going to be tough , we 're going to see this issue recur again and again over the years , '' the historian said .

Indeed , both Obama and McConnell , the GOP 's new lead fiscal negotiator , already seem to be playing out a familiar script .

McConnell quickly fired back .

`` The president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months , but it 's the fight he is going to have , because it 's a debate the country needs , '' McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night , adding that Obama `` must show up '' and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending .

Although he has sworn off direct negotiations with Obama , Boehner echoed McConnell 's remarks on Friday .
