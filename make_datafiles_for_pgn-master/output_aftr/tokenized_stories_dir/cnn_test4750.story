`` All of the major metro areas in the Northeast will be impacted by either heavy rain or heavy snow , along with high winds , '' said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen .

He said it 's too early to predict which metro areas will be hit hardest , but airport delays are predicted Wednesday in New York City , Philadelphia , Boston and Washington , D.C.

`` The I-95 corridor may end up being the dividing line between heavy snow and heavy rain , '' Hennen said . `` Either way travel in the Northeast will become dangerous , especially interior sections of the Northeast with heavy snow . ''

AAA is expecting 46 million Americans to travel 50 miles or more from home during the Thanksgiving weekend . That would be the most travelers since 2007 , AAA said in a press release .

On the bright side , people traveling by car will probably pay lower gas prices than in recent years , AAA says .

The current average price of gasoline in the United States is $ 2.85 per gallon , 43 cents per gallon lower than the average price for Thanksgiving in 2013 .

CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said a European computer model calls for a foot of snow in Connecticut and Massachusetts , whereas an American computer model does n't predict as much snow .
