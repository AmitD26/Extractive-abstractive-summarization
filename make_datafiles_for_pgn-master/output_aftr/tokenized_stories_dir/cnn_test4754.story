Police stopped short of calling the man a suspect .

`` He is someone we definitely have to talk to , '' NYPD Assistant Chief Joe Reznick told CNN on Thursday , `` But can we arrest him for this right now ? The answer is no , definitely not . ''

`` We 're very interested in him , '' a law enforcement official told CNN .

`` Baby Hope , '' a little girl whose body was found in a blue and white picnic cooler in a wooded area near the Henry Hudson Parkway on July 23 , 1991 , was never identified until this week .

Police now believe `` Baby Hope '' was South American , according to Reznick .

`` Trust me when I say the investigation is probably more active now than it 's ever been during the course of 22 years , '' Reznick said .

As CNN previously reported , police have identified the little girl and her mother but will not make either name public because of the ongoing investigation .

Thanks to a tip , the department confirmed the identity of the girl 's mother through DNA testing , according to Police Commissioner Ray Kelly . The body was exhumed in 2011 .

`` A DNA match was made with the mother and the mother has been cooperating , '' Kelly told reporters Tuesday . He declined to name the mother or provide details on the case .

The NYPD Cold Case Apprehension Squad never gave up hope , continuing to hand out flyers and canvas nearby neighborhoods every year on the anniversary of the discovery of the body .

Detective Robert Dewhurst , a member of the squad , told CNN in July that several detectives were still on the case and that people with information may speak many years later for many reasons , such as feeling safer after moving to a new area where they do n't see the person responsible every day .

For months after Baby Hope 's body was found , police went back to the site hoping whoever was responsible , driven by guilt , had left some type of memorial that would have helped police .

Baby Hope , two years after she was found , was laid to rest in a donated plot . She was buried in a white dress bought by a detective 's wife .
