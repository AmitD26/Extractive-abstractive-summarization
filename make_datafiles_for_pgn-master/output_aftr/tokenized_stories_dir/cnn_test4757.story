-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In just four days , Chris Picco went from husband and expectant father to a man without a family .

His wife Ashley died November 8 ; their newborn son , delivered by emergency cesarean section , died three days later .

In August , Ashley and Chris Picco celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary by posting a photo to Facebook . In the image , a tiny pair of fur-lined baby booties stands empty between the Southern California couple . `` Coming Soon '' is inscribed above . It is still Ashley 's cover photo .

Lennon James was born by emergency C-section three months early , `` fighting for his life , '' Chris posted . Although Chris was grieving Ashley 's loss , he thanked those who had reached out in several online postings .

`` It 's impossible to sum up what has happened in the past couple of days , '' he said . `` My wife , best friend and mother of my child passed away . I have a lifetime to grieve this unspeakable loss , but I know that right now she would want me to focus completely on baby Lennon James Picco ... ''

On Wednesday , a friend posted a video of Chris in the hospital , singing to his newborn son . The video shows Chris seated next to a whirring , clicking incubator , baby Lennon swaddled in blankets and surrounded by tubes . The video was recorded Tuesday , when Chris had posted , `` Ashley would often feel Lennon moving to music , so I brought my guitar today and gave him a little concert . ''

The song begins :

`` Blackbird singing in the dead of night

Take these broken wings and learn to fly

`` Dear friends , family , and supporters ; it is with an unbelievably heavy heart that I write this . My little fighter , Lennon James Picco went to sleep in his daddy 's arms late last night . He was surrounded by family , friends , and the best doctors , nurses and hospital staff in the world . He was dressed in an outfit that Ashley bought for him , with little guitars on it , and wrapped in a blanket made by a dear friend . I am so thankful for the four unforgettable days I got to spend with him . His mommy would have been so beyond joy to see him and to hold him , touch him , bathe him , sing to him - as I have had the privilege of doing . I have been so blessed and honored to love him before he was formed , to cherish him while mommy carried him , meet him face to precious face , and hold his perfect little body while we said ` goodbye for now ' . There are no words , but I wanted to keep you updated , as your love and support has meant more than anything in the world . All you need is love . ''
