-LRB- CNN -RRB- FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the head of the Confederation of African Football Issa Hayatou have slammed the `` western media '' over their reporting of the crowd violence that marred Thursday 's Africa Cup of Nations semifinal between Ghana and hosts Equatorial Guinea .

Thursday 's game saw home fans pelting Ghana 's players and supporters with bottles , rocks , broken glass and cutlery after Equatorial Guinea conceded two quick first half goals .

The game resumed in the second half but was halted after further violence directed at Ghana 's supporters .

There were reports of further riots in the streets around the stadium . Several Ghanaian supporters were also injured during the violence . One Ghanaian football official described the scene as being like a `` warzone . ''

Chaos

`` In front of me was utter chaos -- angry , screaming fans . But there were scared , scurrying fans , too , '' recalled Gary Al Smith , a Ghanaian football journalist who was in the stadium at the time .

`` I 've never played in front of anything like that and I 'd like to say sorry on behalf of my team , '' said Equatorial Guinea 's star player Emilio Nsue after the match was restarted and his team had lost 3-0 .

`` The media can play a role , must play a role , but they must play a role where the notions of respect and fair play are the basics , '' Blatter said .

`` Today the world opens the newspapers , watches television , and sees only murders and killing , '' he added .

`` We never talk about princesses marrying any more . ''

Equatorial Guinea had been fined close to $ 100,000 over the violence and ordered to pay the expenses of the 36 injured Ghanaian fans .

Third place

Saturday saw another potential flashpoint pass without incident .

Before the game several players had suggested that the tie should be played behind closed doors with no supporters .

One player , Democratic Republic of Congo defender Gabriel Zakuani , even suggested forfeiting the match altogether .

Meanwhile , journalists covering the event have reacted incredulously to Hayatou and Blatter 's remarks .
