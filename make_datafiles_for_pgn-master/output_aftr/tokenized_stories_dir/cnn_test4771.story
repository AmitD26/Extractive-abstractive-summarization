The Ebola outbreak in coastal West Africa is still contained to Guinea and Liberia , the World Health Organization announced Tuesday , despite rumors of the virus spreading to other countries .

Cases have been reported in Sierra Leone , Mali and Ghana , but the WHO says none has been confirmed . Rumored cases in Mali are still being investigated .

`` This is one of the most challenging Ebola outbreaks that we have ever faced , '' said Dr. Keiji Fukuda , WHO 's assistant director-general for health security .

It 's the first emergence of Ebola in western Africa , which means doctors and health officials in the region do n't have any experience with the virus . Outbreaks generate a lot of fear and anxiety , Fukuda said , which can lead to misinformation .

There are about 50 staff currently deployed in the area and more are set to go shortly . They are working to prevent the spread of infection , primarily in health care facilities , and are sending personal protective equipment to surrounding countries .

`` What is really important is to inform the population of Guinea and Conakry about this disease , as this is the first time they are facing Ebola , '' Jasarevic said . `` They need to know what it is and how they can protect themselves . ''

The aid organization Doctors Without Borders has called the outbreak unprecedented , because previous cases have been limited to a small area .

Ebola is one of the world 's deadliest viruses , causing a hemorrhagic fever that kills up to 90 % of those infected . It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system , causing high fever , headache and muscle pain , often accompanied by bleeding .

`` Ebola is clearly a severe disease , '' Fukuda said . `` It is also an infection that can be controlled . ... We know very well how this virus is transmitted . ''

The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- formerly Zaire -RRB- , where one of the first recorded outbreaks occurred in 1976 .
