China reacted angrily to the report , preventing people inside the country from visiting the two Times websites or searching for the terms `` New York Times '' and `` Wen Jiabao '' on popular social media platforms .

`` It 's trying to blacken China 's image and has ulterior motives , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a response to a question about the article , which mentioned Wen 's son , daughter , younger brother and brother-in-law as being among those who had grown rich during Wen 's time in power .

Asked about the decision to block the websites , Hong replied : `` China regulates the Internet in accordance with laws and regulations . ''

Chinese authorities have blacked out the broadcast signal for international television stations like CNN and the BBC when they have aired sensitive reports about the country .

The Times story about Wen 's family 's wealth comes at a particularly delicate time for the ruling Communist Party , only a matter of weeks before the start of the 18th Party Congress , at which the country 's next set of top leaders will be announced .

The blocking of the Times websites Friday also takes place four months after the introduction of the Chinese-language site , which the company said at the time was `` intended to draw readers from the country 's growing middle class '' through a mixture of reporting by Chinese journalists and Times articles translated from English .

The Times cited a company spokeswoman as expressing disappointment Friday that web access had been cut off .

`` We hope that full access is restored shortly , and we will ask the Chinese authorities to ensure that our readers in China can continue to enjoy New York Times journalism , '' said Eileen Murphy , according to The Times . `` We will continue to report and translate stories applying the same journalistic standards that are upheld across The New York Times .
