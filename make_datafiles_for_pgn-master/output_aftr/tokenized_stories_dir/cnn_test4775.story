What would you do if you only had one day to live ? Probably not spend time downloading and fiddling with a mobile app , we 're guessing .

But a new app , Sobrr , wants you to embrace life in just that way . It lets you create a social network geared toward meeting new people around you , sharing photos and videos of what you 're up to and supporting other users who are also living it up . Or whatever .

The kicker is that , anything you do using the app is totally erased after 24 hours . Texts you send to other users disappear after a few seconds and photos or videos you share can go away nearly as quickly .

So , you can call Sobrr the anti-Facebook . But if you want to call it Tinder meets Snapchat meets Foursquare , you would n't be that far-off either .

No , Yang says , his app is n't just another tool for the hookup culture or a way to send naughty photos without having to answer for them later . But if somebody wants to use it that way ? He 's not here to stop them .

`` From the party animals that I 've surveyed , more than half admitted that they want to meet new people in the party , and crave for a one-night stand , '' he said .

Sobrr lets users post content `` that they might otherwise feel too embarrassed to post on other platforms , '' he said . Yang also said it 's important for users `` to have their own space and little secrets . ''

It 's possible the Silicon Valley startup is onto something . In the past year or so , ephemeral messaging apps such as Snapchat , Confide and Wickr have flourished .

So far , the app 's user base remains relatively small , boasting 10,000 users in the weeks it 's been available exclusively for Apple 's mobile devices . Whether more folks will flock to it to live a more carefree social media life , or merely hide the evidence from their wild nights out , remains to be seen .
