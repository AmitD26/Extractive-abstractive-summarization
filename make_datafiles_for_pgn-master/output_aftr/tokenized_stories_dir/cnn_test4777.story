Iceland is working on banning Internet pornography , calling explicit online images a threat to children .

`` At the moment , we are looking at the best technical ways to achieve this . But surely if we can send a man to the moon , we must be able to tackle porn on the Internet . ''

Such a step is somewhat surprising among Western nations that , for the most part , champion free-speech rights . But the move would n't be unprecedented in the island nation .

Iceland has had laws banning the printing and distribution of pornography for years , but those laws have n't been updated to include the Web . And two years ago , the nation 's parliament banned strip clubs , saying they violate the rights of the women who work in them .

The options being considered , according to the Daily Mail , include blocking the IP addresses of known porn sites and making it illegal to use credit cards from Iceland to subscribe to X-rated sites .

Attempting a total block of porn sites somewhere like the United States , with its legions of public and private portals onto the Web and the millions of software engineers who likely would spring into action to find workarounds , would be nearly impossible .

The move is , predictably , drawing fire from Web-freedom advocates , including some in Iceland who agree with Jonasson on most issues .

`` Since he claimed office as minister , Jonasson has brought forward progressive legislation and has shown that he can be a man of principles and courage . For that , I truly respect him , '' Birgitta Jonsdottir , a member of Iceland 's parliament who represents part of Reykjavik , wrote in an editorial for London 's The Guardian .

`` But he is way off track in his attempts to place a shield around Iceland in order to ` stop porn ' from entering the country . ''
