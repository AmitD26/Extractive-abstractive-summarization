Half of the 258,000 Somalis who died in the famine were children younger than 5 , Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement .

The report , jointly commissioned by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network , is the first scientific study on deaths in the crisis .

The world did not do enough after warnings in 2010 that starvation loomed following severe drought . And the people who needed help the most were extremely inaccessible , he said .

In the worst-affected area , Lower Shabelle , close to one in five children younger than 5 died .

At the peak of the crisis , between May and August 2011 , famine and severe food insecurity claimed some 30,000 lives a month , the report said .

The United Nations has been working with its humanitarian partners to change the way they operate , Lazzarini said . Some 2.7 million people in Somalia are still in need of life-saving assistance .

`` Our aim is to ensure that Somalia never goes through another famine again , '' he said .

` Catastrophic shocks '

Several factors led to the crisis , according to the report .

`` For millions of Somalis , already weakened by chronic food insecurity and persistently high levels of acute malnutrition , the shocks were catastrophic , '' said the report .

The result was what the researchers say was one of the worst famines in the past 25 years .

`` We now have a picture of the true enormity of this human tragedy , '' said Mark Smulders , a senior economist for the FAO .

`` Lessons drawn from this experience will help the international community , together with the people of the region , build a stronger and more resilient future . ''

International humanitarian organization Oxfam said Thursday that the mistakes made in Somalia in 2011 must never be repeated .

`` Famines are not natural phenomena , they are catastrophic political failures , '' it said in a statement .

`` The world was too slow to respond to stark warnings of drought , exacerbated by conflict in Somalia , and people paid with their lives . These deaths could and should have been prevented , and such a shocking death toll must never be allowed to happen again . ''

World leaders meeting in London next week to discuss the situation in Somalia `` must take steps to ensure that this was Somalia 's last famine , '' Oxfam said .

This means investing in long-term development , creating jobs , supporting farmers and pastoralists , and ensuring properly trained security forces to help achieve the `` just and sustainable peace '' the country so badly needs , it said .

Its shaky transitional government , backed by African Union peacekeepers , has been battling Islamist guerrillas for years .
