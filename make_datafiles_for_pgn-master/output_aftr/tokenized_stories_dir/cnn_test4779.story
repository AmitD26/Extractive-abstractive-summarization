Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The much-maligned , color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System is about to be consigned to the proverbial dustbin of history .

`` Though the system served a valuable purpose in the terrible days and months following the terrorist attacks of September 11 , it was clearly time for the current color-coded system to be replaced with a more targeted system , '' King said . `` I know they have been working on this for a long time . It sounds to me like the changes they are proposing make sense . We will have to wait and see how they implement this new , more targeted system . I expect the biggest challenge for DHS will be balancing the need to provide useful and timely information with the need to protect sensitive information . ''

`` The old color coded system taught Americans to be scared , not prepared , '' said ranking member Rep. Bennie Thompson , D-Mississippi . `` Each and every time the threat level was raised , very rarely did the public know the reason , how to proceed , or for how long to be on alert . I have raised concerns for years about the effectiveness of the system and have cited the need for improvements and transparency . Many in Congress felt the system was being used as a political scare tactic -- raising and lowering the threat levels when it best suited the Bush administration . ''

In its lifetime , the threat level has been raised to orange/high five times , although it went to that level three other times for specific industries . The threat level was raised to red/severe once -- on August 10 , 2006 , and only for commercial flights from the United Kingdom to the United States -- when British authorities announced they had disrupted a major plot to blow up aircraft . The level went down to orange on August 16 , 2006 , where it remains .

The general threat level is yellow/elevated . The two lower levels have never been used , and task force looking at the system recommended in 2009 eliminating them altogether and making yellow the lowest threat level but renaming it `` guarded . ''

Almost from the start , the threat level system was the butt of jokes and multiple parodies .

A `` Total Headcase Advisory System '' began with `` George Soros is arrested '' and ended with `` Hillary Clinton is elected president . '' Still another announced that Homeland Security and Crayola had jointly revised the system , changing green to aquamarine , blue to raw umber , yellow to burnt sienna , orange to neon carrot and red to cotton candy .

The public did n't care much for the system either , with polls conducted at the time indicating most Americans found it confusing and not very useful .

More seriously , however , some critics accused the Bush administration of using using the system to generate fear at politically sensitive times , such as just before the 2004 election . And just days after his 2005 resignation , then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told a Washington forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the Homeland Security Advisory Council , which made the decisions .

The council included Attorney General John Ashcroft , FBI chief Robert Mueller , CIA director George Tenet , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell .

And in 2009 , Ridge wrote in a tell-all book that sometimes officials such as Ashcroft and Rumsfeld pressured the department to change the level , describing a 2004 event in which his arguments against raising the alert worked .

`` I believe our strong interventions had pulled the ` go-up ' advocates back from the brink . But I consider the episode to be not only a dramatic moment in Washington 's recent history , but another illustration of the intersection of politics , fear , credibility and security , '' he wrote .

The Bush administration denied Ridge 's assertions , however .

`` Nobody 's more surprised than I am , '' then-Homeland Security adviser Fran Townsend told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . `` Of course , Tom Ridge never expressed those concerns while he was in the administration , nor did he when I spoke to him after he left ... -LRB- He -RRB- was n't the only one in that meeting who suggested the terror alert should n't be raised . At no time was there a discussion of politics in that meeting . And the president was made a consensus recommendation from the council that he accepted -- not to raise the terror alert . ''

Townsend is now a national security contributor for CNN .
