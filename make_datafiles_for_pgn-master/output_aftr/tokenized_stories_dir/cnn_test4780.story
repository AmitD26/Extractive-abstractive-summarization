National Democrats quickly seized on the development as proof that Christie and his aides have stonewalled the investigation , even as the 136-page report failed to find any conclusive evidence tying Christie to the scandal . And a top New Jersey Democrat vowed the investigation would continue .

But phone records show that it was Christie who texted Egea before the two traded a dozen messages during the hearing , according to a copy of the report obtained by CNN .

The text messages were deleted before the committee could review them , but the report shows Egea 's sworn testimony was not accurate .

The report is inconclusive on what Christie knew about last year 's lane closings that snarled traffic on the George Washington Bridge . Christie has denied knowing anything about the lane closures until they were over .

But according to the report , Egea 's phone records show that Christie texted her during the officials ' testimony and the texting continued throughout the hearing .

A Christie spokesman declined to comment , pointing instead to what the governor said about the issue in August .

`` I have no recollection of her even sending me a text , '' he said . `` It obviously was something of no moment or no import because I have no recollection of it at all . ''

`` The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely , that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision , '' he said . `` The Committee 's work has simply corroborated our comprehensive investigation . ''
