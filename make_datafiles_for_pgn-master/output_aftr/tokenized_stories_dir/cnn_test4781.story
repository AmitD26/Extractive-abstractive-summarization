Flying in tight formation , Israeli fighter planes drop bunker-busting bombs on a nuclear enrichment plant built into the side of a mountain .

Iranian pilots race for their own jets to fight back , but by the time they take to the sky , it 's too late . The Israeli jets streak away .

Experts inside and outside Israel say no .

They envision a much more complicated attack , one that would involve more than 100 planes -- from fighters to refueling tankers -- flying hundreds of miles to bomb up to eight targets around Iran .

`` It is a very large-scale operation , much greater than the one carried out in Iraq 30 years ago , '' said Kam , a former colonel who served with an intelligence research division in the Israeli military .

Israel would most likely attack Iran with fighters jets -- the F-15I and the F-16I -- rather than missiles fired from submarines , Kam and other experts said .

`` In order to create proper damage to the nuclear plants , you need extremely accurate weapons , '' Kam said . `` I do n't know that the missiles are accurate enough . ''

It has four squadrons of F-16Is , the Israeli version of the U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon . The Israeli jet is known as the Suefa , or Storm .

The Israeli fighters lack the range to reach most of the likely targets in Iran , so Israel would also need to put tanker aircraft into the sky , said Douglas Barrie of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London .

It also has at least four KC-130H tankers , versions of the giant Hercules aircraft , but is not likely to use them because their slow speed means the jets would need to slow down to link with them , wasting fuel , he said .

The strike aircraft would carry bunker-busting GBU-28 bombs -- 5,000-pound bombs to `` go after hardened and buried sites , '' Barrie said .

Like other experts , he based his analysis on the assumption that if Israel mounted an attack , it would do so without American help .

There would be at least four primary targets , said Emily Chorley , a nuclear expert at Jane 's : the Natanz and Fordo nuclear enrichment plants , the Esfahan uranium conversion facility , and the Arak nuclear complex .

Esfahan and Arak are above ground and are `` relatively vulnerable to aerial attack , '' she said .

But Natanz , in the center of the country , is buried under 33 feet of earth and 6 feet of concrete , Chorley said , making it `` very hard to penetrate . ''

Fordo , near the holy city of Qom , is `` even more difficult '' because it is deeply buried in a mountain , she said .

Dropping a bunker-busting bomb on Fordo actually might make it less vulnerable , Chorley said , since collapsing the entrance without destroying the facility would protect it from further bombing .

`` It 's questionable whether Israel is capable of destroying it in an air-launched attack , '' she said .

Israel would have at least two secondary targets as well , Chorley predicted -- the Tabriz and Imam Ali missile bases in the west , `` to prevent a retaliatory missile attack '' on Israel .

It also could try to strike the controversial Parchin military base east of Tehran , which inspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency have been trying to visit , Chorley said .

Iran 's single declared civilian nuclear reactor probably is safe , Chorley said .

An attack on the Bushehr reactor would risk spreading nuclear contamination , and could mean killing Russian personnel at the Russian-built facility , infuriating Moscow .

Israel has three potential routes of attack , according to Jane 's and other experts , assuming its fighters do not fly all the way around the Arabian Peninsula . Jane 's says the Israeli Air Force does not have enough refueling capacity to travel that distance .

The northern route would go through Turkey , with which Israel has tense relations . The southern route would go through Saudi Arabia , which fears its rival Iran getting a bomb but is openly hostile toward Israel .

The central route is the shortest . It runs through Jordan and Iraq . Jordan and Israel are at peace , but there 's no guarantee Jordan would formally give Israel permission to fly over its territory .

Iraqi air defenses , meanwhile , `` can not prevent violations of sovereignty , '' said Charles Hollosi of IHS Jane 's . That makes it the `` most likely location for air refueling . ''

He doubts the Iranians would be able to detect them coming that far away .

`` I do n't imagine them having two hours ' notice . The Israelis will be desperate to give them as little notice as possible .

Barrie noted the Israeli military 's success in attacking a suspected nuclear site in Syria in 2007 .

Iran 's air force has American-made F-14 Tomcats acquired under the shah 's regime , which ended in 1979 , Barrie said , as well as Russian-made MiG-29s . On paper , they are not a match for the Israeli planes .

`` Israel remains the pre-eminent air force in the region -- well-equipped , and they have trained long and hard , '' he said .
