How has life changed for new dad Marc Lesser ? Well , for one , he has n't slept more than two to three consecutive hours since his son , Sam , arrived a month ago . Lesser gets up with his wife for overnight feedings .

`` I 'm the baby passer , '' he told me during an interview when he could have been sleeping instead .

When the baby wakes up , Lesser passes him from the crib to his wife , Pauline , then takes a cat-nap before burping and rocking the baby to sleep when feeding time is over .

`` I do n't want to make myself sound better than I am because there are certain feedings that after I pass him off , I pass out , '' he joked .

But there 's a huge learning curve for first-time dads , which can make them feel clueless even as they jump up to help with the diaper changes and bottle feedings . I asked dads to share what surprised , delighted and woke them up in a cold sweat during their first days of parenting .

Mike Little , a father of identical twin boys in Birmingham , Michigan , said he had never changed a diaper before his kids were born . `` I just thought I do n't know if I am going to be any good at this , '' he said in between yawns . -LRB- His kids are just 6 months old ! -RRB-

Lesser , worried his son might stop breathing , did something I actually still do -LRB- even though my kids are 5 and 7 ! -RRB- : He checked the baby 's chest to make sure he was still breathing .

Prince William and dads everywhere show ` Mr. Mom ' is outdated

Some new fathers are a bit more freewheeling .

Peter Shankman , a successful New York entrepreneur and proud father of 13-week-old Jessa , recently spent five days alone with his daughter while his wife was overseas for work .

Shankman said he was n't worried at all about going solo , and bases his confidence on the logic that kids have been surviving for years without their parents ' sterilizing bottles and everything else .

Go-to gadgets for dads

To keep tabs on their little ones , some of the dads I talked with have come up with some , let 's say , unusual approaches .

Shankman reached out to friends in the security industry , and installed a device on his daughter 's crib , which sends an alert to his phone when there is any motion above the height of the crib .

`` There is something to be said for having a dad who is a complete geek , '' he joked .

Lesser is resorting to some more traditional devices , calling the `` pee-pee teepee , '' which covers the boy 's penis during diaper changes , his `` savior . ''

`` I 've learned the hard way because definitely at 5 o'clock in the morning , there 'd be a couple of times where I forget to put it on and the next thing I know I feel something warm on my shirt , '' he said .

Modern fathers face new expectations

While we often talk about the `` work-life balance '' issue as mainly a working mom phenomenon , the dads I spoke with made it clear it 's very much a working father issue as well .

Cody Mathers of Houston , Minnesota , whose little girl Willow is about to be 3 months old , said the biggest stressor of being a dad is `` finding that way to balance career and fatherhood . ''

Every father I spoke with said he did more of the child care -- and the housework -- than his dad and his grandfather did .

Lesser said that when older family friends come to visit , he thinks they 're probably a bit surprised . `` Because I am the one changing the diapers and burping the baby and I know it 's totally different for them , '' he said . `` It 's evolution in a very good way . ''

With everything dads are doing now , I wondered if we give them enough credit -- we being society in general , moms , media , etc. .

`` I had a friend of mine who told me when these babies are born , no one is going to ask you how you 're doing , so I 'm going to make sure that I do , '' he said as he fought another yawn . `` And he 's right , because I do think that happens a bit . ''

How life has changed

In his interview with CNN , Prince William said a lot of things affect him differently now that he 's a dad , and all the fathers I spoke with could completely relate .

`` The babies have given me sort of a sense there is something bigger than work , '' said Little , who works long hours as an attorney in a big law firm . `` When I come home and I 'm stressed and you see those two and you see the faces , you realize that it 's just work , so I do think it changes everything . ''

It changes everything , indeed , including how little time you now have for each other , said Mathers . He and his wife used to enjoy a date night every Friday but that went away when Willow was born .

`` That 's an adjustment , but the reward is better , '' he said .
