Consumers left angry and confused after the botched Obamacare rollout now have something else to worry about : misleading letters from insurance companies .

In Colorado , Kentucky and Washington , state insurance commissioners have come down on insurance companies for sending thousands of consumers letters that were either threatening , incorrect or omitted crucial information about the Affordable Care Act .

Obamacare fix could add millions in government costs

`` What they were telling me was I had to accept their choice to continue with no protection from preexisting conditions , to basically take their choices and go ahead before I knew the other options that were available through the exchange , '' said the man , who asked for anonymity to share personal information and speak candidly about a politically charged issue .

But the letter was more than troubling , it was also illegal . Clark said Humana broke the law when it included a form with the letter that had not gotten the required approval from her office .

She said Humana officials worded the letter the way they did because `` they were interested in keeping those policyholders . Also , I think , again , it was a lack of understanding of Kentucky law . ''

In addition to the fine , Clark required Humana to send customers a correction with a full range of options that included buying insurance from the exchange , working with a broker or even keeping their current coverage until it expires .

And she worried that if she levied a bigger fine , Humana would just pass the cost along to their customers in the form of higher premiums .

In Colorado , Humana sent a similar letter that received an rebuke from state Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar .

`` I was disappointed to see a letter that appeared threatening and incorrect going out to consumers . The last thing we need is more confusion , '' Salazar said of the letter .

And in Missouri , the state insurance department is looking into whether similar Humana letters there broke any laws .

`` The department is aware of written correspondence between Humana and policyholders and is looking into the matter , '' said Chris Cline , the department spokesman .

Humana declined multiple interview requests , but in a statement said , `` Humana has been reaching out to our individual insurance policyholders to let them know of their full range of coverage options beginning January 1 , 2014 -LRB- when the Affordable Care Act 's new insurance laws become effective -RRB- . ''

Obamacare : Now what ?

But Humana is not the only company to come under fire .

LifeWise spokesman Eric Earling said the complexity of health insurance reform means that they are unable to communicate all the details in a single letter .

`` The first goal is , you 're a customer of ours , here 's what your options are with us , as one would expect , '' he said . `` Our experience is our consumers are well aware there are other options for their business . ''
