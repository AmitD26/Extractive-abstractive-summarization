Imagine : you are sitting with friends , one day in the distant future , in a space-age house , while robot servants cook dinner , fold laundry and mow the lawn .

Colin Angle , who co-founded manufacturers iRobot in 1990 with fellow MIT alums Rodney Brooks and Helen Greiner , hails Roomba as `` the world 's first practical home robot . '' The company is now hoping to infiltrate the boardroom with its wandering `` AVA '' telepresence robot , and the battlefield with its line of defense machines .

Angle sat down with CNN 's Nick Glass to talk about making the sci-fi world of robots a reality .

Angle : I had grown up with Hollywood concepts of robots , and the labs that Dr Brooks and I worked in were focused on trying to make it real .

In fact , our first business model was to send a robot to the moon and sell the movie rights . We actually got quite far . It did n't ultimately succeed but it did get us going , and the Spirit and Opportunity rovers were impacted by the work we 'd done . It was very cool but not a great business .

What did everyone think robot vacuuming was going to be ? Well , they think Rosie the Robot from `` The Jetsons , '' a human robot that pushed a vacuum . That was never going to happen .

How did you learn to make Roomba ?

We entered the toy industry : we partnered with Hasbro building robot baby dolls and robot dinosaurs . They taught us how to manufacture very complicated electric mechanical things at a low price .

We partnered with Johnson Wax , the guys that make the industrial cleaning machines , and we built giant robot cleaning machines .

We were also building robots for the Pentagon to clear minefields . Using that intelligence technology actually gave us the algorithms which Roomba uses to make sure -LSB- your home -RSB- is thoroughly vacuumed .

Naming is something not necessarily best left to an engineering organization .

What 's the future ?

If you think about what robots are supposed to do in our future , we 're just about half of the way there . They can vacuum , they can scrub your floors -- but what about my laundry ? What about all these other things that robots are supposed to do ?

What 's the next big need ? Well , I think it has to do with extending independent living : allowing our ageing demographic to live independently in their homes for longer .

You may have a menagerie of robots that move around and do things : you may want a robot to bring you a beverage . You 're not going to talk to your vacuum cleaning robot : in fact you may never see your vacuum cleaning robot because ideally you come home every day and your floors are freshly vacuumed .
