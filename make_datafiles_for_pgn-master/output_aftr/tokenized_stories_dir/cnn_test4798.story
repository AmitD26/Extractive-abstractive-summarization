-LRB- Business Insider -RRB- -- Groupon , the fastest-growing web company on the planet , reportedly turned down a $ 6 billion buyout offer from Google late last week .

Sounds crazy , right ? For most two-year-old companies , the idea of getting a $ 6 billion offer -- never mind turning it down -- is a wild dream .

Especially for an idea like Groupon that seems so simple : Daily money-saving coupon offers for local businesses , delivered by e-mail and over the web -LRB- A $ 50 credit to the Gap on sale for $ 25 , for example -RRB- . So it 's understandable that Groupon 's decision surprised people .

And Groupon says it has saved its customers more than $ 800 million so far this year , up from about $ 50 million last year .

For consumers , that means spending less cash -- always a nice thing in tough economic times . And for local businesses , that means bringing new customers in the door , which makes them happy , too . That 's why so many restaurants , stores , and service providers are rushing to get their deals on Groupon that the company has had to change its business model to keep up -- no longer just `` one deal per day , per city , '' but several potential deals , customized for the user .

And while there are competitors like LivingSocial , which has some 10 million subscribers , attracting a lot of attention and investment , Groupon is still leading the pack .

Therefore , the promise of further explosive growth is the biggest reason that Groupon was smart to turn down Google 's offer .

Imagine Facebook selling to Yahoo for $ 1 billion in 2006 -- it would n't have been worth $ 50 billion right now . Or imagine that Google had taken Yahoo 's meager offer early in its history , too . It would n't be worth almost $ 200 billion as it is today .

If history is any indication , Google would probably have tried to change Groupon , to make it more Googly . But the two companies have vastly different structures and cultures . And based on our understanding of Groupon , Google could potentially ruin Groupon very easily .

`` I 'm not sure this is a tech company that gets built in San Francisco or Palo Alto , '' Groupon co-founder and CEO Andrew Mason told us when we visited his office last month . `` It 's so heavily people-dependent -- not really consistent with the way people think about building startups in -LSB- Silicon -RSB- Valley . ''

Google , meanwhile , is the prototypical Silicon Valley tech company -- the master algorithm . Yes , there are lots of people at Google , too , including many sales and support staff . But Google 's culture is dominated by engineers , the sort of high-GPA geniuses who can answer all of the brain-teaser Google interview questions .

Of course , that 's not to say that the companies wo n't figure out a deal in the future , or that there is n't a chance that Groupon could stumble , and be worth less in the future .

But based on the way Groupon is growing in popularity today -- and is expected to generate more than $ 2 billion in sales next year -- turning down Google 's offer is n't as crazy as it sounds .
