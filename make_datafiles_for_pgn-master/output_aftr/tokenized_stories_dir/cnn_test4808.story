-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The bloodied bodies lay stuffed and tangled in the back of a pickup like garbage .

`` Brother of a whore ! '' they shouted as the corpses splashed and the water ran red . `` Animals ! '' `` Dogs ! ''

At one point , a voice asks mockingly , `` This is a soldier ? ''

Report : Syrian army stretched amid uprising

This scene , said to have been shot in Syria , surfaced in a video on YouTube , where images of anti-government ferment and violence have emerged consistently since unrest started in the nation in mid-March .

CNN could not verify the authenticity of the video , but it illustrates the hostility of the nearly five-month-old conflict across Syria between regime forces and anti-government protesters .

The posting on the video says the bodies are anti-government forces being dumped by thugs loyal to President Bashar al-Assad .

Syrian state TV has aired the video , saying that the bodies are being dumped by anti-government protesters . A banner said the incident took place in Hama over the Orontes River .

But one prominent anti-government activist , who asked not to be named because of the dangers that could arise from the release of the information , told CNN the state TV account was correct .

The bodies are those of Syrian secret police killed by Syrian fighters from Iraq who have joined the anti-government fight , said the activist , who gets information about the goings-on in Syria from an extensive network of informants .

However , that report said , `` the vast majority of casualties have been peaceful protesters , and the vast majority of the violence has been perpetrated by the security services . ''
