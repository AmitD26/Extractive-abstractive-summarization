Some 1,348 people have been executed by the state since 1976 , when the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume after a four-year moratorium . Twenty-eight were given lethal injection this year , three over the past several days .

While the annual number of executions and death sentences continue to drop nationwide , it remains a legally and socially acceptable form of justice for aggravated murder in 32 states .

Evan Mandery 's `` A Wild Justice : The Death and Resurrection of Capital Punishment in America '' -LRB- Norton -RRB- is a stunning insider 's look at the legal and social forces dividing the justices during turbulent times .

For two centuries death by hanging , firing squad , gas chamber , electrocution , and toxic chemicals -LRB- among nearly a dozen methods -RRB- was completely ingrained in the American political fabric .

But Mandery chronicles one justice 's quiet , improbable crusade to change the legal landscape beginning in the early 1960s , in the process conflicting the court like few issues before or since .

Money and politics court 's first big case this term

His narrative crests with Furman v. Georgia -LRB- 1972 -RRB- , when the court struck down that state 's capital laws , and effectively putting executions on hold .

States then made changes to their laws , and the court four years later -LRB- on the eve of the nation 's Bicentennial -RRB- , reversed itself in stunning fashion .

Mandery : `` It just shows how utterly remarkable what Goldberg did . He said : I want to revisit this issue . In 1963 , it was so widely accepted that the death penalty was unconstitutional that the defendants in other cases did n't challenge its constitutionality . He made the argument on their behalf . There are no Goldbergs anymore . It 's hard to imagine a justice today saying ` I want to raise this up to national agenda . ' The court is so often in the business of following change rather than leading it . ''

Mandery : `` I hope people understand what an extraordinary , revolutionary , and subversive idea that Goldberg and his partner Dershowitz advanced in 1963 . Whatever your views on the death penalty and the Supreme Court , everyone acknowledges as a subject of discussion that the Constitution is an evolving document and that the death penalty is constitutionally problematic , if not unconstitutional . In 1963 , when they started , nobody did . It was revolutionary . ''

CNN : What was the political fallout from Goldberg 's prodding ?

Mandery : `` There is one particular quirk about this history that acted as a barrier to a consensus view coalescing . At the beginning of the 1971 term when Furman was decided , -LRB- Chief Justice -RRB- Warren Burger said he wanted the case to be conducted in complete secrecy . And he wanted each justice to write his own opinion . And consequently the justices operated in almost complete isolation throughout the term , which had some very bizarre results . It was one of the contributing factors to the splintering of this 5-4 decision with nine opinions .

`` It 's almost impossible to discuss the case because there is no majority opinion . -LRB- Liberal Justices -RRB- Brennan , Marshall , and Douglas wrote opinions that really seemed to be against the death penalty in all cases . Douglas ' decision was premised basically on the issue of racism , Brennan 's on human dignity , Marshall on a host of consideration including inequality . -LRB- Justice 's -RRB- Stewart and White 's opinions are the most closely aligned . Stewart said the problem with the death penalty is its randomness among murderers , White says the problem with the death penalty is that it is n't applied frequently enough to achieve deterrence . Even the four dissenters could n't agree . ''

CNN : You write Potter Stewart -LRB- appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower -RRB- and Byron White -LRB- appointed by President John Kennedy -RRB- were the key players here .

Mandery : `` There 's a lot of evidence that Stewart made a deal with White because he emerged -LRB- in June 1972 -RRB- with a changed position on capital punishment . Where he had previously been against it in all cases , White was now taking the position that his problem with the death penalty was its application . He told his clerks at the beginning of the term that he wanted to write a `` short snapper '' saying that the death penalty treated people as a means to an end , and was therefore unconstitutional . And there are hints in some of Stewart 's earlier opinions that he was , in fact , morally opposed to capital punishment . But that is not the position that he ultimately articulated in his concurrence in Furman . ''

Mandery : `` Grand political theories of judicial behavior do n't explain very much . These are socially situated actors who have different views at different times and are responding to their perceptions of their own constituencies . They 're not elected but they feel that they are answering to people . It 's a very messy history . ''

CNN : Is there something about the death penalty itself that makes the court 's jurisprudence so problematic -- the finality , the questions of life and death .

CNN : What has the court said on mandatory DNA testing and re-testing for all capital inmates ?

Mandery : `` Imagine what a difference it would make if the Supreme Court said that states were required to have DNA exoneration projects as part of their death penalty systems . In other words , if they guaranteed somebody that type of post-conviction appeal . They 've removed themselves utterly from the process of trying to make the system better . Everybody agrees that the conviction and execution of an innocent person is morally intolerable and yet the Supreme Court has n't gotten involved in the business of what 's required , how much due process is required , how much extra due process is required , to protect against the execution of an innocent .
