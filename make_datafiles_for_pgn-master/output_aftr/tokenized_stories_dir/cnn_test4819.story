Four months after his birth in Hamilton , Ontario , Devin Scullion was diagnosed with one of the rarest diseases known to humans .

He was born two months premature , and his mother , Jamie Madley , said she knew right away something was wrong .

`` He was big for a preemie , '' Madley said . `` His joints were tight , his movements were robotic , his skin was thin -- you could see his veins everywhere . I just did n't know what it was . ''

Progeria affects approximately one in every 4 million to 8 million infants . There are only about 200 children living with the disease worldwide . There is only one other child in Canada with the disease , according to Madley .

As they age rapidly , these children suffer from a loss of body fat and hair and an inability to gain weight .

According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation , most girls develop about 90 % of their bone mass by age 18 and boys by age 20 .

Building strong bones during childhood helps prevent osteoporosis in adulthood . This is why children with progeria have such issues with bone density and rigidity .

Heart disease due to atherosclerosis , also known as hardening of the arteries , is a critical problem for children with progeria . These children can have heart attacks or strokes as early as age 5 . Most die of heart disease by age 13 .

When Devin was diagnosed , the cause of progeria was unknown and the prognosis was bleak .

`` There was n't much information . It was pretty much , ` There 's nothing we can do for your son , take him home and enjoy him while he 's there , ' '' Madley said .

`` There was pretty much no hope . There really was n't any kind of medication . I did what I could -- I put him on a diabetic diet , had him on vitamins . ''

That was 16 years ago . There have been ups and downs . When Devin was 6 , he suffered two strokes just three weeks apart . He fought through paralysis and hip dysplasia , and had to learn how to walk again .

Now , results from the first clinical drug trial are offering hope for researchers , children with progeria and their parents .

The drug , called Lonafarnib , was originally developed by Merck & Co. to treat numerous adult cancers and pediatric brain cancer . For the past 2 1/2 years , 26 children with progeria from 16 countries took Lonafarnib orally twice a day . Devin Scullion is one of those children .

The results , published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , are called exciting by researchers .

`` Now , we not only have our first treatment , but we know for the first time that some aspects of the disease can be improved , and this inspires us to work harder and faster toward additional treatments for progeria that could hopefully work in conjunction with Lonafarnib to make a difference in the health of children with progeria . ''

`` I think that we have just sort of just broken open the first of many possibilities here for the children , '' Gordon said . `` It is possible that some systems affected in Progeria may be resistant to treatment . But if a cure means getting rid of progerin and really affecting the cardiovascular system in a big way so that these children live longer lives , then trials gives us a lot of hope . I think we can do this for the children and I think it 's what the children deserve . ''

Dr. Mark Kieran , director of pediatric medical neuro-oncology at Boston Children 's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Insititute , is the principal investigator of the study .

In general , the weight gain seen among patients was small , but still measurable , he said . The real surprise was the reduction in stiffness and thickness of major arteries , which decreased 35 % , according to the study .

So far , that track has led to another trial . Researchers are two years into a second study involving 45 children from around the globe , including 20 of the original participants , Kieran said .

Scientists have added two more drugs that attack the abnormal protein in a different way . Researchers have also identified another 35 children with progeria , making a total of 80 , and there are plans for a third trial that will include these children and a fourth drug .

But even that optimism is tempered . More research is needed , Gordon said .

`` We will not know whether heart attacks , strokes or longevity are influenced by this very short study , '' she said . `` We may need another 10 years to determine if heart attacks , strokes and length of life are influenced by Lonafarnib .

Dr. Francis Collins , whose discovery of the gene led to the current advances , agreed .

`` It 's an encouraging development , '' he said . `` Ten years ago , we had no idea what caused this disease ... in a rather dramatically accelerated period of time , we have evidence of a treatment that seems to provide benefit .

`` But let me be clear , this is not a cure , '' he said . `` These children are not suddenly going to have a life like any other kids . We still have a lot to do before we will know if we are really prolonging life and reducing serious medical problems . ''

Still , Collins said , what has happened so far is pretty remarkable .

To inspire similar success stories , he said , the National Institutes of Health and the drug industry have recently partnered to `` crowd source '' the potential to repurpose drugs , `` effectively teaching old drugs new tricks . ''

According to Collins , the need is great . There are 4,700 diseases where molecular causes have been discovered , mostly within the past 10 years , he said . But only about 250 of them are treatable .
