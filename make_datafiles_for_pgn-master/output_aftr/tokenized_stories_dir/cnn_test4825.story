While about a quarter of adults in the United States suffer from some form of mental illness , most of them are not getting adequate treatment , if any .

In the age when there 's an app for everything , it 's no surprise that there are a lot of smartphone tools out there claiming to help people cope . From informational resources to interactive mental wellness programs , there 's plenty out there to choose from .

Do n't mistake your phone for a therapist , but some mental health professionals are encouraging their patients to use mobile apps as a way to supplement their care .

`` You can definitely utilize and capitalize on the smartphone technology to create tools that people have with them all the time , '' said Kristen Mulcahy , a psychologist in Falmouth , Massachusetts .

Patients with OCD have unwanted thoughts and anxieties that trigger repetitive behaviors .

The user can also create an audio recording of an obsessive thought to listen to on loop , in order to practice enduring it without doing a repetitive behavior .

`` It holds -LRB- patients -RRB- a lot more accountable , because they know I 'm going to be able to see everything they are or are n't doing , '' she said . The price tag is steep at $ 79.99 , but it may help patients cut back on their more expensive in-person sessions a lot faster , Mulcahy said ; the app is a `` surrogate therapist . ''

Tracking your body with technology

Dr. Rakesh Jain , psychiatrist at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston , uses a free mood tracking app called Moody Me by MedHelp . Users can upload photos that correspond with different moods , from `` manic '' and `` excellent '' to `` horrible '' and `` depressed . ''

Moody Me also has a social feature , where users can share their moods with their friends . There are `` Ask a Doctor '' forums with advice from real experts on a variety of topics and communities for discussions around specific mental disorders .

Jain also gets his patients to use a body weight tracker called BMI by NutriSystem to track their body mass index , since depression is a mind-body disorder . Although BMI is an imperfect indicator of health , studies have shown that depression and BMI are linked .

His favorite app is called Live Happy , which costs 99 cents . It was developed in collaboration with Sonja Lyubomirsky , a psychologist at the University of California , Riverside , and the company Signal Patterns .

Part of this app is also expressing gratitude . You can call , text or e-mail a person whom you appreciate . A `` gratitude journal '' allows you to jot down things that you are thankful for in your life . The `` Replay Happy Days '' activity leads you through the exercise of remembering happy moments to replay positive emotions .

If you are n't sure whether what you 're feeling could be classified as depression or anxiety , there 's a free tool called depressioncheck . This app offers a three-minute screening for anxiety and depression . Of course , it 's not meant to replace a real mental health professional 's evaluation ; you should seek consultation with a licensed therapist before trying to make any diagnoses on your own .

For those who have bipolar disorder , there 's an app called Bipolar Disorder Connect . This free app is a gateway into a community of people living with bipolar disorder . Users ask each other questions and talk about treatments .

PTSD Coach , co-created by the VA 's National Center for post-traumatic stress disorder , includes a PTSD self-assessment and information about the condition . Relaxation skill tools and anger management techniques are part of the program . It is intended for veterans and military service members .
