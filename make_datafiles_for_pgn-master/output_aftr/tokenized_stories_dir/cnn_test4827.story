Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Supporters of an Iranian opposition group claimed Thursday they have information about another secret facility tied to the Iranian government 's nuclear program .

A U.S. official who is not authorized to speak on the record said the United States is aware of the facility .

The International Atomic Energy Agency , which monitors nuclear activities on behalf of the United Nations , has inspected Iran 's declared enrichment facilities , but Iran does not provide details or access to sites where nuclear components are made .

Iran claims its nuclear program is for civilian energy needs , but the United States and other nations maintain Iran is working to develop fissile material for nuclear weapons .

The International Atomic Energy Agency said in its most recent report , in February , that Iran continues to stonewall the inspectors by not providing sufficient information or access to its facilities for inspectors to determine the ultimate purpose of Iran 's nuclear program .

Former nuclear inspector David Albright , who has closely followed developments concerning Iran 's nuclear exploits , said he had no information about whether TABA is in fact a secret nuclear site . But he did question the claim that Iran has enough parts to make 100,000 centrifuges .

According to Albright , Iran has indicated it wants to have 50,000 centrifuges and has so far manufactured 12,000 to 15,000 of them .

At the news conference , Jafarzadeh -- saying that `` the revelations today show the policy pursued by the United States has not been productive in halting the nuclear program of Iran '' -- maintained that only a democratic Iran will succeed in eliminating the nuclear program , and that the best chance for democracy lies with the United States removing the People 's Mujahedeen of Iran from its terrorist list .
