-LRB- CNN -RRB- The Republicans have taken control of Congress , and with it ownership of health care reform . As long as the Republicans were in opposition , they could just complain . And they did , voting repeatedly -- and futily -- to repeal the Affordable Care Act .

The idea is favored by business groups that support the GOP financially . But such a change would increase the number of uninsured and raise the federal budget deficit by $ 53 billion over the next 10 years .

Nearly five years after its enactment , the ACA remains unpopular , despite the fact that many of its reforms -- ending pre-existing condition exclusions , covering adult children to age 26 , and closing the Medicare drug doughnut hole -- are very popular .

The ACA has also been remarkably successful in achieving its goals . Both the percentage of Americans who are uninsured and the rate of growth in health care spending are at historic lows . Republicans continue to talk repeal , but actual repeal would at this point be disruptive .

One of the great virtues of the ACA is that it has managed to extend coverage significantly without disrupting the three primary forms of coverage enjoyed by most Americans . Nearly half of Americans are insured through their employment , while Medicare and Medicaid each cover another sixth . The ACA has expanded benefits for employed Americans by requiring coverage for preventive services and capping out-of-pocket expenditures . Employer-sponsored enrollment has remained largely stable under the ACA , while Medicare and Medicaid enrollment have grown . Premiums for employer coverage and for Medicare have increased more slowly than in previous years .

One of the most problematic features of ACA coverage is the high deductibles and co-insurance that come with many marketplace plans for those whose incomes are too high to qualify them for cost-sharing reduction payments . But conservatives have supported high cost-sharing , and Republican proposals to repeal the ACA would wipe out the out-of-pocket expenditure caps it imposes . Republicans support generous tax subsidies for health savings accounts to help cover cost sharing , but HSAs only benefit those wealthy enough to put savings aside , and particularly those in high tax brackets .

Congress could easily clarify the meaning of these words through the kind of technical amendments that Congresses have always adopted after major legislation . ACA opponents , however , are encouraging Congress to use a potential adverse Supreme Court decision to push through much broader changes . Notice that Republicans are not promising if you like the coverage you have now you can keep it , whether you are covered by employer-sponsored coverage , Medicare or Medicaid .
