Italian football club Lazio must play their opening home game of the season with a section of their fans banned from the match as punishment for racial abuse .

The match , which was won 4-0 by defending Serie A champions Juventus , was held at Lazio 's Olympic Stadium in Rome .

League chiefs said Lazio supporters in the Curva Nord stand twice directed sustained abuse at the players involved in the traditional Serie A curtain raiser .

France midfielder Paul Pogba was one of the Juventus players targeted by abuse by some of Lazio 's more hardcore supporters .

He told the French news agency AFP : `` What can I do ? I 'm alone against 30,000 fans . They do that even though there are blacks in their team .

`` It 's also a lack of respect towards their own players .

Following Sunday 's Supercup final , Juventus and Lazio were also both fined by 5,000 euros after fans lit flares in the stands .
