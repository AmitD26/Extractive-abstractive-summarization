A former prosecutor who declined to bring charges against Bill Cosby a decade ago said Wednesday that he wishes he could 've nailed the comedian on an allegation that he drugged and molested a woman at his Pennsylvania home .

Bruce Castor also told CNN that he believed Cosby -- a beloved figure who , with his wit and boyish smile , has charmed audiences as a family-friendly stand-up comic , the voice of Fat Albert , the host of `` Picture Pages '' and the star of a wildly popular eponymous sitcom -- lied to authorities .

In January 2004 , Andrea Constand , then a 31-year-old staffer for the women 's basketball team at Temple University , Cosby 's alma mater , was at the comedian 's Cheltenham , Pennsylvania , home when Cosby provided her medication that made her dizzy , she alleged the following year .

She later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray , she further alleged to police in her home province of Ontario in January 2005 .

` I could n't check her blood '

`` Back then , the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong , '' he said . `` The problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it . ''

This left Castor no way to corroborate Constand 's allegations , he said . He could n't check her blood , urine , hair or fingernails for traces of drugs , he could n't obtain hair or fiber for analysis , and he could n't obtain a warrant to search Cosby 's home for evidence .

Of Cosby 's interview with prosecutors , Castor said , `` I thought he was lying . I thought he was evasive , and I thought that those things would be of value if I had another piece -LRB- of evidence -RRB- to go forward with . ''

Castor released a statement on his office 's website in 2005 , saying that he found that `` insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt . '' Constand 's attorney filed the civil suit two weeks later .

Latest in line of accusations

Castor 's account comes a day after former supermodel Janice Dickinson became the latest of a handful of women to accuse the 77-year-old comic of sexual assault publicly . She told `` Entertainment Tonight '' that Cosby raped her in 1982 after giving her a pill and a glass of red wine during a dinner in Lake Tahoe .

Since 2005 , several women have come forward with remarkably similar stories about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the comedian . This year , the accusations resurfaced , and earlier this month , a seemingly harmless post on Cosby 's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm .

`` I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes , '' she said .

On Saturday , NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he did n't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the accusations .

NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just `` shaking his head no . ''
