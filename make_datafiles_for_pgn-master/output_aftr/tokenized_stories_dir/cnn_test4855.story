Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi announced Friday on Tunisian state TV that he has taken over the responsibilities of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- who ruled the nation since 1987 and fled in a plane Friday with his relatives .

He left a country reeling . Before he stepped down , Ben Ali had dissolved the government and declared a state of emergency . Under the emergency declaration , people are not allowed on the street between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. Groups of three or more people are subject to arrest and , if they try to flee , can be fired on .

His departure followed weeks of widespread outrage over poor living conditions and repression of rights . In daily demonstrations , thousands of protesters had denounced corruption in the Ben Ali government and had urged that he step down .

He apparently got the message . Ghannouchi moved quickly to fill the vacuum . `` Considering the fact that at the current time he -LRB- Ben Ali -RRB- can not fulfill his duties , I take over today , the powers of the president of the republic , '' he told his countrymen .

Ghannouchi asked residents to cooperate with the army , which was ordered to take charge of the streets following a state-of-emergency declaration .

And he extended a welcoming hand to government critics , saying that `` oppositions groups who reside overseas can return to the country . ''

Meanwhile , the army appeared to be wielding the most power , staking out positions on major streets .

`` We hope that the army will match its reputation for being more professional and less trigger-happy than the security forces that have been responsible for much of the violence over the last several weeks , '' said Amnesty International spokesman Claudio Cordone from London .

In a telephone interview with CNNI , he said 55 people were killed in Tunisia over the last several weeks of demonstrations .

Ben Ali 's plane went on to Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , where the Saudi official news agency reports said he was welcomed by the king .

Tunisia under Ben Ali has been a pro-Western state supportive of U.S. policy in the Middle East and in its efforts against terrorism .

Events in Tunisia were being watched closely elsewhere . In Cairo , Egypt , about 45 protesters stood outside the Tunisian Embassy and chanted , `` Revolution in Tunisia is revolution in Egypt ! ''

They promised to hold a larger demonstration Saturday evening .

In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was monitoring the events . `` We condemn the violence and urge restraint on all sides , '' she said in a statement .

She urged the Tunisian government to `` respect the right of its people to peacefully assemble and express their views '' and called for `` free and fair elections in the near future that reflect the true will and aspirations of the Tunisian people . ''

Recent diplomatic cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia obtained by WikiLeaks revealed growing disquiet with the government -- especially over nepotism within the government .

WikiLeaks published a 2009 cable recounting a lavish dinner for the U.S. ambassador given by Ben Ali 's son-in-law , Mohamed Sakher El Materi , a prominent businessman .

The ambassador wrote in the cable : `` After dinner , he served ice cream and frozen yogurt he brought in by plane from Saint Tropez -LRB- a high-end French resort -RRB- , along with blueberries and raspberries and fresh fruit and chocolate cake . ''
