By the time we depart Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport , we will have spent 36 hours on the ground . Like Edward Snowden , whose exact location here in the transit lounge remains a mystery , we can not step foot on Russian soil without special visa clearance .

We arrived early Tuesday morning on a mission -- to find the former U.S. surveillance specialist in the transit zone . As it turns out , this airport has an expansive area for transiting passengers and we now know nearly every corner of it .

That statement came after we 'd already landed on the ground in Sheremetyevo . It piqued global interest in the story . Putin broke his silence on Snowden , after leaving initial diplomacy to his seasoned Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov .

Contrary to its appearance on the outside , the Capsule does not reflect futuristic , space age technology on the inside . The rooms are the scale of large walk-in closets in the U.S. but with much poorer insulation .

After a few hours on the ground we produce a mini video report on Snowden 's movements , the locations he could be at the airport and why Lavrov says insinuations by Washington of harbouring Snowden are not acceptable .

Putin then moves into action while on a bi-lateral visit in Finland . Global interest reaches a crescendo . The next thing we know , CNN is the only international broadcaster inside the transit zone and we begin conducting two-three live shots an hour .

This global game of `` cat and mouse '' appears to have entered a new phase . The Russian President compares the situation to trying to shave a piglet . A lot of noise , Putin noted , but very little hair to be had .

By this point we are showing up on the radar of airport security , and so our very own game of cat and mouse ensues as we try to continue doing live reports while being tracked by burly Russian guards .

Opinion : Why U.S. is being humiliated by the hunt for Snowden

The two former Cold War adversaries cooperated on the Boston Marathon bombings investigation , but when it comes to Edward Snowden and his treasure trove of leaked documents , it does not appear Russia is prepared to do so .

Edward Snowden is reportedly in the airport , according to Russian President Vladimir Putin

It 's a global game of cat and mouse -- and CNN ends up in its own version of the game
