The measure was voted through in the National Assembly by 329 in favor to 229 against , with 10 deputies abstaining .

France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same-sex marriage .

But while a significant number of MPs back the legislation , which is supported by Prime Minister David Cameron , the move has prompted widespread rebellion within Cameron 's Conservative Party . The bill must go through several more stages before it can become law .

In the United States , where President Barack Obama has voiced his personal support for same-sex marriage , it has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia -- but many people remain vehemently opposed .

Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande 's electoral pledges in campaigning last year .

The National Assembly , which is dominated by Hollande 's Socialist Party , was expected to pass the bill Tuesday , having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month . The left also controls the Senate .

But the plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives , with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in Paris in recent weeks .

Same-sex marriage around the world

Opening up marriage to same-sex couples `` would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone , '' he said . At the same time , failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a `` deceit '' that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children , he said .

Lawmakers have a `` unique opportunity '' to put an end to outdated discrimination , the group said in a statement . `` The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families , without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity , '' it said .

A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government .

Opinion : Gay rights in France -- How even the U.S. leads the way

Polls show the U.S. public has gradually become more accepting of the idea , with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed , according to Pew .

Nonetheless , 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage , according to the Pew Research Center .

The issue has also divided Australia , where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September . A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64 % of those surveyed `` support marriage equality . ''

According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Trans and Intersex Association , same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries , and in five of those countries , the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws .
