Television anchor Brian Williams is n't the first person to be embarrassed by claiming a remembrance that , well , never really happened .

Tyson 's assertion is still published on the webpage of the Hayden Planetarium , which he runs .

Fact checkers found Tyson 's recollection to be wrong , and The New York Times even published an opinion piece in December 2014 by two psychology professors about the Tyson incident and `` Why Our Memory Fails Us . ''

`` In his post-9 / 11 speech , Mr. Bush actually said , ` The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends , ' and he said nothing about the stars , '' wrote professors Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons .

`` And I here publicly apologize to the President for casting his quote in the context of contrasting religions rather than as a poetic reference to the lost souls of Columbia . I have no excuse for this , other than both events -- so close to one another -- upset me greatly . In retrospect , I 'm surprised I remembered any details from either of them , '' Tyson wrote in September 2014 .

There 's a twist on the Tyson tale , the two professors noted in The New York Times .

Bush recalled more than once how he saw the first plane hit the north of the World Trade Center before he entered a classroom in Florida , where his reaction to the devastating attacks was forever captured on television cameras .

`` In reality , he had been told that a plane had hit the building , but had not seen it -- there was no live footage of the plane hitting the tower , '' the two professors wrote .

Bush 's misremembrance was even the subject of a scholarly essay in 2004 by then graduate student Daniel Greenberg of Duke University , now a human memory expert who 's a professor at the College of Charleston in South Carolina .

Greenberg found two of Bush 's recollections to be impossible because footage of the first plane strike was n't available at that moment in time .

Noting how the President had access to aides to jog his memory , Greenberg concluded : `` We might expect that he would be better off than the average university undergraduate -- however , like so many others , he appears to be suffering from a near-textbook case of false recall . ''

`` I think my dad had a job , like , being the grandmaster or whatever of the 50th celebration of the automobile in Detroit , '' Romney told a tea party rally in Milford , according to the Boston Globe .

The Toronto Star exposed the misremembrance .

A Romney aide told the Boston Globe that the Republican candidate was merely telling a story about a family member .

`` Mitt does n't say he was there . In fact , he says his memory was foggy , '' the aide said . `` He was simply telling the story about his dad . ''

In her own campaign for the U.S. presidency in 2008 , Hillary Clinton stated she evaded sniper fire when visiting Bosnia as first lady in 1996 .

While seeking votes , she provided a dramatic recollection of the event , which occurred on March 25 , 1996 .

`` I remember landing under sniper fire . There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base , '' said Clinton , a Democrat .

The Philadelphia Daily News ' editorial board confronted her with video footage showing Clinton 's arrival at Tuzla , calmly walking from the rear ramp of a U.S. Air Force plane with her daughter , Chelsea , then 16 , at her side . Both Clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed .

Clinton told the editorial board that she `` misspoke '' and the falsehood was a `` minor blip . ''

`` I say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement , '' she said .

In a subsequent radio interview , Clinton was n't worried about the incident hurting her credibility .

`` I have been in the public eye for many , many years , and this is something that I think happens to anybody , '' she told radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .

His memoir seemed as good as gold .

But the investigative website The Smoking Gun found Frey 's life was n't as exciting as he portrayed it .

Frey eventually admitted he embellished events about himself and other characters in the book .

`` I made a mistake , '' he later confessed to Oprah Winfrey in 2006 . `` I made a lot of mistakes in writing the book and promoting the book . ''

Pressed if he lied or made a mistake , Frey elaborated on what happened .

`` I think probably both , '' he said .

He admitted to embellishing several facts : he was jailed for only a few hours , not 87 days ; and each character in the book was n't wholly represented .

But he asserted his book remained a memoir .
