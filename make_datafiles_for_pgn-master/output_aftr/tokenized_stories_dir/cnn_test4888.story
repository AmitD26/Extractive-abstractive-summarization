Stephenville , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- The man accused of killing Chris Kyle , the former Navy SEAL who was the subject of `` American Sniper , '' and Kyle 's friend told a detective after the shootings that he was worried about his own mental state .

According to a police body camera video played in court Thursday , Eddie Ray Routh was sitting in Kyle 's stolen truck when he told a detective : `` I do n't know if I 'm going insane . ''

Routh also spoke of voodoo , hell and the apocalypse in the video . The defense , which is mounting an insanity case , focused on those remarks .

The prosecution asked Lt. Michael Smith of Lancaster , Texas , police whether he thought Routh was being metaphorical during their conversation . Smith said he could not tell .

Dr. Jeffrey Barnard testified that two of the six bullets that hit Kyle would have been `` rapidly fatal . ''

A prosecutor asked Barnard several times whether the other victim , Chad Littlefield , had wounds consistent with someone lying on the ground or in a kneeling position , but the doctor could n't say .

The prosecution appeared to be attempting to establish that Littlefield and Kyle were defenseless when shot . Both men were shot multiple times at a Texas firing range in February 2013 .

The two men took Routh , a veteran with mental problems , to the firing range as a kind of therapy , lawyers have said .

The trial began Wednesday with a lawyer using Kyle 's own words to bolster an insanity defense .

But Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash told the jury that Routh told investigators he used drugs and drank whiskey that morning . He admitted that he killed the two men and said he `` knew what he was doing was wrong , '' the prosecutor said .

Routh used two guns , Nash said .

Routh shot Kyle five times in the back and side and once in the side of the head , using a .45-caliber pistol , and shot Littlefield with a 9 mm pistol four times in the back , once in the hand , once in the face and once in the head , Nash said .

The range is a small , remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge , and the men were isolated , authorities said .

Frank Alvarez , resident manager of Rough Creek Lodge , testified Kyle had `` exclusive access to the range when he came out . ''

Kyle had said he was going to use the range for about 45 minutes , Alvarez testified , but `` about 5 p.m. I got a radio call that said I had to go to the shooting range . Something had happened . ''

A hunting guide found Kyle , 38 , and Littlefield , 35 , Kyle 's friend , motionless and called 911 . The men were dead when officers arrived . Routh , an unemployed former Marine reportedly diagnosed with PTSD , was gone , and so was Kyle 's black Ford pickup truck , police said .

`` They went out to a shooting range . Like , he 's all crazy , '' Routh 's sister told authorities .

Routh got back into the truck and hit the road again , police said . Officers caught up with him that evening at his home in a Dallas suburb .

Before that order was issued , a reporter asked Capt. Jason Upshaw of the Erath County Sheriff 's Office what could have driven Routh to the alleged murders .

Routh served in the Marines from June 2006 to June 2010 . His time in the military included a 2007 tour of duty in Iraq and a humanitarian mission to help the victims of the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti .

Correction : Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield , who was killed with Chris Kyle . Littlefield was not a veteran .

CNN 's Jason Morris and Chris Lett reported from Stephenville , Texas , and Steve Almasy , Ralph Ellis and Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta . Greg Botelho and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report .
