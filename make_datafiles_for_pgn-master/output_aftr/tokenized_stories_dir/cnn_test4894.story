Starting Tuesday , this scenario will no longer be a pot smoker 's fantasy in one South American country .

The law and the new regulations make Uruguay the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production , sale and consumption of the drug .

In announcing the marijuana regulations , presidential aide Diego Canepa reminded everyone that the state will control the marijuana market from beginning to end , starting with setting prices .

That 's right . The Uruguayan government has created an agency whose mission is to regulate the pot market , known as the Institute for the Regulation and Control of Cannabis .

The proposed price starts at 20 Uruguayan pesos per gram -LRB- about 87 cents in U.S. dollars -RRB- , Canepa said .

Julio Rey , founder of a cannabis club and a spokesman for the National Association for the Regulation of Marijuana , told CNN in December , shortly after passage , that his organization was very pleased with the legislation .

`` We will take care of the tools of this law to demonstrate that we , as the public , can objectively look at this project and comply with its proposed legality , '' Rey said .

This is n't about creating a free-for-all system , Canepa told reporters . It 's about creating rules that will refocus government efforts on prevention and taking the market from the hands of ruthless drug traffickers that only care about money .

`` What we now know is that we had a sustained increase in consumption during prohibition . This new reality , as we understand it , is going to change that , and it will be possible to implement better public policy to take care of those who abuse drugs , '' Canepa said .

`` If we legalize it , we think that we will spoil the market -LRB- for drug traffickers -RRB- because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market . And we are going to have people identified , '' he said .

With the help of state-of-the-art technology , authorities will track every gram or marijuana sold , according to Canepa . Bags will be bar-coded . The genetic information of plants that are legally produced will be kept on file . This will allow police to determine whether illegal marijuana is being commercialized .

Governments and drug policy experts will certainly be watching closely how the Uruguayan model develops . The marijuana legislation places the South American country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies , surpassing even the Netherlands , where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place .
