Forecasters are calling for a wintry mix of precipitation Wednesday into Thursday from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Carolinas and southern Virginia .

Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency , with ice , sleet , snow and freezing rain expected in various parts of the state .

Tennessee has reported 30 weather-related deaths in the past eight days , including car accidents , cases of carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia . As of Tuesday evening , there were 32,600 customers without power over six counties . Things will get interesting again by Wednesday afternoon .

In Georgia , Gov. Nathan Deal ordered state government offices in 50 northern counties closed on Wednesday and declared a state of emergency for disaster preparedness , starting at 2 p.m. .

The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning in north Georgia for Wednesday through Thursday , with snow , rain and subfreezing temperatures in some areas .

In case you 've forgotten , Southerners are n't good with ice .

And we 're not talking just a little bit into the South , ice is possible nearly to the Gulf Coast .

Officially , forecasters call it a wintry mix . That 's code for snow , sleet , rain and freezing rain . Weather advisories are posted from east Texas to Virginia .

Lake Charles , Louisiana , is only 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico , yet freezing rain is in the forecast . The gators say this is a croc .

Even though it 's been on the chilly side for the last week -- virtually a lifetime for folks below the Mason-Dixon line -- Southerners still have a ways to go before perfecting their winter sports skills .

While the South struggles with winter , a Boston man has found a way to profit from it . For $ 89 , he 'll express ship 6 pounds of snow to anywhere in the United States . It 's packed in a Styrofoam container so it should n't melt too much . Ship Snow , Yo sold out the first day and with 70 inches of the white stuff on the ground , the company should be able to fill orders for some time to come .

You know winter has gone on too long when the New York Times writes an editorial about it . Trying to ease the Big Apple out of its cabin fever , the headline simply reads : `` This Winter Has Gotten Old . ''

Actually there 's not much hope in the article , except that `` New Yorkers are relieved not to live in Boston . Bostonians , snow-buried , may be grateful not to be on the ice planet Hoth , where it 's Boston winter everywhere , all the time . ''

`` A ridiculous 84 in Orlando today ! '' tweets meteorologist Tom Terry . `` Soaking in the warm air as another ice/snow storm hammers the South . ''

CNN 's Ray Sanchez , Phil Gast and Dorrine Mendoza contributed to this report .
