Lyric Cook , 10 , and her cousin Elizabeth Collins , 8 , were last seen by their grandmother more than a week ago when they left on a bike ride .

`` We believe these girls are alive and we are not discouraged by the passage of time since their disappearance , '' FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault told reporters in Evansdale , Iowa .

She declined to discuss exactly what evidence investigators might have that pushed them toward that conclusion . Breault said she believes someone knows something , and she urged anyone with information to step forward .

`` Cooperation with law enforcement is the key factor in discovering the whereabouts of Lyric and Elizabeth . Unfortunately , in this case law enforcement has not received total cooperation from all family and close friends . It 's important to note that the majority of the family has cooperated 100 % , '' Breault said . `` We believe there 's someone out there and we would urge them to come forward . ''

The girls ' bicycles and a purse were found near Meyers Lake hours after they were reported missing July 13 .

A search of the 25-acre lake turned up nothing , and the FBI is confident the girls are n't in the lake , said Breault .

Authorities are now calling their disappearance an abduction .
