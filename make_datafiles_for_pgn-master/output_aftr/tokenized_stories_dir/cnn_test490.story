Buenos Aires -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Argentine lawmakers approved an agreement with Iran that will create a five-member commission to investigate the deadly 1994 bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish community center .

The measure passed by a 131-113 vote early Thursday after more than 14 hours of debate .

Iran hints at new evidence in 1994 Jewish center bombing

Argentina requested the arrest of several Iranians in 2007 in connection with the bombing , including the current defense minister of Iran , Ahmad Vahidi . Interpol approved so-called Red Notices for these suspects , alerting countries around the world of Buenos Aires ' desire to have them arrested .

Seeking a way around the impasse , Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner drafted an agreement with Iran that would create a `` truth commission '' and allow the judge and prosecutor in the criminal proceedings to interrogate the accused Iranians .

The government heralded the agreement as a way to find out what happened in 1994 .

`` This is a memorandum that is not clear , that is not complete and that we feel does n't bring any benefit to the cause , '' Julio Schlosser , president of the Jewish umbrella organization DAIA , said before the vote .

It calls for a commission of five international jurists charged with unraveling what was behind the bombing .

`` I negotiated this memorandum with who I had to , not with who I wanted to , '' Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman said . `` At each step , I kept in mind that us Argentinians learned with lots of pain that we have to seek justice and not condemnations , to seek the truth and not vengeance .
