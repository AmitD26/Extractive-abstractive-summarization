Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- When Hillary Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 -- She says she did not try marijuana there -- only 12 % of Americans wanted to legalize the drug .

In 45 years , however , the tide has changed for legalization : 58 % of Americans now want to make consumption legal , two states -LRB- Colorado and Washington -RRB- already have and two more states -LRB- Oregon and Alaska -RRB- could join them by the end of the year .

On paper , activists feel their plan will work . But it is one yet to be decided factor -- who will be the Democrats ' nominee for president in 2016 -- that could throw a wrench into their push .

`` She is so politically pragmatic , '' said Alan St. Pierre , the director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws . `` If she has to find herself running against a conservative Republican in 2016 , I am fearful , from my own view here , that she is going to tack more to the middle . And the middle in this issue tends to tack more to the conservative side . ''

Later in the year , Clinton labeled marijuana a `` gateway drug '' where there `` ca n't be a total absence of law enforcement . ''

`` I 'm a big believer in acquiring evidence , and I think we should see what kind of results we get , both from medical marijuana and from recreational marijuana , before we make any far-reaching conclusions , '' Clinton told KPCC in July . `` We need more studies . We need more evidence . And then we can proceed . ''

This is more open , however , than in 2008 when Clinton was outright against decriminalization , a step that is less aggressive than legalization .

Despite warming on the issue , Clinton 's position causes concern among activists like St. Pierre because he feels they are far from solid .

St. Pierre said he also watched -- laughing -- as Clinton tried to personally distance herself from marijuana at the CNN town hall .

`` Absolutely not , '' Clinton said when asked if she would try the drug . `` I did n't do it when I was young , I 'm not going to start now . ''

What 's more , some activists spoke highly of Democrats with executive experience , such as Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley , who spent eight years as mayor of Baltimore .

With an eye on 2016 , some activists are starting to contrast that view with Clinton 's .

`` I think in 2016 there is going to be a number of states with legalization initiatives on the ballot and there will be broad support , '' said the Drug Policy Alliance 's Todd . `` I do n't see standing behind and defending the status quo of this destructive policy as helping a candidate in the 2016 election . ''

Clinton has come face to face with some aspects of marijuana policy on her trips to stump for Democrats across the country .

While raising money in Colorado for Sen. Mark Udall earlier this week , Hillary Clinton saw marijuana in her coffee . Pointing to the foam design atop Udall 's latte , Clinton said , `` Look at you , you got like a plant . Is that a marijuana plant ? ''

To laughs from the baristas at PigTrain Coffee , some who may have seen that the design looked more like a rose than marijuana , one answered jokingly , `` That 's exactly what it is . ''

@highlight

Marijuana legalization activists plan to make a big push in 2016 .

@highlight

That push will force candidates , including Hillary Clinton if she runs , to take a stand on the issue .

@highlight

Clinton says she has never tried marijuana and has not been as supportive of marijuana policy as other Democrats .

`` I am fearful ... that she is going to tack more to the middle , '' said one activist .
