-LRB- CNN -RRB- Well , the thought experiments are finally over . Hillary Clinton 's online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be .

And nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy , certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign .

Should she win , Clinton will add to her potential `` firsts '' : first woman president ; the first president who had been a first lady . There 's another one , too : the first secretary of state to become president since James Buchanan .

Only a handful of the nation 's top diplomats have gone to the White House -LRB- Thomas Jefferson ; James Madison ; James Monroe ; John Quincy Adams ; Martin Van Buren ; and Buchanan -RRB- . And none in the 20th century , a curious fact that suggests politics and statecraft are quite different animals . Too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire , ambition and temperament to compete for the top job .

Too much loyalty to a president who is unpopular among independents will hurt her . But so will flip-flopping .

Clinton presided over the secret channel that laid the basis for the November 2013 interim accord and led directly to the putative understandings reached between the United States and Iran earlier this month in Lausanne , Switzerland . And she certainly can take credit for pushing tough sanctions that forced Iran to the table .

The problem , of course , is that her Republican opponents and more than a few Democrats hate what the negotiations have produced . Much less enamored with the Obama 's `` let 's engage our enemies '' trope , Clinton may have doubts herself .

The good news is that there wo n't be an agreement for months . So for now , she can back the importance of tough negotiating and even tougher sanctions or worse , should the Iranians cheat . But sooner or later , perhaps as early as June if there 's an agreement , Clinton will have to take a stand on what may well be a very problematic and unpopular accord and what Congress ' role should be .

And this will put her at odds with traditional friends and supporters in the Jewish community . Frankly given her political interests , it would be easier for her candidacy if the agreement fell apart and she could campaign on a tough anti-Iranian message , hammering the mullahs ' repressive policies at home and their mischief-making in the region . She may not be that lucky .

Still she will have an advantage in dealing with the pro-Israeli community . Unlike President Obama , the Clintons have strong credentials on the Israeli issue . And that will help somewhat in trying to walk a narrow line between a negotiating process with Iran that Clinton launched and its fruits , which are seen by many Israelis and American Jews right now as too generous to the mullahs .

Clinton 's time at the State Department should help her in a presidential campaign where Americans are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the White House . The Republicans will try and show that Benghazi and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she did n't accomplish much .

Clinton was n't a Henry Kissinger or a James Baker .

Still , four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential to lead America in a dangerous and turbulent world . And in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs , that can only help .

He says her experience overseas could be an asset as long as she does n't get ensnared by controversy over Obama policies
