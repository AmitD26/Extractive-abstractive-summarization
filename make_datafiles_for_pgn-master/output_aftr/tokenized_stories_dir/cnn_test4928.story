Noor Inayat Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross for her spy service .

To make ends meet she took up exotic dancing and the name Mata Hari -LRB- meaning `` the light of day '' in Malay -RRB- . With her sensual performances becoming the attraction of the major European cities came the men and the gifts for her favors . Many of these favors came from royalty and high-ranking French and German military officers .

2 . Noor Inayat Khan

Khan was born in 1914 and at a young age moved with her family first to England and then to France . In 1940 , Khan , along with her mother and sister , escaped back to England just before France surrendered to Germany .

While in England she joined the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force -LRB- WAAF -RRB- , but her ability to speak fluent French soon caught the attention of the Special Operations group and Khan agreed to become a spy .

3 . Belle Boyd -LRB- aka `` La Belle Rebelle '' -RRB-

Born Isabelle Boyd in Martinsburg , Virginia , in 1844 , the beautiful Belle soon became the star attraction in Washington , D.C. , social circles prior to the beginning of the Civil War .

With the outbreak of the war , she returned to Martinsburg . When the Union soldiers occupied the city , Belle mixed with the officers and soon gathered information on troop movements , which she passed on to the Confederate forces .

However , she is probably best known for warning Stonewall Jackson that the Union intended to blow up all the bridges around Martinsburg . With this information , Jackson , with a small number of troops , was able to surprise the Union troops and drive them from the area .

After the war , Boyd toured the United States as an actress under the stage name of La Belle Rebelle .

4 . Elizabeth Van Lew

She would wear old clothes and bonnets and talk to herself . Because of this , most people thought that her Northern sympathies were just a part of her craziness . Mental Floss : Confederacy 's plan to conquer Latin America

After the war , President Grant named Elizabeth the postmaster for Richmond . When the citizens of Richmond found out that Crazy Bet was an act , they shunned her . However , at her death , the state of Massachusetts placed a memorial marker on her grave .

Born in 1841 in New Brunswick , Canada , Sarah ran away from home in her early teens . In order to survive she became an itinerant Bible salesman , by calling herself Frank Thompson and dressing like a man .

In 1861 , Frank -LRB- Sarah -RRB- enlisted in the Second Michigan Infantry and over the next two years not only fought in a number of Civil War battles , but also served as a spy for the Union Army . Solders in her unit called Frank `` our woman '' because of his feminine mannerisms and his extremely small boot size . However , none of her comrades ever figured out that Frank was really Sarah .

This boded well for her spying , where she dressed as a young boy serving in Confederate camps , as an immigrant Irish peddler and , most interestingly , as a woman . In 1863 , Sarah caught malaria and deserted the army out of fear that hospitalization would reveal her true identity .

In 1884 , though , Sarah applied for and was awarded a veteran 's pension in which the secretary of war acknowledged that Sarah was a female soldier who had rendered faithful services to the ranks .
