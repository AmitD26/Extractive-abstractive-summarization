Lionel Messi , left , and Thierry Henry celebrate as Barcelona reach the last eight of the Champions League .

Former winners Porto joined them at the next stage after their return leg against Atletico finished goalless in Lisbon -- the 2-2 draw in the first leg in Madrid sending them through on the away goals .

Spain 's Primera Liga leaders Barcelona strolled into a 4-0 first half lead on their way to a 6-3 aggregate success with Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o building on Henry 's double .

Jean Makoun pulled one back just before half-time and Juninho struck three minutes after the restart , but the French champions never looked like disturbing Barca 's path to the March 20 draw .

Lyon 's hopes suffered another blow when Juninho was given his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card in time added on and Seydou Keita took full advantage by snatching another in the final seconds .

Messi showed his class in the 40th minute . The Argentina star collected the ball on the right touchline , before embarking on a mazy run past three Lyon defenders . He then exchanged a one-two with Eto'o , before firing a low shot home .

Any thoughts of a comeback failed to materialise as Barca continued to create a raft of chances .
