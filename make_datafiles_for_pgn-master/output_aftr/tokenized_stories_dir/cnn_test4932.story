Mason Gonzalez is ready with pennies . Dodgers tickets were prizes for collecting the most pennies .

Guinness World Records , which would certify the record , said Thursday it had not yet received documentation from the group . The current record for pennies laid out is 40 miles .

The money -- about $ 84,500 -- will go to the nonprofit program that provides free after-school care for students at more than 200 elementary and middle schools in at-risk communities in four California counties -- Orange , Los Angeles , Riverside and San Bernardino .

Flores said the idea for `` Miles of Change '' came after group members saw students at a school in Kansas make a 40-mile chain of pennies in July 2008 to set the world record .

The pennies were collected by 35,000 students in the after-school program and were laid in loops around the two-mile track in Fontana , California .

Flores said every penny must be touching the next penny in order to qualify for the Guinness world record . Documentation will include aerial photos , she said .

The effort also is meant to honor Abraham Lincoln 's 200th birthday and the 100th anniversary of the introduction of the Lincoln penny .
