-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Conservationists have found a new population of orangutans in a steep , mountainous corner of Indonesia -- a discovery that significantly adds to the number of the endangered red-haired primates .

The orangutans were discovered in a mountainous corner of Indonesia .

The latest population was found in the eastern edge of Borneo , with conservationists counting 219 nests . Even by conservative estimates , that raises the total number of the orangutan population by at least a couple of hundred , maybe thousands .

`` So to find a substantial population of potentially several hundred to several thousand animals is very exciting . ''

Locals in the area had long spoken of an orangutan population in the hard-to-access limestone mountains of the Kalimantan province . A group of conservationists reached the area in December after driving for a day , taking a boat for another , and then hiking across steep mountainous terrain for two , Meijaard said .

Orangutans , a species of great apes , with hair that is usually reddish-brown instead of the black or brown . The name is derived from the Malay and Indonesian words for `` orang '' -LRB- person -RRB- and `` hutan '' -LRB- forest -RRB- . They spend most of their time on trees , subsisting on fruit and leading a solitary existence except to mate .
