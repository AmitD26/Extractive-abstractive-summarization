The Wisconsin congressman said Iran 's progress has sped along `` because this administration has no credibility on this issue . ''

Biden hit back by criticizing what he called `` bluster '' and `` loose talk '' about the issue , saying international sanctions are crippling the Iranian economy and that U.S. and Israeli officials believe Iran is `` a good way away '' from getting the bomb .

The facts :

Iran has greatly expanded its ability to produce nuclear fuel in the past four years , revealing a second uranium enrichment plant in 2009 and continuing to defy U.N. demands that it halt work until questions about its intentions are resolved .

Based on those figures , the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security , estimated that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for five nuclear bombs . The organization , led by former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright , says Iran could build a crude bomb with 20-25 kg -LRB- 44-55 pounds -RRB- of highly enriched uranium .

However , it would take Iran more than two months to produce that amount if it started with 20 % - grade uranium , and `` several months '' to make enough for a bomb using low-enriched uranium . That would give the world community enough time to detect the operation and organize a response , ISIS noted in June .

Fact Check : Wind power , electric cars and the stimulus

Iran has denied conducting any nuclear weapons research , insisting its nuclear program is for civilian purposes . The IAEA has verified that Iran has not diverted any of its declared uranium stock , but cautions that Iran `` is not providing the necessary cooperation '' to verify that all nuclear work is peaceful .

Conclusion : According to at least one widely circulated estimate , Iran could produce enough uranium for five bombs , as Ryan says . But the same estimate notes that it would draw attention if it did so , and that 's only part of the work necessary to make a weapon .
