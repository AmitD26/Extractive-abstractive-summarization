-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world , the average American is probably asking , `` How should I protect myself ? ''

Health officials ' advice is to follow common-sense precautions : Wash your hands , stay home if you 're sick and listen to your local health authorities .

`` If you 're sick , it 's very important that people stay at home . If your children are sick , have a fever and flu-like illness , they should n't go to school . And if you 're ill , you should n't get on an airplane or another public transport to travel . Those things are part of personal responsibility in trying to reduce the impact . ''

`` In areas with no disease yet , a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps , '' said Dr. Anne Schuchat , interim deputy director of the CDC 's Science and Public Health Program . In addition to washing hands often , she recommends covering your mouth when coughing and sneezing and avoiding touching your eyes and nose in case the virus is on your hands .

The World Health Organization calls the situation a `` public health emergency of international concern , '' and the United States has declared a `` public health emergency , '' likened by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to preparations for a potential hurricane . No authorities are calling the outbreak a pandemic .

The CDC expects U.S. numbers will grow and recommendations will change depending on what happens in individual communities , said the CDC 's Schuchat . The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school , work and public events .

Schuchat noted swine flu symptoms are relatively general and nonspecific . `` So many different things can cause these symptoms . it is a dilemma , '' she said . `` It is a challenge that we are wrestling with . There is not a perfect test right now to let a person or doctor know exactly what this is . ''

But Schuchat specifically advised anyone who feels ill after returning from Mexico to see a doctor .
