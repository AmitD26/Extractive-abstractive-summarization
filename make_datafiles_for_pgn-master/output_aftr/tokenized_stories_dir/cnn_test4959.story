According to figures from Hollywood.com Box Office , it opened at the top spot with an estimated $ 23.4 million , better than Apatow 's The 40 Year-Old Virgin -LRB- $ 21.4 million -RRB- -- hence , the glass is half full . But that figure is far lower than the debut for Apatow 's `` Knocked Up '' -LRB- $ 30.7 million -RRB- , and it 's the worst opening for a comedy for star Adam Sander since his 2000 turkey `` Little Nicky '' -- hence , the glass is half empty .

Of course , `` Funny People '' was billed more as a thoughtful dramedy than a balls-out Sandler laugh-fest , and when matched against the opening frames for Sandler 's serious efforts `` Reign Over Me , '' `` Spanglish , '' and `` Punch-Drunk Love , '' Funny People is far and away the winner -- and the glass is half full again .

At this rate , the film is well on its way to the upper ranks of the ` Potter ' franchise . The guinea pigs of `` G-Force '' were right on its heels at third place , nibbling up $ 17.1 million , a decent 46 percent drop for a two-week cume of $ 66.5 million .

And Katherine Heigl 's romcom `` The Ugly Truth '' took in an additional $ 13 million , a 53 percent drop for fourth place and $ 54.5 million total .

Of the two other wide releases this weekend , at least the sci-fi family comedy `` Aliens in the Attic '' -- which grossed a meager $ 7.8 million for fifth place -- broke into the top 10 . The torture porn flick `` The Collector '' collected a grisly $ 3.6 million and plopped dead at 11th place .

Finally , a true milestone was reached this weekend by `` The Hangover . '' With $ 5.1 million this weekend for a running total of $ 255.8 million , the summer 's biggest die hard blockbuster has passed `` Star Trek '' and -LRB- for a brief moment -RRB- `` Harry Potter 6 '' as the third highest grossing movie of the year .
