An investigator walks past the wreckage from a plane crash in Clarence Center , New York , in February .

The last sounds heard in the cockpit were First Officer Rebecca Shaw saying `` We 're '' and then screaming at 10:16 p.m. on February 12 , according to a transcript of the cockpit recording .

Seconds earlier , the pilot , Capt. Marvin Renslow , said , `` Jesus Christ , '' as a sound `` similar to stick shaker '' was heard , the transcript said . Renslow said , `` We 're down , '' and a thump was heard before Shaw said , `` We 're '' and screamed .

The National Transportation Safety Board released the transcript of the cockpit recording on Tuesday as it began a three-day hearing in Washington on the crash . See how crash of Flight 3407 unfolded ''

Continental Connection Flight 3407 , operated by regional carrier Colgan Air , plunged into a house in Clarence Center , New York , killing all 49 people on board and one man in the house .

About five minutes before the crash , Shaw had shared with Renslow her fear of flying in icy conditions , according to the transcript .

The NTSB 's preliminary investigation determined there was some ice accumulation on the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft , but that `` icing had a minimal impact on the stall speed of the airplane . '' Watch more on the NTSB investigation ''

In a story Monday , the Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow 's incorrect response to the plane 's precarious drop in speed : He overrode an emergency system known as a `` stick pusher , '' which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall .

Colgan Air , the operator of Continental Connection flights , said Monday that Renslow had never trained in a flight simulator with the safety system that activated just before the plane went down . Colgan said there is no regulatory requirement that it provide hands-on training with the `` stick pusher . ''

`` That 's a significant problem , '' veteran pilot Douglas Moss told CNN . Moss , an expert in stall recovery , believes flight simulator practice with a stick pusher should be mandatory for aspiring pilots .

Renslow had failed five pilot tests , known as `` check rides , '' three of which occurred before he joined the airline , Colgan Air said . Renslow had revealed only one of those failures to the airline , according to Colgan .

He said those issues are : airplane performance , cold weather operations , a sterile cockpit , flight crew training and performance , and fatigue management .
