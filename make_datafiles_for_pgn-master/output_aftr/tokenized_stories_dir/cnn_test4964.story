Maria Jesus Coronado Padilla mourns her 2-year-old daughter , Paulette Daniela Coronado Padilla on Sunday .

Neighbors described parents arriving at the day care center completely desperate on Friday , seeing it engulfed in flames and knowing there was no way to get the children out . The building had two doors , one of which was padlocked shut , and windows were too high for the children to reach , officials said .

`` When we went out and ran towards the nursery , teachers already had many children outside , those who could walk properly , '' said one man at the scene , who did not give his name . `` A pickup truck broke down the walls . The dad of one of the kids broke down one of the walls with his car driving in reverse , and that helped us a bit . ''

`` They did n't tell us anything , nothing , until like 6 p.m. , '' said Ofelia Vasquez , whose 4-year-old son Herman was in the building . She said she eventually was told he was at Chavez Hospital .

`` We went there and we saw that he was badly burned , 75 percent of his body was burned , '' she said .

Herman Vasquez died after surgery , his mother said .

As of Sunday afternoon , 26 children remained hospitalized , 12 of them in critical condition , Sonoran authorities said . Another 10 children had been transported to other hospitals : eight to Guadalajara , one to Ciudad , Obregon , and two to Sacramento , California .

A team of 29 medical experts in Hermosillo was deciding if any more victims would be moved to the Shriners Hospital for Children in Sacramento , or elsewhere .

In addition , six adults were injured , Sonora spokesman Daniel Duran said .

President Felipe Calderon traveled to Hermosillo on Saturday . He arrived with Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont and Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova to get firsthand updates from doctors and investigators , the state news agency Notimex reported .

A severely burned 3-year-old girl arrived Saturday at the Sacramento hospital -- where pediatric burn treatment is a specialty -- and was in critical condition , according to Dr. Tina Palmieri , assistant chief of the burn unit .

In Hermosillo , a large crowd gathered outside of the emergency entrance of the city 's general hospital and many people consoled each other , video from the scene showed .

`` They told me that this happened in a matter of five minutes , '' Hermosillo Mayor Ernesto Gandara told reporters after surveying the scene .
