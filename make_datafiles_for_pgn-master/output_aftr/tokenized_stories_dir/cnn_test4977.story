-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- California voters on Tuesday appear to have approved Proposition 8 , a measure banning same-sex marriage in the state .

CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin says the U.S. Supreme Court may have to rule on the issue of same-sex marriage .

California 's secretary of state late Tuesday released semi-official results showing Proposition 8 had passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent . CNN has not officially called the result one way or the other .

Hostin : It 's still valid right now . But really they are also in a legal limbo . The bottom line it 's all over the place . The law is really unclear here .

Then another law professor that I spoke to said that is absolutely fundamentally ridiculous . The bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples and this is a right that is not going to be given away . I think we 're going to see a lot of litigation here , Kiran , and the bottom line is everyone is in a legal , legal limbo .

Chetry : It 's very interesting the grounds for which they are challenging . At least in one of these lawsuits they said that it was a constitutional revision rather than an amendment . And that means it would need two-thirds approval of the House in the legislature . So do we think it could go to the state house in California as well as being fought in the courts ?

Hostin : I really think this is going to be a legal issue . I think this is going to go before the California Supreme Court . And we already know as you mentioned that there are three cases pending before the California Supreme Court . And what is interesting to note is that it 's the very same court that allowed these marriages in the first place .

And so , my guess is that that court is going to weigh in , probably reinstitute the right to marry for same-sex couples and then that 's going to be likely based on the U.S. Constitution and our Supreme Court is going to weigh in .

What is I think extremely interesting here is that we now know that we have a president-elect , Obama . He 's going to get the opportunity likely to appoint Supreme Court justices . So we do n't even know which type of court or the makeup of the court that will hear this . But I think the Supreme Court will likely weigh in on this issue .

Hostin : Yes .

Chetry : It was the highest funded campaign on any state ballot .

We also know , Kiran , that in Arizona and Florida that this ban was implemented . And so , you know , it 's all over the place . People care about this issue , and this is an issue that is really present . And I think that it 's something that , we , of course , have to watch because we 're talking about equal protection , we 're talking about discrimination . People care about these issues .

Chetry : Sunny Hostin , great to see you . Thank you .

Hostin : Thanks . iReport.com : Did you vote on a same-sex measure ?
