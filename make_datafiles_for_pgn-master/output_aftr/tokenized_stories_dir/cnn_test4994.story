Under Michael Steele 's leadership , the RNC has been accused of spending campaign funds on private jets , booze , limousines , five-star hotels , overseas resorts and a party donor 's trip to a Hollywood bondage club .

Most conservatives will agree that these expenditures are a horrible waste of funds at a time when Republicans are hoping to enjoy sizable gains in the 2010 midterm elections .

After the devastating results of the 2006 and 2008 elections , conservatives were unexpectedly able to energize their followers as the Tea Party movement emerged and President Obama experienced first-year difficulties . Local Republican victories in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey boosted the spirits of conservatives who feared Democrats might be on the verge of another New Deal .

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was forced to resign in early 2006 after being accused of violating campaign finance laws in Texas . He was also tied to the lobbying scandals that centered on Jack Abramoff .

California Rep. Duke Cunningham ended his career for accepting bribes from defense contractors who benefited from his decisions on appropriations .

Even Ralph Reed , the darling of the Christian Coalition , had been in cahoots with Abramoff in schemes to mobilize activists to protest gaming with the intention of drumming up business for his long-time friend . It seemed that the attitude of Republicans in Washington had become `` anything goes . ''

Rather than the party of Ronald Reagan , the GOP looked more like the party of Tammany Hall .

The Steele scandals point to that same kind of arrogance . This time around , Republicans are in an even weaker position , given that they are in the minority and out of the White House , struggling to rebuild their battered party . In addition , Democrats have just achieved a major victory with health care , and it seems that the jobs market is finally starting to improve .

Republicans will need to clean their house quickly and find leaders who do not look more interested in the lavish ways of Washington than in the more modest ways of Main Street .

On Monday , the Republican National Committee chief of staff resigned , with many assuming he was fired by Steele in an effort to clean house .

The resignation is a start . But much more needs to be done . If the Republican leadership does not respond more aggressively , recent efforts to revive the party wo n't amount to very much .

Conservative voters will not be enthusiastic about supporting a party whose leaders partake in lavish and questionable activities , and Democrats will have more evidence that their opponents can not be trusted with power .
