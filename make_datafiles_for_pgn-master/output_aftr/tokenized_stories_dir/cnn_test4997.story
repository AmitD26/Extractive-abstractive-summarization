-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spanish leaders Barcelona gave Real Madrid hope of snatching the Spanish title after being held 0-0 at city rivals Espanyol on Saturday in a tense match that saw Daniel Alves sent off with half an hour to play .

Should that match in Italy go ahead if European air travel resumes following the volcanic ash fallout from Iceland , Inter boss Jose Mourinho will have eagerly noted Espanyol 's success in nullifying Barcelona 's star-studded line-up .

Earlier on Saturday , fourth-placed Sevilla bounced back from the midweek defeat at struggling Valladolid to crush Sporting Gijon 3-0 , who had two players sent off .

Mali striker Fredi Kanoute opened the scoring in the eight minute after his initial header was blocked , and 13th-placed Gijon lost Mate Bilic to a second yellow card on 32 .

Kanoute 's strike partner Luis Fabiano doubled the lead eight minutes after halftime with a header from Adriano 's cross as the Brazilian made up for having an earlier effort ruled out for offside .

Jose Angel Valdes was sent off for a second booking with 10 minutes left after Alvaro Negredo went down clutching his face , and the Sevilla forward set up defender Cala from the resulting free-kick .

Villarreal claimed sixth place from Athletic Bilbao after beating Atletico Madrid 2-1 in the late match .

Argentine defender Diego Godin diverted in a 21st-minute corner and Italian forward Giuseppe Rossi made Atletico pay for calamitous defending just before halftime .

Bilbao can move back into the top six with victory at Zaragoza on Sunday , while fifth-placed Mallorca face mid-table Osasuna .
