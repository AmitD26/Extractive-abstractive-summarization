-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alan Alda almost died in 2003 . He was in a remote area of Chile , doing an episode of `` Scientific American Frontiers , '' and he developed an intestinal obstruction that came within hours of killing him . It was his good fortune that he survived the whole ordeal .

Alan Alda rummages through his life in his new book , `` Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself . ''

It 's not like his life had been bad before he almost died . He 'd earned lasting fame as Hawkeye Pierce on `` M * A * S * H , '' received a variety of awards and nominations -LRB- including Emmy wins and an Oscar nod -RRB- and established a long-lasting , happy marriage and family . But there 's nothing like escaping death to concentrate the mind wonderfully -LRB- to paraphrase Samuel Johnson -RRB- .

So , in the spirit of the examined life , Alda has put his thoughts -- derived from commencement speeches , advice and life experiences -- into a book : `` Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself '' -LRB- Random House -RRB- .

It may seem like an odd pursuit for a man with so many honors , but Alda took the quest seriously .

One theme that comes up over and over again is fear : `` It 's one of the ways I feel alive , '' Alda says . That 's true for both his public speaking engagements and his acting roles , he adds . `` When you escape near disaster you feel great , so I set these little disasters up for myself . ''

In the end , he trusted his instincts . `` I just took a leap into it . ... Sometimes those leaps are the most valuable way to do it . ''

Alda does n't diminish the impact of others . He pays tribute to a number of people in the book , from his father -- a well-known stage actor -- to such figures as actor Ossie Davis , scientist Richard Feynman -LRB- whom Alda portrayed on stage -RRB- and manager Martin Bregman .

`` He was an unlikely hero of mine , because he really risked a lot one night in Chicago , '' Alda says . `` He saved some people from possibly getting badly hurt , getting them out of jail . ''

And Convy , like some of Alda 's `` M * A * S * H '' colleagues , is also an illustration of how performers get pigeonholed , a subject Alda has considered deeply . `` That 's what usually happens when you get well-known in one part ... which is why it really is fair for actors to get paid a lot of money on television , because it could be the last time you 'll see them . That one job for five or six years could turn out to be what their whole career is . ''

There are also the pitfalls of celebrity itself , the blurring of boundaries between public roles and private life . Alda 's been beseeched by troubled people , asked to give talks at medical schools and been stared at in restaurants . The attention , he admits , can be disconcerting .

`` People were always curious about actors , '' he says . `` But now it 's much more true . ... I think that 's partly because the need to sell papers and keep profits up have devalued things a little bit . ''

`` All of us depend on people being pretty rigorous about the way they see reality , and if we knew a little bit more about the way -LSB- scientists -RSB- work , I think we 'd be able to support them in some of the things they do that will benefit us , '' he says .

So , for all of his own rigor , did Alda come to any conclusions about the meaning of his life ?

`` I think I come to some odd conclusions that sort of bring me back to where I was in the beginning , '' he says . He believes there 's more to that existential interpretation : `` I think that what they were constantly saying was that life is meaningless , except for the meaning you bring to it by the choices you make and the things you do .
