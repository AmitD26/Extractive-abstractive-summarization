The revelation was made public after a restraining order against Terri Horman was unsealed by Multnomah County court authorities in Portland .

The father alleges his wife knows what happened to Kyron , who was last seen at school more than one month ago .

`` I believe respondent is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron who has been missing since June 4 , '' Horman wrote in his request for the restraining order . `` I also recently learned that respondent attempted to hire someone to murder me . The police have provided me with probable cause to believe the above two statements to be true . ''

When asked by reporters at the Thursday news conference in Beaverton , Oregon , how he processed the information discovered in the restraining order he said , `` I did n't process it . It 's not important right now . Kyron is still missing . He 's still missing . ''

This is the second time in a week that the boy 's biological parents pleaded with the stepmother to work with investigators . But there have not been any changes since the earlier request , said Young . `` She is still not co-operating . ''

`` I 'm so angry , I do n't have the words , '' said Young . `` She is not taking an active role in trying to find Kyron . She is not telling the truth . ''

`` I 've known her for a long time , said Young , `` I know she 's lying . ''

Young and Kaine Horman said they have been totally blindsided by the disappearance of their son and by the events that followed .

Authorities have not named any suspect or person of interest in connection with Kyron 's disappearance .

Relatives of Kyron have said they are trying to keep the focus on finding the boy and not suspicions about the boy 's stepmother .

Sources told CNN affiliates that investigators believe that Terri Horman has lied to them , and cell phone records could show she was n't where she claimed to be .

`` Our main goal is to keep Kyron in the front of everyone 's mind because we have a better chance of finding him . So we are constantly working to keep him the focus of the story and not Terri , '' the family members said in an e-mail .

Terri Horman was in the headlines Monday when CNN affiliates KGW and KATU reported that she had attempted to hire a landscaper to kill her husband several months ago .

KGW reported that sources believe Terri Horman approached the landscaper , who had been working on the family 's property in northwest Portland , and offered the man `` a large sum of money '' to kill Kaine Horman .

Repeated efforts by CNN to reach Terri Horman have been unsuccessful .
