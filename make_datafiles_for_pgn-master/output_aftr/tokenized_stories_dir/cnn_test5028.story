The draw sees Milan stay in second spot , one point behind champions Inter , who were held to a 1-1 draw at Palermo on Saturday .

Third-placed Roma are three points adrift but meet Inter next Saturday in a decisive clash .

Milan are bidding for their first Italian championship since 2004 , but have lost David Beckham and Aleessandro Nesta to serious injuries in the past week .

Milan also had opportunities in an entertaining game and Inzaghi and Mancini were denied by fine saves by Morgan De Sanctis .

`` It 's never easy playing Napoli . We had a few chances after the goal but it was n't to be , '' Ronaldinho told AFP .

`` There are ten games left to give it our all . We need to take the positives from the game and keep our feet on the ground . If we do , the scudetto is a real possibility .

Bari and Parma shared the spoils with a 1-1 draw to stay in mid-table with Chievo and Catania also ending 1-1 .

Sampdoria later completed a miserable week for Juventus with a 1-0 home win in the battle for the final Champions League spot .

Juve , shocked by Fulham in the Europa League , were beaten by a superb long range strong from Antonio Cassano for Samp , who go fifth .
