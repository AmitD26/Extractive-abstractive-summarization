Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A malfunctioning launch control center for a portion of the nation 's nuclear missiles remained offline Wednesday as investigations continued into a weekend computer problem that disrupted communications with more than 10 percent of America 's land-based nuclear missiles .

Early indications are that Saturday 's disruption to one of the launch control centers linked to Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming lasted longer than an hour , Lt. Col. John Thomas said . The problem appears to be very similar to glitches at two other nuclear missile sites in the late 1990s .

The fifth control center remains offline and is believed to be the source of a computer hardware problem that caused a communications disruption Saturday . It has been electronically isolated from the launch system while the problem is investigated and solved , Thomas said .

Thomas said that as soon as computer messages started telling the squadron commanders at Warren Air Force Base that a problem existed over the weekend , closed-circuit television security cameras were used to check each silo and make sure no obvious problems existed . Then , Air Force personnel from Warren were sent to all 50 silos , in a `` not insignificant effort , '' to visually inspect them and make sure they were secure . Some of the missile silos are hundreds of miles from the base .

The investigation is still going on , Thomas said , but early indications are that a computer component on the fifth launch control center continually tried to communicate with the missiles in the silos when it was n't supposed to . He compared it to five people with walkie-talkies and one of them sitting on the button , making it impossible for the other four to use theirs .

Once the fifth launch control center was isolated , the other four established communications with all 50 missiles , and the squadron was back to normal , Thomas explained . The process of isolating the problem and getting the other control centers linked back to the missiles took more than an hour , he said . Because of redundancies in the nuclear force , several military officials have said , the president always had the ability to order the missiles to launch .
