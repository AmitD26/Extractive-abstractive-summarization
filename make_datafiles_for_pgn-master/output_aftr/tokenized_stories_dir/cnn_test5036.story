Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The sham marriage trial of Mexican actress Fernanda Romero , under way in a Los Angeles federal court , offered more drama this week than the soap operas she is famous for .

The courtroom cast included celebrity photographer and reality TV star Markus Klinko , whom defense lawyers tried to paint as a revengeful ex-boyfriend who turned her in to immigrations agents .

Romero sat directly in front of jurors , holding hands with co-defendant Kent Ross , the Los Angeles musician she allegedly paid $ 5,000 to marry her so she could get a U.S. work visa .

The couple had an `` unconventional relationship , '' but their marriage was real , a defense lawyer said in opening statements .

The 28-year-old actress-model began sobbing as Klinko testified against her Wednesday , outlining his romantic relationship with Romero that he said began after she married Ross .

The judge scowled several times as the lead defense attorney questioned Klinko about areas already ruled irrelevant to the case .

Klinko testified that it was `` completely incorrect '' that his motivation was to get his former girlfriend deported .

The criminal complaint named Ball as a target of the federal investigation , alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company .

Klinko said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared Klinko might by extorted by Ball .

The prosecutor in the case , Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Left , said Romero could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted , though such cases usually produce shorter sentences .

The federal complaint accuses Romero of paying Ross , 28 , to marry her June 12 , 2005 , but alleges that they never lived together as a couple .

She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18 , it says .

Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic , Clean and Clear , Pepsi , Apple and JC Penney , it says .
