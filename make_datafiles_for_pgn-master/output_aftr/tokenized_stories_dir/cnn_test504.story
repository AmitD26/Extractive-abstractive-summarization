` Dementia Village ' - as it has become known -- is a place where residents can live a seemingly normal life , but in reality are being watched all the time . Caretakers staff the restaurant , grocery store , hair salon and theater -- although the residents do n't always realize they are carers -- and are also watching in the residents ' living quarters .

Residents are allowed to roam freely around the courtyard-like grounds with its landscaped trees , fountains and benches -- but they ca n't leave the premises .

Their two-story dormitory-style homes form a perimeter wall for the village , meaning there is no way a resident can accidentally wander out .

And if they do approach the one exit door , a staffer will politely suggest the door is locked and propose another route .

Elderly Germans try to avoid care homes

Placing an aging family member here is far less expensive than round-the-clock , in-home care . It also takes an enormous amount of stress off family members who do n't have ample time or proper training to care for their loved ones .

Nearly every day of the week , Theo drives 15 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- each way to spend a few hours with his 80-year-old wife .

Although they ca n't chat with each other , Theo and Corrie will often sit for hours , holding hands and lovingly look into each other 's eyes . Every so often , Corrie offers a smile , a laugh , a squeeze of the hand . At least part of her memory , it seems , is still intact , though she ca n't verbalize much these days .

Like other residents of Hogewey , Corrie may not know exactly where she is , but she always feels right at home . That 's precisely the idea .

For Yvonne van Amerongen , one of Hogewey 's founders , the need to create the small village was deeply personal .

Five things CNN 's Dr. Sanjay Gupta learned at the center

Van Amerongen sat down with her colleagues in November 1992 to discuss how they could transform the typical nursing home into more worthwhile living .

They created a 1.5 hectare -LRB- four-acre -RRB- complex , completed in 2009 , that is home to 23 housing units and seven different `` lifestyle themes , '' such as crafts , culture , religious and urban .

From the furnishing of her unit to the decorations and the type of food served , Corrie is led to believe that nothing in her life has changed . It 's this sense of normalcy that they strive for day in and day out at Hogewey .

But telling stories is exactly what some of the residents do , all day long , including Corrie 's housemate , Jo Verhoef . Like all of Hogewey 's residents , Jo 's dementia is rapidly progressing . Her `` loop '' is getting shorter ; the conversations she carries and the questions she asks are becoming more repetitive in a shorter amount of time .

Steve may be a relic of Jo 's past , a distant , foggy memory of a baseball player she says lived with her for a short time when she was younger . Or , he may be a figment of her imagination . Sadly , we 'll never know .

Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind

Worldwide , 35.6 million people have dementia , according to the World Health Organization , with 7.7 million new cases being diagnosed every year . At that rate , the number of people with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050 . This will be an additional burden for governments already struggling to contain the runaway costs of health care .

In Holland , everyone pays into the state health care system during their working years , with the money then disbursed to pay for later-in-life expenses - and that means living in Hogewey does not cost any more than a traditional nursing home .

Could this innovative model work in other countries ? Health care industry leaders in Germany , England , Switzerland and Japan are all beginning to take notice . At Hogewey , says van Amerongen , `` We have Dutch design , Dutch cultures , Dutch lifestyles , but the concept is to value the person , the individual ... to support them to live their life as usual , and you can do that anywhere . ''

On a physical level , residents at Hogewey require fewer medications ; they eat better , and yes , they live longer . On a mental level , they also seem to have more joy . It 's a difficult thing to measure , but that is the most important thing here at Hogewey .
