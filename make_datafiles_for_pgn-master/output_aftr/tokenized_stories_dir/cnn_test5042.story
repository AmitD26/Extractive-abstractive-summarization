The victims , who were in a small warehouse in the Upper Ninth Ward , are believed to have been homeless and were burning a fire to stay warm , officials said .

A fire department dispatcher said the call came in shortly before 2 a.m. Tuesday .

Those inside apparently were burning trash in a barrel , Holmes said . An investigator indicated the bottom of the barrel may have burned through , Holmes said .

Holmes said that numerous phone calls Tuesday indicated that some of the victims may have been from out of town .

The building is less than a mile from the French Quarter and was likely abandoned before Hurricane Katrina . Many of the victims may have known each other by nicknames , Holmes said . The area is known for panhandling , he said .

Authorities were in the process of identifying the badly burned victims , who may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning or smoke inhalation , Holmes said .
