Back in the community where she and Frank had lived for almost 40 years , Branham learned two of her former neighbors also had brain tumors .

`` It was like a light bulb went off , '' Branham recalls . `` How can that many have cancer living right next door to each other ? ''

Since then , more brain cancer cases have turned up , 30 in all , among current and former residents of McCullom Lake , a community of about 1,000 residents in northern Illinois , not far from the Wisconsin state line .

Branham and others in McCullom Lake are now pointing the finger at a chemical plant a mile up the road in Ringwood , Illinois .

`` I do n't think there 's been a bigger brain cancer cluster outside the workplace -- ever , '' says Aaron Freiwald , attorney for 31 McCullom Lake Village plaintiffs now suing Rohm and Haas . In addition to the brain cancer cases , there is one plaintiff alleging her liver damage resulted from environmental pollution . The company denies making anyone sick .

Branham 's case is the first to go to trial , with jury selection set to begin Wednesday in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

Frank Branham died in June 2004 , a month after learning that he had a deadly glioblastoma brain tumor . He was 63 .

Rohm and Haas says even though the cancer cases are close together , they are random .

`` There is no cluster in McCullom Lake Village , '' says Kevin Van Wart , attorney for Rohm and Haas . `` If you draw circles around selected cases , you can always draw the conclusion of something unusual . ''

Brain and central nervous system cancers strike 7.6 per 100,000 people in the United States , according to the National Cancer Institute . An estimated 22,020 men and women in the United States will get diagnosed with these cancers this year .

Originally a dairy

The facility has disposed its waste off site since 1978 , but vinyl chloride , trichloroethylene , or TCE , and vinylidene chloride have all been found in nearby groundwater , according to the CDC .

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services calls vinyl chloride `` a known carcinogen . '' Long-term exposure to vinyl chloride on the job increases workers ' risk of cancers of the liver , brain , lung and blood , according to the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry .

Breathing or drinking high levels of TCE can damage the central nervous system , liver and lungs and also cause an abnormal heartbeat , according to the agency . Breathing high levels of vinylidene chloride can affect the central nervous system , liver and kidneys , the agency says .

But Van Wart , the Rohm and Haas attorney , says the plume of contaminated groundwater is moving away from McCullom Lake and does not affect any homes or residential wells .

`` Nobody disputes that it exists . But that is not going anywhere near McCullom Lake Village , '' Van Wart says . `` No agency has ever concluded any resident was exposed to dangerous chemicals . ''

The company has also offered to pay $ 5,000 to monitor the air for vinyl chloride and $ 50,000 for an independent analysis of theories of possible vinyl chloride exposure .

When Joanne and Frank Branham moved to McCullom Lake in August 1960 , they saw a picturesque community with other young families .

On Sundays , the husbands would go down to the beach to play baseball . The wives would pack picnic baskets and watch .

Looking back , Joanne Branham says there were warning signs . In the summer , a terrible odor would sometimes force them to close their windows , she says .

After her husband died , Joanne Branham 's children bought her a plane ticket to return to Illinois , from Phoenix , Arizona , where she and her husband had retired .

Freund , 49 , a truck driver and jewelry store owner , says he never gave the Rohm and Haas plant a second thought until Joanne Branham came back to town .

`` It was a cover-up from the get-go as far as I 'm concerned , '' says Weisenberger , who also suffers from seizures .

`` What they did was wrong , and if this will save one person 's life and they wo n't do this again , it will be worth it , '' she says .
