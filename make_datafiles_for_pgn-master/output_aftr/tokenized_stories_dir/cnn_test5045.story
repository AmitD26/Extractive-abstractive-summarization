LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was the stench . That was what really hit Danny Boyle the first time he went into a slum in India .

Boyle 's experiences shooting in the teeming , chaotic port city of Mumbai could also be described as sweet and sour .

The director , who is renown for films like `` Trainspotting '' and `` 28 Days Later , '' had never even been to India before he and his crew traveled there to make the critically acclaimed Oscar contender `` Slumdog Millionaire . ''

`` It 's pretty mad , '' admits Boyle . `` Everything is extreme . It 's too hot , the tea is too sweet ; everything is kind of too much . '' But , he adds : `` That 's wonderful for drama , absolutely wonderful . ''

`` Slumdog '' is a classic rags-to-riches story about a young boy from the slums , Jamal Malik -LRB- played by British actor Dev Patel -RRB- , who beats millions of other Indians to bag a coveted place on the country 's version of TV game show `` Who Wants to be a Millionaire ? ''

Through the timely story of the young `` slumdog , '' Boyle illuminates the contradictions of present day India -- the nuclear power that does not provide public sanitation for its population -- and Mumbai was the ideal city in which to do it .

`` Mumbai is a city of extremes , '' Boyle explains , `` Life is raw . It 's incredibly powerful and rich because their economy is expanding , the richest men in the world are there ... but then there is also this enormous poverty as well . '' Do you think Danny Boyle has captured India in `` Slumdog Millionaire '' ? Tell us below in the SoundOff box .

Boyle 's film shows these extremes with great realism . He takes the audience from the cheerfully money-grubbing micro-commerce of the slums where young boys charge slum dwellers to use filthy latrines , to Jamal 's job as a `` chaiwallah '' -LRB- tea boy -RRB- in one of India 's much-publicized call centers , and later , to the Indian game show phenomenon , `` Kaun Banega Crorepati . ''

`` There 's a period of time between about 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. where it all stops and just the dogs move around , but other than that , the place is just a tide of humanity . ''

With limited time in India , Boyle made the decision to travel to the places he intended to shoot and film the cast 's rehearsals there . This was something the film 's star , Patel , found challenging at first .

`` You ca n't stop the bystanders in Bombay , '' she explains , `` It is something that you attract anyway , especially if you have a camera out there and a foreign crew and a song and dance .

`` You are definitely going to attract a huge crowd and you ca n't do anything about it . The only thing you can do is enjoy it . ''

For Boyle and the crew , on the other side of the camera , the energy and chaos was a pretty intense experience .

But they did have some tricks up their collective sleeve . Boyle and veteran cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle shot crowd scenes , like the chase through Juhu slum at the beginning of the film , using the people who happened to be passing by on the street for added realism .

'' -LSB- We used -RSB- a Canon stills camera , which takes 12 frames per second . If people see a stills camera , they do n't think it 's recording live action , '' he explains .

`` You arrive and you feel a bit vulnerable and naked again , and that 's a really good thing , because you are not tempted to just step in your own footsteps all the time . ''
