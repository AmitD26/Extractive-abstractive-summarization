WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey , the acting commander of U.S. Central Command , spent Wednesday in Beirut , Lebanon , to discuss the security crisis with officials there and assure them that U.S. military aid will continue , a U.S. military official said .

The trip had not previously been scheduled . It is not clear when it was added to the agenda of the top U.S. military commander for the region .

Discussions centered on continued U.S. military assistance to the Lebanese armed forces in light of the ongoing crisis .

For the last several years , the Defense Department has supplied Lebanese armed forces with ammunition , armored vehicles and weapons .

The Lebanese army said Tuesday that it will use force if necessary against armed groups , acting after at least 62 people were killed as anti-government Hezbollah militants battled supporters of Lebanon 's pro-Western government while the military largely stayed on the sidelines , declining to intervene .

The army reversed its stance Tuesday , saying it would take steps up to and including the use of force in response to `` security activity and military presence , '' an apparent reference to public activity by armed groups .

Meanwhile , several Western and Middle East nations have lined up to support an Arab League effort to intervene in the political crisis . An Arab League delegation is scheduled to arrive in Lebanon this week in hope of negotiating an agreement between the Lebanese government and the Shiite Hezbollah movement .
