Yes it can , at least in a limited sense . Over a century ago , Albert Einstein showed that time is intrinsically elastic , capable of being stretched or shrunk by motion . Fly from London to New York and back , and you will leap a split second into the future of stay-at-home Londoners . The effect can easily be measured using atomic clocks and involves only billionths of a second -- too brief for a person to notice , and hardly the stuff of `` Doctor Who '' television series-style adventures .

But time stretching can be magnified by increasing the speed . Close to the speed of light -LRB- about 300,000 kilometers per second -RRB- , time warps become startling . Fly to the star Vega , 25 light years away , and back again at 99 % of the speed of light , and when you return to Earth in 2062 , you will have experienced only seven years travel time in the spacecraft . In effect , you will have leaped 42 years into Earth 's future .

Wormholes in space are shortcuts linking distant points -- a bit like that other sci-fi favorite , the star gate . Leap through one and you might come out on the other side of the galaxy a few minutes later . If wormholes exist , they could be adapted to make time machines that send you into the future if you traverse them in one direction , but into the past if you go in the other direction . Like a black hole , a wormhole would be a massive gravitational space and time warping object . But whereas a black hole represents a one-way journey to nowhere -- jump in and you can never get out -- a wormhole has an exit as well as an entrance .

Do wormholes exist ? Black holes certainly do , but nobody has yet glimpsed any sign of its cousin , the wormhole . Furthermore , some physicists are so uneasy about their potential for being portals to the past that they flat-out reject the very idea . The problem concerns those familiar time travel paradoxes , like going back in time and murdering your mother before you were born . Physicists call these causal loop paradoxes , and they affront our desire for the universe to be a rational and ordered system . If cause and effect get muddled up in time , what does that do for our notions of reality ?

In spite of these misgivings , there is nothing in Einstein 's theory of space , time and gravitation to forbid journeying into the past , a possibility that Einstein himself hated . Not only wormholes , but several other mechanisms have been found that , according to Einstein 's theory , can be used to travel back in time . All these proposals suffer from the problem of extreme impracticality , though . Building a human-sized wormhole , for example , would require harnessing vast amounts of peculiar quantum field energy and deploying gravitational stabilizing technology that would need the resources of a cosmic super-civilization .

Nearly 100 years ago , Albert Einstein showed that motion could stretch or shrink time

Fly from London to NYC and back and you leap forward a split second , Paul Davies says

@highlight

He says a big time warp requires an intense gravitational field , such as a black hole

@highlight

Going back in time would require a `` wormhole , '' which he says is possible in principle
