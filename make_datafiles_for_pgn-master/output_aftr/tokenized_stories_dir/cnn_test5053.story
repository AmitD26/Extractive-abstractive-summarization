-LRB- WIRED -RRB- -- Android chief Andy Rubin took to the blogs Wednesday evening to combat recent reports of Google clamping down on Android 's openness .

`` As I write this the Android team is still hard at work to bring all the new Honeycomb features to phones . As soon as this work is completed , we 'll publish the code . This temporary delay does not represent a change in strategy . ''

Honeycomb is Android 's first tablet-optimized software release . Rubin cites the difference in form factor between tablets and phones as the reason Google has n't released Honeycomb 's source code to device manufacturers and developers .

Motorola is the exception : The company 's Honeycomb-fueled Xoom tablet has been on the market for more than a month , which makes Google 's decision to hold the code from wide release a bit mystifying .

`` They say they 're going to release it , I 'm not gon na call them liars , '' Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin told WIRED.com in an interview . The Android OS is based on a version of the Linux OS , which has been an open source , collaborative platform since its release decades ago .

Rubin 's post also addressed questions raised in a recent Bloomberg story about Android 's level of control over its partners . Bloomberg wrote :

Over the past few months , according to several people familiar with the matter , Google has been demanding that Android licensees abide by `` non-fragmentation clauses '' that give Google the final say on how they can tweak the Android code -- to make new interfaces and add services -- and in some cases whom they can partner with .

Motorola vouches for Rubin 's statement .

`` In the time since we 've started working with Google , our relationship has matured , but it is n't any more limiting than it ever has been , '' Christy Wyatt , Motorola 's VP of mobile software development , told Wired.com . `` I do n't believe that anything has changed in the CTS since the beginning . ''

Finally , Rubin emphatically denied other rumors of ARM-chipset standardization in the platform , much of which arose in the wake of an anonymously sourced DigiTimes story .

`` There are not , and never have been , any efforts to standardize the platform on any single chipset architecture , '' Rubin wrote . With the Nexus One , Google 's first flagship phone , the company worked with Qualcomm to install its 1-GHz Snapdragon ARM processors in the HTC-manufactured handsets .

The subsequent Nexus S came equipped with Samsung 's 1-GHz Hummingbird processor , which is also based on ARM architecture .

All of this negative attention is n't good for Android 's `` open '' image , and maybe that 's what overcame Rubin 's reluctance to speak : too much FUD about Android 's future .
