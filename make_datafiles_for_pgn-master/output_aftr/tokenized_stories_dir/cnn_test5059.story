SOUTH KOREAN CNN STUDENT NEWS VIEWERS : Annyeonghaseyo ! We love CNN Student News . We are watching CNN Student News from South Korea . Yay !

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Someone introducing our show from half a world away ? Might have found something that 's more awesome than Fridays . I 'm Carl Azuz . Let 's get started .

First Up : Middle East Policy

AZUZ : First up , President Obama announces a `` new chapter '' in the U.S. policy toward the Middle East . In yesterday 's speech , the president talked about all of the upheaval that 's been sweeping across that part of the world . He called the revolutions and political protests a wave of change that can not be denied . President Obama said the U.S. does and will support reforms in the Middle East and North Africa that help ordinary people in the nations there . And he spoke out harshly against governments that have used force on protesters . He also pushed to re-start the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , saying that the demand for change in the region might help kick-start negotiations . In terms of changes across the entire Middle East , the president said `` it will be years before this story reaches its end . '' But he explained why the U.S. supports change .

U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : There 's no straight line to progress , and hardship always accompanies a season of hope . The United States of America was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves . And now , we can not hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights , knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful , more stable and more just .

Severe Flooding

In 1927 , American aviator Charles Lindbergh took off for his famous flight across the Atlantic Ocean . It was the world 's first solo , non-stop , transatlantic flight .

Japan 's Economy

AZUZ : Next up , we have a report from Kyung Lah that 's related to Japan 's gross domestic product , or GDP . That 's the total value of all the goods and services that a country produces in a given amount of time . Japan 's GDP is down . And to find out one of the big reasons why , you just need to look back at what happened a couple months ago .

KYUNG LAH , CNN CORRESPONDENT : The tsunami that leveled Japan 's northern coastline on March 11th is now , two months later , destroying a new terrain : the country 's economy . Japan 's government announced the nation 's gross domestic product fell at a surprising 3.7 % annualized rate in the first quarter of 2011 . It 's the second quarter in a row the GDP has fallen , meaning Japan is now in a recession .

Look deeper into the GDP fall , and the numbers are even more grim . Industrial output , which includes all the consumer products Japan sends around the world , plunged 15.3 % in March , the worst ever recorded in Japan 's history . The auto industry hurt the most . Car production fell almost 60 percent in March . Nissan 's President and CEO Carlos Ghosn re-opened a hard-hit factory in the tsunami zone just this week , leading workers in a rah-rah session , but acknowledging full recovery for the company is still months away .

In the hard-hit region of Miyagi Prefecture , half of the companies and factories -- 10,000 of them -- are affected by the earthquake and tsunami ; 600 expected to close . Japan 's government says a quarter of a million foreigners left Japan in the immediate aftermath of the disaster . As far as tourism coming in , it 's fallen off a cliff . Airports are reporting a 35 to 60 percent drop in travelers . The nuclear crisis at Fukushima is also fueling concerns of an energy shortage , impacting Japan 's ability to produce cars , electronics and parts for months to come . Experts say Japan 's economy was already struggling before the disaster . HSBC Senior Economist Frederic Neumann believes there is a chance the disaster could have an unintended positive outcome .

AZUZ : Now , this is n't an official proposal ; it 's just an idea at this point that some people are talking about . We want you to talk about it ! Do you think it 's better to tax drivers by the mile or the gallon ? Zoom on over to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com and share your opinions .

AZUZ : All right , we 're going to stay in the driving lane here and look at something called a roundabout . It 's a kind of intersection , but not one with a traditional crossing . A roundabout -- as the name suggests -- is a circle . Officials say they do n't make sense in every situation . But Tom Foreman steers us toward one mayor who 's all about the circular logic .

TOM FOREMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT : North of Indianapolis , in the suburb of Carmel , Mayor James Brainard has been going around in circles for years over traffic jams .

BRAINARD : It 's made a huge difference in the way our city looks and feels , and the way people get around .

FOREMAN : Roundabouts , not to be confused with bigger , more intimidating rotaries on the East Coast , are designed to smoothly sweep drivers in from any direction , slowly guide them around , and just as easily let them out and on their way . Since cars do n't stop , commuters save time and , officials say , use 30 % less gas at intersections .

FOREMAN : The mayor says intersection accidents are also way down , improving insurance rates . And the city saves money , too .

BRAINARD : We do n't have to buy a $ 150,000 signal . We do n't have to buy electricity every year . And we do n't have to replace it after 15 years when all that mechanical equipment wears out .
