The new entity would be the biggest in the US , combining AT&T 's 95 million customers with T-Mobile 's 34 million users for a total of 130 million subscribers .

AT&T said the transaction would quickly provide `` the spectrum and network efficiencies necessary ... to address impending spectrum exhaust in key markets '' due to the exponential growth of traffic on its network .

AT&T did n't directly address how the merger would affect the new company 's pricing . But on the website it built to announce the deal , www.mobilizeeverything.com , it notes : `` Historically , during periods when carriers combined to achieve efficiencies , U.S. wireless prices fell . ''

The company also cites a 2010 report from the U.S. General Accounting Office which found that the average cost of wireless services -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- `` declined 50 percent from 1999 to 2009 , during a period which saw five major wireless mergers . '' The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors at both AT&T and Deutsche Telekom , but will be subject to regulatory approval .
