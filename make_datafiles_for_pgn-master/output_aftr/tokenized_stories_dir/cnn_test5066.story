-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Clashing priorities of jobs versus the environment are provoking questions about how far the nation should go to promote clean energy alternatives like solar and wind power .

`` The actual debate happening in the United States is not hard to understand , '' wrote Matthew Yglesias on the Center for American Progress Action Fund 's blog . `` We 're having an argument about whether doubling-down on fossil fuel extraction or promoting efficiency and renewal energy would be better economic policy . ''

Those numbers could benefit the nation 's budget and some of America 's 14 million unemployed .

Defending Obama 's environmental record , White House spokesman Clark Stevens pledged the administration `` will continue to take steps to meet the president 's important goals of protecting the health of our families , increasing our nation 's clean energy generation , reducing our reliance on foreign oil , and supporting American industries and innovation . ''

Criticism of Obama 's clean energy initiatives resulted in the resignation of an administration energy official this week after solar panel maker Solyndra -- which got about a half billion dollars in federal loan guarantees -- went bankrupt . On Thursday , Obama defended government help for clean energy companies because they 're `` part of that package of technologies of the future that have to be based here in the United States . '' The president said Europe and China are outpacing the U.S. in clean energy because their governments are offering incentives . Many smaller U.S. clean energy companies , he said , find it difficult to find private investors .

Environmental ` gut check time ' for Obama ?

Nonetheless , environmentalists say they 're worried about other clean energy issues . The State Department is poised to decide later this year whether to approve a permit for a Canadian company to build a new oil pipeline from Alberta , Canada , to Texas , which supporters say will increase jobs and energy independence .

In a move last month that angered much of the environmental community , Obama decided to delay implementing EPA rules limiting smog from vehicles , power plants and factories . Business leaders applauded the decision , saying the rules would have killed jobs .

So , what do Americans think ? Most -LRB- 63 % -RRB- say developing alternative energy sources should be a higher priority than expanding fossil fuel exploration and production , according to a Pew Research Center study . For so-called `` main street Republicans , '' that number is 66 % .

As for Election Day politics , Obama is unlikely to lose many votes over his environmental record , Mellman says , because most environmentalists will find themselves with few acceptable alternatives .

Obama 's 2012 GOP rivals include candidates who doubt that climate change is real and who favor eliminating the EPA . What Obama does risk is voter turnout and enthusiasm -- key factors that helped him win in 2008 .

`` I think many of them will , '' says Mellman . `` The question is , how many of them will ? And I think that is influenced to some extent by the administration 's policy decisions . ''
