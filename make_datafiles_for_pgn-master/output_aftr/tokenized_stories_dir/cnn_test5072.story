-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Syria has until Friday to agree to let Arab League observers into the country to monitor the government 's response to civil unrest or else face economic sanctions from its neighbors , a senior Arab League diplomat said Thursday .

`` If they do not comply , then the league 's economic body will file a report to the foreign ministers of the league who will meet on Sunday to vote on the economic sanctions to be implemented , '' said the diplomat , who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the negotiations with Syria .

If Syria agrees by the Friday deadline , then the league will send a delegation to Damascus to discuss details of the observer mission before the team goes , the diplomat said .

Another activist group , the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , reported earlier that at least 11 Syrian military defectors were shot dead and four injured during clashes with regular Syrian army units in the area . A further 73 civilians were arrested in Homs province Thursday , the group said .

A campaign of raids and arrests is also taking place in the Damascus suburb of Domeir , the Qalet Mudeeq neighborhood in Hama , and Baniyas , the LCC said .

Al-Assad has resisted mounting calls for his resignation as president in recent weeks as international outcry over the Syrian violence has intensified .

On Tuesday , the humanitarian committee of the U.N. General Assembly voted by a large majority to condemn the violence in Syria and express its support for the Arab League initiative .

Syria 's government has said it is fighting armed terrorists , and it maintains that the death toll is much lower than international observers and opposition groups say .

CNN 's Lonzo Cook and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report .
