-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Based on a true story , Cameron Crowe 's `` We Bought a Zoo '' is the kind of real-life adventure tale with which anyone who has ever dreamed of truly making a new start can identify .

As for the humans , Matt Damon does a great job as the grieving widower Benjamin , whose wife dies before the film begins . Benjamin and Katherine -LRB- Stephanie Szostak -RRB- had one of those storybook romances that we all wish we had -LRB- theirs is told completely in still photos and mostly dialogue-free scenes pulled from Benjamin 's memory -RRB- , and the pain is etched clearly on his face . His kids are all he has left , but much like George Clooney 's Matt King in `` The Descendants , '' Benjamin 's parenting skills leave little to be desired .

You see , Benjamin was an adventure writer for a newspaper , the kind of a guy who voluntarily takes assignments that land him in a hurricane hunter airplane . Kids , on the other hand , can be way worse . Benjamin 's son Dylan -LRB- ably played by Colin Ford -RRB- is less than happy about , well , everything . He 's recently been expelled from school and his behavior -LRB- which includes drawing very disturbing pictures -RRB- is one big reason why Benjamin thinks they all need a fresh start . Dylan and Benjamin are constantly at each other 's throats , and those scenes occasionally err on the side of strident .

Dylan 's petulance and generally obnoxious behavior are really the film 's only misstep . He 's clearly a talented and smart kid , and his inevitable acceptance of his surroundings and new life come about 20 minutes too late . But it 's a minor issue as far as the overall film is concerned .

When Benjamin buys it , the zoo is on its last legs . Kept together by a small but devoted staff , including head zookeeper Kelly Foster -LRB- a winning Scarlett Johansson -RRB- , zookeeper Robin Jones -LRB- Patrick Fugit -RRB- , who is rarely seen without a capuchin monkey on his shoulder , or Kelly 's young cousin Lily -LRB- Elle Fanning -RRB- , who takes an immediate shine to Dylan , and zoo architect Peter MacCready -LRB- played with fantastic drunken brio by Scottish actor Angus Macfadyen of `` Braveheart '' -RRB- .

Thomas Haden Church does a spirited turn as Benjamin 's levelheaded older brother , Duncan . Duncan is the voice of reason , pleading with Benjamin to do the sensible thing and cut bait when things get tough at the zoo .

`` We Bought a Zoo '' is exactly what it needs to be in this holiday season . I started smiling at the beginning , and kept a smile up until the end when , I 'll confess , I was also shedding a few tears . Do n't mistake this for frothy , insignificant throwaway entertainment . This one comes with real emotions that are thoughtfully and carefully presented . And , for better or worse , most of us can relate .

`` We Bought a Zoo '' is rated PG and contains a few mild -LRB- and cutely delivered -RRB- expletives .
