-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- McDonald 's probably wo n't be exclaiming `` I 'm Lovin ' It '' in this case .

In a David-and-Goliath match-up in the world of fast food , McCurry -- a small Indian curry shop in Malaysia -- has won an eight-year legal battle against the hamburger giant .

The sparse 24/7 self-service restaurant in the capital , Kuala Lumpur , is popular with blue-collar workers who are drawn to its affordable fare , such as biryani rice and fishhead curry . Its logo : a chicken flashing a thumbs-up .

The eatery opened in 1999 . McDonald 's filed suit two years later .

The hamburger chain , which has 185 restaurants throughout Malaysia , said McCurry was violating the prefix `` Mc '' and that McDonald 's had the right to protect it .

McCurry , in turn , said the prefix is common and is part of last names all across Europe . Furthermore , it said , the `` Mc '' in McCurry stands for `` Malaysian Chicken Curry . ''

A lower court ruled in favor of McDonald 's , and Suppiah appealed . An appeals court in 2006 overturned that ruling , prompting McDonald 's to appeal this time .

Suppiah said the ruling means he can now add other McCurry locations , with its slogan : `` Tasty and so Gooood . ''
