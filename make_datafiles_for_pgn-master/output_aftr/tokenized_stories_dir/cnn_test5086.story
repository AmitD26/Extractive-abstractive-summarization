Paul told CNN that he went through a scanner at the airport and set off an alarm . He wanted to go through the body scan again instead of getting a pat-down -- claiming that he showed Transportation Security Administration officers his knee and under his socks -- but the agents refused his request , according to the Kentucky senator .

`` When an irregularity is found during the TSA screening process , it must be resolved prior to allowing a passenger to proceed to the secure area of the airport , '' TSA spokesman Greg Soule said . `` Passengers who refuse to complete the screening process can not be granted access to the secure area in order to ensure the safety of others traveling . ''

The senator said that he did n't think it was `` appropriate '' for him to have a pat-down , adding he should have been able to go through the scanner again .

`` Is it too much to ask to have a little dignity when you travel ? And should n't an adult be able to get back in line and go through the scanner ? '' he told CNN . `` I do n't think that 's too much to ask . ''

A TSA official said Paul was `` not detained at any point '' and left the checkpoint willingly . The official was not authorized to speak for attribution .

`` It tells me that either the machines are inadequate , or they are not telling us the whole story , '' said Paul , insisting that two TSA agents told him that the screeners go off randomly -- an assertion the federal agency denies .

`` I think we 've gone overboard ... I feel that our dignity is compromised , but I do n't feel more safe , '' said Paul , noting he spoke with Pistole after the incident Monday . `` Regular , ordinary citizens do n't need to be put through this , particularly the frequent travelers . ''

Rand Paul is the son of libertarian Texas Rep. Ron Paul , a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination . Ron Paul weighed in on the controversy Monday afternoon , calling it an example of a `` police state in this country '' that `` is growing out of control . ''

CNN 's Alan Silverleib , Aaron Cooper and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report .
