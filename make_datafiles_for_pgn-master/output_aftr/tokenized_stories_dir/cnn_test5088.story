-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has ruled out the possibility of Carlos Tevez departing on loan , hours after AC Milan announced plans to discuss a possible move for the Argentina striker .

Milan want an initial loan deal with a view to a post-season transfer , but Mancini warned the Italian champions ahead of Thursday 's planned meeting that the 27-year-old will only leave the English Premier League leaders if a permanent deal can be agreed .

`` Thursday we have a meeting with Manchester City about Tevez , but will probably not be the decisive one to conclude the negotiations , '' Galliani told Milan 's official website .

`` It will be almost impossible to take him to Dubai with the rest of the team . With Manchester City we have a long way to go , at the moment . ''

`` Manchester City paid Carlos a lot of money three years ago . It is correct that if one club -- it could be Milan , Juventus , Paris Saint-Germain -- they pay Carlos for his value . This is correct . ''

Tevez was fined by City for refusing to warm up when he was an unused substitute in a European Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich in September .

The former Manchester United forward has been consistently linked with a move away from the Etihad Stadium after handing in a transfer request in December 2010 .

Tevez looked to be heading back to former club Corinthians -- where he spent two years between 2004 and 2006 -- but the Brazilian club pulled out of the deal in July .

The Buenos Aires native has not played for City since September 's domestic cup victory over second division Birmingham City and has made just three league appearances for the team he captained last season .

Meanwhile , former France striker David Trezeguet is on the verge of sealing a switch to Argentine team River Plate .

River 's official website confirmed the 34-year-old has passed a medical and will officially join the Buenos Aires club on January 4 .

Trezeguet has enjoyed a glittering career , winning the World Cup with France in 1998 before scoring the winning goal for his country in the final of Euro 2000 against Italy .
