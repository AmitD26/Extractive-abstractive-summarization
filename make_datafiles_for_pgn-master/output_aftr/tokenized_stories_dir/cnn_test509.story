It is one of the most enduring mysteries of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , and for the families , it 's a reason for hope .

And the clincher : Why , if the beacon is designed to activate on impact , should we believe there was an impact ? Could the plane have landed intact ? Could the 239 passengers and crew still be alive ?

The issue resonates with some family members looking for hope where little exists . Of the 26 questions families recently presented to the Malaysian government , 12 addressed the beacon .

Adding to the mystery : Hijackers or renegade pilots can not disable some of the emergency beacons , namely , the ones attached to the plane 's airframe . They are powered by batteries and inaccessible to the crew . So by all accounts , the attached beacon on Flight 370 should have activated if the plane crashed .

But experts consulted by CNN say there are numerous reasons why a beacon could fail in an ocean crash .

And there 's one other possibility considered even more likely by some : The crash impact may have actually activated the beacon , but the damaged plane sank in less than 50 seconds , the time necessary for it to transmit its first emergency signal . The beacons do not work underwater .

On Friday , 49 days after Flight 370 disappeared , no one can say with certainty what happened with the plane 's beacons .

Beacons -- more formally called emergency locator transmitters , or ELTs -- are devices that transmit an electronic distress signal in the event of a crash .

Unlike the so-called `` pingers , '' which help investigators zero in on a plane 's black boxes , ELTs are intended to help rescuers locate the plane itself . And , unlike the pingers , they do not operate when submerged under water , owing to the natural laws that govern radio waves .

The third ELT was stowed in the cabin .

The RESCU 406 AFN was designed `` to provide emergency transmission for aircraft flying over land , '' according to Honeywell 's published specifications .

But experts say any impact -- whether on land or at sea -- likely would have activated the transmitter .

Once activated , the device simultaneously transmits `` bursts '' -- short , digitally coded signals -- on three frequencies . Two of the frequencies -- 243 MHz and 121.5 MHz -- are VHF frequencies and can help search planes hone in on a target . The third frequency is 406 MHz .

In 1979 , the United States , Canada , France and the former Soviet Union teamed up to provide a global , satellite-based system to detect emergency beacons activated by planes , ships and backcountry hikers and to distribute those alerts to rescuers .

The six low-altitude satellites , whose main function is to provide meteorological information , orbit the poles and give complete but non-continuous coverage of the Earth 's surface . Because they can only view a portion of the Earth at any given time , the satellite may need to store geographic information from an emergency beacon and rebroadcast it when it comes within view of a ground facility .

The six geostationary satellites , parked in spots more than 22,000 miles above the equator , cover most of the Earth 's surface but can not determine the location of the beacon unless the location is encoded in the signal .

All of the satellites listen for a beacon 's 406 MHz signals and together can identify a beacon 's location to within approximately 3 kilometers , or just under 2 miles .

But authorities say no satellite signals were sent . No rescue was launched .

Other rescues

But the disappearance of large commercial jetliners is very rare , and consequently , so is the discovery of them .

Cospas-Sarsat said it was instrumental in finding a Varig Airlines B-737 that wandered off course and crashed in the Brazilian jungle in September 1989 . And when a Turkish Airlines B-737 dropped off radar near Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands in 2009 , an ELT alert was the first confirmation to controllers that the aircraft had crashed .

Somewhere in the Indian Ocean

What can explain the lack of a signal in the Flight 370 case ?

`` In this case , there was n't even one burst , according to the reports that we received , '' Lett said .

Likewise , the water-triggered ELTs in the life rafts would be ineffective if they became submerged , according to published Honeywell manuals for the devices .

Cospas-Sarsat also notes that beacons must have a relatively unobstructed view of the sky to work properly .

`` A submerged beacon , or one with its antenna blocked by the body of an aircraft or vessel , is unlikely to be received by the satellites , '' the organization said .

Said Honeywell Aerospace spokesman Steven Brecken : `` Until the recorders are recovered , we do n't want to speculate what could or could not have happened . We ask the same thing you do , why did n't the ELT operate ? We do n't have the answer . ''

In a recent letter to Malaysian authorities , a family group showered them with questions about the ELTs .

How many ELTs are on the plane , they asked , adding that they had gotten conflicting numbers .

Did Malaysia Airlines conduct maintenance checks ? When was the latest check for MH370 's ELT ?

They asked to see the results of those checks .

Was the 406 MHz beacon certified ? Was it possible to break the ELT in a crash ? Where exactly was it located ?

Would the ELT signal be weakened if it was surrounded by metal ? Was the cable and blade antenna 9G certified ? How much impact is needed to activate the ELT ? Had the crew been trained in the use of ELTs ? Can a beacon unlock `` and bounce -LSB- float -RSB- to the surface of the water ? ''

Many of the questions remain unanswered .

But Cospas-Sarsat officials said that previous accidents have exposed shortcomings with the system and that they are working to improve it .
