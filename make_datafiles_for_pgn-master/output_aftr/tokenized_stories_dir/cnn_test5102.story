As many who grieved over Houston 's shocking death yesterday at 48 will tell you , this first encounter would have taken place somewhere in the middle of the `` Morning in America '' years . Indeed , she seemed destined for greatness even before she released her first eponymous album for Clive Davis ' Arista Records in 1985 . The word was out years before that Houston had the presence , the pedigree and -- goodness knows -- the pipes to be something unprecedented , remarkable , even historic .

Daughter of the great soul-and-gospel vocalist Cissy Houston , cousin to both Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick and goddaughter to Aretha Franklin , Houston 's family background seemed a magically appropriate fusion of both the grit and the glamour of late-20th-century African-American pop music . You could n't find a more auspicious template for great expectations . And for a while , she fulfilled those prospects -- and then some .

Remember the insouciant swagger she showed in both the video and the recording of `` How Will I Know ? '' The effortless push-pull command of romantic lyrics she exhibited in `` Saving All My Love For You '' ? The skyscraping , come-to-meeting intensity she brought to `` The Greatest Love of All '' ? They were all on `` Whitney Houston , '' the debut album that answered just about every question we could have about her before we could calm down enough to come up with any questions at all .

At her peak she had enough confidence to win both the rockers and the disco crowd with the white-lightning rave , `` I Wan na Dance With Somebody -LRB- Who Loves Me -RRB- . '' She covered Dolly Parton 's `` I Will Always Love You '' with such overpowering force that she all but assumed ownership of the song . There seemed nothing she could n't do , even acquit herself more than decently as a movie actress in `` The Bodyguard '' -LRB- 1992 -RRB- , `` Waiting to Exhale '' -LRB- 1995 -RRB- and `` The Preacher 's Wife '' -LRB- 1997 -RRB- .

When someone can do anything , it 's not unusual for others to wonder if she 's doing too much -- or trying too hard . Those of us who were mesmerized by her prodigious breakthroughs wondered how long she could keep it up , especially under the glare of multimedia celebrityhood . Some of us might have preferred that she take a hiatus , a brief withdrawal from the spotlight to protect her voice and , especially , her psyche from gossip , glitz and , yes , controlled substances .

But when people demand that you deliver a knockout `` Star-Spangled Banner '' at a Super Bowl while a war 's going on , when your life literally becomes a lowbrow real-life sitcom -LRB- only without the laughs -RRB- and when there are hundreds , thousands and millions of little-girls-with-big-voices who look to you as a role model , there 's not a whole lot of elbow room to turn the dial to `` slow '' and contemplate ways of adjusting your art and your life to time 's insistent demands .
