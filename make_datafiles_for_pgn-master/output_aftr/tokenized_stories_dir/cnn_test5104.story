San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Apple rolled out a high-definition iPad on Wednesday with a faster processor , a better camera and a display screen that promises to be dramatically sharper than the current model , the iPad 2 .

`` It is amazing , '' Apple CEO Tim Cook said at a San Francisco unveiling . `` We 've taken it to a whole new level , and we are redefining the category that Apple created with the original iPad . ''

The new 9.7-inch display screen will feature a `` retina display '' of 2047 by 1536 pixels , compared with the current model 's 1024 by 768 pixels .

To break it down , that 's a total of 3.1 million pixels on the display screen .

`` Your retina in your eye can not discern those individual pixels , '' said Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller . `` The images on it look stunning . ''

The new version will be available in the U.S. on AT&T and Verizon and will be the first iPad to connect to 4G networks -LRB- a fact that , at least for now , remains academic in most cities -RRB- . It also will go on sale Friday in Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Hong Kong , Japan , Puerto Rico , Singapore , Switzerland , the UK and the U.S. Virgin Islands .

Surprisingly , `` the new iPad '' was as close to a name as Apple gave the gadget Wednesday . Predictions had bounced back and forth between `` iPad 3 '' and `` iPad HD '' before the event . But the announcement ended without an official name being announced .

On Wednesday , Cook also announced an updated version of Apple TV , the company 's Web-TV integration device that competes with products like Google TV , Roku and Boxee .

The system supports 1080p , or `` Full HD '' high-definition video , up from the current model 's 720p . It will be available for $ 99 starting next week and could pave the way for what 's expected to be Apple 's next project : a fully integrated high-definition television .

When the iPad was introduced in early 2010 , tablets already existed , but none had become popular with mainstream consumers . Some analysts wondered if there would be a market for a device that falls somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop but does n't fully replace either .

The answer was a resounding `` yes . '' The company has sold more than 55 million iPads worldwide to date .

Just last week , Microsoft rolled out its Windows 8 operating system for tablets , suggesting that Windows-based tablets could be making a serious run .

In a move perhaps designed as a shot at these rival upstarts , Cook announced Wednesday that the price on the iPad 2 will be slashed $ 100 . So , a 16 GB , Wi-Fi-only model will sell for $ 399 , making it more competitive with the lower-end tablets .

Cook also announced Wednesday that the 25 billionth app has been downloaded from the App Store . Perhaps significantly , that app was downloaded in China .
