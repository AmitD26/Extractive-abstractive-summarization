Which Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for $ 250 million ?

Was it the Bezos who helped recover two Apollo-era F-1 engines from the bottom of the Atlantic ocean this spring ? A savior capable of raising rusted heaps out of their watery graves ?

Was it the Bezos who 's sunk $ 42 million into the `` Clock of the Long Now , '' a timepiece that will run for 10,000 years entombed inside a man-made cavern carved into the top of a mountain outside of Ely , Nevada ? An eccentric billionaire who 'll drop vast amounts of money into , well , a hole in the ground ?

Was it the Bezos who founded Amazon , the biggest store in the world , a company that has both transformed and trampled nearly every formerly brick-and-mortar industry it has entered , from books to shoes and beyond ?

Or was it the Bezos whose personal investments -- in companies like Twitter , Airbnb , Makerbot , Uber and many others -- demonstrate an innate understanding of the shifting trends of the web ?

Each one of those Jeff Bezoses would do interesting things to the Washington Post -LRB- well , maybe not the crazy mountain clock guy -RRB- .

AWS began as a commerce problem . Amazon needed a massive server cloud for the holiday shopping season but only a fraction of it for the rest of the year . That means a lot of expensive servers would be sitting idle to make sure your Christmas presents do n't get hung up when you press `` purchase . '' So the idea hatched that those idle computer servers could be rented out to other companies . It worked .

Similar to the creation of AWS , journalism has its done its share of invention and experiments that have transformed the Web .

Django , a Web framework used by companies like Pinterest and Instagram , got its start in the newsroom of the Lawrence Journal-World . Backbone , a Javascript library that powers sites like Hulu and Pandora , was created as part of the Document Cloud project at the New York Times . These newsroom technologies and others like them are transformational not just to journalism but to the entire Web the same way AWS does n't power only Amazon .

These spinoffs , these `` hare-brained '' ideas , these bits and pieces of code that start in the newsroom and end transforming the Web itself , are what technologists in journalism do best when they have the right support and leadership behind them . That leadership is still too rare in the journalism industry . That may have changed in a big way on Monday .
