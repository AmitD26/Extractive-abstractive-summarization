`` I 'd like to get a couple of shows down and see how it goes , '' Keith Richards says . `` But I 'd love it . ''

The news comes after the band gathered in late April in the New York area for a full week of rehearsals -- their first time playing together at such length since the final night of the marathon A Bigger Bang tour at London 's O2 arena in August 2007 . In July , the band will gather in London to further discuss live performance possibilities .

`` It 's all very hush-hush , '' Richards says . `` I 'm going over to London for a bit , so I 'll find out more then . ''

He adds that the band will also use the summit to discuss whether they will be recording their first new LP since 2005 's A Bigger Bang .

`` We 're going to talk about that in July and see . I mean , I 'd love to get some tracks down and see what songs we 've got . And that goes along with part of getting the band back together and getting things moving . So I 'd love to cut some tracks , yeah . ''

Does Richards see himself writing one-on-one with Mick Jagger again ?

`` Oh , yeah , '' he says . `` I have no doubt . ''

The vibe was joyful , with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger joking around between takes .

Adds Richards , `` I thought I 'd be quite rusty . After all , we had n't done it for a while â € '' five years or something . But it sounded as fresh as you could hope for . It was a great week . ''
