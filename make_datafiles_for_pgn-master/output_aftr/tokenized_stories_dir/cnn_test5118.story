WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seventeen-year-old women should be able to buy the `` morning-after pill '' without a prescription within a few weeks , a government spokesman said Thursday .

Plan B , also called the morning-after pill , is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex .

The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that the contraceptive will be available over the counter to 17-year-olds , as it currently is for women 18 and older .

The FDA just needs to review the label changes from the drug 's maker , Duramed , Strait said . Once that 's done , the approval will be complete .

In the order , U.S. District Judge Edward Korman also asked the agency to consider whether the pill should be available to women of all ages without a prescription , saying that such a determination is best left to the expertise of the FDA rather than a federal district judge . Watch more on the Plan B controversy ''

In August 2006 , the FDA approved the sale of Plan B without a prescription to those 18 and older , but those 17 and under needed a prescription to obtain it .

`` No useful purpose would be served by continuing to deprive 17-year-olds access to Plan B without a prescription , '' Korman wrote in his order . `` Indeed , the record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription . The FDA 's justification for this age restriction , that pharmacists would be unable to enforce the prescription requirement if the cutoff were age 17 , rather than 18 , lacks all credibility . '' Watch bloggers debate the merits of Plan B ''

Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards said in a statement that the FDA 's announcement is `` a strong statement to American women that their health comes before politics . And that 's the way it should be . This decision is common-sense policy that will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and protect the health and safety of all women . ''

The morning-after pill -- made by Duramed , a subsidiary of Barr Pharmaceuticals -- is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex . It works by stopping ovulation and decreasing the chances that a fertilized egg will attach to the uterus . When used within 72 hours of unprotected sex , it can lower the risk of pregnancy by almost 90 percent , the maker says .

`` Plan B is a high dose of birth control pills . ... The FDA violated its standards when it made the high-dose Plan B available nonprescription to adults . But now the FDA is making the drug available to minors without parental consent , '' the Concerned Women for America , a Washington-based conservative Christian group , said Wednesday .
