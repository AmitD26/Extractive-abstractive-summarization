Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A large fire at the southwest Atlanta film studio of Tyler Perry on Tuesday night damaged the backlot facade of one of Perry 's sound stages , according to a statement from the studio Wednesday .

`` We are grateful that there were no injuries and that 99 % of the damage is limited to the backlot facade , '' the studio statement said .

The building 's interior , which was protected from the flames by concrete masonry construction , did suffer some water damage , according to a statement from the Atlanta Fire Department .

When he opened the studio for production four years ago , Perry named the backlot 34th Street , `` as in Miracle on 34th Street . ''

Each sound stage is named after legendary African-American actors , including Sidney Poitier , Ruby Dee and Cicely Tyson . The sound stages are where Perry shoots his TV sitcoms , including `` Meet the Browns '' and `` House of Payne . ''

The multimillion-dollar studios sit on 60 acres and include five sound stages , a 5-acre pond , a theater , a chapel , a commissary , a gymnasium , Perry 's office , an art department where sets are designed , hair and makeup facilities , a wardrobe department , set decoration , a post-production facility and the backlot , according to the studio website .

Perry 's credits include work as director , writer , producer , actor and playwright .
