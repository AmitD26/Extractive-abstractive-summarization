-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In November 2010 , I watched `` HBO 's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel '' and saw a piece on the hazing antics at several historically black colleges and fraternities . I took to Twitter to share my thoughts on the issue .

Much of the report focused on Southern University , and man , did the floodgates open as a number of students from the university angrily tweeted me back , cussing , yelling and screaming , with some defending hazing , while others were angry at the national attention focused on their university .

Despite the anger and vitriol , I refused to back down , making it clear that getting beaten for being in a band or fraternity was absolutely dumb .

One year later , when news of the death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion became public , I immediately thought of that discussion and those folks who viewed hazing as a ritual worthy of continuing .

State laws have been passed , organizations have been kicked off campuses and national fraternal and sorority groups have paid millions in settlements because of hazing , but we continue to see these stories .

`` Why ? '' is a consistent question that is asked , and at the end of the day , it boils down to power and a desire to demand others kowtow to someone else 's demands in order for them to be accepted .

Every one of these organizations is overseen by adult leaders or advisers . But in truth , fellow students run the show . Normally in a band , a drum major sits at the top of the food chain , but Champion clearly had to bend to the band 's culture to be fully accepted as a member of FAMU 's `` Marching 100 . ''

These are powerful forces that can only be changed by peers . Hazing will only be brought to a close when members of organizations make it clear the vile hazing traditions will not go forward . No one today can be hazed if the student leaders make it clear that it 's unacceptable . Yet because of the natural turnover in student organizations , that mindset has to be created and passed on for it to succeed .

When I was about to pledge Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. in spring 1989 , I met with my four other pledge brothers and made it clear : I 'm not getting hit , I will never use alcohol and I will not agree to be hazed .

Me , I did n't give a damn . I would look others in the eye and say , `` In the history of our chapter , only one brother has failed to graduate , and we do nothing with him . Are you guys on the six - or seven-year plan , and can you match our graduate rate ? ''

I yelled , `` If we pledged brothers the right way , why in the hell are we afraid to say it ? ''

Since those days , I 've never wavered from my anti-hazing position . It is deplorable and shameful to think that someone would beat another person for them to prove something . Prove what ? They can take a punch ? No . I prefer to challenge his mind , his intellect .

Our goal as fraternity men is to take young men and mold and shape them to be better men . It is not our aim to take young men and train them to be collegiate mercenaries , hellbent on inflicting as much pain as they got onto the first person they have control over .

Is there tremendous value in fraternities , sororities , bands and student organizations ? Absolutely . The leadership opportunities are tremendous , and the lifelong relationships are vital .

But what has to be preached and preached and preached to every student , whether they are white , black , Asian , Latino , male or female , is that if they love that frat , sorority , drill team or band , they should n't do anything to jeopardize it for the next person .

Do we need tougher hazing laws ? Yes . Do we need universities to take punitive action , including kicking students out who break the rules ? Yes . Do we need national organizations to ban chapters for years for egregious behavior ? Absolutely . Should fellow student leaders turn in others who break the rules and haze ? Of course . There must be a zero tolerance attitude from every state official , administrator , student leader and organization member . To hell with tradition , rituals and `` the way we do things . '' All that must end . Now .

But we also must raise a generation of young people who have enough confidence in themselves to say , `` I will not take a beating just to be accepted by you . I 'd rather not have your affection or support if it means putting my life on the line . ''
