Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Turkey 's foreign minister called for a new international initiative for Syria to protect civilians and increase pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to stop his bloody crackdown , saying his country would not remain indifferent to a `` massacre in its back yard . ''

`` Now we need to revitalize a new international initiative , '' Davutoglu told reporters Friday . `` We hope that with such a strong message those who are supporting Bashar al-Assad or -LRB- the -RRB- regime at this moment , they will have to make a reassessment , '' Davutoglu said , referring to Russia and China , which vetoed the resolution .

Al-Assad , Davutoglu said , has lost all credibility both inside Syria and around the world . He pointed to the increasing number of defections from the Syrian army , estimating that about 40,000 soldiers had abandoned their posts following orders to attack civilians .

Ankara also has tried to broker the nuclear standoff between Iran and world powers . Davutoglu told reporters he believes that Iran is ready for talks about its nuclear program .

Davutoglu said Turkey had talks with Assad and then worked with the Arab League , but Ankara 's hopes faded when President Assad failed to implement a road map for reforms .

`` We wanted Assad to be Gorbachev , but he chose to be Syria 's Milosevic said Davutoglu , comparing the parallels between the events in Syria and the massacres carried out by the former Serbian leader , Slobodan Milosevic , in Bosnia during the '90s .

While Turkey has long maintained it is against foreign military intervention , Davutoglu said his country can not stand idly by while regimes open attack against their people .

`` If there is an oppression by an autocratic leader against the people , nobody can expect us or the international community to be silent , '' Davutoglu said later Friday during a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` When I went to Damascus last August , I made it very clear to -LSB- al-Assad -RSB- , I said Mr. President if there is any foreign attack against you we will be siding with you , but if you fight against your own people and force us to decide to be either with you or with the people , we will be with the people . ''

Davutoglu said he would propose new ways to turn up the heat on the Assad regime when he meets Monday with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , but declined to provide specifics .

`` It is time for humanitarian access to these cities , '' he said , particularly referencing cities like Homs that are being shelled by Syrian forces . There must be some international initiatives for this humanitarian access . ''

`` If Russia and China want to help to Syria , they must be helpful for this humanitarian access . This is not foreign intervention , '' he said , alluding to Russian fears the West will back a Libya-style foreign military campaign .

`` I think this time , Iran has seen that there is a need for negotiation , '' he said . `` This time , I am more optimistic . ''
