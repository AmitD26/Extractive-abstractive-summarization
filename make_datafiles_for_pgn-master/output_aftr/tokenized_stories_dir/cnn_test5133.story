In a letter , Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi blames himself for urging Roxana Saberi to stay in Iran .

Bahman Ghobadi said he kept quiet about the arrest and conviction of the Iranian-American journalist at the request of her family . After Saberi was convicted last weekend and sentenced to an eight-year prison sentence , he said he felt he had to do something .

He told CNN that Saberi , whom he described as his fiancee , is caught in a `` game of politics . ''

`` From the other side of the ocean , the Americans have protested against her imprisonment , because she is an American citizen , '' he writes . `` But I say no , she is Iranian , and she loves Iran . I beg you , let her go ! I beg you not to throw her in the midst of your political games ! She is too weak and too pure to take part in your games . Let me be present at her trial , sit next to her wise father and gentle mother , and testify she is without guilt or reproach . ''

Saberi , 31 , was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public . The decision prompted sharp denunciations from President Barack Obama , as well as other U.S. and international officials .

Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine . The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper accreditation . On April 9 , word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage .

Ghobadi wrote that he is `` optimistic about her release , and I firmly hope the verdict will be canceled in the next stage of the trial . ''

CNN 's Igor Krotov and Shirzad Bozorghmehr contributed to this report .
