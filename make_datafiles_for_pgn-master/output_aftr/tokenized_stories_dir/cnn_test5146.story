-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It may not be legal , but it 's definitely popular . For just 10 Guatemalan quetzals , or 15 Mexican pesos -LRB- the equivalent of just over a U.S. dollar -RRB- , you can pay to ride a zip line across a river and into a new country .

A news team from Mexico 's Televisa network , a CNN affiliate , found four zip lines crossing over the Suchiate River , which serves as part of Mexico 's southeastern border with Guatemala . They observed people crossing into Mexico in broad daylight , apparently not worried about immigration authorities posted not far from there .

Guatemalans on both sides of the border are in charge of the zip line and collecting money from people willing to cross .

A Guatemalan immigrant getting ready to cross the border using the zip line admitted he was doing so illegally . He said he had `` obtained my passport but did n't know I also need a visa to cross '' into Mexico .

Mexico shares a largely unpopulated , almost 600-mile border with Guatemala marked by jungle and rugged mountains . The zip lines connect the Guatemalan community of El Carmen to the Mexican town of Talisman .

Those who do get to the U.S. border have another river to cross , the Rio Grande -LRB- or Rio Bravo , as it 's known in Mexico -RRB- or a 21-foot wall .

U.S. Border Patrol Agent Ariel Medeles says crossing this way can be dangerous . `` There was a group down here and then they got caught in the flash flood and hours later they were looking for a body north of the openings , '' says Medeles .
