-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton believes he is back in the fight for the 2011 Formula One world championship after claiming a much-needed victory at Sunday 's German Grand Prix .

The 26-year-old headed home Ferrari 's Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber of Red Bull to secure his second maximum-points haul this season and the 16th of his career .

The Briton trails world champion and current standings leader Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull by 82 points , and is fourth in the drivers ' championship , but Hamilton is confident he is back in contention for the title he claimed in 2008 .

`` We 're back in the fight though , and I really hope we can carry this forward and keep the momentum going . ''

Hamilton spent large parts of the Nurburgring race battling at close quarters with both Webber and the Spaniard Alonso , and he felt the intense competition helped him to perform at his best .

Passing judgment : Hamilton must stay aggressive

`` Being able to drive with your head as well as your heart , and getting it just right , is massively satisfying . ''

Vettel , 24 , endured his lowest finish of the season so far and only secured fourth after he overtook Alonso 's teammate Felipe Massa in the pit lane heading into the final lap .

It was the first time the German had finished outside of the top two this season , but Vettel still holds a 77-point lead over second-placed Webber .

`` Of course I would have wanted to please my home crowd . I have seen so many fans in Red Bull colors , so of course I would have wanted to win here to see them cheer for me . ''

Webber won at the Hungaroring last year from Alonso and Vettel , while Hamilton failed to finish .

`` We are only in the middle of the season and so many points are still waiting to be taken , '' Hamilton told the F1 website .
