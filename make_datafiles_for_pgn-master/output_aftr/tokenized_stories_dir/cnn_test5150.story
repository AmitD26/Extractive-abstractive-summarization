-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` When you and I went to dinner in Arizona in the spring of 2011 , '' I say to Ned Colletti , general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers , `` you thought your team might be a lot better than it turned out to be . ''

`` It tells you that I do n't know what I 'm doing , '' he jumps in , finishing my thought .

`` And when we went to dinner in L.A. before this season , '' I remind him , `` you sure as hell were n't sure your 2012 team had a shot to be the best team in baseball . ''

He says , `` Well , how 's that saying go , ` The whole is greater than the sum of its parts ? ' ''

Well , OK , not EVERY team . But maybe the Dodgers are too big to fail . Maybe you ca n't keep a franchise this strong down too long . Maybe the bum breaks even out . Maybe a new owner and a new cash infusion and a new attitude can create a new mood . I do n't know . Call me maybe .

I can tell you this much : For years and years before the last owner owned the Dodgers , the Dodgers owned this town . The seats were filled . The team took five World Series championships and nine National League pennants after bolting Brooklyn to go west . If you count the Brooklyn years , these boys of summer won six Fall Classics and 22 pennants .

An organization that oozed success and epitomized class was being abandoned by some of its fan base . The seats WERE N'T filled . The team was n't succeeding . Its owner was in divorce court and its financial statements were in bankruptcy court . A lawsuit and a criminal investigation were pending over a parking lot incident in which a Northern California man was beaten into a coma . Dodger Stadium attendance in 2011 was down more than 627,000 from the year before .

I wondered what it would take for the Dodgers to straighten this out . Would it take years ? Would thousands of fans who once jammed the freeway near Stadium Way now steer clear for good ?

Well , they are n't totally back , the team or the fans , but you 've got to admit , it 's getting better .

After all , what did they have ?

They had a hard-hitting hitter , Matt Kemp , who might have been his league 's legitimate Most Valuable Player last season , having come in second in a vote to a guy who later was accused of using a banned substance . They had a hard-throwing thrower , Clayton Kershaw , who was indeed his league 's most valuable pitcher , having racked up a record of 21-5 . They had a left-handed swinger , Andre Ethier , whose production had tapered off sharply in 2011 after a hot start .

And ... . and ... ?

They had a team that ended up 11.5 games out of first place . They had an owner fans resented , with a big `` FOR SALE '' sign in the yard . A much-loved ballclub and ballpark suddenly had five popular people -- Kemp , Kershaw , Ethier , a certain redheaded gentleman in the radio-TV booth -LRB- initials V.S. -RRB- and a nice lady named Nancy Bea who plays the organ .

It was n't as if the Dodgers had n't been down on their luck before . On October 29 , 2005 , the owner fired his general manager . He was Paul DePodesta -LRB- aka the true identity of the Jonah Hill character from `` Moneyball '' -RRB- , who , for all his calculations and acumen , had just fielded a Dodgers team that won 71 of 162 games .

He had money to spend . He tinkered , he tweaked . Ethier was acquired in a December 2005 trade . Kershaw was drafted in June of 2006 . There were signings and experiments that did not pan out , but there was also Manny Ramirez , who was acquired by Colletti from the Red Sox in mid-2008 and turned the whole left field pavilion into his own personal `` Mannywood . ''

That 2009 team had a record of 95-67 . It was the first Dodger club since the championship run of 1988 to win that many .

Ah , but prior to that 2009 NL championship series , snap , things changed . It was announced that owners Frank and Jamie McCourt were kaput . They had separated . As soon as the Dodgers were eliminated , Frank McCourt eliminated Jamie McCourt as the club 's CEO . That same month , she filed for divorce . A day after she did , Frank McCourt 's side claimed Jamie McCourt had a guy on the side .

Critics and skeptics no longer saw the Colletti who landed productive guys like Ted Lilly and Juan Rivera without giving up much in return . They focused instead on risks like Andruw Jones and Juan Uribe who did n't produce .

And on the field ?

Well , there was no waiting . Colletti did what he could . There were new arms , like those of Chris Capuano and Aaron Harang . There were the unrelated Ellises -LRB- catcher A.J. and infielder Mark -RRB- who were much better than anyone anticipated . There was a battle-tested bat -LRB- Bobby Abreu 's -RRB- that the GM went out and got .

Best team in baseball ? Maybe not . Best record in baseball ? You bet .

It was the Dodgers .
