-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When we think about asylum , the picture that most people draw in their heads is of some persecuted person crossing a border to a safe country and pleading his or her case .

This is the traditional , and most common way , to request asylum .

But as the latest twist in the Julian Assange case shows , there are rare times when asylum is granted to someone who has yet to reach their safe haven .

Ecuador 's decision this week to grant asylum to Assange was celebrated as a victory by his supporters , but the WikiLeaks founder 's conundrum remains unchanged . For the foreseeable future , he is stuck inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London .

The concept of diplomatic asylum is as old as the practice of having permanent embassies in foreign countries . It is tied closely with the practice of diplomatic immunity , which is more well known .

From the 19th century onward , the practice of diplomatic asylum virtually disappeared in Europe , while it continued to grow in Latin America .

The exception is Latin America , where some legal writers even grant diplomatic asylum the status of a human right , the U.N. report says .

The court ruled that diplomatic asylum is not recognized unless treaties or other agreements are in place between countries .

So today , `` in general international law there is n't actually a right to grant diplomatic asylum , or at least other states are n't required to respect it , '' said Matthew Happold , an international law expert at the University of Luxembourg .

In fact , Happold said , under international law , if the U.K. officially requests Ecuador to hand over Assange , Ecuador would be legally obligated to do so .

A negotiated solution staved off a similar diplomatic drama between the United States and China this year . The blind Chinese activist Chen Guangcheng had escaped house arrest and sought refuge inside the U.S. embassy . Unlike the Assange case , however , Chen did not ask for asylum and none was granted . Instead , New York University invited Chen to study there , and China agreed to let him go .

With negotiations apparently deadlocked between Ecuador and Britain , it is uncertain how long Assange will remain holed up inside the embassy while Sweden awaits to question him over claims of rape and sexual molestation .

`` These cases can go on for years if there is n't some settlement . It 's happened in the past , '' Happold said .

Meanwhile , some experts questioned the validity of the arguments that Ecuador used to grant asylum .

The purpose of an embassy is to maintain ties with other countries , but as long as Assange remains in limbo , `` every day it will become a greater obstacle in their efforts toward good relations . ''
