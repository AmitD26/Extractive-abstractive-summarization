Iran and Algeria were the sole opponents in the 57-nation body , which represents 1.5 billion Muslims .

The organization 's move sends a message to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that its members will not accept the regime killing its people , OIC Secretary-General Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu told CNN .

He also called on the U.N. Security Council to approve tougher resolutions against the regime .

The development came as would-be rescuers searched for survivors amid the rubble left after Syrian government forces shelled a town in Aleppo province near the border with Turkey , killing 40 people , a spokesman for the rebel Syrian National Council told CNN .

Another 40 people in the town of Azzaz were missing after the shelling , which targeted a popular food market , Omar said .

Meanwhile , a United Nations commission concluded Wednesday that both Syrian regime forces and anti-government rebels have committed war crimes in the Syrian conflict .

The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry said government forces and their Shabiha militia allies committed crimes against humanity such as `` murder and torture , war crimes and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law , including unlawful killing , indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations and acts of sexual violence . ''

Since February 15 , the report says , `` the situation in the country has deteriorated significantly with armed violence spreading to new areas and active hostilities raging between rebels and the government and the militias . ''

The violence continued Wednesday , with at least 205 people killed , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . Ninety of them were in Aleppo province , and most of them were in Azzaz , a town near the Turkish border that was shelled by regime warplanes .

Opposition activists have put the death toll in the 17-month crisis at more than 20,000 .
