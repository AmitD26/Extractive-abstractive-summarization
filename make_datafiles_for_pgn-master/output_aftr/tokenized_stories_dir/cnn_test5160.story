-LRB- Wired -RRB- -- Twitter launched a new service on Wednesday called the Twitter Political Index , or Twindex . By applying highly tuned algorithms to Twitter 's fire hose of data , the service offers a real-time look at voters ' moods , and scores which presidential candidate is trending up -LRB- and who is trending down -RRB- day to day .

Welcome to the age of big political data .

â € ¬ The company had contracted Jeff Veen 's Small Batch to build a site that could show how people were talking about the election . And on this day , Veen was in the office to show what he 'd come up with , a subdomain on Twitter -- election.twitter.com -- that could track trending terms and follow message volumes about the various political candidates .

When Veen 's technology went live a few weeks later , it gave everyone a window into the vital discussions happening on Twitter . Williams was positively giddy .

It was , Williams explained to Wired , a glimpse of what Twitter could be . This was in Twitter 's salad days , literally , when the most common knock on Twitter was that it offered little more than people boasting about what they ate for lunch . `` In the future , Twitter will be less personal , '' Williams explained . `` Less about status , even . It will be more about what 's happening with trends and events . ''

Sure , there were plenty of happy Obama supporters present , but mostly the team was excited because its servers stayed up under the load . As results came in , cheers went up as the team announced not who won the election , but tweet volumes .

Topsy uses Twitter 's high-volume fire hose of data to look at every tweet in the world , and establish a neutral baseline .

So , for example , if Obama has a score of 38 , that would mean that tweets about him are more positive than 38 percent of all other messages on Twitter .

The project began when Twitter noticed that conversations about candidates on its own feeds accurately foreshadowed voter sentiments showing up in traditional polls .

Similarly , in the run-up to the Michigan and Arizona primaries , Twitter saw Mitt Romney 's follower count surge , while Rick Santorum 's sputtered out . When the election results came in , they confirmed what Twitter was seeing internally : Its own social media provided an inside line on what voters were thinking .

So Twitter began working with polling groups and Topsy to look into the political data buried in the din of constant online chatter -- they wanted a better way to measure the sentiment voters were expressing in real-time .

Topsy would look at every single tweet sent in the world , every day , and create a three-day average baseline .

It created an algorithm to understand which tweets skewed positive and which were negative . Together , Twitter and Topsy built a keyword engine , and via repetitive , ongoing spot checks by human observers , they found their algorithm would generate voter-accurate results 90 percent of the time .

And that was just the beginning of a refinement process . Every time they ran the data set against human curators and found differences , they were able to improve the algorithm .

What Twitter eventually built was the Twindex . It did n't rely on questions , and could be generated in real-time . And when Twitter compared the Twindex for Obama with Gallup 's approval rating , the graph was remarkable .

`` We pulled this up and said ` Oh , I think we 're onto something , ' '' says Adam Sharp , Twitter 's head of government news and social innovation . `` At first glance , you can readily see some parallels in the data . ''

As it continued to refine its methods , Twitter found that it had an increasingly strong correlation with Gallup polling data . But more interesting , obviously , is where the numbers diverge .

A possible explanation of this is that voters might have answered approval rating poll questions very positively in the weeks after the raid , but in ongoing conversations with each other on Twitter , sentiment focused more on normal , day-to-day concerns about the economy .

`` One of the reasons why we partnered with Topsy was because a secondary goal was to boost the ecosystem around big Twitter data , '' says Sharp . `` To demonstrate the data was big enough , and show that it was available via existing entirely publicly available data . ''
