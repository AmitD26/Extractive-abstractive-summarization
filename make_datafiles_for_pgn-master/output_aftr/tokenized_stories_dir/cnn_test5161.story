-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Responding to an allegation by the U.S. chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Pakistan 's main intelligence agency has a `` longstanding relationship '' with a Taliban-allied insurgent group that targets U.S. troops in Afghanistan , a senior Pakistani intelligence official said : `` We do have a relationship : that of an adversary . ''

`` We have made our resolve very clear that -LRB- the Haqqani Network -RRB- is an enemy we need to fight together , '' said the official , who did not want to be identified discussing intelligence matters .

`` I also have an understanding that the ISI and the -LRB- Pakistani military -RRB- exist to protect their own citizens , and there 's a way they have done that for a long period of time , '' Mullen said . `` I believe that over time , that 's got to change . ''

Based in Pakistan 's North Waziristan frontier , the Haqqani Network `` has been at the forefront of insurgent activity in Afghanistan , responsible for many high-profile attacks , '' according to the United Nations . The group is believed to have three main sources of funds : donations from the Persian Gulf region , drug trafficking , and al Qaeda payments .

The official said the `` onus of providing proof of this '' relationship was on the Americans and it was not up to the ISI `` to start providing clarification . ''

Asked if offense was taken by Mullen 's remarks , the intelligence official said : `` Not personally , no . ''

Earlier in the Geo TV interview , Mullen was pressed on issues such as the arrest of CIA contractor Raymond Davis and unmanned drone strikes against targets within Pakistan , which have marked what he called a `` rough patch '' of increasingly complex relations between the two nations in recent months .

`` We ca n't snap our fingers and say all of the sudden we trust each other , '' he said , `` and that 's what we 're trying to work our way through in the midst of these huge terrorist challenges that we both have . ''

`` It 's the focus from the United States ' perspective on the terrorist threat -LRB- in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas -RRB- , the al Qaeda leadership which still lives there and still threatens to kill as many Americans as they possibly could , combined with what I would call this federation of terrorist organizations that are getting along more than they used to , and at least from my experience ... the complexity is increasing , not decreasing . ''

Mullen 's term is set to end this year .

`` It 's been a very rough patch lately , '' Mullen said , `` and I think the leaders , including Generals Pasha and Kayani , Director Panetta and myself and others are very committed to working our way through this because we see the need to solve this problem , and we just ca n't walk away from it . ''
