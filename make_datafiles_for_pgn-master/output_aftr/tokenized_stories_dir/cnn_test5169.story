Attacks and counterattacks between the two sides are a frequent occurrence but appear to have escalated in the past two days .

On Tuesday night , the Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted two rocket-launching squads in northern Gaza as they prepared to fire into southern Israel . That attack killed two militants from Al-Qassam , the military wing of Hamas , and wounded two others .

Israeli aircraft struck Gaza again early Wednesday , killing two people and seriously wounding nine others , said Ashraf al-Qidra , the spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza .

The Palestinian rocket attacks wounded three Thai workers in Israel , hospital officials said .

Defense Minister Ehud Barak toured areas hit by rockets in southern Israel and said the military `` is working efficiently against all the terror elements . Since the beginning of the month , 15 active terrorists have been killed in the act , and more have been injured . ''

He wished a speedy recovery to those injured by rockets fired from Gaza . `` Hamas will receive its punishment for what has happened here , '' he vowed , promising that Israel will `` work with patience and level-headedness . ''

`` There is no way to eliminate the hatred or hostility entrenched in Hamas . But the IDF will act on the border , from the air and in any other necessary way in order to strike down those who attempt to cause us harm , '' he said .

Annual Qatari aid to Palestinians in Gaza will increase from $ 250 million to $ 400 million , Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya said in Khan Younis in southern Gaza .

In Washington , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said U.S. officials `` share Qatar 's deep concern for the welfare of the Palestinian people , including those residing in Gaza . ''
