A CNN crew accompanying National Transitional Council fighters witnessed people cheering for the new ruling forces . Fighting was reported in one neighborhood , al-Manshiya . Dr. Mohamad Altaib of Sabha central hospital reported some rebel fighters died from Gadhafi loyalist sniper fire there .

The fall of Sabha is significant because it means other parts of Libya , still holding out , are now cut off .

NTC fighters fanned out across the city in search of Gadhafi associates . Weaponry was found in one house , but so far , there has been no sign of Gadhafi or Abdullah Al-Senussi , the former head of military intelligence . The men , thought to have been hiding in the city , are wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity .

The NTC forces took the airport and the citadel , said Col. Ahmed Bani , the NTC 's military spokesman , Monday . `` Our flag is waving high in both locations , '' he said .

East of Sabha on Monday , a ragtag stream of civilians-turned-revolutionaries encountered scant resistance as they swept through oasis towns .

Sabha is among a handful of enclaves where Gadhafi has had support . About 400,000 people live in Sabha 's province and about half of them live in the city . Other enclaves include Bani Walid and Sirte in the north .

The death toll includes four people killed Tuesday in fighting south of the city , in Abuhadi , he said .
