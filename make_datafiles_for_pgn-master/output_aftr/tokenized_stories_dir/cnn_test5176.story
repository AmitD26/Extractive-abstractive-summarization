Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- By now , Christmas merrymakers have packed away the decorations and may even have paid off their holiday shopping sprees . But while the rest of us have moved on to Valentine 's Day , Cin Davidsen is still surrounded by glittery Christmas ornaments .

She works at North Star by Premier , a wholesale showroom in Atlanta 's AmericasMart , and last month she presided over the store 's 2011 debut of over 7,000 holiday decorations .

It 's the kickoff to a year 's worth of holiday shopping for boutiques , gift stores , florists , interior decorators and chain stores . So what can consumers expect to finally see in local shops , many months from now ?

`` There 's a real trend towards vintage ornaments this year , '' said Justin Spath , a buyer for the Santa Claus Christmas Store in Santa Claus , Indiana . `` We 're seeing a lot of retro ones , back to Victorian and even 1950s and '60s . There 's a lot of people going back to the traditional Christmas look -LRB- more -RRB- than they have the past few years . ''

`` It 's traditional red and white with hints of lime green . That lime green has really become one of the traditional colors for Christmas . It just pops . Everything that it 's on , it just pops . ''

Nickie Sfamenos , the showroom manager for wholesaler Regency International , said their line of peacockish blues and greens was a particular favorite of stores in New Orleans . She said icicles and anything with a snowy look were popular with wedding planners for winter nuptials .

East Coast area stores and large aquariums will likely carry some of North Star by Premier 's `` Under the Sea '' line , which features whimsical fish and bright Caribbean colors , said Davidsen . Another of the company 's lines , `` Calypso , '' is popular in the Deep South and South America , she said .

`` Most of our product is hand-produced , '' Goldman said , noting that all the company 's glass ornaments are blown by artisans , not machine-made . All the glitter on the ornaments is painted on by hand , added Davidsen .

`` The production times are significant . So by taking orders in January , we ship -LRB- the holiday merchandise -RRB- in proper time for the retailers to get it in time to show for Christmas , '' Goldman said .

Like many wholesale companies , North Star by Premier goes overseas to design its decor lines and have the ornaments manufactured , Alice Goldman said . Her husband , Dan , and son Neal run their 62-year-old family business .

Once the designing and manufacturing is done , the merchandise has to travel back to the United States by boat , she said . `` We start delivering in May and June . People want their orders from May through November , because they have to get the merchandise into their stores , into their stockrooms . ''

And while all that work is happening for the current year 's holiday shipments , wholesalers are already thinking a year ahead .

`` Right now we 're already thinking about items for Christmas 2012 , '' said Danny McDonald , the vice president of Regency International .

`` We 've just gotten through the big shows , and we see the trends and we see what people are asking for , and we actually start thinking about it and putting our basic thoughts down right now . ''

It usually takes between 90 and 120 days to manufacture a wholesaler 's line of products , McDonald said . Many wholesalers choose to go to Chinese factories to manufacture their ornament lines . Those 90 to 120 days encompass gathering raw materials and wooing a skilled workforce away from steadier jobs in computer manufacturing , he said .

By comparison , it 's relatively easy for the average consumer to choose from a dizzying array of shiny ornaments in a store . According to Hooper , shoppers did so with enough verve last holiday season to deplete a lot of the inventory that boutiques had been holding on to .

And now those boutiques and specialty stores are ready to replenish their stock .

`` For us , we usually spend around $ 20,000 every time we come in January , and about $ 15,000 when we come back in July . '' Casto said this was her 16th year coming to the market .
