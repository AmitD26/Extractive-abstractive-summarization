-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Algerian foreign minister on Thursday shot down assertions that Moammar Gadhafi is in his country , saying that was never an option .

`` I think the information that was disclosed which concerns some of his family members who had to be received in Algeria because of extreme circumstances , mainly humanitarian reasons , created a wave of panic , '' Medelci said .

Gadhafi 's wife , two sons and other relatives fled to Algeria , deepening the mistrust between the rebel government and Libya 's powerful neighbor .

Algeria described the move as a humanitarian gesture , but it angered the National Transitional Council , with one official calling it `` an aggressive act . ''

The transitional council has accused Algeria of supporting the Gadhafi regime . Algerians also complained to the United Nations about damage done to their embassy soon after the rebels entered Tripoli .

`` The NTC has said it is going to set up a government representative of all regions , and when it has done that , we 'll recognize it , '' Medelci said .
