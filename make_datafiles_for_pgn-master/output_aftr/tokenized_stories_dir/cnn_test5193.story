WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pilots at AmeriJet International have nice big planes , but nowhere to go .

The video has become the most compelling argument in the pilot 's public-relations arsenal ever since flight crews went on strike August 27 . Pay issues may be their top concern , but the lack of bathrooms has had the greatest resonance with the public , striking workers acknowledge .

So at picket lines , and on YouTube , pilots have been hoisting the plastic bags , which the airline provides in lieu of a loo .

`` It 's degrading , '' said Dawn Leschinski , one of two women pilots employed by the carrier .

The striking pilots say AmeriJet originally removed the plane 's lavatories to reduce the plane 's weight and the cost of servicing the restrooms .

Pilots say that the bags are fitted around a metal frame somewhat like portable johns used by campers . At the end of their flights , pilots dispose of the bags in an airport dumpster .

Pilots also complain that there are privacy issues , since cargo handlers sometimes ride in the cargo hold , where pilots go to the bathroom .

`` You just have to be real discreet , '' Patel said . `` You have to do it in front of everybody else . ''

An AmeriJet official declined to comment on the lavatory issue , or even discuss whether the planes have lavatories .

A Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman said lavatories , or the lack thereof , are not a concern for regulators .

`` That 's not an aviation safety issue . It 's a passenger or crew-member comfort issue , '' said agency spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen . `` There is absolutely no requirement for any aircraft to have a lavatory . ''

But one business industry group says lavatories should be a concern .

Kevin Mitchell of the Business Travel Coalition , which represents corporate travel offices , called AmeriJet 's working conditions `` worse than the sweatshops of the 1930s '' and said it is a safety issue .

Pilots in the industry say the major cargo carriers all fly planes with lavatories , but several smaller cargo carriers have eliminated restrooms .
