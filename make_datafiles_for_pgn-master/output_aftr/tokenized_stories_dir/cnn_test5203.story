-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bram Stoker 's private journal sat unnoticed on his great-grandson 's bookshelf in England for at least a year .

Full of notes that would inform his legendary novel `` Dracula '' and other stories , the thin , unmarked book had probably been lugged down from the attic at some point , along with other things the Stoker family had passed down for more than a century and placed inconspicuously in Noel Dobbs ' Isle of Wight home .

Then , one day not long ago , a researcher working on a project about Stoker got in touch with Dobbs to ask if he might know anything about a journal his famous relative kept . Dobbs looked around and finally popped open this tiny book . It was signed `` Abraham Stoker . ''

Dacre Stoker has worked with Bram Stoker scholars to annotate `` The Lost Journal , '' which also offers quirky bits of folklore from Ireland , Stoker 's homeland , and insight into the inspiration for his other work .

There are 305 entries , some pages-long , others just a few sentences .

Bram Stoker was in his early 20s when the journal began in 1871 . He had graduated from Ireland 's Trinity College and was working at Dublin Castle .

Vlad 's father was a member of the Order of the Dragon , or Dracul . `` Dracula '' means son of the Dragon .

The last entry of Stoker 's journal in 1881 hints at a major character he would use in `` Dracula . '' In the novel , Renfield is an asylum inmate who has delusions that compel him to eat living beings , including flies , to gain their life force . The vampire Count Dracula seizes on Renfield 's weakness and offers him as many creatures as he can eat in exchange for his eternal devotion .

It does n't work out well for Renfield in the end .

In his journal , Stoker wrote : `` I once knew a boy who put so many flies into a bottle that they had not room to die . ''

In another passage , the author seems to be alluding to a vampire 's inability to see his own reflection . `` Story of man who reflects everybody 's self who meets him , '' he wrote .

Stoker 's interest in spookiness shows up in other journal entries .

`` A man builds up his shadow on a wall bit by bit by adding to substance , '' he wrote . `` Suddenly the shadow becomes alive . '' The passage is believed to be a kernel of the `` The Shadow Builder , '' one of Stoker 's first attempts at a horror mystery .

The author apparently drew from his journal for material that would make up `` Under the Sunset , '' a lesser-known collection of short stories for children that Stoker published in 1881 .

One note in the journal alludes to the writer 's fascination with children : `` Palace of Fairy Queen . Child goes to sleep & palace grows -- sky changes into blue silk curtains etc. '' Dreaming kids would appear in several stories in `` Under the Sunset , '' all darkly told tales that meditate on the blurry line between reality and imagination , science and folklore .

The journal 's first entry , titled `` Night Fishing , '' is a kind of ode to the sea and the people who encounter it . The writing seems experimental and flowery .

Though Stoker died before his Count Dracula became internationally famous when Bela Lugosi played him as a suave nobleman in the 1930s film , Dacre Stoker thinks the author would be flattered by how his character has stayed relevant over the years . From Lugosi to Anne Rice 's Lestat and `` Buffy the Vampire Slayer '' to `` Twilight '' and `` True Blood , '' Stoker 's main question : `` What does it mean to live forever ? '' has proved eternal .

In one of his books , the author alludes to another diary . He writes about an upcoming trip to London where one can get work as a writer . The journal of writing and notes that was recently found in the Isle of Wight home is not that diary .
