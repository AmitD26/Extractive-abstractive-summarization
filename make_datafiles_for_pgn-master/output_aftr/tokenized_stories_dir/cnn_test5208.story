He is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson supermarket , where U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , D-Arizona , was meeting with constituents Saturday . Six people were killed and 14 others wounded in the shooting .

Federal authorities have charged Loughner with first-degree murder , attempted murder and attempting to kill a member of Congress , counts that involve the shootings of federal employees . State prosecutors also could bring charges in the remaining cases .

A federal public defender known for handling high-profile cases , Judy Clarke , has been appointed to represent Loughner , a federal judicial source said .

Clarke defended `` Unabomber '' Ted Kaczynski and assisted in the case of confessed al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui .

Loughner has invoked his right against self-incrimination and is not talking with investigators , Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said over the weekend .

Investigators have not found anything connecting Loughner to extremist groups , the law enforcement official said . They believe Loughner was unemployed at the time of the shooting , according to the official .

Months before Saturday 's shooting rampage , one of Loughner 's former instructors said he saw Loughner as a threat and kicked him out of class .

Loughner was `` physically removed '' from the Pima Community College algebra course in June -- less than a month after it began -- instructor Ben McGahee told CNN .

`` I was scared of what he could do , '' McGahee said . `` I was n't scared of him physically , but I was scared of him bringing a weapon to class . ''

The 9 mm pistol used in Saturday 's shootings was purchased at a gun store in November , FBI Director Robert Mueller told reporters Sunday . And a law enforcement source said the suspect tried to buy ammunition at a Walmart store but was turned down because of his behavior . Another Walmart store later sold him the ammunition , the source said .

When he tried to enlist in the Army in 2008 , the service rejected him for reasons it says it ca n't disclose due to privacy laws . But an administration official told CNN on Sunday that Loughner had failed a drug test .

In postings on the social-media sites YouTube and MySpace , Loughner railed against government `` mind control , '' being surrounded by people he considered illiterate and the illegitimacy of the U.S. government . In class , McGahee said Loughner accused him of violating his free-speech rights : `` And of course free speech is limited in the classroom . ''

One such outburst was `` the straw that broke the camel 's back , '' and McGahee -- who had already raised concerns about Loughner with administrators -- had him removed .

In a statement Saturday night , Pima Community College said Loughner was suspended after a series of run-ins with campus police between February and September , capped by the discovery of a YouTube video in which he accused the college of operating unconstitutionally . Loughner quit school after the suspension , the college said -- and it warned him that to return , he had to present a doctor 's note stating that his presence would not be `` a danger to himself or others . ''
