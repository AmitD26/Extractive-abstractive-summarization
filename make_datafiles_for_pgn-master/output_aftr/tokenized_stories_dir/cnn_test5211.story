The French government has not confirmed the claim , which follows an acknowledgement earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere .

Ibrahim Baitalmal , the spokesman for Misrata 's Military Council , said that if the French agreed to help in Misrata , anti-Gadhafi forces there would receive much needed supplies to fight against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi 's forces .

The U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary , with the exception of a ground invasion , to protect civilians . NATO began bombing military targets a short time later .

It also reported that pro-Gadhafi forces had bombed an opposition building in Tobruk , in the far east of the country .

Lavrov said that if confirmed , France 's action was in violation of the U.N.resolution .

But speaking in Moscow Friday , French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his country 's NATO partners and the U.N. Security Council had been told about France 's decision to drop weapons for the Libyan opposition .

`` It 's within that framework that we reacted . We informed our NATO partners and the Security Council . ''

French Ministry of Defense spokesman Colonel Thierry Burkhard confirmed Wednesday that its military had dropped food , medical products and light weaponry by parachute to Libyans in Djebel Nefoussa .

Speaking at a news conference Thursday , Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi said rebel forces were receiving arms from France but were not trained in their use .

CNN 's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report .
