`` The King 's Speech '' won the best picture , best actor , best director and best original screenplay Oscars at Hollywood 's Kodak Theatre Sunday night .

Natalie Portman , who played a ballet dancer in `` Black Swan , '' was given the best actress Academy Award . Portman also won Golden Globe and SAG best actress trophies in recent weeks .

Portman , who is pregnant , was asked backstage if she might now consider `` Oscar '' as a name for her child .

`` I think that 's probably definitely out of the question , '' she said .

`` The moral of this story is listen to your mother , '' Hooper said .

`` My father always said to me I would be a late bloomer , '' Seidler said , `` I hope that record is broken quickly and often . ''

Colin Firth , who portrayed the stuttering King George VI in `` The King 's Speech , '' completed his sweep of best actor honors with the Oscar win . `` I have a feeling my career has just peaked , '' said Firth , who also won a Golden Globe and the SAG award .

`` I think I 'm going to cook a lot , '' Firth said . Cooking is `` a very good way to decompress , '' he said

He does not support the decision to re-release the movie with the F-word edited out to allow a younger PG-13 rating at U.S. theaters .

`` The context of this film , it could not be more edifying , more appropriate , '' he said . `` It 's not vicious . ''

Christian Bale repeated his Golden Globe and SAG award wins by taking the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in `` The Fighter . ''

Melissa Leo , who played the mother and manager of two boxers in `` The Fighter , '' completed her trifecta of major awards when 94-year-old Kirk Douglas handed her the best supporting actress Oscar . Leo also won Golden Globe and SAG best actress trophies .

Douglas , who walked with a cane and spoke slowly with slurred speech , managed to upstage Leo with his humor , jokingly delaying reading what was in the envelope . His stand-up routine was rewarded with big laughs .

Leo , whose acceptance speech included a censored expletive , used Douglas 's cane to walk off stage .

Two awards went to `` Toy Story 3 '' for animated feature film and best original song .

The short documentary Oscar went to `` Strangers No More , '' a film about an Israeli school that includes students from 48 countries .
