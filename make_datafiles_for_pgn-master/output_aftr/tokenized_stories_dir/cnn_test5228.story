Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- John Brennan joined the CIA as a young man after responding to a newspaper want ad . Now , at 57 , he could become its next director .

President Barack Obama on Monday nominated Brennan , his chief counterterrorism adviser , to lead the CIA , praising his pick as someone already closely connected to the agency and willing to fight on its behalf .

Brennan worked for the CIA for more than two decades and has been Obama 's assistant for counterterrorism and homeland security since 2009 . In that role , Obama said , Brennan worked closely with many government agencies .

He was also intimately involved in the run-up to the raid on the Osama bin Laden compound in May 2011 .

`` John is legendary even in the White House for working hard , '' Obama said . `` He is one of the hardest working public servants I have ever seen . ''

In recent years , Brennan has become well-known in Washington as the public face of the White House 's counterterrorism policies . Now , if the Senate confirms his nomination , he 'll head an agency where many employees work behind the scenes .

`` If confirmed as director I will make it my mission to make sure that the CIA has the tools it needs to keep our nation safe and that its work always reflect the liberties , the freedoms and the values that we hold so dear , '' Brennan told reporters shortly after Obama tapped him for the job .

Obama announced Brennan 's nomination Monday at the same time he tapped former Sen. Chuck Hagel to become defense secretary . Both men , he said , `` have dedicated their lives to protecting our country . ''

If the Senate confirms Brennan 's the nomination , he will replace retired Gen. David Petraeus , who stepped down from his job as CIA director in November amid revelations that he had engaged in an extramarital affair with his biographer .

Petraeus resigned on November 9 as the FBI investigated whether his biographer , Paula Broadwell , had inappropriate access to classified information .

`` Those of you who know John can attest to his intellect , expertise , and prodigious work ethic . I have had the privilege of working with him for the better part of two decades , and I know him to be a public servant of the highest integrity . We have worked literally hundreds of tough issues together , and I have found that his approach always begins and ends with the question , ` What is the right thing to do here ? ' '' he wrote .

Returning to the CIA would be a homecoming of sorts for Brennan , who spent 25 years there , developing a deep knowledge of the Mideast and fluency in Arabic .

Debate over the drone program and Brennan 's position on CIA interrogations could make for some rough moments during his hearings .

Opinion : John Brennan , Obama 's drone warrior

Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , said he planned to examine Brennan 's record closely .

`` I appreciate John Brennan 's long record of service to our nation , '' McCain said in a statement , `` but I have many questions and concerns about his nomination to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency , especially what role he played in the so-called enhanced interrogation programs while serving at the CIA during the last administration , as well as his public defense of those programs . ''

Even as she praised his record , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , said she planned to raise the CIA detention and interrogation issue with Brennan .

The fact that Brennan is coming from the West Wing and has frequently talked about the president 's views on camera could make him political fodder , said Frances Fragos Townsend , CNN 's national security contributor .

On Monday , Brennan said he was prepared to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and field their questions .

Compared to Hagel , reaction to Brennan nomination muted

CNN 's Catherine E. Shoichet reported in Atlanta ; Pam Benson in Washington . CNN 's John Berman , Jill Dougherty , Devon Sayers and Jim Acosta also contributed to this report .
