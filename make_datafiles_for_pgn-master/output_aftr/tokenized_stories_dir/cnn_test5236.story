Tampa , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Her family calls her the Mitt Stabilizer . Ann Romney , who is someone who is known to be able to calm her husband down when needed , is taking center stage in trying to paint a more personal picture of her husband of 43 years .

He would have some serious injuries but would recover and stay in France , actually taking over the mission . When he returned to the United States , he immediately proposed to Ann . They would start a family in Utah and then move to Massachusetts .

Asked if she gave him advice , she said `` of course '' adding `` we share everything . There 's nothing we do not know about , you know , any struggle that either one of us is going through . We share everything .

`` Of course I give him advice , and of course he gives me advice . And I think we listen to each other more than we listen to anyone else . ''

She described a job that her husband also talked about to CNN , but it is one the family rarely discusses publicly : He served as head of the Mormon congregation in Belmont , Massachusetts , because the church does not employ paid clergy . So Romney not only led services but counseled members of the congregation and helped them in whatever way he could .

`` I look at and see how -- how wonderful that was , '' she said . `` When we 're mothers and responsible for children , there 's something that happens to us -- that service gene that 's naturally there where we 're taking care , we 're watching over . We 're nurturing .

`` And for men , they often do n't get that experience . But when you serve in a way Mitt was serving at that time , that 's exactly the experience he had : nurturing , caring , looking out for , being concerned . ''

`` I was for a long time , after the diagnosis , trying to just struggle through on my own , not sharing with how hard of a time I was having . And so , you know , you kinda just wan na tough it out and not be a burden to anyone else . But then , finally , you just ca n't go on , '' she said .

`` I really just was having a very , very hard time , and was very depressed , '' she told Borger , `` and had kind of given up a little bit in thinking that I was -- you know -- it was a little overwhelming . ''

Her husband took over the household chores -- cooking , going to the grociery store -- and reassured her `` that it was n't fatal , we were gon na be OK , '' she said . `` No matter what I went through , he was gon na be there next to me and he was gon na be helping me .

At that point , she said , `` I was n't able to do anything . ''

`` It was , like , he was gon na do anything he could to just say , `` I 'm here . You 're OK . Just stay right there and we 'll be OK . ''

She said uncertainty about the disease , which has no cure , was very hard for her to face .

`` There 's this huge unknown . And it 's a very , very frightening place to be . ''

She tried various ways to deal with the symptoms , especially fatigue , including an alternative treatment called reflexology , in which pressure is applied to various parts of the body . She also tried horse riding .

While she had not seen major problems from the disease in recent years , she did have a relapse around the Super Tuesday primaries in March .

`` I overdid and I knew I was overdoing , '' she said .

Most people have `` a reserve tank , '' she explained , but `` with MS you go to empty and you go to empty . ''

She said she `` just had to get past that mile mark and then I 'd be OK , and I could rest . But I did n't quite make it to the mile mark . I kinda collapsed . ''

The stress `` is a great teacher , '' she said . `` It really is . Because -LRB- I -RRB- ca n't absorb all this that 's going on around me . There 's a lot of noise and there 's a lot of really negative noise that 's going on around me , around my husband -- during this campaign . And

so I have to just learn how to not to let that just get into my psyche . ''

`` Get him out of the public eye -LRB- and -RRB- he is loose and funny and spontaneous as you 'd ever want to be . And just so much fun to be with . ''
