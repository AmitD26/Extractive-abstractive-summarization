-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of Malaysia 's police force has warned opposition supporters they face arrest if they attend a rally Wednesday evening organized by losing candidate Anwar Ibrahim .

According to a statement from Anwar 's Pakatan Rakyat -LRB- PR -RRB- coalition , the event is being held at a private location so is not bound by the law .

The group said it had informed police but there was no need for a permit .

`` Our conscience can not allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating . A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to , '' Anwar said in a statement released Monday .

A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were `` unsubstantiated '' and the government 's victory was in line with independent polling .

`` Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was ` massive fraud ' , '' the spokesperson said in a statement .

Prime Minister Najib Razak took his oath of office on Monday after 80 % of the electorate turned out to cast their vote .

During the weeks leading up to the election , reports emerged of escalating violence , including beatings and death threats .

Other allegations surfaced on polling day , with Anwar 's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government .
