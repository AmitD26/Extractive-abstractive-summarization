Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A day after a 75-minute session , talks will resume Monday to try to reach a deficit-reduction deal and pave the way for a hike in the nation 's $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling , a White House spokesman said Sunday .

White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer said on his Twitter account on Sunday night that congressional leaders will return to the White House for further negotiations on Monday . At 11 a.m. that same morning , President Barack Obama will hold a press conference in the White House briefing room , according to his official schedule .

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said afterward that Democrats are `` still hopeful for a large bipartisan agreement , '' one that will do `` no harm to the middle class or to economic growth -LRB- and -RRB- protect Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries . ''

Those comments echoed many others made by key figures in both parties , as they posture to try get a deal that cuts into the nation 's debt .

Republicans initiated the fight when they demanded drastically reduced spending -LRB- but no tax hikes -RRB- before they agreed to raise the nation 's debt ceiling . Obama responded by saying he backs an ambitious plan to reach $ 4 trillion , mostly through cuts but also with revenue increases .

If Congress does n't act by August 2 , the government could begin defaulting on its obligations . The president hinted at that sense of urgency Sunday . When asked before the meeting 's start if a deal can be reached within 10 days , he told reporters , `` We need to . ''

The White House immediately pushed back , with a senior administration official saying Boehner had initially accepted the need to increase tax rates on wealthy Americans as part of a deal . But then , the official said , Republicans offered a different plan in the talks with Obama that began Thursday .

Obama believes `` it is time to solve this problem , '' White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley said on ABC 's `` This Week '' program Sunday . He added that Obama 's `` call to the -LRB- congressional -RRB- leaders is to step up and be leaders . ''

The Treasury Department has warned that failure to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a default , which could push interest rates to skyrocket and cause the dollar to plummet . But Republicans , including those controlling the House , have said they 'll block any such move without substantial budget cuts .

A U.S. default on its debt obligations would have `` real nasty consequences '' for the United States and the global economy , the new director of the International Monetary Fund said in an interview broadcast Sunday .

`` It would jeopardize the stability at large , '' Christine Lagarde , who last week became the first woman to head the global financial institution , told ABC .

Still , such warnings did n't prevent party leaders on Sunday talk shows from reverting back to time-tested talking points that suggested the two sides were still far from an agreement .

At the heart of the GOP resistance is a bedrock principle pushed by conservative crusader Grover Norquist against any kind of tax increase . A pledge pushed by Norquist 's group , Americans for Tax Reform , has been signed by more than 230 House members and 40 senators , almost all of them Republicans .

After Sunday nights talks , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's spokesman Adam Jentleson said that the Nevada Democrat wants `` an approach that is balanced between spending and revenues . '' However long it takes , he said that Reid is `` firmly committed '' to striking a deal .
