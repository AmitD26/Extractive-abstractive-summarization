-LRB- CNN -RRB- A pilot and CEO of a health research firm , who survived a 2010 mishap involving a plane in Gaithersburg , Maryland , was among six people killed in Gaithersburg Monday when a twin-engine plane crashed into a subdivision .

Michael Rosenberg , CEO and founder of a North Carolina clinical development company called Health Decisions , was identified as one of the people on the airplane , according to a statement from the company . The flight originated in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , close to the company 's headquarters in Durham .

The National Transportation Safety Board has not said who piloted the plane , but Rosenberg was certified to fly that type of aircraft , according to Federal Aviation Administration records .

`` This guy , when I saw him , for a fast jet with the wheels down , I said , ` I think he 's coming in too low , ' '' said Pedreira , who lives near the crash scene . `` Then he was 90 degrees -- sideways -- and then he went belly-up into the house and it was a ball of fire . It was terrible . ''

Montgomery County Police Chief Chris Manger said Gemmell 's husband and the couple 's 5-year-old child were not home at the time .

On Monday , Sumwalt said the plane 's `` black box '' had been recovered from the wreckage . He said the device contained the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder .

`` It has been rushed to our headquarters in Washington , D.C. , where ... investigators in our labs will begin this evening downloading the data , '' he said .

`` I think that Phenom just came up short , '' the call said , according to LiveATC.net .

Later , someone says , `` There 's nothing left of that house . ''

A woman who lives near the scene of the plane crash told CNN affiliate WUSA she might have heard victims calling for help .

She also described how she first became aware that something was terribly wrong .

`` At first I heard a big sputtering sound . By the time we rushed over here , you see a plane hit the side of the house and then crash right down and there was a big explosion , '' the woman said .

She also says she heard a loud booming sound . `` By then , the flames were just so high and then it was a big mushroom effect of smoke and it just burst into flames . ''
