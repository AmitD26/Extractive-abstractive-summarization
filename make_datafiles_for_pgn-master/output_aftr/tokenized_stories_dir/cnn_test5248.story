This tragedy is not without precedent . Next month will mark the 10th anniversary of a similar nightclub fire in Rhode Island . At this sad time , it 's appropriate to reflect on what we 've learned from club fires -- and what we have n't .

Rhode Island 's Station nightclub fire of 2003 , in which 100 concertgoers lost their lives , began when fireworks set off by Great White , an 80s heavy metal band , ignited flammable packing foam on the club 's walls .

Deadly blazes : Nightclub tragedies in recent history

Panicked patrons stampeded toward the club 's main exit , and a fatal pileup ensued . Contributing to the tragedy were illegal use of pyrotechnics , overcrowding and a wall covering that would have failed even the most rudimentary flammability tests .

Video images of the Station fire were broadcast worldwide : A concert begins ; the crowd 's mood changes from merry , to curious , to concerned , to horrified -- in less than a minute . You 'd think the world would have learned from it . You would be wrong .

The following year , the Republica Cromanon nightclub in Argentina went up in flames , killing 194 people . The club was made to hold about 1,000 people , but it was estimated that more than 3,000 fans were packed inside the night of the fire , which began when fans began lighting flares that caught the roof on fire .

• Be observant . Is the concert venue rundown or well-maintained ? Does the staff look well-trained ?

• Once seated , take note of the nearest exit . -LRB- In an emergency , most people try to exit by the door they entered , which is usually not the closest , and is always overcrowded . -RRB- Then , share the location of that nearest exit with your entire party . Agree that at the first sign of trouble , you will all proceed to it without delay .

• Once the show begins , remain vigilant . If you think there 's a problem , LEAVE IMMEDIATELY . Do not stay to `` get your money 's worth '' despite concerns about safety . Do not remain to locate that jacket or bag you placed somewhere . No concert is worth your life . Better to read about an incident the next day than be counted as one of its statistics .

To be sure , all fire codes must be vigorously enforced , and club and concert hall operators must be held to the highest standards . A first step is banning indoor pyrotechnics in all but the largest , stadium-type venues .

In coming days , Rhode Islanders will follow the unfolding news from Brazil with a sense of queasy deja vu -- the rising body counts , the victim identification process , the grieving families , and the assigning -LRB- and dodging -RRB- of blame . If only they had learned from our tragedy .

Pyrotechnics , overcrowding , poor exits have contributed to tragic fires in recent years

You would think the world would have learned from past incidents , John Barylick says

Concertgoers have to be their own fire marshals , he says
