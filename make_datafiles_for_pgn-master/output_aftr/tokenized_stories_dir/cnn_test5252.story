Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Riot police fired warning shots and tear gas Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to keep hundreds of protesters away from the building 's perimeter , witnesses said .

The clashes came amid heightened tensions at U.S. diplomatic missions in the region following Tuesday 's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi , Libya , that left Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other consular officials dead .

About 500 protesters turned out Wednesday in Cairo to demonstrate against a film that mocks Islam 's prophet .

Wednesday night 's protest turned violent as demonstrators threw rocks and pushed through barbed wire fencing outside the embassy , according to Mahmoud . Two police trucks and a car were set afire .

`` Forces were able to push them down toward Tahrir Square farther from embassy street , '' Mahmoud said , adding that some arrests had been made .

More than a dozen people were injured in the clashes , which continued after midnight , said Khaled Khatib of the Health Ministry .

Earlier , Egypt 's president spoke in the `` strongest terms '' about Tuesday 's incident at the Cairo embassy -- but not against the attack .

WhiIe Egypt 's prime minister called Tuesday 's incident `` regrettable '' and unjustified , President Mohamed Morsy condemned the anti-Muslim film that incited the protesters .

The flag was adorned with white characters that read , `` There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger , '' a phrase often used by Islamic radicals .

Four protesters were arrested and were being questioned for `` going off track to what is accepted as peaceful protesting , '' said Interior Ministry spokesman Alla Mahmoud .

The Cairo incident was not nearly as bad as the violence in neighboring Libya , where an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi killed four Americans , including Stevens . The Libya attack has been blamed on a pro-al Qaeda group , according to sources tracking militant groups in the region .

It was unclear if the two attacks were coordinated . Protesters in both countries were upset over an online film that depicts Islam as a fraudulent religion and the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer , child molester and ruthless killer .

In his statement , Morsy called on Egyptian diplomats in Washington `` to take legal action against those people who seek to ruin relationships and discussions between people and countries . ''

Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt , telling them to avoid the demonstrations .

Frenzied protesters could be seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans .

Egypt 's Foreign Ministry pledged to protect embassies and warned of the protests ' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy .

Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street , where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to Mubarak .

`` These protests are a bad image for Egypt , '' said Ahmed , a Cairo street vendor . `` Of course I 'm against insulting Islam , but it 's the undereducated , poor people who are out here causing problems . ''

`` All I want for Egypt is security and stability , '' he said . `` And as you can see this is n't it . ''
