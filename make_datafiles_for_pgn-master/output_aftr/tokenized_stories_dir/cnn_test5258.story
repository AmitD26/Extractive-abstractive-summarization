-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The severity of the numerous injuries I sustained could have been fatal .

The most severe : getting the back of my skull crushed by the impact of the truck . I needed emergency brain surgery . My neurosurgeon had to remove part of my cerebellum because fragments of my skull had pierced it .

After the surgery , he said to my parents , `` I operated on him as if he had a chance . '' But my parents never doubted I had a chance .

After a two-month coma , I slowly came out of it , putting many doctors and the general medical profession in disbelief .

When a neurologist saw me for the first time , all I could do was move one finger on my right hand . He told my parents : `` I am optimistic that Ryan will gain enough strength in his right hand to type . '' This statement stuck with me throughout the years .

It 's been nine years since the accident and I still remember that statement every day . It helps me remember how wrong that neurologist was ; how I 've proved him wrong and how it motivates me to never let someone tell me what I can or can not do .

When people ask me about my story , I never get to fully say what I want to because there is just so much to it . I often leave out the incredible impact of family , faith and friends . Every day I was in a coma , my parents prayed for me and for it not to be my time , and to come back to them . They were so supportive throughout all of my recovery , as was the power of prayer and help from loving friends and the community .

When the accident first happened , my local church held a prayer service for me . The church normally holds 500 people . But that night , there was standing room only -- all for a 9-year-old boy .

When I was discharged from the hospital , friends and family from all over came together to help me by making giant get-well cards from various schools or having friends make dinner for us on a weekly basis . People that I did not even know expressed their concern for my well being from all around the country .
