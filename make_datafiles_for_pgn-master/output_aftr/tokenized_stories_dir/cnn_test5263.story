Jackson , Mississippi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of an African-American man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case .

Relatives of James Craig Anderson , who died shortly after receiving his injuries on June 26 , sent a letter with their request to the prosecutor in the case , Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith .

The letter states that the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious convictions .

`` Our opposition to the death penalty is deeply rooted in our religious faith , a faith that was central in James ' life as well , '' the letter states . But the family goes on to explain that there is another reason for their opposition , one that is tied to Mississippi 's racial past .

`` We also oppose the death penalty because it historically has been used in Mississippi and the South primarily against people of color for killing whites , '' the letter states . `` Executing James ' killers will not help to balance the scales . But sparing them may help to spark a dialogue that one day will lead to the elimination of capital punishment . ''

Anderson 's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the actual killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb . Smith , the district attorney , has called it `` vicious '' and a `` premeditated hate crime . ''

U.S. Department of Justice investigators are now in Jackson , investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors . The killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson , a city of nearly 540,000 people .

Deryl Dedmon Jr. , 19 , of Brandon , Mississippi , is facing murder charges in Anderson 's death and is eligible for the death penalty . A second teen , John Aaron Rice , 18 , was initially charged with murder , but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because Rice was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson .

The district attorney 's office has not officially commented on the family 's request for no death penalty in the case .

`` James Anderson lost his life for no other reason than the color of his skin , '' said Morris Dees , chief trial counsel for the law center . `` Those responsible must be held accountable for their callous and deadly actions . We are filing this lawsuit today to ensure his family gets a measure of justice . ''

In addition to Dedmon and Rice , the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident that evening : Sarah Graves of Crystal Springs ; Shelbie Richards of Pearl ; and William Kirk Montgomery , John Blaylock and Dylan Butler , all of Brandon . None of the five has been arrested or charged , and it was unclear whether they had retained attorneys .

Attorneys for Dedmon and Rice have not responded to requests for comment from CNN . During a bond hearing , Dedmon 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the `` racial allegations . ''

Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack , which took place after a night of drinking in largely white Rankin County outside Jackson . Dedmon told friends they should leave , saying , `` Let 's go fuck with some niggers , '' officials said .

The gang of teens climbed into Dedmon 's green truck and a white SUV and drove 16 miles to the western edge of Jackson . They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway , officials said . He was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp .

On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN , the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where Anderson is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible .

The teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson . Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson 's beating took place , as the teens yelled racial epithets , including `` white power . ''

At this moment , Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck .

`` Defendant Dedmon drove the F-250 out of the parking lot and turned right onto Ellis Avenue , '' the lawsuit says . `` Just as Dedmon turned right , his headlights shone directly on Anderson , who , having been severely beaten , was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel 's entrance . Dedmon accelerated , drove onto and over the street curb , and struck Anderson with the front of the F-250 . ''

`` He was not remorseful , '' District Attorney Smith said . `` He was laughing , laughing about the killing . ''

The proceedings of the case are taking place in the Hinds County courthouse , where in 1994 Byron de la Beckwith was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963 . That case and others have given Mississippi a racially charged history .
