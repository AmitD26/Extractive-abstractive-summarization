It 's not too early to learn the first few lessons from this continuing saga , which promises to deliver many more for weeks , probably months . Here is some of what we have learned -- and relearned -- so far :

Sadly , this is a lesson we see repeated time and time again , across national borders , destroying promising careers and even changing the course of history . Nothing , it seems , not even the highest IQs , the most exclusive security clearances , or the tangible risk of losing it all for the sake of a tryst will stop certain men from pursuing an illicit relationship . Yes , powerful women do it too , but the cases are rare .

News : The Petraeus scandal -- what we know so far

Gen. Petraeus , the most celebrated military officer of his generation , is the most recent addition to the list . We still do n't know what 's behind tens of thousands of pages of e-mails Gen. John Allen allegedly exchanged with a woman involved in the Petraeus scandal , and there 's the curious case of the FBI agent who reportedly sent shirtless pictures of himself to that same woman . We ca n't say yet which of these characters will join the melancholy list that includes John Edwards , Eliot Spitzer , Dominique Strauss-Kahn , Tiger Woods , Mark Sanford , Anthony Weiner , and on and on and on , each with an accompanying cast of heartbroken relatives .

2 . Anything you write in an e-mail can be used against you .

Nothing is private , especially not when it goes through Google -LRB- Gmail 's -RRB- hands . If America 's top spy , the head of the CIA , can get caught writing secret love letters to his girlfriend on Gmail , nobody 's e-mails are safe . Petraeus and his clandestine girlfriend , Paula Broadwell , took some troubles to keep their illicit correspondence safe . They reportedly relied on a trick used by some al Qaeda operatives . They left messages to each other in the drafts folder of an account , the password to which they both knew , thinking they would remain for their eyes only . But it did n't work .

3 . The FBI can investigate practically anyone in the U.S. , even the director of Central Intelligence .

That 's a stunning notion to contemplate , and it says both good and bad things about America . First the good : No one is above reproach , not even a man whose power is vast and often elaborately concealed . In fact , if you ask the world 's great conspiracy theorists , they will tell you the CIA can do anything , anywhere , at any time . But its boss got found out by his own country 's law enforcement gumshoes . That 's amazing .

4 . Americans are deeply torn about the question of private morality and the public sphere .

There is a nagging sense that the Petraeus case may have cost the United States the service of an uncommonly talented man for no good reason . We do n't know all there is to know , and there is a possibility that this is a matter of compromised national security , in which case the invasion of privacy , the destruction of personal lives , and the painful intrusion into the deepest emotional recesses of several families ' worlds , could ultimately prove justified .

Until more is known , the rest of the world is shaking its head at what could be another baffling case of American puritanism .

Zakaria : Why Petraeus will be missed

5 . A salacious sex scandal will push everything off the top of the rundown or the front page , especially when the most immediate next challenge is the `` fiscal cliff , '' a dry and arcane topic that will cause most people to change the channel or turn the page .

That 's one reason we know this strange and twisting case , already involving such a complicated and unlikely cast of characters , will continue to garner enormous attention for a long , long time .

She says anything you write in an e-mail is not really private ; the FBI can look if it so chooses
