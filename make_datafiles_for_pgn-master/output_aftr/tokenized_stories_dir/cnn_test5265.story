-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While the rest of the world last week was fixating on the chimney atop the Sistine Chapel , waiting to see whether the smoke would be black or white , it was n't the smoke that intrigued me .

The ballots , of course , were made of paper .

Had the cardinals voted on iPads , they could n't very well have tossed the sleek tablets into the chapel 's cast-iron stove .

Yet an all-but-paperless society is where some experts argue we are headed . The digital upheaval has gathered such force that every business that once depended on paper has felt the earth shift . Newspapers , magazine publishers , book companies , bookstores , offices of every kind ... the transition to digital is beginning to feel as profound as the revolution once ushered in by the invention of moveable type .

The Minneapolis Star Tribune recently noted the precipitous decline of the North American paper industry : `` River towns in the forest from eastern Washington to the coast of Maine have lost more than 100 paper mills in a wave of consolidation in little more than a decade ... North American demand for three types of -LSB- coated -RSB- paper -LSB- has -RSB- fallen 21 percent . '' The Boston Business Journal last year quoted equity analyst Matt Arnold : `` There 's a secular shift to paperless . It 's an overarching mind-set . ''

All of this echoes a 2011 projection by the research firm RISI , which advises the global forest products industry : `` By 2015 , most publishing paper end uses in North America , such as magazine , newspaper and book publishing , will fall 12-21 percent , compared to their 2010 levels . '' The firm went on to project `` another 40-50 percent fall over the next 15 years . ''

Thus , there is a special fascination to a promotional campaign developed in recent years by Domtar , one of the world 's largest manufacturers of paper . The campaign is not just for Domtar products -- it is for paper itself , no matter where it comes from or who sells it . The theme is : `` Paper Because . ''

`` Paper is good . Pass it on . ''

`` Paper means that you mean business . ''

`` Paper is personal . ''

I hasten to say that I 'm not knocking those messages -- I agree with every word of them .

I just find it illuminating , and more than a little melancholy , that we have reached the point at which those messages are deemed necessary -- the point at which the paper industry feels a need to convince people that paper is important .

It would have been like running promotional campaigns for air , or for water . Such things did not need promotion -- they were indispensable .

But there 's something about paper . I 'm currently about halfway through a copy of Time magazine , cover date September 25 , 1950 -LRB- yes , I 'm a little behind on my reading , but I 'm slowly catching up -RRB- . I 'll often buy old magazines not just because I find them to be a wonderful way to delve randomly into America 's history at precise moments in time , but also because , at the end of a day spent staring at shifting , constantly updating images on multiple screens , there is something calming about holding carefully laid out and edited sheets of paper , and luxuriating in the steadiness of it all .

But as magazines and newspapers and books and business offices and schools make their inexorable leap into the digital future , there 's nothing wrong with acknowledging just how nice the tactile , comforting , here-when-you-want-me world of words and pictures on paper has been , even while recognizing and appreciating the marvels of the new way .

I 'm very glad that you 've found your way to these words on whatever screen you may be reading them , and I do n't think any of us are fooling ourselves into thinking the paper-to-digital course will suddenly be reversed . To use a phrase connected to another once-ubiquitous part of our daily lives : That train has left the station .

`` Hi . I 'm paper . Remember me ? ''
