-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On January 6 , 1367 , at the Abbey of St. Andrew in Bordeaux , a royal baby was born . It was a boy . His father was the Prince of Wales , Edward of Woodstock -LRB- known to history as the Black Prince -RRB- . His mother was a fabulously glamorous princess called Joan of Kent .

Richard of Bordeaux 's birth was a moment of broad international interest . It mattered to the French , with whom the English were engaged in the Hundred Years War . It mattered in what we now call Spain , where the Black Prince was waging a brutal military campaign . It mattered to the other dignitaries of Europe . Richard 's baptism was attended by three monarchs : Jaime IV , king of Mallorca ; Richard , king of Armenia ; and Pedro , the deposed king of Castile . In short , insofar as a medieval royal birth could be a world news event , this was .

Cohen : How to raise a royal baby

There were rolling news crews from all over the world , beaming back to every inch of the globe pictures of ... well , of rolling news crews from all over the world . They knocked shoulders with tourists and well-wishers , who ranged from idle passersby to devoted monarchists wanting to drop off gifts for mother and baby . A few actual patients of the hospital leaned in doorways or rolled around in wheelchairs , looking bemused . It was a sweaty , heaving scrum .

` Wicked ' author : Royal baby stands for hope

I ca n't speak for the rest of the world , but in Britain it is fairly easy to analyze our own continuing fascination with , and popular enthusiasm for , the monarchy . Trite as it is to say , the royal family is a living link with our national history . Our history is built -- or taught , at any rate -- around reigns and dynasties . Our wonky constitution has largely evolved around the monarchy , from Magna Carta in 1215 to this year 's Succession To The Crown Act , which provides -LRB- now , it seems , unnecessarily -RRB- , for a girl to inherit royal power on equal standing in precedence to a younger brother .

And then , of course , we secretly recognize that the royal family is virtually the only surviving relic of the rigid class system of the British past . Even if -LRB- most of us -RRB- do n't miss it in practice , there is a shared snobbish pride among swathes of the conservative middle Britain in being able to present ourselves to the world as a land of ranks and titles , blue blood and high birth , a nation that still has a nonsensical strain of privilege at its heart .

Opinion : Baby helps make a monarchy better

The very fact that this seems to fly in the face of every liberal credo of our times -- equality , democracy , meritocracy , openness , transparency , fairness -- only makes it more delicious . There is something medieval at the core of modern Britain , and I think we rather like the fact that the whole world is still prepared to sit up and celebrate it .

He asks : Why , when Windsors have so little sway now , does a birth still captivate world ?

Jones : Monarchy like reality show ; a tie to old class system . Brits jazzed that world cares
