Lech Walesa , the man who led Poland to freedom in its Cold War struggle with the Soviet Bloc , is refusing to apologize for suggesting gay Polish politicians should `` sit behind a wall '' in the country 's parliament .

The former Polish president and Nobel Peace Prize winner provoked uproar in Poland when he told a television reporter Friday night that as a minority , gays have no right to a prominent position in politics , and should sit perhaps at the rear of parliament of or even `` behind a wall . ''

A devout Catholic and father of eight children , Walesa now says he has nothing to apologize for despite a mountain of criticism heaped upon a man who was once venerated as a champion of Polish liberty . He stressed he did not `` feel homophobic . ''

`` I will not apologize to anyone , '' the former president said in an interview Monday . `` All I said -LRB- was -RRB- that minorities , which I respect , should not have the right to impose their views on the majority . I think most of Poland is behind me . ''

Others have called for called for Walesa to return his Nobel prize , while the Committee for the Defense Against Sects and Violence filed a formal complaint with prosecutors in Walesa 's hometown of Gdansk , accusing him of promoting a `` propaganda of hate against a sexual minority . ''

Along with damaging his reputation , the controversy could also have a painful effect on Walesa 's career .
