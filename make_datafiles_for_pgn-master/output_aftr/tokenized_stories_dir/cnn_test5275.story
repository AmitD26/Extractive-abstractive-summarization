-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Unsolicited text messages from scammers , companies and political campaigns are illegal and annoying . But at least now they 're easier to report .

I just tested it . Here 's how it works :

I first reported as spam a text message I received from the Mitt Romney presidential campaign . -LRB- To be clear , the Romney campaign did not spam me . I voluntarily signed up to receive its text updates . However , I had to test this spam reporting service with somebody 's text message , and I doubt that one spam report would do Romney much harm . -RRB-

OK , this might sound like the new spam reporting service did n't really do anything -- but actually it probably did the right thing . In the United States , any texting campaign that uses a shortcode has to obey strict rules . One of those rules is that if you reply `` stop '' to any message that came from a shortcode , it has to stop sending you messages .

Many mobile users do n't know this , so this is a good reminder first to try to unsubscribe . And also , it verifies that my test did n't do Romney 's campaign any harm .

After I got Verizon 's acknowledgment of my spam report and sent it the full 10-digit phone number of the spam sender , the system responded : `` Thank you , we appreciate your assistance . '' It also offered Verizon 's instructions for blocking text messages from a specific number .

This spam reporting service apparently does n't tell you whether any action was taken against the spammer you reported . So it 's a little unsatisfying in that regard . Also , this service is new , so it 's unclear so far what kind of difference it might make in the fight against spam texts .

However , forwarding spam texts to an easy-to-remember shortcode is a simple thing to do . So it might be a good idea to try using this service to report any spam texts that you receive . Let 's hope it helps .
