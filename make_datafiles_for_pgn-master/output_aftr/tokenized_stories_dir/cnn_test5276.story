-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just days after `` Titanic '' director James Cameron traveled to the bottom of the sea , another wealthy adventurer has announced a spectacular deep ocean discovery .

`` I 'm excited to report that , using state-of-the-art deep sea sonar , the team has found the Apollo 11 engines lying 14,000 feet below the surface , and we 're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor , '' the billionaire investor and entrepreneur wrote .

Bezos said that watching that original mission as a 5-year-old in 1969 inspired him to dream big , and now he wants to undertake the huge challenge of pulling the engines up .

After doing their work , the rockets plummeted into the ocean , where they have been undiscovered for four decades . NASA had some clues as to where they landed , and a piece of the debris landed on a German merchant ship , providing more clues .

But bringing them up will be a challenge . `` If all five are still clumped together , it will be like trying to bring up the big part of the Titanic , '' Pearlman said .

Still , it 's not the first time a lost piece of the space race era has been found . NASA 's Mercury 7 space capsule piloted by Gus Grissom was found and recovered in 1999 .

Just this week James Cameron took a solo dive to the deepest part of the ocean , while Sir Richard Branson used millions to fund his attempts to travel around the globe in a balloon .

`` But that fits into the way he does business , '' Pearlman said , noting Bezos ' other venture into space flight , Blue Origins , which aims to make human space flight cheaper and easier . `` Bezos and that Blue Origins have always played their cards very close to their chest and often do n't share their milestones until after they have succeeded . ''

But profits do n't seem to be behind Bezos ' quest to find the F-1 engines . The rocket engines remain property of NASA and the U.S. government , and Bezos wrote that he would like to pull the engines to the surface and then have NASA put them on display at a museum in Seattle .

`` It 's hard to imagine getting two investors to get in a bidding war at auction over them , '' said Pearlman .
