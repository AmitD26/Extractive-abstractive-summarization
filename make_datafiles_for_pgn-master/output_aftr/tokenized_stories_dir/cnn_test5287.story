London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Miranda , the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald , won a partial victory in his legal action against the Metropolitan Police Thursday , but the judge left a loophole that allows the police to continue investigating the materials they seized from him on Sunday .

Miranda , a Brazilian citizen , spent nearly nine hours in detention Sunday being questioned under a provision of Britain 's terrorism laws , after he was stopped as he changed planes on his way home from Berlin to Brazil .

Authorities confiscated Miranda 's electronic equipment , including his mobile phone , laptop , memory sticks , smart watch , DVDs and games consoles .

The High Court order says that the inspection , copying , disclosure , transfer and distribution of the materials seized must cease , save for the purpose of protecting national security and for the purpose of investigating whether the claimant is a person who is , or has been , connected with terrorism .

The Metropolitan Police said it is pleased that the High Court `` rejected an attempt to prevent further examination '' of the seized material .

Jonathan Laidlaw , a lawyer representing the Metropolitan Police , told the court a criminal investigation has been launched following inspection of the material seized from Miranda .

`` Initial examination of material seized has identified highly sensitive material , the disclosure of which could put lives at risk , '' police said . `` As a result the Counter Terrorism Command ... has today begun a criminal investigation . This investigation is at an early stage and we are not prepared to discuss it in any further detail at this stage . ''

Speaking outside court , Miranda 's lawyer Gwendolen Morgan , of the law firm Bindmans , described the ruling as a partial victory .

Miranda and his legal team will decide whether to appeal the ruling after the court provides its full reasoning , she said .

Bindmans , which was hired by The Guardian to represent Miranda , filed the case to seek recovery of Miranda 's property and prevent the government from inspecting the items or sharing what data it may have already gleaned from them .

Miranda ` afraid ' during questioning

`` The purpose of these proceedings is to protect the confidentiality of the sensitive journalistic material that was seized from the Claimant . Confidentiality , once lost , can clearly never be restored , '' she said .

The British government has defended its actions in Miranda 's case , saying it has a duty to ensure national security .

The Metropolitan Police have called what happened `` legally and procedurally sound '' and said it came after `` a detailed decision-making process . ''

Evidence of pressure from prime minister

New evidence emerged Wednesday that the pressure placed on The Guardian over its reporting on information leaked by Snowden came from the highest levels of government .

Rusbridger said the official has now been identified as Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood , and that he first contacted him in mid-June .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , who heads the Liberal Democrats , Cameron 's coalition partners , considered the authorities ' request `` reasonable , '' his office said .

â € ª `` The Deputy Prime Minister felt this was a preferable approach to taking legal action , '' according to a statement issued Wednesday evening . `` He was keen to protect the Guardian 's freedom to publish , whilst taking the necessary steps to safeguard security . ''

He and Greenwald told CNN 's Anderson Cooper of their distress and anger about his treatment at Heathrow Airport .
