When Liz Cheney announced her intention to become the next senator from Wyoming this year , she likely evoked voters ' memories of her father , Dick Cheney , the former vice president .

The same is true for two politicians in Georgia . Both the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter will be on the 2014 ballot in the Peach State . Michelle Nunn is running for U.S. Senate , while state Sen. Jason Carter has launched a bid for governor -- jobs her father and his grandfather , respectively , once held .

`` For their constituents and the American public , those names are a proven quantity , and as time goes on , you see that Americans look back at the history of our political system , and things seem better in hindsight , '' said Dan Mahaffee of the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress . `` It harkens back to a more collegial political era . ''

Candidates and family heritage

All over the country , candidates with such familiar names are either running for re-election or jumping into races and using their families ' vast networks to anchor nascent campaigns .

• Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is running for her state 's open U.S. Senate seat . Her father , Arch A. Moore Jr. , was governor of West Virginia for 12 years .

• Sen. Mary Landrieu is running for re-election in Louisiana . Her father , `` Moon '' Landrieu , was once mayor of New Orleans and a brother , Mitch Landrieu , is now the city 's mayor .

• Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey is running for re-election . A member of one of the most dominant political families in the United States , Frelinghuysen can trace his roots back to four U.S. senators and Frederick Frelinghuysen , one of New Jersey 's delegates to the Continental Congress .

• Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado , the son of a former congressman , is running for re-election . And so is a cousin , Tom Udall of New Mexico , also a U.S. senator .

A ` ready-made Rolodex '

`` A politician 's kid grows up hearing all kinds of awful things about Mom or Dad , and they learn that 's not the end of the world , '' he said . `` Toughness matters in politics . ''

Mahaffee added , `` You are almost born with a ready-made Rolodex . ''

American dynasties from the early years on

The Republican Tafts have long dominated Ohio politics , boasting three U.S. senators , a president , a governor and countless local positions . The Democratic Kennedy family has dominated politics in New England -- with a president , three presidential candidates , three senators , multiple congressmen and dozens of local elected positions .

A 2012 study of the Kennedys ' political dominance by the University of Minnesota found the family has logged more than 92 years in congressional service , a number that does n't even count Joseph P. Kennedy III 's recent term as a representative from Massachusetts .

Then there are the obvious political families : the Bushes and Clintons . Between 1980 and 2008 , a member of one of these families was either president or vice president .

Bush and Clinton `` fatigue '' has even become a common term as speculation grows about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both eyeing a run at the presidency in 2016 .

Some political watchers said the continuity these families bring can be comforting to voters , but the public also can sour on candidates who see themselves as anointed successors to their families ' political power .

Mahaffee , however , said the idea that voters are sick of political families is dispelled by the fact that so many of them exist . Do voters occasionally get sick of one family ? Yes , he said . But on the whole , such a history is a good thing for candidates , he said .
