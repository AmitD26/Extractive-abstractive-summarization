The Boston Marathon bombings in April , however , serve as a reminder that the United States still faces a terrorism threat from disaffected U.S. citizens and residents who are influenced by al Qaeda 's ideology .

The good news is that the number of `` homegrown '' jihadist extremists who have been indicted or convicted has steadily declined over the past few years , according to New America Foundation data . Where there were 41 cases in 2009 , there have been six so far this year .

In recent years , extremists plotting attacks against the United States have also shown little , if any , connection to foreign groups . None of the 21 homegrown extremists involved in plots against the United States from 2011 to so far in 2013 is known to have received training abroad .

Of these extremists , only one , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , one of the alleged Boston bombers , is reported to have had contact with foreign militant operatives , but it remains unclear to what extent , if any , those contacts played a role in the Boston attack .

This lack of coordination between domestic extremists and overseas groups is likely the result of two factors . First , the ability of terrorist organizations to coordinate with extremists in the United States has been reduced by policing efforts inside the country and counterterrorism operations abroad .

Of the 45 `` homegrown '' jihadist extremists who were indicted , convicted or killed from 2011 to now , 18 are known to have communicated with other extremists over the Internet or posted materials related to their radicalization online .

The shift to plotting by individuals who lack ties to foreign groups poses a distinct type of threat -- plots and attacks that are more difficult to detect but are also likely to be of a smaller scale . And because of the measures now in place to prevent the acquisition of precursor chemicals and materials suitable for making conventional explosives , homegrown extremists have also often struggled to produce effective bombs .

Before the Boston Marathon bombings , homegrown jihadists in the United States had shown little success at producing explosives . Joseph Jeffrey Brice -- who has professed admiration for Osama bin laden and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh -- almost killed himself in April 2010 when a homemade bomb he was constructing exploded prematurely .

A month later , Faisal Shahzad 's car bomb failed to explode in Times Square , even though he had received explosives training in Pakistan .

While the number of terrorism-related indictments fell between 2009 and 2013 , the number of terrorist incidents has stayed about the same -- about one per year -- though not all of them have been lethal :

-- In June 2009 , Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad killed a soldier outside a recruiting station in Little Rock , Arkansas .

-- Five months later , Major Nidal Malik Hasan shot and killed 13 people at Fort Hood in Killeen , Texas .

-- Yonathan Melaku 's drive-by shooting of military facilities in Northern Virginia in 2011 produced no casualties .

-- The Boston Marathon bombers killed four and wounded hundreds of others in April 2013 .

The incidents carried out by homegrown extremists continue to be limited in their lethality , and major operations such as the 9/11 attacks are well beyond the skills of even the most capable domestic extremists .

According to a count by the New America Foundation , since 2001 , 13 extremists motivated by right-wing ideologies , one left-wing militant and two individuals with idiosyncratic motives have deployed , acquired or tried to acquire chemical , biological or radiological weapons .

Noncommunity members provided useful reports of suspicious activity in another 9 % of homegrown extremist cases , while an informant or undercover agent monitored almost half of all homegrown extremists .

Looking forward , a concern about the Boston attack is whether it represents an intelligence failure that could have been avoided through a better implementation of existing policies or a new trend where `` lone wolf '' extremism is largely undetectable with the existing systemic checks in place .
