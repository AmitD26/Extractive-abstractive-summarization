Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides .

Meanwhile , as much as 10 feet of additional snow is on tap for the Sierra Nevada , doubling the amount that 's fallen in an epic storm on the cusp of the winter solstice .

High winds also whipped much of the state , particularly at high elevations . Peak wind gusts reached 152 mph in Alpine Meadows summit in northern California , the Weather Service reported .

Mudslides forced officials to close a portion of State Route 1 , also known as the Pacific Coast Highway , in Ventura County from just north of the Los Angeles County line to Oxnard , according to the California Department of Transportation . The Pacific Coast Highway was also closed north of Santa Barbara due to flooding .

`` A serious situation will develop now with the mudslide danger that will continue over the next several days , '' Cabrera said Monday .

The rain was expected to diminish Monday but intensify once again Tuesday night and Wednesday , according to the National Weather Service . Yet another storm is forecast for Christmas night .

A winter storm warning remained in effect through Monday afternoon for California 's Sierra Nevada , from Yosemite to Kings Canyon , according to the National Weather Service .

Forecasters said travel into the high country of the southern Sierra Nevada could be difficult , if not impossible .

Mammoth Lakes , California , got almost 9 feet of snow in less than 24 hours , according to Cabrera .

`` We get a lot of snow here but not usually this much in a 24-hour period , '' said Butner , a hairstylist who 's also a CNN iReporter . `` The decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them , '' and there 's flooding at the end of the neighborhood , she said .

`` We 're getting a couple inches an hour as of now , '' she said late Monday morning .

CNN 's Nick Valencia and Michael Martinez contributed to this report .
