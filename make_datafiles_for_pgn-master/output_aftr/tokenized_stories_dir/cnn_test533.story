`` He was embarrassed , '' he told the station .

Now , his son does n't want anything to do with Christmas .

Michael Rougier said the teacher called his wife to apologize , but that 's not enough .

`` He needs to be fired , '' Rougier told KOAT . `` For him to make a comment like that , there has to be at a minimum prejudice in him , and we do n't have room for that . ''

Kim Vesely , the director of Rio Rancho Public Schools , released a statement to media about the incident .

The boy 's family has asked that he be moved out of the teacher 's class , and the school has complied , Vesely said .

The teacher 's remark came amid something of a dust-up over Santa 's skin color after Fox News Channel picked up on a Slate.com writer 's piece questioning the mythical character 's ethnicity .

Writer Aisha Harris , who is black , wrote about growing up wondering why Santa was depicted as a white man , and argued for something less definitive : a penguin .

Harris said Kelly 's comments are part of the reason she felt the need to provoke thought about Santa 's race .

`` To me , -LRB- it -RRB- just spoke to the reason why I wrote the piece , is that there are a lot of people out there who automatically assume that Santa must be white and there 's no way -- it 's laughable that he could be anything else , '' Harris said Sunday on CNN 's `` Reliable Sources . ''

`` The point I was trying to make was that I think that we have , the world has changed a lot over the last 50 , 100 years , and Santa Claus is a fictional character , '' Harris continued .

Kelly shot back at her critics , telling them to get a sense of humor .

`` Humor is what we try to bring to this show , but that 's lost on the humorless , '' she said Friday on `` The Kelly File . ''

`` We continually see St. Nick as a white man in modern-day America , '' Kelly continued . `` Should that change ? Well , that debate got lost because so many could n't get past the fact that I acknowledged , as Harris did , that the most commonly depicted image of Santa , does , in fact , have white skin . ''

`` I thought it was beautifully done , '' Gingrich said .

Reality check

'' -LRB- St. -RRB- Nick was Greek . The last time I checked , Greeks were n't black , '' Donohue told CNN 's Don Lemon on The 11th Hour .

According to the St. Nicholas Center , which says it 's dedicated to `` discovering the truth about Santa Claus , '' St. Nicholas was indeed Greek and lived about 1,700 years ago in an area that is now southern Turkey .

But author Reza Aslan said he does n't think many Greek people would be accurately portrayed as the `` rosy-cheeked Santa that we 're all used to . ''

Amy Holmes , anchor of `` The Hot List '' at TheBlaze.com , acknowledged that most depictions of Santa feature a white man .
