-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British Prime Minister David Cameron has given Sri Lanka a March 2014 deadline to hold an independent international inquiry into alleged war crimes during the country 's 26-year civil war .

The summit opened Friday amid concerns about the rights situation after Sri Lanka 's war with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , which ended in 2009 . The prime ministers of Canada , Mauritius and India opted not to attend .

He said he made it clear to Rajapaksa that he had `` a real opportunity , through magnanimity and reform , to build a successful , inclusive and prosperous future for his country . ''

Among the steps needed to achieve this were `` credible , transparent and independent investigations into alleged war crimes , '' Cameron said .

`` And let me be very clear . If that investigation is not completed by March , then I will use our position on the U.N. Human Rights Council to work with the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner and call for a full , credible and independent international inquiry . ''

Cameron said his meeting with the president was `` very frank '' and `` nothing was off the agenda . ''

`` President Rajapaksa , in response , explained that an enormous amount of work has been done in terms of resettlement , rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure destroyed during the conflict . In order to reach consensus on political matters a Parliamentary Special Committee -LRB- PSC -RRB- has been established for all parties concerned to air their views and reach a settlement , '' it said .

`` It 's a very holistic , very comprehensive , very impartial report . It had over 5,000 hearings , and it 's set within the principle of international humanitarian law , incorporating the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality . ''

Independent judiciary ?

As many as 70,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka 's war . In its final stage , which lasted from September 2008 to May 2009 , the Sri Lankan army advanced into an area of the north where about 330,000 people were trapped by fighting .

A U.N. report in 2011 said the government used `` large-scale and widespread shelling '' that left a large number of civilians dead .

The number of civilian deaths and injuries are unknown to this day , and U.N. figures greatly differ from those in reports from Sri Lanka 's government and various nongovernmental organizations .

`` Since the end of the armed conflict , the Sri Lankan government has been systematically dismantling checks and balances on independent justice institutions , '' co-chair Helena Kennedy said in a statement .

`` The IBAHRI considers that the lack of an independent judiciary will prevent the Sri Lankan legal system from providing an effective investigation into war crimes and human rights violations committed by government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam at the end of the armed conflict in 2009 .
