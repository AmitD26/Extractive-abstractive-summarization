Some 750 firefighters were battling the blaze , which was 5 % contained late Thursday . With the help of helicopters and air tankers , they established a loose perimeter .

The fire 's evacuation area was 93,000 acres , affecting approximately 38,000 people and 13,000 homes , and the flames were estimated to have burned through 15,700 acres , said Maketa .

That marked a dramatic increase from the 8,500 acres officials said had been burned by Wednesday night , he noted .

`` Wind is probably our No. 1 threat , '' the sheriff said . Combined with dry brush and high temperatures , the winds have fanned devastating flames .

`` If it 's a draw , that 's a victory today because we have n't had too many draws in the last couple of days , '' he said .

` The flames were there '

`` We literally had five minutes , and we left because it was , the flames were there , '' Jaenette Coyne told CNN 's AC360 Thursday night .

She said she grabbed a baby album and a personal computer with pictures on it . She also took a firebox , which contained most of the couple 's important documents .

`` It was probably the worst thing I 've ever seen in my life . You have that moment where you say : ` Is that really my house ? ' But we know it was . However , now I 'm grateful that I know . A lot of people here just do n't know , '' Jaenette Coyne said .

In northeast Colorado Springs , CNN iReporter Heather Croze took photos outside her home , capturing a billowing plume of smoke . One shot shows just how wide the smoke was on the horizon .

A county fairground northeast of the Black Forest Fire looked like a Noah 's Ark with families who fled with their animals to escape the looming inferno .

At least eight families also have taken refuge at the Elbert County Fairgrounds in Kiowa , the Denver Post reported , which is about 35 miles southeast of Denver .

Paula Warren , one of thousands of residents forced to flee her home northeast of Colorado Springs , spoke about how difficult it was to leave and wonder if her home was all right .

`` I thought I had about an hour , and it turned out to be about 20 minutes , '' she said . `` I had a pillowcase full of socks , and that 's basically all I have . ''

By Thursday afternoon , she got bad news . A friend called her to say that her home was on an online list of residences that had been designated as destroyed . Warren did n't know exactly where the friend had seen the information but she believed it to be true .

Her home sat on five acres and she does n't think the land has been damaged . `` Trees are still standing , '' she said .

The animals have adjusted fairly well , she said .

`` You ca n't just take 'em to a Motel 6 , '' she said . `` And my friend is very tolerant . ''

His wife , Caml Schultz , said their family was able to save only some photographs , paperwork and few items of clothes .

`` But we have each other , and we 're blessed . So many people have suffered loss , and so we 're just thankful that we 're here and safe and that we 're loved , and that we have so many people that are willing to help take care of us , '' she said .

Working to protect homes

Sheriff Maketa praised the swift and strong help that civilian workers have been getting from National Guard and other military responders . Authorities said that they are watching neighborhoods and homes to do everything they can to keep them safe while combating the blaze .

Still , there have been losses .

Rose , the El Paso County spokesman , stressed later that those figures were preliminary , and said he would expect them to increase .

`` There are areas of the Black Forest that we have not been able to get into at all to make any sort of assessment . So it 's almost impossible to come up with another number , but it is safe to assume that that number will in fact rise , '' he said .

Ken Litch , a 12-year resident of the area , watched Wednesday as the Black Forest Fire gained ground on his home . There was n't much else he could do .

Another major fire in the state is the Royal Gorge Fire , which is burning 55 miles to the southwest , on the other side of Colorado Springs .

It burned several buildings around the iconic Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge , and threatened the bridge itself .

Authorities downgraded the number of acres burned from 3,800 to 3,100 late Wednesday . The wildfire was 20 % contained , the state office of emergency management reported . Twenty structures have been lost to the flames .

The famous Royal Gorge Bridge that spans the Arkansas River is intact but needs to be inspected before it can reopen for tourists , a spokeswoman for the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park said .

`` We did not know until today whether the bridge was still standing , '' Gorge Bridge and Park spokeswoman Peggy Gair said .

There were other fires in the state as well , including in Grand and Huerfano counties . Black Forest was the biggest of the blazes .
