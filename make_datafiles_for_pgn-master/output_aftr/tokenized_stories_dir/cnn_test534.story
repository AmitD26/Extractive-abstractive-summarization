He is skilled at the `` throw-down , '' a move that gets you on a skateboard at near full speed .

M.J. Rahimi has mastered some of the world 's most popular skateboarding tricks .

`` I 'm very happy I 'm making skateboards , '' Rahimi said . `` My biggest dream is to make a skateboard and have a professional skate on it . ''

Rahimi says his first homemade board shattered into pieces but he kept at it when the sport started picking up popularity several years ago . Demand for affordable equipment picked up too .

`` When I first started , my dad said it will never work , but now he supports me , '' he says .

Rahimi reveals his plan is to create an affordable brand . He hopes to sell his boards at the growing number of skate shops in the Islamic Republic where trendy teenagers shop for the latest gear .

According to skate store owner Ali Reza Ansari , business is brisk . `` We are doing our best to improve skateboarding here , '' Ansari said . `` We have really good skaters here -LRB- in Tehran -RRB- . ''

Ever since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , the leadership here in Iran has been wary of the spread and influence of western culture .

In the future some may even ride Rahimi 's boards -- a product that takes pride in being made in a basement in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
