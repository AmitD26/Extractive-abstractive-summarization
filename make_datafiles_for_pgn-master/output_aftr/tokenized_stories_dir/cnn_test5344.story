-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in the Champions League Group D match at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday night .

City had looked dead and buried inside the first 15 minutes as Bayern raced into a 2-0 lead . Thomas Muller opened the scoring after five minutes sliding home a low left-foot shot past City keeper Joe Hart .

Seven minutes later , Mario Gotze doubled the lead capitalizing on a dithering City defense to fire home from six yards following a corner kick .

But the tide started to turn against a rampant Bayern just before the half-hour mark as David Silva slid in to score after James Milner had headed the ball into the six-yard area .

Three minutes later , Milner capped a memorable night for City and himself with a low , side-foot drive past the despairing hands of Neuer .

`` To come here and put in that performance gives us a lot of belief for the next round . ''

City 's win takes them level on 15 points with Bayern but the German champions finish first on account of their superior goal difference .

Group C winners , Paris Saint Germain suffered their first loss in this year 's Champions League campaign going down down 2-1 to Benfica at the Stadium of Light .

Turkey and snow are a perfect combination for many people around the world at this time of year , but it certainly was n't the case for Galatasaray and Juventus on Tuesday night .

Neither players , nor fans will be feeling very festive after the abandonment of their crucial Group B match after 32 minutes following a snowstorm in Istanbul .

As the pitch markings disappeared under a blanket of snow , Portuguese referee Pedro Proenca ordered both teams off to allow ground staff to clear the lines with shovels . But their efforts proved to no avail and the game was called off a short time later .

The match will resume on Wednesday at 12 pm GMT , UEFA said in a statement .

Galatasaray need to beat Juventus to join group winners Real Madrid in the last 16 . Los Blancos finished with 16 points after a 2-0 win against FC Copenhagen at the Parken Stadium .
