-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Genuine . Funny . The type of guy who 'd give you the shirt off his back .

`` It is just going to be a huge hole in everybody 's lives for him and his family . He 'd give you the shirt off his back if he needed to , '' Joseph Trapani told CNN affiliate WFTS .

They were on a lunch and movie date , WFTS reported . Her friends said that Oulson 's wife had taken off from work to spend the day with her husband during time off from his job .

She works for USAA selling insurance , while Oulson did financial work for SKY Powersports in Port Richey , the affiliate said .

At the movies , a confrontation arose between Oulson and a 71-year-old retired police officer when Oulson sent a text message during previews to his young daughter , police said . The former officer , Curtis Reeves , told Oulson to put away his cell phone , and a subsequent dispute ended when Reeves allegedly shot Oulson .

`` She 's a wreck . I mean she just lost her husband , the father of her little girl over something that should have never happened , '' WFTS reported Trapani said .

Reeves , a former Tampa Police Department officer , has been charged with second-degree murder . He was denied bond during his first court appearance Tuesday .

Oulson rode dirt bikes , loved boating , and was a motor cross enthusiast . He was a devoted father and husband .

A sensational crime that strikes many chords
