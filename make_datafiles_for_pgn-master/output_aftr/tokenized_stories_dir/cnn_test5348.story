London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Their crime was one of shocking brutality . Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale first ran down soldier Lee Rigby in a car , then hacked him to death in a frenzied machete and knife attack .

Confronted with gory closed-circuit TV footage , grueling witness testimony and Adebolajo 's own defense that he had `` no choice '' in Rigby 's killing , as he was `` a soldier of Allah , '' the jury took only 90 minutes to convict both defendants of his murder . They were cleared of the attempted murder of a police officer .

Adebolajo was the only one to give evidence in court . He denied the charges of murder and attempted murder of a police officer , on the grounds that he had acted from religious conviction . He converted to Islam in 2002 to 2003 , while at a university , and adopted an Islamic name , Mujahid Abu Hamza .

`` I am a soldier of Allah , '' he told the jury . `` It is a war between Islam and those militaries that intervene in Muslim lands . ''

Adebowale , who did not take the stand , converted to Islam more recently , in 2008 to 2009 .

A closer look at their backgrounds reveals that both were already known to police and that both showed earlier signs of radicalization .

In a news briefing , Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick said police had had contact with the two men , as both victims and offenders , over a number of years -- in Adebowale 's case for drug offenses , and in Adebolajo 's case for a handful of incidents involving violent crime .

Both men also participated in a protest in 2012 .

On the witness stand , Adebolajo said he attended demonstrations but was not specific , describing them as a way `` to let off steam . ''

He said he had listened to speeches by Anjem Choudary , a controversial British Muslim cleric , but did not agree with him . `` I think he is a good man , however he encourages his followers that jihad in this country is not allowed at this moment , '' he said .

Little extremist material was presented to the court as evidence , although materials on `` martyrdom '' were found in Adebowale 's home in Greenwich , southeast London .

Dick , who watched tapes of police interviews with Adebowale , described a `` troubled young man '' who `` was very changeable , emotional and many times very aggressive . He did spit at officers and several times this required restraint . ''

There were some indications that Adebowale was associated with a street gang in 2008 , she said .

Adebolajo also told jurors he was against British foreign policy but did not believe his Islamic views led him onto the path he had taken .

`` Even before I became Muslim , I did not agree with foreign policy , '' he said , then describing an early memory of watching the Iraq war on television .

'' ` Operation Shock and Awe ' -- I saw it unfold on BBC and CNN what not , and I was disgusted , you know . It was reported as if it was praiseworthy , '' he said . `` I knew that every one of those bombs was killing someone . I was disgusted . ''

Adebolajo , who is married with six children , said in his police interview , shown in court , that he did n't like blood . He maintained that he posed no threat to civilians , only to the British military because of its actions overseas . He tried to cut Rigby 's head off because it was the proper method under Allah , he said .

`` It brings me little joy to approach anybody and slay them . Can you believe me ? I am not a man who gains enjoyment from watching horror films , '' he said .

His defense lawyer , David Gottlieb , sought to define Adebolajo in his closing argument as a man who was `` motivated by a noble idea '' rather than being a psychopathic murderer .

His client was intelligent and totally sincere in his beliefs , and had shown `` absolute honesty and moral conviction , '' Gottlieb said .

`` He did what he did because it was divinely ordained , '' he said , adding that he considered Adebolajo should have been charged with treason or terrorism rather than murder .

The defense lawyer for Adebowale , Abbas Lakha , echoed the argument that the men intended to kill a British soldier because they were soldiers of Allah , and that this was not the same as intent to murder .

Police : ` It 's a complicated story '

Critics may ask why these two men , given that they were known to the police , were not monitored more closely -- and so perhaps prevented from committing Rigby 's murder .

With those questions in mind , the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee is reviewing what was known about them before the attack .

The two men attended mosques across the capital but , Dick said , police `` are not aware of anyone else being aware of what was going to take place . We are not aware of anyone else engaged in the planning of this attack . ''

She said the two men `` were in different parts of London , with different people , exposed to a variety of extremists . ''

She suggested those hoping for all the answers are likely to be disappointed .
