WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- John Edwards took the stage at Indiana University on Tuesday night for a discussion on the 2008 presidential election , but members of the audience may have had something else on their minds entirely .

Edwards talked about politics , poverty and his hopes for America and the world , according to The Associated Press . Afterward , he answered only written questions that had been submitted before his speech . The affair was n't mentioned , AP reported .

The revelation , confirming a months-long investigation by the National Enquirer , was a political bombshell for the former candidate , who espoused moral values during his White House bid and whose wife is fighting a public battle with breast cancer .

During the interview , Edwards said he had engaged in an extramarital affair with a former campaign staffer , Rielle Hunter , but he vehemently denied he was the father of her newborn baby .

But with the 2008 presidential election officially in the history books , Edwards may be looking to accomplish what a handful of other national political figures have been able to do : successfully re-emerge from an embarrassing public scandal that by all appearances has left his political career in ruins .

Political opponents and members of the media have written off Bill Clinton on more than one occasion after embarrassing sex scandals , and many assumed Louisiana Sen. David Vitter 's career was done after his involvement with a Washington escort last year .

But for every politician that has survived a sex scandal , scores of once-powerful men have not . Just ask former Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart , former Republican Rep. Bob Livingston , or Democratic Rep. Tim Mahoney , who lost his re-election bid last week after an affair with a former staffer was disclosed .

`` He needs to figure out what the Democratic Party needs post-Obama election and step back and think , ` Well , what can I bring to the table ? ' '' said James Spellman , a professor at George Washington University 's Graduate School of Political Management . `` It ca n't be all about him and his resurrection . It has to be about the benefits he can bring to helping the new administration and what he can do to help Obama and his team get the job done . ''

`` Americans are very forgiving , and their memory is often short , '' Spellman said . `` He can come back if he does it right . ''

The speech Tuesday night appears designed not to make a political splash -- no reporters or cameras are allowed in the room . But by all outward appearances , it is an attempt by Edwards to dip his foot back into the political waters after a three-month hiatus .

Edwards is also set to make a public appearance in San Francisco , California , Wednesday -- and slated to debate former Bush strategist Karl Rove at the American Bankers Association , the San Francisco Chronicle reported over the weekend .

But even as Edwards is appearing to take the first steps toward a comeback , former supporters -- many of whom where blindsided by his admission of infidelity -- may be unwilling to give him a second chance this soon .

`` I wish he would keep himself locked in a cave for a year , '' a former senior staffer to Edwards ' campaign said . `` The best strategy he could adopt right now is to stay below the radar and just be quiet and let people move on . ''
