ISIS may not be operating the type of polished pipeline infrastructure one would find in southern Iraq around Basra , but Iraqi oil ministry officials say an old fashioned truck network for this crude is active and serving distribution needs .

And now , after nearly three months of heated battle in Iraq , one can see a clearer picture of where ISIS stands as an energy player .

It popped up on the global radar in June by seizing assets in Iraq , but building on those early gains , according to a number of energy sources , is proving difficult . August was not a good month for ISIS .

What they do hold , Iraqi officials suggest , will need maintenance . So far , it is getting that work done only through intimidation of on-site engineers who are not loyal to the ISIS cause . ISIS ' income from oil is falling as they struggle to control the personnel within refineries , according to Assim Jihad , a spokesman at Iraq 's Oil Ministry .

`` At first they got a large sum of money by seizing inventories , but this can not last , '' he added .

The Iraq Energy Institute estimates ISIS is producing about 30,000 barrels a day in Iraq and 50,000 daily in Syria . On a black market price of $ 40 a barrel , it is earning $ 1.2 million a day in Iraq and $ 2 million in Syria .

Energy traders and regional security specialists tell me supplies are being funneled into regional oil importing countries of Jordan , Turkey , and Syria .

`` They use oil tank trucks instead of oil pipes . There are about 210 oil tank trucks smuggling oil to Turkey and other places every day , '' Hussein Allawi , Baghdad manager of the Iraq Energy Institute told me .

`` We are not talking about people who own a couple of trucks and tanker trucks , '' said Kate Dourian , senior editor at the Middle East Economic Survey . `` We are talking about certain market-oriented people who have organizations that trade in illegal oil . ''

Oil strategists say Iraq 's national military and the Peshmerga forces of the Kurdish region are trying to strike a fine balance . They want to keep ISIS out of their prized fields and refineries , but they do n't want to destroy infrastructure which would take years and millions of dollars to rebuild .

The organization may be falling short of designs to become a `` state '' oil company , but revenue of over $ 3 million a day can certainly finance its operation of terror .

ISIS controls several oil fields in Iraq and Syria , which it is using to finance its terror operations

@highlight

However running refineries is difficult and ISIS has suffered setbacks in areas such as Baiji

@highlight

It is estimated to be earning more than $ 3 million a day in black market oil sales

@highlight

It may be struggling to increase that -- but the funds are plenty to finance its terror operation
