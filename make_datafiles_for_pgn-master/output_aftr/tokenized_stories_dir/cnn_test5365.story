-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the United States weighs possible military strikes on Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack , it has to consider a critical question : then what ?

A broad cross-section of experts on the region agree : A missile strike could worsen the war in Syria and usher in a host of new problems .

`` The key issue is not the tactics of the strikes , but the strategic aftermath , '' says Anthony Cordesman , a former Defense Department official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

Al Qaeda , extremists emboldened ?

`` A limited attack could suppress morale among regime forces and encourage defections and splits , '' says Jeffrey White of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .

The opposition would be emboldened -- including the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front , analysts say .

`` Supporting the opposition at this point would be like French-kissing al Qaeda , '' says Michael Rubin , a former Pentagon official now with the American Enterprise Institute . `` If the opposition wins , al Qaeda will win power . ''

`` There is a real risk that destabilizing the Assad regime could enable the jihadist and al Qaeda-affiliated rebel groups , '' agrees Erica Borghard , author of the policy analysis `` Arms and Influence in Syria : The Pitfalls of Greater U.S. Involvement . ''

`` These groups are militarily more capable than the rebels currently receiving U.S. support . ''

What do Syria 's neighbors think of potential Western strikes ?

Many analysts believe a U.S. attack would be aimed largely at making a statement that using chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war is unacceptable -- and that President Barack Obama is serious about his `` red line . ''

`` Doing something cosmetic would be worse than doing nothing at all , '' says Christopher Harmer , senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War .

Some other analysts fear al-Assad would respond with new chemical weapons attacks .

` Red line ' debate : Are chemical weapons worse ?

The United States insists Syria was behind the attack , but `` there is no absolute certainty , '' Husain notes in a CNN Opinion column .

If rebels did carry out the attack `` to bait America into the conflict , then U.S. firepower would be futile , '' says Husain . `` No amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent non-state actors from further use of these weapons . ''

Bombing raises suspicion of another chemical attack

It 's unlikely Syria would attack U.S. assets , analysts say .

`` The Lebanon-based terrorist militia might fire rockets into Israel , as they did in 2006 , in response to an attack on their Syria patrons . That could draw the United States more deeply into the war . On the other hand , the memory of Israel 's 2006 response might deter Hezbollah . ''

International ramifications : Protests , unrest , attacks ?

A missile strike on Syria could lead to new violence in other parts of the Middle East and around the world , says Firas Abi Ali , head of Middle East and North Africa Country Risk and Forecasting at IHS .

In Lebanon , Hezbollah supporters would be more likely to attack Sunnis `` due to the increased perception that Sunni communities are supporting Western-Israeli targeting of Hezbollah and Syria , '' he says . In several Middle Eastern countries , protests could arise -- some of them potentially violent . In Jordan , Syria `` would likely sponsor groups '' to attack malls , hotels , and government targets , Abi Ali says .

And there will be a `` high risk '' of attacks , sponsored by Iran , against Western assets around the world , from India to Thailand to Brazil , Abi Ali says .

Who wants what ?

Syria becomes ` Obama 's War ' ?

The repercussions for the United States , in the eyes of the world , could be tremendous , analysts say .

`` No amount of spin and victory claims can get around these issues . Nothing can stop critics from validly raising every past U.S. mistake in past interventions in the region and the world . ''

`` The worry here is that the U.S. could be drawn into even more extensive involvement in Syria , '' says author Borghard . `` This could involve a number of things , including imposing a no-fly zone over Syrian airspace and/or more extensive arming and training of rebels ... This would be a far more resource-intense operation than the 2011 NATO operation in Libya and would involve greater risks . ''

But in examining the possible repercussions of a missile strike , Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute says , `` There is no scenario that will end violence and improve the situation . The time for preventive medicine was two years ago . ''

`` When one side finally wins , the United States will have to craft a strategy to address a whole new set of problems that such a victory will bring , '' he says . `` Let 's call where we are now Phase I of the Syrian civil war . We have yet to see Phase II and Phase III but they are coming . ''
