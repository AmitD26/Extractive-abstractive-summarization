The remains have not yet been identified , Robert Soulas said .

Air France 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1 , 2009 , killing all 228 people aboard . The bulk of the wreckage was found this year after a search by robot submarines of an underwater mountain range .

Many bodies were still in the fuselage , investigators said at the time . Only about 50 bodies were recovered in the days following the crash .

Soulas got the news from a French government liaison appointed to deal with families of victims , he said .

The Airbus A330 plummeted 38,000 feet in just three minutes and 30 seconds amid conflicting information that may have led the pilots to make bad decisions , France 's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis -LRB- BEA -RRB- said Friday .

Miles O'Brien , a pilot and aviation analyst , said : `` You push down on the wheel to gain air speed , perhaps they -LRB- pilots -RRB- were getting information that the air speed was too high . Pulling the nose up will exacerbate an aerodynamic stall . ''

The speeds displayed on the left primary flight display were `` inconsistent '' with those on the integrated standby instrument system -LRB- ISIS -RRB- , the report says .

At the time of the descent , the two co-pilots and captain were in the aircraft cockpit .

The pilots lost contact with air traffic controllers while flying across an area of the Atlantic Ocean known for constant bands of severe turbulence .

Air crash investigators at the Paris-based BEA have been working on the theory that the speed sensors , known as pitot tubes or probes , malfunctioned because of ice at high altitude .
