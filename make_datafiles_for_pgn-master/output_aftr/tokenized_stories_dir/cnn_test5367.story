Ken Hoinsky describes his book as a self-help book for men seeking advice on interacting with the opposite sex .

`` It is a guide for men to get better with women , '' he explains in a video on the crowd-funding website Kickstarter , which he used to raise funds .

He writes in the book : `` The concept of ` waiting for signs ' or ` indicators of interest ' was commonplace in older pickup theory . It is 100 % garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet . ''

People turned to Twitter and other social media to criticize not just Hoinsky 's project , but also Kickstarter for having hosted it .

An online petition demanding that Kickstarter remove the project garnered nearly 30,000 signatures by Wednesday evening .

'' ` Disgusting ' does n't even begin to describe it : basically , it 's a how-to guide on sexually assaulting women , '' the petition states .

But Kickstarter says it will not delete Hoinsky 's crowd-funding project .

`` Some of this material is abhorrent and inconsistent with our values as people and as an organization , '' Kickstarter said in a statement . `` Based on our current guidelines , however , the material on Reddit did not warrant the irreversible action of canceling the project . ''

The website said the controversy will lead to reviews of their policies , but did n't elaborate .

The book excerpts that critics are sharing are taken out of context , he said . They come from a later chapter on physical escalation that follows clear advice that `` no means no , '' he said .
