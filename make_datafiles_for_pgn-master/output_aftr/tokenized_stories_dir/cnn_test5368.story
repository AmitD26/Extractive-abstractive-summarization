Forensics is the use of scientific or technical information to answer questions in a court of law . Digital forensics is the branch that focuses on the identification , acquisition and analysis of information found on digital devices : computers , cell phones , digital cameras or any computer-based system .

Fast forward to 2013 and we have thousands of people taking pictures and videos of what everyone expected to be an every day event . Law enforcement agencies were able to use these images to observe the comings and goings of hundreds of people at a certain site at a certain time in order to detect a pattern of behavior with which to identify the two suspects . And most of this imagery came from private citizens .

Personal computers have been around for nearly 30 years . The Internet has been commercially available for 20 years . Mobile phones have been pervasive for more than 10 years and smartphones , in particular , for more than five . Computers , networks and cell phones have increasingly become the record keeper , instrument or target of criminal activity over the last few decades .

Yet , in Boston , a lot of the images came not from public-sector cameras but from private-sector cameras : our fellow citizens . Fellow citizens who voluntarily shared their information so that law enforcement could do its job .

Yet , citizens stepped forward to offer their help , a clear sign of a community willing to work together for a greater good and one that does not distrust the government .

Although some might claim that these people were surrendering their rights for an element of security , it was the same instinct that made some people run toward the carnage so that they could provide assistance and comfort to friends , family and strangers . They were not surrendering their rights when they helped law enforcement but were empowering themselves as a community .

Your personal privacy has more to fear from the likes of Facebook and Google than from the government . Commercial entities such as social media sites offer free services and yet make money . How ?

We , our information , have become their commodity . They have more money , motivation and resources to use our collected information for their own purposes than the government does . We , as users of social media , self-exploit ; we post our information voluntarily . Yet , once posted , we usually lose exclusive ownership of the information and always lose control over it .

It also points to the incredible resiliency of the U.S. Constitution and its ability to guide us in a modern era , yet why it needs constant interpretation . As technologies evolve that the Founders could not have possibly anticipated -- from fully automatic weapons and thermal imagers to satellites and digital technologies -- we have to figure out how to balance our rights as individuals and needs as a society .
