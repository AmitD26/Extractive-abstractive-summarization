Meet these members of the Coffee Party Movement , an organically grown , freshly brewed push that 's marking its official kickoff Saturday . Across the country , even around the globe , they and other Americans in at least several hundred communities are expected to gather in coffeehouses to raise their mugs of java to something new .

The one who was `` never active in this stuff ''

Politics ? It never spoke to John Purser , who 's preferred the simple life . At 69 , he lives in a two-room house on a rural dirt road in Carroll County , drives a 26-year-old Ford pickup and takes odd jobs to get by . He cuts grass , chops wood and does handyman work . Earlier this week , he freed a bird from someone 's house and `` got paid with a bottle of whiskey , '' he said with a laugh .

He does n't need much . Never has . But Purser , who worked in maintenance for Delta Airlines for 30 years , has seen the little security he might have had -- his retirement money , for example , and his home 's value -- fall apart in recent years . And he just does n't understand why some fancy executive should earn millions . His own daddy made $ 12 a week building roads for the Work Projects Administration during the Great Depression .

`` Our country was a hell of a lot worse off then , and we came together , and we did something , '' he said . `` I 'm not that smart . I do n't know the dollars and cents . But I 'm just looking for something different . ''

The Atlanta coordinator

That moment , and her childlike understanding of what it meant , stuck with Hopkins and has driven her ever since . The stay-at-home mom used to work in the real-estate mortgage field but left when she became disheartened by the industry .

She feels hopeful about the people who are re-engaging in and taking ownership of the political process .

`` President Obama is stifled by a dysfunctional Congress . When he was on the campaign trail , he used the word ` we ' a lot . He can not do this alone . He needs our help , '' she said . `` Americans are waking up across the board . ... Not everyone is cut out to be an activist . But everyone can do something . ''

The young fiscal conservative

He ca n't help but think it 's being hijacked by social conservatives and the far right , he said , and as a gay man who 's committed to gay rights , it may not be his cup of political tea .

`` I never feel uncomfortable stating my opinions , '' but it was `` sort of ironic . They wanted free discussion of the issues but did n't want to talk about the conservative side of things , '' Oxford said after the planning meeting . `` I think it was great , but I 'd like to see more conservatives and libertarians . ''

The disillusioned Obama supporter

`` As a Southern woman , I was taught that discussing politics and religion is ill-mannered , '' said Darlene Jones-Owens , 53 , of Carrollton , Georgia . But she became an involved and vocal Democrat when she `` realized that America had been lied to about Iraq , that our military uses torture , and when I heard John McCain sing ` Bomb , bomb , bomb Iran . ' ''

She said she began registering voters for the Democratic Party , canvassed her neighborhood to talk about issues that had become dear to her and endured `` icy stares and insults . '' Unable to find Obama bumper stickers and other materials where she lives , the University of West Georgia lecturer and a friend ordered them in bulk and made sure others had access to them .

The man Aunt Rosa called `` baby ''

His great-grandmother 's first cousin was the legendary civil rights activist Rosa Parks , whom he grew up calling `` Aunt Rosa . '' He remembers her telling him , '' ` You know , baby , you 're not special . You 're unique , ' '' and that 's a distinction he appreciates today . To be special means you deserve more , your own category ; everyone , on the other hand , is unique and has something to offer .

He calls himself a `` political realist '' who never expects change to happen in a flash . He did n't put that on Obama , and he looks at the Coffee Party with cautious optimism .

`` I think that space is definitely onto something , '' he said . It 's `` another way to start a conversation . That 's what I really like . ''
