-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Campaign 2014 is in full swing with primary voting , and incumbents and challengers busy raising money .

Now the first task for every federal candidate in this midterm election year will be to read the Supreme Court 's ruling on campaign finance for a reality check .

The 40-page decision handed down on Wednesday promises to continue a transformation over how donations and spending on elections are conducted .

The practical effect : it would allow well-heeled donors to spread the wealth to give to more candidates and political groups .

But the larger implications could be huge , played out for years to come in a variety of continuing challenges to current restrictions .

`` Every time this current Supreme Court has confronted a campaign finance restriction , it 's struck it down , '' said Thomas Goldstein , publisher of SCOTUSblog.com . `` It has been on a slow but steady march towards deregulation , towards saying that restrictions on your spending money -- say , in expenditures or in contributions to candidates -- that is a free speech right . ''

Breyer 's lament

The ruling `` eviscerates our nation 's campaign finance laws , leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intend to resolve , '' he added .

But Chief Justice John Roberts , in his majority opinion , acknowledged what many a smart election lawyer knows :

`` The government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse , '' he said .

The man behind the ruling

The Alabama native has worked for years with his local Republican Party in Birmingham , and is chairman of Conservative Action Fund , a so-called `` super PAC '' that `` promotes conservative Republicans ' time-proven messages and effective solutions . ''

His success in business and a willingness to put his money into GOP coffers set him at the center of the politically tricky Supreme Court fight . He equates his donations to `` core political speech . ''

He supports those individual controls , but `` what does n't make any sense is that you can only give that amount of money to a few candidates , because somehow my giving money to -LRB- U.S. Rep. -RRB- Martha Roby of Alabama could corrupt -LRB- former Rep. -RRB- Allen West of Florida , '' he told CNN .

`` That 's just nutty , but that 's what the powers-that-be want : to prevent folks who want to get involved from having the same ability to get involved and support candidates that big union PACs have , '' he said .

`` The reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness , so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations , we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate , '' said Robert Zimmerman , a prominent Democratic fundraiser .

Fundamental debate

The competing arguments are stark : supporters of campaign finance reform say current federal regulations are designed to prevent corruption in politics . Opponents said it would criminalize free speech and association .

The current case deals with direct political contributions . But it continues a trend that culminated in the separate `` Citizens United '' high court ruling from 2010 , easing long-standing restrictions on `` independent spending '' by corporations , labor unions , and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns .

These super PACs are independent political organizations operating as `` 527s , '' named after the tax code governing their operation . They can not contribute directly to a federal candidate or political party .

Some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased , or even unlimited , aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the `` super PACs . ''

All PACs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates , legislation , or ballot measures . The difference is in how they are organized for regulatory and tax purposes , and by the amounts of money they are allowed to spend .

Regular PACs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties , while super PACs can not .

With a resounding win at the high court , wealthy donors like McCutcheon -- whether Democrat , Republican , or Independent -- could in theory contribute a maximum $ 3.6 million to the national and state parties , and the 450 or so Senate and House candidates expected to run in 2014 .

Another point of contention is whether the aggregate spending limits are really having a pervasive effect , or only involve a relative few well-heeled givers .

Figures from the Center for Responsive Politics for the 2012 race showed about 600 donors leveraged their money to each give the maximum of about $ 48,000 total -- benefitting no more than 17 presidential or congressional candidates .

Lax enforcement

Unlike in `` Citizens United , '' the big winners may be harder to discern . Certainly individual donors seeking to expand their election portfolio have more choices . But as Roberts noted , other big-move avenues exist to funnel money to outside groups willing to spend freely .

`` The court opens another loophole by allowing our political parties to be further corrupted by big-money contributions from special interests , '' said Elisabeth MacNamara , president of the League of Women Voters of the U.S. `` The party and PAC systems now become a huge funnel for corrupting elected officials across the country . ''

But McCutcheon argues that characterizing the legal fight as between `` good '' and `` bad '' simply blurs the truth .

The case is McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission -LRB- 12-536 -RRB- .
