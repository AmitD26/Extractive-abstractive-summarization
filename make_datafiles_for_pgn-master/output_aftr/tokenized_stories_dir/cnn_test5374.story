-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Schumacher has been one of Pirelli 's biggest critics this season , but Formula One 's tire supplier has backed the seven-time world champion to end his long wait for a victory at Sunday 's European Grand Prix .

He has been outshone by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg , but Pirelli 's motorsport director Paul Hembery believes the German can perform well in Valencia , where he has failed to make the top-10 in two previous attempts .

Schumacher did , however , top the qualifying times at another street circuit last month in Monaco , but started the race sixth due to a penalty and ended up retiring early -- as he did last time out in Canada .

`` I think you have to look at someone like , maybe Michael , getting the pole position , '' Hembery told F1 's official website .

Schumacher , who won 91 grands prix between 1992 and 2006 , was penalized in Monte Carlo due to a collision with Bruno Senna at the Spanish Grand Prix .

The former Ferrari driver has endured a miserable start to the 2012 season , collecting just two world championship points and retiring from five of the first seven races . Rosberg , meanwhile , is fifth on 67 points and clinched the first race win of his career in China .

`` Our motto in the last few days has been to roll our sleeves up and focus on the job in hand , '' he said . `` Everybody in the team has taken that approach to heart , so we can travel to Valencia in an optimistic mood . ''

Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn , who worked with Schumacher at Ferrari , conceded he has not provided him with an adequate car .

After this weekend 's race in Valencia , the world championship will head to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix on July 8 .
