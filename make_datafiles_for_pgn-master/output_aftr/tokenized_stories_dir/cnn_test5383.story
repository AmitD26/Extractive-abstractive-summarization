Oxford , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- WikiLeaks.org , the website that released secret video of a U.S. airstrike in Iraq that killed a dozen civilians , is `` getting an enormous quantity of whistle-blower disclosures of high caliber , '' the site 's founder , Julian Assange , said Friday in a rare public appearance here .

Speaking at the TED Global conference , Assange said that `` we are overwhelmed by our growth '' and the site ca n't keep up with the volume of the new material because it does n't have enough people to verify it .

He later told reporters that `` there are many things which are very explosive . ''

Assange said the organization gets material from whistle-blowers in a variety of ways -- including via postal mail -- vets it , releases it to the public and then defends itself against `` the regular political or legal attack . ''

Assange said at a news conference that Manning `` is a political prisoner being held in the nation of Kuwait , effectively keeping him away from the press and effective legal representation . '' He said WikiLeaks is providing legal assistance to Manning without saying if he was the source of the video .

U.S. military authorities have warned that the publication of classified documents on WikiLeaks could aid in the planning of terrorist attacks and harm national security .

Assange denied reports that WikiLeaks had received hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. cables in addition to the Iraq video . He said the site would have released the cables if it had received them .

Assange said some information , including a patient 's medical records , should legitimately be kept secret . But he said WikiLeaks 's practice of revealing information from whistle-blowers follows the traditions of journalism . The fact that governments and organizations spend money to keep this information secret , Assange said , is a good indication that releasing the information can achieve reform .

`` I received advice from figures like -LSB- investigative reporter -RSB- Sy Hersh to exercise caution , '' Assange said , adding that U.S. officials have now adopted a `` reasonable '' attitude in private .
