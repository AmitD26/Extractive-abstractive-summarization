-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` War ! What is it good for ? '' sings Edwin Starr in his 1970 song , before giving an unambiguous answer : `` absolutely nothing . '' History , archaeology , and anthropology , however , suggest that the story is not so simple .

In the Stone Age , humans were a rough lot . When people 10,000 years ago disagreed , they usually solved their arguments without violence ; but when they did decide to use force , they faced far fewer constraints than the citizens of functioning modern states . Violence was normally on a small scale , in homicides , vendettas , and raids , but because populations were also tiny , the steady drip of killing took an appalling toll . By many estimates , 10 to 20 % of Stone Age humans died at other people 's hands .

If we fast-forward to the 20th century , we see a stunning contrast . The century suffered world wars , genocides , and nuclear attacks , not to mention civil strife , riots , and murders . Altogether , we killed a staggering 100-200 million of our own kind . But between 1900 and 2000 , roughly 10 billion lives were lived -- meaning that just 1-2 % of the world 's population died violently .

So if you were lucky enough to be born in the 20th century , your risk of dying violently was just one-tenth of that in the Stone Age ; and since 2000 , the United Nations tells us , the risk of violent death has fallen even further , to 0.7 % .

These are astonishing statistics , but the explanation is more astonishing still . In perhaps the greatest paradox in history , what made the world safer was war itself .

What happened , it seems , is that starting about 10,000 years ago , the winners of wars began incorporating the losers into larger societies . The victors then found that the only way to make these larger societies work was by developing stronger governments ; and one of the first things these governments had to do , if they wanted to stay in power , was suppress violence among their subjects .

But that did not happen . The reality is that people hardly ever give up their freedoms , including their freedom to kill and impoverish each other , unless forced to do so , and virtually the only force strong enough to scare people straight has been strong government . Back in the 1600s the philosopher Thomas Hobbes nicknamed this `` Leviathan , '' after the terrifying monster of the Old Testament .

The process of making Leviathan was not pretty . Whether it was the Romans in Britain or the British in India , pacification could be just as bloody as the savagery it stamped out .

Nor were all governments equally good Leviathans . Democracies , whatever their other faults , tend to value life more than dictatorships .

War seems to be only way people have found to create peaceful societies , he argues

Morris : World has single great power -- USA -- capable of deterring governments from using force
