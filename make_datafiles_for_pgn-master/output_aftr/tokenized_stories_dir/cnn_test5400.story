Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China 's third-largest city Guangzhou -- capital of China 's richest and most progressive province Guangdong -- has announced it has taken the first concrete steps in unbolting the country 's often reviled `` Re-education Through Labor '' -LRB- RTL -RRB- system .

A senior judge told the state-run China Daily that all detainees in the city under the `` laojiao '' or RTL system would be released by the end of the year .

`` The police and many legal experts have realized the drawbacks of laojiao and called to abolish the system , which has become outdated , '' Yu Mingyong , deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People 's Court , was quoted as saying .

`` Many of those released from laojiao find many difficulties returning to society , families and work after ... their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years . ''

Human Rights Watch welcomed the move but said there were few RTL camps and detainees in cities . It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,000 detainees held in a network of facilities throughout the province .

Despite the move to end the process -- originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and Marxist indoctrination -- HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug detox centers .

Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet `` gulags '' -- a place where `` counter-revolutionaries '' and `` class enemies '' could be detained without trial .

Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing .

In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week , the vice president of Guangzhou City , Yuming Yong , said the city 's administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March , effectively scrapping the system .

`` Judicial reform of RTL has been a priority this year , '' Yong told the Nanfang Daily . `` Guangzhou has stopped approval of re-education through labor -LRB- cases -RRB- further highlighting the protection of citizens ' personal liberties . ''

An administrative tribunal official Xiao Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard , the system would eventually be `` digested out '' but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments .

While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reform-oriented , human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system .

`` Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform , that 's their identity , '' Bequelin said . `` Unfortunately , this ` reform ' essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 'Re - education Through Labor ' to ` Coercive Detoxification Center . ' ''

He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the RTL detainees in the province -- 10,000 out of a total of 18,000 according to HRW â € '' are drug offenders or users who posed little political threat to authorities in Beijing .

`` It 's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,000 RTL detainees who are not being shifted to the detoxification system . Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention , ` Custody and Education , ' designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers , '' Bequelin said .

These centers , HRW argues , also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative , rather than judicial , decisions .

While even Guangdong 's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system , saying that it was `` not opposed to the use of coercive power and punishment by public security organs , '' recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL .

`` The system was designed to maintain social order , prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code , '' read one Xinhua editorial . `` It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods , however , with the development of society and the legal system , its defects have become more and more evident .
