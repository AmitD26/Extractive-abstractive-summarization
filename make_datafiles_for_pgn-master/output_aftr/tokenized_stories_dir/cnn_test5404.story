Opinion : The overwhelming maleness of mass homicide

After the attack , Holmes identified himself to police as `` The Joker , '' Batman 's archenemy .

Some have speculated the 24-year-old Aurora man was heavily medicated during his initial court appearance Monday . Others have suggested he was in the midst of a psychotic breakdown and hearing voices . Others say he may have just been exhausted , or feigning mental illness to game the judicial system .

`` He has no right to come into court looking like he has a sad face . It 's not right , '' shooting survivor Corbin Dates said after the hearing . `` The look that he has right now is not something that 's going to be believable by anyone . ''

Holmes may have been medicated , said Chicago clinical psychologist Daniela Schreier .

But she said an underlying mental health issue seems likely , as well .

Some people may think Holmes was a longtime psychopath who turned to violence to show the world he could make a lasting mark , she said . After seeing him in court , though , Schreier said she believes Holmes suffered a psychotic breakdown as recently as this spring , triggering his decision to drop out of graduate school , start buying weapons and launch his attack amid paranoid delusions , she said .

Dr. Mark Levy , a forensic psychiatrist in Mill Valley , California , said he does n't think Holmes ' behavior was due to medication .

`` Whatever is happening on the outside of him is like a fly buzzing around the room , something you occasionally take note of , '' he said . The rest of the time , he explained , a person in such a state is inwardly dealing with an invisible roiling chaos , unaware of what 's going on around him .

Chris Cline , vice president of clinical services at Skyland Trail , a mental health services facility in Atlanta , said it 's not clear from Holmes ' appearance whether mental illness is a factor .

`` I think we need to see what comes out with more data before we rush to judgment about whether he has a mental illness or something else that 's different than that , '' he said Tuesday on CNN .

`` I do n't take the bizarre behavior yesterday as confirmation of mental illness , '' she said .

The issue continued to be a topic of discussion Tuesday , with commenters on CNN and other online venues debating what the unusual appearance meant .

`` He 's a pathological , homicidal sociopath . He literally has no feelings for those around him , '' said one commenter on CNN.com who went by the screen name JR4 . `` Like his acting job in court ? He knows that spending life in a psych ward with meds will be a lot better than spending hard time on death row in a maximum security prison . ''

In many ways , however , he said Monday 's court appearance speaks for itself .

`` You can draw your own conclusions , '' Pinsky said Monday on his show . `` Not a normal guy . ''
