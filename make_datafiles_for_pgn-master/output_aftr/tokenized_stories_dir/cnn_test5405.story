Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After weeks of talking past each other , congressional leaders and President Barack Obama talked to each other Wednesday evening -- only to emerge evidently no closer to a deal to halt the government 's budget stalemate .

The White House meeting , coming a day after the start of the federal government shutdown , served at least one purpose , in that key players in the debate gathered together in the same room for over an hour : Obama called it `` useful , '' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was `` worthwhile , '' and House Speaker John Boehner cast it as a `` polite conversation . ''

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , for instance , went so far as to call it `` unproductive . '' Neither side discussed any potential compromises , with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden doing most of the talking and Boehner making clear he wo n't go forward with a `` clean '' funding bill -- with no Obamacare amendments -- a GOP congressional source said .

Moreover , the parties are on the verge of another crisis -- over whether to raise the debt ceiling by October 17 , at which point the federal government wo n't be able to pay its bills .

`` At times like this , the American people expect their leaders to come together to find ways to resolve their differences , '' Boehner said . `` The president reiterated one more time tonight that he will not negotiate . ''

A few minutes later , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid claimed that it was Boehner -- not the president or his fellow Democrats -- who has refused to budge on budgetary matters , saying `` we 're through playing these little games . ''

`` I thought that they were concerned about the long-term fiscal affairs of this country . And we said , ` we are too . Let 's talk about it , ' '' the Nevada Democrat said . `` My friend , John Boehner ... can not take yes for an answer . ''

`` Am I exasperated ? '' Obama said of Boehner , who is under pressure from fiscal hawks , and is refusing to let the House vote on the Senate-approved spending plan . `` I am absolutely exasperated , because this is entirely unnecessary . ''

The president foreshadowed Boehner 's comments that he would n't negotiate with Republicans in their attempts to tie government funding to Obamacare changes . Doing so , the president said , would set a dangerous precedent .

Fresh off having sent four separate proposals tying funding the government to either delaying or defunding Obamacare -- each of which was rejected by the Senate -- the GOP-led House continued to work Wednesday , albeit on another plan Democrats say wo n't go anywhere .

A day after an initial effort failed because the short-term proposals comprising a tiny portion of the overall federal budget lacked the necessary two-thirds majority support due to Democratic opposition , the House passed -- with majority support -- bills to fund national parks , the National Institutes of Health and District of Columbia operations .

The incremental approach pushed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas seeks to pressure Democrats to approve spending for programs that Republicans like , but not Obamacare .

Yet Obama has signaled he 'd veto those measures should they reach his desk . That 's unlikely , given that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has dismissed the GOP approach as `` reckless and irresponsible . ''

While expressing openness to budgetary negotiations generally , Democrats have said they 'll only talk after Congress passes a clean spending measure . Both Democrats and Republicans say such a bill would pass the House with support from the Democratic minority and moderate Republicans .

So far , Boehner has succumbed to pressure from the tea party right to avoid a vote that would pass something without causing some harm to the health care reforms .

Decision to raise debt ceiling , or risk default , looms

The looming debt crisis could pose even more headaches , and confrontation , in the coming weeks .

Obama offered no indication that he 'll budge . Noting that such Republican brinkmanship in 2011 led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating , the president said Tuesday he `` will not negotiate over Congress ' responsibility to pay bills it 's already racked up . ''

Raising the debt ceiling ?

Still , that crisis is still a few weeks away . The government shutdown is the one currently affecting hundreds of thousands of furloughed government workers , not to mention millions of others who rely on government programs , visit national parks and have some other type of interaction with affected programs .

Government shutdown forces clinical trial patients to wait

Pelosi said that scores of Democrats have reluctantly offered to back a plan to fund the entire government at a figure that 's been bandied about by Republicans , albeit well below what her party members want . The other option would be to reconcile budgets passed by both chambers earlier this year in a conference committee , as is Washington custom .

`` That 's not what our Constitution had in mind : that if you do n't like something , you threaten to shut down the government , '' the California Democrat said . `` It 's not that kind of system . ''

A blow to the economy

Federal employees who are considered essential will continue working . Those deemed non-essential -- up to 800,000 -- could be furloughed , unsure when they 'll be able to work or get paid again .

The shutdown could cost the still-struggling U.S. economy about $ 1 billion a week in pay lost by furloughed federal workers . And that 's only the tip of the iceberg .

While many agencies have reserve funds and contingency plans that would give them some short-term leeway , the economic effect would snowball as the shutdown continued .

The total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers , said Brian Kessler , economist with Moody 's Analytics . His firm estimates that a three - to four-week shutdown would cost the economy about $ 55 billion .
