The experts also recommended that governments should let the public know more about their processes in carrying out the death penalty .

Documents : Not enough left to finish botched execution

The study was already in the works before the failed execution in Oklahoma .

The group does n't take a position on whether the death penalty should be used , but rather suggests ways to improve the system , the Constitution Project says , to ensure it is being carried out fairly .

`` Without substantial revisions -- not only to lethal injection , but across the board -- the administration of capital punishment in America is unjust , disproportionate and very likely unconstitutional , '' former Virginia Republican Attorney General Mark Earley , a member of the committee that produced the report , said in a statement .

Among its 39 findings , the report warns that executing people convicted of felony murder violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution , which bans cruel , unusual and excessive punishment for crimes .

`` Including accidental and non-intentional murderers among the death-eligible creates perverse outcomes â € '' those least `` deserving '' of a death sentence can be sentenced to die while premeditated and intentional murderers may avoid capital punishment , '' the report says .

The report also takes on the issue of executing people suffering from mental retardation , which the Supreme Court banned in 2002 . Some states , the report says , have overly stringent standards for people to be declared mentally handicapped .

The move to a single lethal drug , the report says , would make sure the government is using `` the most scientifically reliable methods to minimize pain and suffering during an execution . ''

States also should make public what drug is used and allow the public to have input on the process . Currently , some states do not identify the drugs they use for lethal injections . Some manufacturers refuse to allow their drugs for such use .
