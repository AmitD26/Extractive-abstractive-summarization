Toyko , Japan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He may be diminutive in stature as he appears under the shadow of the Tokyo Skytree , Japan 's tallest structure at 634 meters . But as he twists and screams `` I 'm so pretty ! '' onstage , it becomes clear that his star is rising .

The crowd of thousands goes wild , screaming his name and snapping as many photos as they can .

In the world of cute , cuddly , and sometimes bizarre mascots , these `` yuru-kyara '' -LRB- meaning gentle or laid back characters -RRB- , have been a ubiquitous presence in advertising in Japan for decades . But Funassyi is a hyperactive talking and dancing pear who has distinguished himself from the pack .

In fact , Funassyi is a household name .

Since then , his popularity has exploded , boasting an impressive resume that includes television appearances , commercials and ad campaigns , and even his own novelty single released under Universal Music Japan .

Funassyi 's undeniable charisma

But what makes Funassyi so different from his countless cohorts of colorful characters ?

Replicating the Funassyi effect

Kumamon 's brand is already expanding overseas , with themed products soon to be appearing in 7-Eleven convenience stores in Taiwan .

Although Funassyi 's stardom currently remains limited to Japan , it 's not unbelievable to imagine his following expanding worldwide , placing him among the ranks of other Japanese icons that became multi-billion-dollar icons .

The creators of Kumamon and Funassyi are hoping for the kind of global fame as Japanese icons Hello Kitty and Pikachu .
