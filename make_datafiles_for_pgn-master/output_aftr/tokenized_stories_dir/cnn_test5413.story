Biden aggressively pressed Ryan on Thursday to defend his ticket 's positions on everything from Medicare to trimming the nation 's debt to the way forward in dealing with Iran .

For his part , Ryan was equally hard-charging and vigorously put forth the ticket 's domestic and foreign policy proposals in exchanges that were at times sharp and pointed .

Five things we learned from Thursday 's vice presidential debate

A CNN-ORC International poll released after the debate suggested voters who watched narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48 % -44 % , a statistically even result . That followed an overwhelming Romney victory in their first of three debates .

`` I think they both accomplished the kinds of things they wanted to accomplish , '' said John Geer , chairman of Vanderbilt University 's political science department .

Political analysts say Biden also helped re-energize Democrats , whose spirits might have flagged after Obama 's lackluster performance in last week 's debate .

`` The most important job Biden did for Obama is reawakening the depressed Democratic base , '' said Larry Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics . `` Biden has primed them for a better performance from Obama . ''

`` That is still the big missing piece in their argument , '' Brownstein said .

Ryan was able to capitalize on Romney 's momentum from his well-received debate performance . The Wisconsin congressman 's performance further smooths Romney 's path to charge ahead , political experts say .

However , some political watchers said Ryan 's response on women 's health issues could prove problematic for Romney during the next two debates .

`` It 's kind of the untalked about thing this morning -- raised a bunch of issues for the campaigns to be talking about over the next couple of weeks , '' Hilary Rosen , a Democratic pundit and CNN contributor , said . `` Yes , the economy is important , but when women have to worry about their health care and the economy , that 's just an extra burden . ''

But CNN contributor and RedState blogger Erick Erickson , appearing on `` CNN Newsroom '' with Rosen , said most women agree with the Romney-Ryan position .
