The two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill , the woman said in a statement released by police . One of the men claimed to be a railway employee and said , `` Our boss has seen you taking photos ; you will have to come with us . ''

`` I pleaded with them to let us go , but they shouted at me and threatened me , '' the woman said . She and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex .

`` Three people stayed with my friend , and the two took me behind a wall , '' she added .

That 's where the attack allegedly occurred . The victim said her mother called her phone multiple times , before one of the men switched it off . The woman said she was threatened with , among other things , sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle .

The four men will be sentenced on Friday .
