-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New York City 's billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg can get pretty much whatever he wants , whenever he wants . Yet the item at the top of his wish list does n't usually carry a price tag .

Since taking office in 2002 , Bloomberg has unleashed a tsunami of public health initiatives intended to do just that -- cutting sodium in prepared meals , ordering that menus in chain restaurants carry calorie counts , posting restaurants ' health department grades , as well as limiting the use of tobacco products .

His first acts included a ban on smoking in restaurants and workplaces . In 2011 , the restriction was extended to public parks and beaches .

`` I got a lot of one-fingered waves -- as I would describe them -- when I marched by bars on St. Patrick 's Day , for example , '' he told CNN 's Jake Tapper last week .

In fact , the policies have worked and have been widely copied , according to Dr. Susan Kansagra , an assistant commissioner at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene .

`` What we 're trying to do is just deglamorize , do n't remind them , do n't make it look like it 's a normal product , '' Bloomberg said . `` Cigarettes are not a normal product . ''

Its passage would be unprecedented , Bloomberg said .

That proposal too has stirred opposition . `` The notion of forcing licensed , tax-collecting , law-abiding retailers to hide their tobacco inventory is patently absurd , '' said Jim Calvin , president of the New York Association of Convenience Stores .

`` This proposal arises from a wild theory that the mere sight of packs of cigarettes on a wall behind the store counter compels kids to start smoking , '' Calvin continuted .

A spokesman for the parent company of Philip Morris USA , whose cigarette brands include Marlboro , said the manufacturer opposes the measure because `` we believe it goes too far . ''

Bloomberg 's eat-your-vegetables approach to public health has triggered cries that the 71-year-old media mogul , politician and philanthropist has turned the city that never sleeps into a nanny state , one where finger-wagging admonitions about what to eat and drink and how to live have become annoyingly intrusive .

But he is undeterred .

Not surprisingly , Bloomberg is appealing the ruling .

The mayor embraces risk and , though he does n't particularly revel in failure , he is not afraid of it , said Gibbs .

She recalled his telling a story of having spent a day skiing . Afterward , a skier remarked proudly that he had not fallen once . Bloomberg was unimpressed . `` He said , ` That means you did n't try hard enough , ' '' Gibbs said . `` If you succeeded at everything , you left opportunities on the table . ''

He rose quickly , eventually overseeing the firm 's information systems .

In 1981 , squeezed out of the bank in a merger , he started Bloomberg LP , the financial news and information company used by Wall Street 's trading firms . It has made him rich .

`` He 's driven by the metric of how do we make the most impact in terms of improving health and saving lives , '' said Dr. Michael J. Klag , dean of the Bloomberg School of Public Health . `` Mike is a data-driven guy , he 's a numbers guy . ''

`` New York is now the healthiest city in America because of what he 's done , '' Klag said .

It 's also one of the safest , with the lowest murder rate of any big city in America . And traffic deaths and fire deaths are the lowest since the city started keeping records in 1916 .

`` Parents from around the country used to dissuade their kids from moving to New York because it was dangerous , '' Bloomberg said last week . `` That does n't happen any more . Parents want their kids to move here because they 're probably safer than where they 're coming from . ''

Putting a dent in obesity

Bloomberg 's focus on food is recent and the data to support it are not as strong .

But talking about legacy is `` a little presumptuous , '' according to Peter Zimroth , a lawyer with Arnold & Porter , which has represented the restaurant industry .

`` The legacy is yet to be written on some of these initiatives , '' he told the conference , adding that the evidence that such efforts would reduce obesity was itself thin and could wind up being counterproductive . `` There 's a limited amount of capital , I think , that government has to engage in coercive measures , '' he said .

In reaching for opportunities , Bloomberg has lost his footing several times . In addition to losing his effort to ban large , sugary drinks , he failed in his bids to get a soda tax adopted and to ban the use of food stamps to buy soda .

The so-called soda ban provoked ridicule from some observers . `` I think this is what makes liberals look like elitist bullies who think they know everything and can tell people what to do , '' Bill Maher said on his HBO show `` Real Time . '' `` You should n't have to clear what you eat with the municipal government . ''

A executive with the National Restaurant Association -- which represents 500,000 restaurant businesses across the country -- called the city 's efforts at change `` heavy-handed '' and was effervescent over Bloomberg 's most recent loss .

Bloomberg 's attempt to limit the size of sodas inspired Mississippi -- whose 34.9 % obesity rate is the nation 's highest -- to pass an `` anti-Bloomberg '' law .

But Bloomberg lashed back .

While his critics might accuse him of simply trying to expand his political power through his health initiatives , Bloomberg 's colleagues say that 's not the case .

Bloomberg 's focus is simple and singular , explained his former colleague Dr. Tom Frieden , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

`` Any time I came to him for a decision , he only asked one question : Was I certain that this would save lives ? '' said Frieden , who served as commissioner of the New York City Health Department from 2002-2009 . `` When it comes to failure - if he works on something for six months and it fails , the next day it 's as if it did n't happen . He is always looking ahead . ''

Meanwhile , Bloomberg appears to be meeting his goal of adding length to the lives of New Yorkers .
