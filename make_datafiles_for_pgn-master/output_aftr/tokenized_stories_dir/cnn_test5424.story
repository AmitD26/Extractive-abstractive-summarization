`` Haim started to confide in me , about some intensely personal stuff , very quickly ... Within hours of our first meeting , we found ourselves talking about Lucas , the film he made in the summer of 1985 , the role I had wanted for myself . At some point during the filming , he explained , an adult male convinced him that its was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations , that it was what all the ` guys do . ' So , they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers , during a lunch break for the cast and crew , and Haim , innocent and ambitious as he was , allowed himself to be sodomized . ''

Feldman recalls that Haim , 11 years old at the time , said , `` I guess we should play around like that , too ? ''

While Feldman never acted on his friend 's suggestion , he did encounter more sexual abuse later on from the adults around him , including an older male Feldman had hired as his assistant who he calls `` Ron Crimson '' in the book . Crimson allegedly performed oral sex on Feldman after he encouraged a teenaged Feldman to take a cocktail of pills . Feldman writes that in his that in his teen years he was constantly surrounded by pedophiles .

Feldman 's childhood was so troubled that he looked to his friend Michael Jackson , introduced to him by director Steven Spielberg , for normalcy . `` Michael Jackson 's world , crazy as it sounds , had become my happy place , '' he writes . `` Being with Michael brought me back to my innocence . When I was with Michael , it was like being 10 years old again . '' Feldman stresses in the book that Jackson never once acted inappropriately toward him .

In the introduction , Feldman refuses to disclose the identity of Haim 's alleged rapist , who he claims is `` one of the most successful people in the entertainment industry . '' `` You ca n't go around publicly accusing industry titans without expecting to find yourself in the middle of a nasty lawsuit , '' writes Feldman , `` to say nothing of the potential threat to my career , as well as to the personal safety of myself and my son . ''

Coreyography acts in part as a warning to parents pushing their children into show business . Feldman claimed on a 2011 episode of Nightline and repeats in the book that the `` number one problem in Hollywood was , and is , and always will be pedophilia . `` 0 .
