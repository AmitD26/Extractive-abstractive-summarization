Just our luck .

`` A CME ... has been observed moving at a flank from Earth and a glancing blow to Earth from this event is expected on June 13 , '' said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in a statement . `` An outside chance of at most G1 -LRB- Minor -RRB- Geomagnetic storms remains in the forecast . ''

Translation : Despite the ominous `` glancing blow '' language , there 's no reason to be alarmed . The disruption of communication systems in the atmosphere is still unlikely , even with the impending solar storms .

People in remote areas of the Northern Hemisphere may even get a light show Friday night . Some scientists believe the storms will produce brightly colored auroras visible in the night sky , although others disagree .

Tony Phillips , curator of SpaceWeather.com , analyzed the last 17 Friday the 13ths `` for fun '' in response to a CNN request . He concluded that Friday 's solar-related activity was an outlier .

`` Of course , there is no actual correlation between solar flares and Friday the 13th , '' he said in an e-mail to CNN . '' -LRB- But -RRB- today ... is shaping up to be the most active of the past 10 years , albeit not by a wide margin . Friday the 13th in May 2005 was similar . ''

Phillips , who is also production editor for science at NASA , categorized only four Friday the 13ths in the last decade as `` high solar activity . ''

Thus , NOAA remains on watch .

According to its website , `` forecasters are keeping a close eye on the Sun and we will update you should conditions warrant it . ''

Solar activity varies in its intensity , but there has been an uptick in solar flares and related episodes in recent years . This is not a surprise . This week , NASA released a statement dubbing this new solar activity a natural occurrence and part of the star 's cycle of life .

They called it a `` mini-max . '' Because , historically speaking , it 's not that bad .

Well , maybe we are lucky after all .
