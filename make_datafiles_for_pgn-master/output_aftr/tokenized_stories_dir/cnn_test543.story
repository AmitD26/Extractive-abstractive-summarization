-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tech visionary Elon Musk made headlines when he said recently that artificial intelligence is like `` summoning the demon '' and may well be humanity 's `` biggest existential threat . '' Just this month , researchers in Japan announced they had created a software system that could outperform the average Japanese high school student on a standardized college entrance exam . In other words , the machines are catching up to humans in intelligence .

Concerns about A.I. and robots can be divided into two broad categories and framed as questions . First , will the machines take our jobs and destroy our livelihoods ? Second , do we have to worry that advanced artificial intelligence could truly threaten humanity , perhaps by acting to destroy us -LRB- as in the `` Terminator '' movies -RRB- or enslave us -LRB- as in the `` Matrix '' series -RRB- .

The reality is that most people in our workforce are employed in occupations that are on some level fundamentally routine and predicable . Most people come to work and , regardless of their job title or industry , tend to face the same basic types of challenges again and again . Just as a trainee might learn to do a job by carefully observing everything done by an experienced worker , rapidly improving machine learning algorithms seem likely to eventually figure out how to do a great many jobs .

Many people remain very skeptical that progress will ever result in a significant unemployment problem . So far , history is on their side . The classic example of technological disruption is the mechanization of agriculture . In the United States , most people once worked on farms . Now the number is roughly 2 % of the population . Millions of jobs were lost , and yet we are clearly better off ; food is much cheaper and workers moved on to often more fulfilling jobs in other industries . The farm workers of yesteryear were able to transition into a rising manufacturing sector and later into service industries .

Technology will certainly create new industries , but there is little reason to expect they will need many workers . We can get some idea of how the future is likely to look by examining one of the most successful technology companies . Google , for example , has become enormously influential and achieved a staggering market valuation with a workforce of only about 50,000 people . That 's roughly half the number of jobs the U.S. economy needs to create in a single month , just to keep pace with growth in the population .

It is entirely possible that accelerating computer power coupled with advances in brain science may eventually result in a true thinking machine . Many researchers believe that such a truly advanced A.I. would be driven to turn its intellectual energies inward , repeatedly improving its own design and making itself even smarter . The result could be an `` intelligence explosion '' culminating in a silicon-based mind hundreds or even thousands of times more intelligent than any human being . And there is , of course , no guarantee that this new alien intelligence would be especially concerned about the welfare of humanity .

The chance that we 'll see a true thinking machine anytime soon is small . Yet , the magnitude of the disruption -- and potential threat -- that would result is so large that the prospect should not be ignored .

For now , though , the pressing question is : How do we adapt our economy and society to a future in which machines do much of the work now performed by people ? Will humans go the way of horses ?
