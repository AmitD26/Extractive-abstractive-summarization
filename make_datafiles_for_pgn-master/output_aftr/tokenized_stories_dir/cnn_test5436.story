At issue is whether Congress may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is otherwise the domain of the states . Carol Anne Bond was given a long prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons . She would have gotten a much shorter sentence under state law .

Professor accused of poisoning wife

Bond , a native of Barbados , lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist . As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : `` Bond was excited when her closest friend , Myrlinda Haynes , announced she was pregnant . Bond 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , Clifford Bond , was the child 's father . She vowed revenge . ''

While suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb , Haynes grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder . After getting little help from local police , in 2007 she called postal inspectors , who set up surveillance cameras . Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler , court records show . She was soon arrested .

Bond admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill Haynes , but only wanted to cause her `` an uncomfortable rash . '' The defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an `` emotional breakdown '' that made her respond in such a shocking fashion .

When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed . She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution . She was released in August 2012 .

During Tuesday 's lively hour of arguments , Bond 's lawyer , Paul Clement , called the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act an `` odd statute '' that clearly exceeds congressional authority . He said the treaty was designed to deal with `` warlike '' behavior , not `` ordinary '' poisoning cases .

`` I do n't think that nation-states poison romantic rivals , attempt to commit suicide , or try to get rodents out of their houses '' using chemicals that might have everyday non-criminal uses , he said , like vinegar .

Justice Elena Kagan was unconvinced . `` You are imagining a world in which judges day-to-day try to get inside the head of treaty makers , '' where judges might say : `` We understand that there 's a national interest in regulating sarin gas , but we do n't think that there 's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical down the line . It seems to me a completely indeterminate test '' for judges to delineate `` what is in the national and international interest . ''

Solicitor General Donald Verrilli agreed , defending the treaty and law by saying , `` There ca n't be a ` too local ' exception to the treaty power . ''

`` It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution , '' against Bond , said Justice Anthony Kennedy . `` But let 's leave it at that . '' The remark brought laughter in the courtroom , but Kennedy clearly was not joking .

Test your knowledge of the U.S. Supreme Court

Justice Antonin Scalia used the issue to delve into another controversial issue .

`` Let 's assume that an international treaty is approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the President , which requires states to approve same-sex marriage . All right ? '' he said . `` Now , if that were a self-executing treaty , same sex marriage would have to be approved by every state . If it is not self-executing , however , it will be up to Congress to produce that result , and Congress would do it by having a federal marriage law . ''

The conservative Scalia said to do so would be `` dragging the Congress into areas where it has never been before . ''

Justice Stephen Breyer also worried about the scope of federal power .

`` In principle your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate , not the House , to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution , '' he told Verrilli , citing a 1920 high court precedent giving Congress the power to enact treaties , even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws . `` And I doubt that in that document the Framers -LRB- of the Constitution -RRB- intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything . ''

`` I am worried about that and I think others are , too , '' the left-leaning Breyer added .

Among those attending the arguments was former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor .

Justices prepare for hot-button cases - and hot internal rhetoric

There are about a thousand treaties signed by the United States currently on the books .

Many academics and lawmakers hope the majority right-leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th Amendment , which states , `` The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ''

And it is not just felonies . Areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulations , taxation , health care , and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision .

Some of Bond 's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh , creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety . They see Bond as an unexpected hero in the fight to return `` the power back to the people . ''
