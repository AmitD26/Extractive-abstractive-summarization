Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China reiterated its opposition Wednesday to the publication of air pollution readings in Chinese cities by foreign embassies and dismissed suggestions that it release similar figures for U.S. cities .

`` Foreign embassies and consulates in China do n't have the legal authority to monitor China 's environment or release relevant data , nor do they have the professional capabilities or conditions to do so , '' said Liu Weimin , a Foreign Ministry spokesman , at a daily press briefing . `` We hope relevant foreign embassies and consulates will comply with universally recognized international conventions as well as Chinese laws and stop such irresponsible actions . ''

U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the U.S. Embassy and consulates in China provide air pollution information to the American community so that `` it can use to make better daily decisions regarding the safety of outdoor activities . ''

`` We are not interested , '' he said .

Vice Minister of Environmental Protection Wu Xiaoqing said Tuesday that , by monitoring China 's air pollution and releasing relevant data , foreign embassies have violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations , as well as environmental protection laws and regulations of China .

According to the EPA , the `` fine '' particulate matter is believed to pose the greatest health risk because it can lodge deeply in human lungs . China has traditionally monitored pollution at a less-rigorous PM 10 standard , which refers to larger particulates of 10 micrometers or less in diameter , which accumulate in the respiratory system when inhaled .

Wu said that it is `` obviously inappropriate '' to be applying foreign standards to the local landscape and that readings determined from a single monitoring station are unscientific .

But under pressure to improve its notoriously poor air quality , China began releasing PM 2.5 data for Beijing in January . According to China Daily , Wu said that 74 major cities had been told to raise their monitoring standards to PM 2.5 by the end of October and release data by the end of the year . These rent moves build upon revised air quality policies that require an index of PM 2.5 be implemented nationwide by January 1 , 2016 .
