-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Golfer Tiger Woods apologized Wednesday for `` transgressions '' that let his family down -- the same day a gossip magazine published a report alleging he had an affair .

`` I have let my family down and I regret those transgressions with all of my heart . I have not been true to my values and the behavior my family deserves , '' he said in a statement on his official Web site .

US Weekly magazine printed a report Wednesday alleging that Woods had an affair with Jaimee Grubbs , whom it identified as a 24-year-old cocktail waitress . The magazine also published what it says is a voice mail message from Woods to Grubbs .

`` Hey , it 's Tiger , '' a man says in the recording . `` I need you to do me a huge favor . Can you please take your name off your phone ? My wife went through my phone and may be calling you .

CNN could not independently confirm that the voice on the recording was Woods .

Attention has been focused on Woods since he crashed his SUV outside his Florida home last week . Investigators say he crashed the vehicle into a fire hydrant and tree . Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck , and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions . What do you think about the whole Tiger saga ?

The Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday that it cited Woods for careless driving -- the golfer paid a $ 164 fine -- and closed its investigation .

The golfer said Wednesday that he was `` dismayed to realize the full extent of what tabloid scrutiny really means '' for him , his wife , model Elin Nordegren , and their children -- a 2-year old daughter , Sam , and a 9-month old son , Charlie .

`` For the last week , my family and I have been hounded to expose intimate details of our personal lives . The stories in particular that physical violence played any role in the car accident were utterly false and malicious . Elin has always done more to support our family and shown more grace than anyone could possibly expect . ''

The 33-year-old golf phenomenon has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times , as well as three U.S. Open titles .
