All apply to Barack Obama 's presidency as it passes the 2,000-day mark , raising questions about the viability of what used to be known as conventional political wisdom .

A strengthening economy and robust stock market traditionally mean general public satisfaction with government . Bringing soldiers home from war zones has always boosted presidential popularity .

A CNN compilation of recent national polls indicates only 41 % of Americans approve of Obama 's handling of the job , down 6 percentage points from a year ago and matching the low of the past 12 months .

Here 's a closer look at some of the issues involved :

1 -RRB- Jobs , but not for everyone

A White House statement noted the 288,000 jobs created in June contributed to the strongest start to a year since 1999 and the best six-month period overall since 2006 .

In addition , the job growth last month spread across the economy instead of coming mostly from low-paying sectors such as food and drink , as occurred previously , said CNN Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans .

`` My hope is that the American people look at today 's news and understand that , in fact , we are making strides , '' he said .

2 -RRB- Who benefits from a strong stock market ?

However , happiness on Wall Street does n't translate directly to satisfaction on Main Street , noted CNN Business Correspondent Alison Kosik .

`` Only about half of Americans invest in stocks , '' so the gains do n't matter to a lot of people , Kosik said , adding that the stock market `` is n't the economy . ''

3 -RRB- Wars ending , sort of

Obama campaigned twice on ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wars started by his predecessor , and he is on track to fulfill that promise .

However , myriad issues cloud the return home of the troops .

The lightning advance by Sunni militants through northern Iraq threatens renewed civil war and partition , raising fears of a jihadist-controlled safe haven for terrorists threatening U.S. interests .

The Obama administration blames Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki for his country 's collapse , saying the Shiite leader rejected an agreement to keep U.S. forces in the country and marginalized Sunni and Kurd populations in Iraq .

Now Obama is sending U.S. forces back to Iraq , by the hundreds so far , to bolster security and advise Iraqi forces . The label of military advisers evokes memories of how the Vietnam War started .

The crisis reported by CNN since November already has brought the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki , various investigations and a White House report that essentially said the entire department needed an overhaul .

4 -RRB- Governing woes

As expected , congressional Republicans have mounted a series of investigations , some necessary and others intended to wring as much political capital out of the controversies as possible heading up to the November elections and beyond .

They also adopted obstructionist tactics after getting overrun by Democratic majorities in Obama 's first term on transformative legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reforms .

The result : a gridlocked Congress of political one-upmanship , and a President who appears to have thrown up his hands in disgust by promising to act on his own as much as he can .

`` We can make even more progress if Congress is willing to work with my administration and to set politics aside , at least occasionally , '' Obama said of Thursday 's job report .

No polling fireworks for Obama or Congress this July 4th

`` There 's no shortage of common ground where he can push his party 's leaders in the Senate to work with us , '' Boehner said in a swipe at legislative intransigence by Senate Democrats . `` Until he provides that leadership , he is simply part of the problem . ''

If any solace for Obama , polls show the public dislikes Congress more than him , with the CNN compilation of recent surveys showing 14 % approval for the legislators .

By seeking to blame Republicans and declaring his intent to govern by regulation instead of legislation , Obama turns off voters who want to see the President engaged and trying , said Wendy Schiller , a political scientist at Brown University .

`` The less Congress does , the more power the executive gets , '' Schiller observed .

5 -RRB- `` Nattering nabobs of negativism ''

Now Obama faces the resulting backlash -- a vitriolic right-wing media machine that feeds and enhances Republican attack politics .

From talk radio icon Rush Limbaugh to Fox News to the rest of an industry spawned in the past two-plus decades , the conservative messaging reflects the deep ideological divide in the country .

Obama has provided fodder to his detractors , getting cited for `` Lie of the Year '' in 2013 by PolitiFact.com for his oft-repeated , erroneous declaration that his health care reforms meant `` if you like your health care plan , you can keep it . ''
