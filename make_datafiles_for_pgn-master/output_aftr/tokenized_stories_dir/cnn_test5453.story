Tel Aviv , Israel -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said Sunday that he could be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani , but expressed wariness of other forces in the country .

`` Why not ? I do n't have enemies , '' he told CNN 's Richard Quest at a business conference in Tel Aviv , when asked whether he 'd be willing to have such a meeting .

Peres reiterated Israel 's position that it wo n't stand for Iran being a `` nuclear danger '' to the world , and that `` all options remain on the table to give weight to the words . ''

But Israel prefers a diplomatic solution , he said .

The Israeli presidency is largely a figurehead position . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leads the government . In Iran , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is in charge of the government .

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Netanyahu late last week . It was the first face-to-face meeting of U.S. and Israeli officials since the U.S. and five other world powers reached a six-month deal with Iran last month over its nuclear program .

Netanyahu wants to eliminate Iran 's nuclear capability entirely , rather than merely suspend and limit the country 's nuclear development .

`` The problem is what will happen in the coming six months . It 's a trial period , '' Peres said Sunday . `` President Obama said that for him also this is a trial and gave an estimate of 50-50 as to whether it will succeed . ''

`` The problems created over 35 years can not be resolved over a limited time . The best test to see whether we are capable of building trust or not is this nuclear issue , '' he said .
