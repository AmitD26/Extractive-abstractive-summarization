`` Just because I do n't look angry does n't mean I do n't have a whole lot of anger inside , '' Masters said . `` I do n't want to get drunk . People get drunk , they have no self control . I do n't want to get mad or do anything stupid or say something stupid . I 'd rather just stay sober . ''

He also ca n't shake his anger at one investigator in particular .

Broderick did not return a call Wednesday to his office . His answering machine said he would not be checking messages until the end of the month .

Michael Goodbee , one of the special prosecutors handling the Masters hearings , said in court that Broderick was out of town on a family emergency . Broderick told CNN in November , before the DNA evidence was confirmed , that he still believed Masters was the killer . The key players ''

He was also the first person to find Hettrick 's body . He did n't immediately report it , he said , because he thought it was a mannequin and someone was playing a prank .

`` It 's just unbelievable because here 's all these stories and drawings that have no nexus with the crime . There 's no one being stabbed in the back . There 's no one being sexually mutilated , '' he said . `` The only thing they had in common with this crime is there was violence . ''

Lots of kids in high school sketch violent scenes and scribe violent stories , Masters said . Go to any high school , he said , and you 'll likely find similar artwork and writings .

`` They won their case by assassinating my character , '' he said .

Masters said he 's been angry for years . Though his father Clyde , who died while Masters was in prison , taught him to never show his emotions , his fellow inmates were aware of his bitterness , he said .

His frustration began to wane when the media started reporting on his case about six months ago . The letters he received in prison and support from fellow inmates helped , he said , but the anger is `` still going to be there . There 's no way to get around that . It 's still inside . ''

`` We 'll cooperate with them and give them anything they want and then they 'll see that you did n't have anything to do with this and they 'll move on , '' Masters recalled his father telling him in 1987 . `` It turns out that by cooperating with them it just encouraged them , because I was the easiest suspect to go after . ''

Clyde Masters knew his son had n't committed the crime , but he thought police were there to help , Masters said . His father was in the Navy for 22 years and felt you should obey authority , he added .

`` Well , you know what ? You should n't always submit to authority . Our country would n't exist if everyone submitted to authority , '' he said . `` It 's just a shame Dad did n't know how the system was . ''

In a news conference after his release , Masters said he wanted only to see his family . He was whisked away from the courthouse to the local Elks Lodge , which his aunts and uncles had rented . At the party , he met some of his younger relatives for the first time .

His first meal was two pieces of grocery store fried chicken -- which he ate simultaneously -- and a glass of lemonade . The chicken was `` fantastic , '' he said .

`` I did n't even eat anything else with it . I just had two pieces of chicken there and people are shaking my hand and leaving like , ` Ugh , I got grease on my hand , ' '' he said with a chuckle . `` Sorry . ''

During visits with family members , he learned how much the world had changed since he was locked up . Everyone had high-tech cell phones with cameras . His cousins and nephews were showing him YouTube and their MySpace pages .

Despite the changes all around him , the changes within him seem negligible , he said .

`` I do n't feel a whole lot different other than a lot of emotional baggage , '' he said . `` Other people would be able to tell you better than I would how much I 've changed . ''

`` You ca n't get any time back , '' he said , quipping , `` My youth and my hair , gone . ''

`` For me , it 's not over until it 's over . They have n't dismissed any charges . I 'm out on bond , so I 'm not completely free yet , '' he said .

`` Whatever happens , happens . We 're ready . '' E-mail to a friend
