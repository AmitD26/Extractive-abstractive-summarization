The Wimbledon champion has come into the U.S. Open after a morale boosting victory in the preceding New Haven tournament and again looked impressive .

But there was a upset defeat for Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova , who was stunned by 15-year-old American Catherine Bellis 6-1 4-6 6-4 .

Bellis becomes the youngest winner at the U.S. Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996 as she beat the 12th seed , who has endured a miserable summer on the hard courts .

Govortsov had three break points at 2-2 in the first set but could not convert and won just a single game thereafter .

Bouchard hit 19 winners overall and few unforced errors to get another grand slam campaign rolling .

Former world number one Ana Ivanovic , seeded eighth , opened her campaign with a 6-3 6-0 win over American Alison Riske .

`` Last year has been amazing change for me . I learned a lot about myself , about my goals , who I am as a person and who I want to be .

`` This is what I had to discover -- what was my goal , '' she told gathered reporters .

Kuznetsova was edged out 3-6 6-2 7-6 in two hours 19 minutes .

Williams , top seed in the women 's tournament and Swiss maestro Roger Federer were opening their campaigns in the night session later Tuesday .
