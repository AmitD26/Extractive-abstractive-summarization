She wrote about the experience in a book , `` Warrior Princess : A U.S. Navy SEAL 's Journey to Coming out Transgender . ''

Trapped in a man 's body

Beck deployed 13 times , serving in places such as Bosnia , Afghanistan and Iraq . She earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart along the way .

Though she 's felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school , Beck did n't come out until after she left the military in 2011 .

Doing so earlier would have been too big a risk .

`` That 's a chance that if I took it , I might be dead today , '' she said .

` No one ever met the real me '

Beck explains her years of hiding as living like an onion .

Deep down , under various layers , or skins , she hid her female persona .

`` It is a constant , but as you suppress and as you bottle it up , it 's not like on that surface , '' she said .

`` You would never notice it because I can push it so deep , but then it does kinda , like , it gnaws at you . So it 's always there . ''

Looking back , Beck believes she might have wanted to become a SEAL because they are `` the toughest of the tough . ''

She thought : `` I could totally make it go away if I could be at that top level . ... Maybe I could cure myself . ''

And for her entire career , Beck kept her mouth shut .

`` No one ever met the real me , '' she said .

`` I gave true brotherhood . I did my best , 150 % all the time , and I gave strength and honor and my full brotherhood to every military person I ever worked with . ''
