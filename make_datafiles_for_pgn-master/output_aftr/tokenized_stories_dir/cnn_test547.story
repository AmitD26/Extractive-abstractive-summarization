The Canadian-born Nielsen 's career reached back into the early days of television , when he made frequent appearances on live drama series like `` Goodyear Playhouse . ''

Much of that changed in 1980 , when he was cast as a doctor aboard an endangered jetliner in the gag-a-minute disaster-movie parody `` Airplane ! ''

Nielsen 's deadpan response to the question `` Surely , you ca n't be serious ? '' with `` I am serious -- and do n't call me Shirley '' helped launch a second career .

The film 's producers went on to cast him in their short-lived television series `` Police Squad ! ''

He reprised that show 's bumbling lead character , Lt. Frank Drebin , a decade later in three `` Naked Gun '' movies , in which he shared the screen with O.J. Simpson and Priscilla Presley .
