-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the new school year approaches , President Obama has been traveling around talking about the high cost of education . In a speech given on August 22 in Syracuse , New York , he laid out a plan to rein in the costs , describing affordable and accessible education as `` Washington 's highest priority . ''

It 's impossible to be on a college campus -- especially a state university -- and not notice the impact of the student debt crisis . The debt weighs on our students . It is as if you could see it in their slumping postures and staggering gaits as they haul boulders and lug chains from class to class . Approximately 37 million students currently hold debt , averaging $ 27,500 per person and totaling over $ 1.1 trillion .

The truth is , if Jerry and I had had $ 27,000 of debt in 1978 , we would never have taken the risk of opening our first scoop shop . More likely than not , we would have been underemployed and buried in back payments .

According to the Center for Responsive Politics , Sallie Mae has donated over $ 1.26 million to federal candidates and parties in the last four election cycles and bankrolled $ 1.93 million dollars lobbying Congress in the first half 2013 .

Corporations like Sallie Mae borrow at dirt cheap interest rates -LRB- subsidized between .23 % and .34 % -RRB- from the Federal Home Loan banks . In contrast , undergraduate students borrow at an adjustable 3.85 % and graduate students borrow at an adjustable 5.4 % .

That 's a sweetheart deal for Sallie Mae which raked in $ 2.5 billion in interest payments from student loans last year , but a terrible deal for students .

It 's time to dam the deluge of cash and corporate influence in Washington once and for all . Whether you 're a college student , a debt holder , a parent or simply someone concerned about the future of our country , you can help .

There is a stampede rumbling across the country to amend the Constitution to declare : 1 -RRB- Money is not free speech ; and 2 -RRB- Corporation are not people .

Thanks to the leadership by groups like People for the American Way , Move to Amend , Common Cause , Free Speech for People and Public Citizen , 16 states have passed referendums calling on Congress to take action and over 150 members of Congress support the amendment strategy .

As the new school semester begins , pick up a stamp and help take back our campus and take back Congress . This is our future and our fight to win .
