The new law -- passed by legislators and signed hours later on Tuesday -- not only signals a change in America 's so-called Rust Belt , but is also the latest sign that the power of organized labor is shrinking in the United States .

American unions already have a fraction of the influence they did a few decades ago . Only about 12 % of workers are union members , down from 20 % in 1983 , according to federal data . In the private sector , the plunge has been even steeper : union membership has dropped from 17 % in 1983 to 7 % today .

That 's partly because certain unionized industries have become a smaller part of the overall work force , particularly in manufacturing . It 's also a result of government action .

America 's up and down relationship with unions

Union supporters in Michigan did n't go down without a fight . They staged a rally outside the state capitol in Lansing as lawmakers voted .

`` People need to wake up and fight , '' teacher Sarah Zigler said at Tuesday 's rally . `` People need to realize what unions have done for them . Who gave people the 40-hour work week ? Who fought for workplace safety ? Who brought you the weekend ? Who brought you workers comp ? Who gave people overtime pay ? ''

`` Unions ! '' protesters shouted after each of her questions .

Faces of the ` right to work ' protest

But unions have long remained a force to be reckoned with . Today , Michigan becomes the latest state in the Rust Belt , the heart of America 's manufacturing industry , to chip away at their power .

Earlier this year , Wisconsin had its own showdown over the power of unions when Gov. Scott Walker -- who opposes unions -- overcame an attempt to recall him from office . The failed recall vote was fueled by anger over laws he pushed that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions . Indiana also passed a right-to-work law this year .

So why the downfall of American unions ? That depends on who you ask .

Blaming big business

Big businesses are behind campaigns to squelch organized labor , and they are seeing some success , according to Gordon Lafer , a political science professor and opponent of right-to-work laws .

What right to work really means

`` The anti-union campaigns of the last three years , starting with Wisconsin , have really been driven ... by big national organizations and money , '' said Lafer , a union member and who teaches labor studies at the University of Oregon .

These campaigns stigmatize unions and encourage people who are unemployed to resent unions rather than big business leaders , he argued .

`` Their fear is populism , '' he said , referring to those who are `` at the top of the economy , during downward mobility . ''

It 's the economy

`` Unions have lost power in the private sector over time because of competition , globalization , and the fact that they do n't add any value to worker productivity , '' said Chris Edwards , an economist with the Cato Institute and a fan of right-to-work laws .

Businesses are responding to today 's realities and `` ca n't pay above-market wages forever , '' he said . `` So either they will move work abroad or they will automate to try to get rid of as many workers as they can . ''

To build jobs in America , Edwards said businesses ca n't be beholden to mandatory collective bargaining , which can increase wages and expenses without increasing profits .

`` Unions are going the way of the dinosaur in the U.S. private sector , which is a good thing for workers and businesses because it will make America more competitive , '' he said . `` If right-to-work laws extend to the 50 states , then private sector unions will be dead in America . ''

The decline in union strength is also tied to the political battle between Democrats and Republicans .

`` There has been a recognition by both the unions and people who are not happy with unions in the last 12 years or so that unions have been fundamentally the powerhouse between the Democratic party and their electoral math , '' said Linda Kaboolian , lecturer on public policy with Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government .

Union organizers did a great deal to push for President Barack Obama 's re-election in key states , including Michigan . The president himself paid a visit to the state this week , voicing his opposition to the state 's right-to-work measure .

`` What we should n't do is take away your rights to bargain for better wages , '' Obama told workers . `` These so called right to work laws do n't have to do with economics , they have to do with politics . ''

James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation rejected the idea that unions ' decline are tied to American politics .

He said the changes are being driven `` by efforts to attract business , '' not an underhanded political effort , he says .
