-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I was introduced to pop -- soda for you Southerners -- at a young age .

As a kid , my drink of choice was Mountain Dew . I loved the taste of an ice cold Dew on a hot summer day . A lot of my favorite memories are associated with its sweet taste .

10 reasons to give up diet soda

I was aware of all the health problems that have been linked to drinking pop . It never stopped me . The empty calories , the dangers of sugar and artificial sweeteners could n't sway me . I had to have it .

After my first dose in the morning , I crashed a few hours later . I experienced huge energy swings throughout the day . I had acid reflux disease . But those could n't be because of what I drank , could it ?

This habit had a trickle-down effect to my children . I had it in the house at all times . My girlfriend kept it in her house as well . But it was n't a habit I wanted my two teenage girls starting up . I wanted to be a better role model . My words do n't hold much value if I am drinking what I tell them that they can not , I thought .

How the ` Sassy Six ' came to be

That day , I decided to do the unthinkable : I quit drinking pop .

Do n't assume this has been easy for me . I struggle with the thought of it . I miss it and can still taste it six weeks later . Giving up pop has been one of the most difficult things I have done , and yet it 's also one of the healthiest .

The desire to change myself into a healthier version became more important than the desire to drink pop . It took me a while to realize that I needed to make that change . I wish I had listened to my body sooner !

I challenge you to do the same . Will you give up pop with me ? Or make another small change in order to be healthier ? Tell me your plan in the comments below , and share your success with me on Twitter @TriHardMike .
