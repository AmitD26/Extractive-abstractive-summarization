LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British-led military operation meant to clear the Taliban from parts of Afghanistan has succeeded , UK officials said Monday .

NATO and its Afghan allies launched Operation Panther 's Claw to flush the Taliban from parts of southern Helmand Province before Afghan presidential elections next month .

Major fighting is mostly over , and the military will now focus on `` holding '' the areas that have been cleared of Taliban so they do not return , Lt. Gen. Simon Mayall said in a briefing . The operation 's success will enable up to 80,000 people in Helmand to vote .

`` Panther 's Claw has been extremely successful , '' said Brigadier Tim Radford , the top British military commander for the operation . `` There will be many Taliban who will not be fighting any more . ''

The British gave several weeks ' warning that they were planning to attack , he said , both to exert psychological pressure on the Taliban and to give civilians a chance to flee .

As a result , `` quite a few Taliban managed to get away , '' Radford said . `` They will always get away and they will always come back in . ''

Mayall , the deputy chief of the British Defence Staff for Operations , said the challenge now was to convince local people that the Afghan government and its allies could protect them from the Taliban .

The Taliban `` are going to assume that we are going to lose interest and move on , '' he said .

NATO forces were going to `` stay in Afghanistan for a very long time , '' he said , adding that active NATO-led fighting should `` tail off '' as Afghan security forces develop the ability to fight the Taliban themselves .

Panther 's Claw focused on the area around the town of Babaji in Helmand Province .

At least 20 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan this month , sparking intense debate in Britain about the country 's military role there .

The British-led operation involved about 3,000 troops -- mostly from the British military but also with Afghan , Danish and Estonian forces , the British Ministry of Defence said in a written statement . The operation started in mid-June with an air assault along a canal about 16 kilometers -LRB- 10 miles -RRB- north of the city of Lashkar Gah , the ministry said .
