-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The creators of the `` Call of Duty '' video game franchise on Monday filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega , who says the 2012 video game `` Call of Duty : Black Ops II '' has damaged his reputation .

Noriega , 80 , is serving a prison sentence in Panama after being convicted of drug trafficking , money laundering and killing political opponents .

Creators of the video game called the lawsuit `` frivolous '' and filed the motion to dismiss it on the ground that Noriega 's portrayal in the game is protected by the First Amendment .

`` What 's astonishing is that Manuel Noriega , a notorious dictator who is in prison for the heinous crimes he committed , is upset about being portrayed as a criminal and enemy of the state in the game Call of Duty . Quite simply , it 's absurd , '' said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , attorney for the video game creator , Activision Blizzard Inc. .

Noriega , 80 , filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in July . In it , he argues that his portrayal `` as a kidnapper , murderer and enemy of the state '' in the 2012 video game damaged his reputation . The company used his image and name in order to make money , the lawsuit says ; therefore , he 's entitled to a share of the profits .

But while North did his own voiceover for the game and acted as an adviser , Noriega said in the July lawsuit that he was n't consulted -- or compensated -- for the use of his likeness .

`` Call of Duty '' video games take storylines from current headlines , and its characters are based on historical figures , from former Cuban leader Fidel Castro to David Petraeus , the retired general and former CIA director .

Giuliani called Noriega 's lawsuit `` an assault on a whole art form -- historical fiction . ''

`` If this were allowed , it would be like -LRB- former al Qaeda leader Osama -RRB- bin Laden 's family suing for ` Zero Dark Thirty , ' '' Giuliani said . `` Obviously that should n't be allowed . ''

Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering , laundering drug money and drug trafficking . He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar 's notorious Medellin cartel and , in the process , amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune .

In 2010 , a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros -LRB- $ 2.9 million -RRB- through banks there . He was ordered to pay the money back .

In Panama , where he was convicted of killing political opponents , he has been hospitalized several times since he returned in 2011 to serve out his prison sentence .

CNN 's Catherine E. Shoichet , Stella Chan and Rafael Romo contributed to this report .
