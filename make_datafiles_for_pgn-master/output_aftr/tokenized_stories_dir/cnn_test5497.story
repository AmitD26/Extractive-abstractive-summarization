-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For some time , sugary soft drinks have been under attack as a major contributor to the obesity epidemic plaguing the nation , if not the world . As a result , sales of regular soft drinks have been dropping . Apparently , sales of diet soft drinks have taken even more of a hit .

So it comes as no surprise that Coca-Cola is planning to launch a new ad campaign defending -- and promoting -- its diet soft drinks .

The ads are going to focus on the safety of artificial sweeteners , or aspartame , in diet soda . Coca-Cola must believe that some of the fall in sales is due to concerns over the health effects of artificial sweeteners .

Here 's the thing : There 's a lot of science out there , and it 's hard to say that aspartame holds much of a health risk .

Further work using data from the National Cancer Institute showed that the increase in brain tumors really began in 1973 , long before aspartame was introduced . Moreover , the increases in incidence of cancer were seen primarily in the elderly , which as a group , was not the major consumer of diet soda .

Some research has shown that drinking artificially sweetened beverages does n't promote weight loss , or even promotes weight gain . More often than not , this is because people wind up overcompensating for the calorie savings they think they 're getting by switching beverages -LRB- think of the person who orders dessert as a reward for having diet soda -RRB- . But in those cases it 's not the diet beverage that caused weight gain ; it 's dieters ' behavior .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll .
