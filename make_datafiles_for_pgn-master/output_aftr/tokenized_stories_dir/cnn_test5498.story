-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I recently interviewed more than 60 chief executives of very large global companies . Virtually all of them said that recruiting and promoting general managers with true leadership potential was the key ingredient to their organization 's long-term success . Fair enough . But the CEOs were then quick to admit that this task is much easier said than done .

The short answer is , we focus on all the wrong things , like a candidate 's charm , their stellar résumé or their academic credentials . None of this has any bearing on leadership potential . And despite claims to the contrary , even a candidate 's past results have little bearing on whether the promoted individual will succeed once promoted .

Want to be a leader ? Act like one

At best , a `` track record '' tells only half of the story . In a new position , the candidate will have to face new obstacles , deal with a new team , manage more people introduce new products and do it all without a clear road map .

So what qualities should you focus on before handing out the next big promotion or making big promotion decision ? One thing is certain : You better get it right . Nothing short of your reputation , and your organization 's success , are at stake .

It all starts with integrity . Like a foundation for any well-constructed house , integrity is the core foundation for leadership effectiveness . It is a blend of honesty , consistency and ethics . Once integrity is squandered or even thrown into doubt , it is very hard for a leader to regain the trust of his or her troops .

Yet integrity alone does n't matter without several other key attributes . Passion , for example , enables a leader to keep moving forward even in tough times .

Jeff Bezos , the CEO of Amazon , was ridiculed in 2001 for clinging to a company that many called `` Amazon.bomb . '' It is now valued at $ 89 billion . Bezos told me that it was his inner passion that fueled his drive to keep pushing forward even in the darkest days of the dot-com crash , when the company was teetering on the brink of collapse .

Courage

Vision

Steve Jobs : How to lead with purpose

Does she ask good questions ? Can she prioritize and make difficult tradeoffs ? Does she know where to focus and where not to waste her time and energy ? Even when looking at an individual piece of the problem , does she keep the entire chessboard in mind , recognizing the potential unintended consequences of her decisions ? Judgment is needed to develop a strategy that will enable the organization to achieve its vision .

If a potential employee does n't have empathy , they have very little chance of getting these , and many other , important constituents on their side . Lack of empathy is a key reason why otherwise analytically brilliant leaders often come up short .

Emotional intelligence

While empathy is externally focused , another key leadership attribute , emotional intelligence , is internally focused . An emotionally intelligent leader habitually takes a hard , honest look at himself and accurately discerns his strengths , weaknesses and blind spots . Putting personal pride aside , he actively solicits the input of others and incorporates the team 's best ideas into the overall action plan .

Without emotional intelligence , hubris sets in , and a leader will overestimate his own ability and alienate others . Even though the hubris may convince him that he can bite off more than he can chew , subordinates will not be so blind . A leader who continuously lets down his or her team wo n't stay in the organization 's good graces for long . From my vantage point , a lack of emotional intelligence is probably the top derailer of previously successful managers moving into fundamentally new and ambiguous roles .
