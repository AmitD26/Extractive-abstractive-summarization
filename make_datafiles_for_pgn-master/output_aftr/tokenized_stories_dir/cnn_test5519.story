Nairobi , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The villagers ' faces light up as Evans Wadongo arrives . Men , women and children sing and gather around as he shows how his invention -- a solar-powered LED lantern -- will soon light up their homes .

`` These families , they are so poor . They do n't have electricity , '' said Wadongo , a native of rural Kenya . `` It 's only kerosene and firewood that they use for lighting , cooking .

`` The amount of money that every household uses to buy kerosene every day -- if they can just save that money , they can be able to buy food . ''

Wadongo , 23 , not only is giving his country 's rural families a way to replace the smoky kerosene and firelight with solar power , he says he also hopes his invention will ultimately improve education and reduce poverty and hunger . And he 's providing it for free .

`` I could n't compete effectively with other kids who had access to lighting , '' he said . `` In every home in the village it was the same . Many children drop out of school for these reasons ... so they remain poor for the rest of their life . All along I was asking myself if there is anything that can be done to improve this situation . ''

In 2004 , while attending a Kenyan university for agriculture and technology , Wadongo found his answer . He was fiddling with a dorm experiment involving the timing of LED -LRB- light-emitting diode -RRB- Christmas lights when it struck him : The environmentally friendly light source could be used to light rural homes .

`` I knew it would have to be sourced by the sun to be useful to people in rural areas , '' he said , `` but -LSB- I -RSB- had never seen a solar panel small enough for individual homes . ''

Then , while walking home from visiting a friend , Wadongo stumbled upon a broken-off piece of a discarded solar panel . With it , he was able to light a small number of LEDs . His project -- Use Solar , Save Lives -- was born .

An artisan helped him design the solar lantern , which Wadongo calls MwangaBora -- Swahili for `` good light . ''

To help get the project started , Wadongo 's family and friends subsidized his student loans for two years . Production of the lanterns was slow until Wadongo attended a leadership training program sponsored by the nonprofit Sustainable Development for All-Kenya .

When the group heard about his MwangaBora , it immediately committed to help , eventually bringing Wadongo on as a partner and chairman of the board .

The group has helped reduce production costs to $ 20 per lantern . Costs are covered by donations . Volunteers help build the lanterns and work with local government and women 's groups to determine the communities most in need . The group sets a small percentage of the cost of each lamp to go toward the volunteers .

The group buys excess pieces of solar paneling , cut from commercially sold panels , in bulk from an overseas company . In an outdoor metal shop , Wadongo and volunteers hammer scrap metal for the frame of the lantern .

Wadongo estimates he 's distributed 10,000 lanterns -- and he has no plans for slowing down .

`` I want to reach out to as many rural communities as possible , '' he said . `` The impact is saving lives . ''

`` I just feel like it 's right , '' he said .
