-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alfred Pennine , longtime proprietor of Pennine Funeral Home in Providence , Rhode Island , may have taken a secret to his grave .

Investigators suspect that Pennine was telling families their loved ones had been buried or cremated , but then not following through and instead keeping the cremation and burial fees , Lapatin said .

Authorities are asking owners of storage units across the state to look through their records to see if they rented to Pennine or whether anything suspicious has been found inside , Lapatin said .

After Pennine committed suicide in July , another funeral director took the body to the Pennine funeral home and discovered five corpses and a fetus in a detached garage , Lapatin said .

The adults were so decomposed the gender could not be identified , Levesque said . The infant was believed to be a female .

The bodies were found by a man who had purchased the unit , which was auctioned because there was no payment on it for six months , Levesque said .

Authorities are not sure of the motive but suspect it was financial .

Lapatin said that in some instances , relatives of a dead person were given ashes after a supposed cremation when the remains were still in the funeral home garage .

Lapatin would not say if other funeral directors were being investigated but added that charges could be filed later .

`` The scope is a lot wider than Mr. Pennine , '' Lapatin said .

Pennine 's brother told CNN affiliate WJAR the family had no comment .
