-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- American University professor Adrienne Pine began her first day back in the classroom this semester the same way she has since her teaching career began : making sure her research was up to date , her notes reviewed , and the lecture she was about to give was ready . But before she left for school , she noticed her infant daughter was n't feeling well . Since her usual daycare center does n't allow children with fevers , Pine decided to bring her baby to class .

Pine , angered that her actions were seen as provocative , fired back -- hard -- on the website CounterPunch , saying she was `` annoyed that this would be considered newsworthy '' and that she `` had no intention of making a political statement or shocking students . I merely had a sick baby who I could n't leave at daycare on the first day of class . ... As it turned out , the baby got hungry , so I had to feed it during lecture . End of story . ''

Today professor Pine spoke with CNN : `` Frankly I felt , and I continue to feel , that the most professional thing I could do was to carry out the class with as few as possible interruptions . Leaving class for 10 minutes would have been a serious interruption for my students . And I also feel that since I 've been breastfeeding inp public in every place possible -- in buses , on planes -- I did n't realize the degree to which people are afraid of breasts in this country and in particular , in the workplace . ''

American University , which today acknowledged it does not offer any emergency backup child care for its faculty or staff , says this controversy has given rise to a much-needed internal debate . `` We want our faculty to be the best teachers and scholars possible and , at the same time , we are sympathetic to the need for work-life balance . Now that this important question has been raised , we consider it healthy to discuss it and we are indeed addressing it in our community , '' said Phyllis Peres , senior vice provost and dean of Academic Affairs .

Latch on NYC : In support of breastfeeding

Missing in all this finger-wagging is a discussion about access to emergency backup child care for working parents . Is there enough , and if not , should employers of all stripes -- public , private , big , small -- be compelled to offer more ? And if it 's the child who is sick , and not the babysitter , what provisions do these centers reasonably need to provide ?

According to the latest Families and Work Institute National Study of Employers , only 6 % of companies surveyed in 2005 offered backup child care . This year , the number has dropped to 3 % .

Breastfeeding intuitive and easy ? No !

There does seem to be good news in all this , particularly for professor Pine . Between 2009 and 2011 , Bright Horizons reports , the field of higher education has seen the second fastest growth rate of all industries it serves in terms of number of employees covered by backup child care . Liz Kennedy , a spokeswoman for the company says , `` One of the reasons we are seeing a shift in demand for backup care in higher ed is the changing demographic makeup of college faculty and professors . '' And if American University chooses to move in that direction , professor Pine might feel she has real backup child care options as a working parent , instead of believing , as she currently seems to , that she has no choice at all .
