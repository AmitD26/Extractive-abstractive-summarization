Still packing 65 mph winds , the storm lashed the region with torrential rains and the potential for flash flooding , according to the National Hurricane Center . Rainfall amounts of 6-12 inches are forecast , with isolated amounts of up to 18 inches .

The storm left stunned residents and tourists in its wake .

Sarah McKinney , who was in Cabo San Lucas on maternity leave from her job in Arkansas when the then-Category 3 storm hit with 125 mph winds Sunday night , tweeted photos of the wreckage Monday : the collapsed roof of a restaurant , a shuttle van flipped over , a resort 's swimming pool pushed into the ocean .

`` 2 days ago we walked along the marina happy with not a care in the world , '' she said . `` Today I 'm shocked and saddened . ''

Early Tuesday the storm was about 25 miles -LRB- 40 km -RRB- west-northwest of Santa Rosalina , Mexico , packing winds of 65 mph -LRB- 100 kph -RRB- as it headed northwest . It was expected to continue to weaken , becoming a tropical depression on Wednesday , forecasters said .

Raul Frias , from Mexico City , was at Club Regina in Cabo when he tweeted that he felt a `` great vibration '' in a shelter and that something `` big was coming down . ''

She piled up her belongings in the bathtub to protect them from the water seeping through the door to her room . She dammed it up with a mattress , but it still came in about an inch deep .

Then the winds subsided . Madison fell asleep .

`` The pressure was horrific , but now it is eerily calm -- just how people describe when the eye passes over , '' she said .

But then the winds smacked the hotel again , and McKinney headed back into the bathroom .

Odile was earlier predicted to bring possibly life-threatening flash floods and mudslides , forecasters said Sunday .

Ports and beaches have been closed , and school classes and celebrations for Mexico 's Independence Day were canceled in Baja California Sur state . Independence Day is Tuesday .
