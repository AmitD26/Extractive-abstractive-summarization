-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- By the time he hit 327 pounds , Robert Foster had been playing `` the fat guy '' for decades . His size was the thing that made him stand out .

His wife , Jessica , was also obese , at 287 pounds . Unlike Rob , she felt invisible . Customers at the bank where she worked stared past her as they made their transactions . In late 2011 , a close family member made a comment at the dinner table that stuck with her :

`` I adore my kids and I love my husband very much , but there was that point I hated myself so much . I was n't giving them the full me because I was disgusted , '' Jess said . `` You have to look in the mirror and say , ` Am I going to allow this to continue or am I going to stand up and make those changes ? ' A light turned on upstairs . ''

The next week , she began taking Zumba classes . In just a few weeks , she had lost 14 pounds -- enough to motivate her to take on new physical challenges . She moved on to bikes and treadmills and made sure to sweat for an hour at least three times a week . After that , there was no turning back , she said .

Rob was a little slower to change -- the thought of going for a run was `` unappealing to the point of agony '' -- but he started playing tennis and stopped taking seconds at dinner .

Rob joined Jess in training for a 5-kilometer race that December . He walked as much as he ran , and Jess finished way ahead of him . But something in him changed .

In Rob 's words , `` it got crazy from there . ''

A few months after that first 5k , he ran his second , this time without walking . Then he did his first 10-mile run . And in May 2014 , he ran his first marathon . By then he was 160 pounds lighter .

Throughout the process , the couple used a calorie-counting app to keep track of everything they ate . They knew they wanted to break their family 's cycle of unhealthy relationships with food while their children were still young .

`` It got to the point where we realized it did n't matter what we fed them , '' Rob said . `` If we were n't eating the same way or if we were overeating , they were going to follow our example . ''

The Fosters began shopping only the periphery of grocery stores , never entering the aisles unless it was for cereal . They added more fruits , vegetables and lean white meats and fish . They also began cooking everything they ate from scratch , including breads , dressings and sauces .

After months of a diet rich in whole grains , green vegetables and lean meats , they recently made the decision to go vegan for health , environmental and ethical reasons .

Rob and Jess now each weigh 167 pounds , down a collective 280 pounds . Jessica has lost 120 pounds from the start of their journey ; Rob has lost 160 . They feel healthier , happier and ready to tackle the world .

He 's not `` the fat guy '' anymore , and he 's fine with that .

`` I love myself . I like what I 'm seeing in the mirror . I know there 's some work to still be done , but I 'm such a different person than I was before . ''
