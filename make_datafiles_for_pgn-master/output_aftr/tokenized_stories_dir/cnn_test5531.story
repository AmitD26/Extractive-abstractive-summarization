-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Tuesday night 's State of the Union address , President Obama is expected to focus on the crisis of widening inequality in America .

But in his SOTU speech , and in the bigger scope of his presidency , Obama must do more than unfurl a list of policy remedies . He first has to acknowledge and then reckon with the conflicting emotions Americans have about `` falling behind . ''

-- If I 'm struggling , it 's my own fault -LRB- and complaining about it is for losers -RRB- .

-- I may be struggling , but I work hard and I do n't want people who do n't work hard as I do to get handouts .

-- If someone else is getting rich , it 's just sour grapes for me to complain that they have too much . It 's unbecoming , maybe even un-American .

To point out these self-scripts is n't to validate divisive right-wing rhetoric about `` makers and takers , '' or the over-the-top comments by a prominent venture capitalist arguing that critiques of the 1 % feel like Nazi persecution of Jews . It 's simply to describe a political and psychological reality .

Each script has an emotional core : shame , pride , inadequacy , helplessness . And so before he gets to the minimum wage or any other proposal , Obama would do well to speak directly to such emotions and neutralize them with a set of counter-scripts . He 's got to say things like :

`` Franklin Roosevelt told us we have nothing to fear but fear itself . In this age , nothing breeds helplessness like believing you are helpless . We can turn this around together -- if we remember no man is an island and no community can improve its lot without using government wisely and well . ''

I 'm not calling for Obama to channel former President Bill Clinton and conspicuously `` feel our pain . '' Obama just has to be Obama -- the author who acutely sensed and articulated the cross currents of ambition and anxiety around him ; the organizer who could navigate the unspoken tensions of identity that influence politics . Obama knows well that before the head can engage on a complex issue , the heart must be acknowledged and its pain and fear must be named .

Whether Obama can get House Republicans to take action on inequality is not a matter of his willpower or assertiveness ; the most forceful president can not force Congress to enact a thing . What Obama can do is build public pressure on Congress to act . And the best way he can do that is to make more people feel truly heard .
