The staff at Kentucky Children 's Hospital kept telling them their infant son , Waylon , was recovering well from surgery . There had been a few bumps in the road , to be sure , but they said that was normal for a baby born with a severe heart defect .

`` Is everything OK ? '' the Raineys would ask .

Yes , the doctors and nurses assured them . Everything was fine .

Then one day , Tabitha Rainey says a cardiologist took her aside .

If Waylon Rainey had been born 30 years ago , he almost surely would have died a few days or weeks after birth . He has a condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome , which means the left side of his heart is so malformed it ca n't pump blood .

Today , surgeons perform a series of three operations on babies like Waylon . They 're high-stakes surgeries -- cutting into an organ the size of a newborn baby 's fist is tricky , to say the least . The blood vessels can be thinner than a piece of angel hair pasta , and one wrong move , one nick , one collapsed artery or vein can be deadly .

These children are medically very fragile , and even the best surgeons lose patients . Surgeons track their deaths and complications and take great pride in the number of babies they save . Some are so proud they publish their success rates right on their hospital websites .

Kentucky Children 's Hospital is not one of these hospitals .

Parents of babies treated at Kentucky Children 's say the hospital 's effort to keep the data a secret , coupled with troubling events over an eight-week period last year , makes them suspicious something at the hospital has gone terribly wrong .

Three weeks later , Waylon Rainey had his surgery and later went into heart failure .

Eleven days after that , newborn Jaxon Russell had a `` botched '' heart surgery at Kentucky Children 's , according to his father .

Less than three weeks later , on October 16 , 6-month-old Rayshawn Lewis-Smith died after having heart surgeries at Kentucky Children 's Hospital .

That same month , Dr. Mark Plunkett , the hospital 's chief heart surgeon -- and the only surgeon performing open-heart surgeries at the hospital -- went on paid leave , according to hospital spokesman Jay Blanton , and the hospital stopped doing heart surgeries .

The parents say they did n't receive any explanation for why the surgeries stopped or why Plunkett left . A hospital spokeswoman said Plunkett was not available for comment .

Parents react to story

CNN met with Connor , Waylon , and Jaxon 's parents in Lexington , Kentucky .

Shannon Russell , Jaxon 's father , said when his son had the second surgery at a different hospital it lasted four hours longer than expected because of infection and scar tissue left behind from the first surgery at Kentucky Children 's . He said the second surgeon also found a hole in Jaxon 's heart that the first surgeon missed , and corrected it .

`` Our question is , how many other babies did this happen to ? '' said Russell , who , with his wife Miranda , started Lil ' Heart Sluggers to help other patients of children with congenital heart defects .

Karpf is executive vice president for health affairs at the University of Kentucky 's health care system , which includes Kentucky Children 's Hospital . He said he put the pediatric heart surgery program on hold because the mortality rates were n't what he wanted them to be .

`` They were OK , and OK is n't good enough for me , '' he said . `` It 's got to be better . It 's got to be good . ''

In December , a local reporter asked for more details . Brenna Angel , who worked for the university-owned radio station , asked the university for the mortality rate for all pediatric cardiothoracic surgeries performed over the past three years . She also asked for the number of surgeries performed by Plunkett , the date of his last surgery , and payments received for his surgeries .

The university answered some of her questions : Plunkett operated on 110 children in 2010 , 81 children in 2011 and 62 in 2012 , often performing multiple surgeries on one child . In 2010 , UK HealthCare received $ 288,522 in payments for his surgeries ; in 2011 , it was $ 255,380 .

But the university refused to release the date of Plunkett 's last surgery or the mortality rate , citing the federal patient privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 . The university 's lawyer said even though Angel was only asking for numbers , those numbers could eventually be linked to patients ' names .

`` Because Dr. Plunkett performs relatively few surgeries and because all of his surgeries are highly complex surgeries , it is relatively easy to deduce the identity of his patients , '' wrote William Thro , the university 's general counsel .

Angel filed an appeal with Attorney General Jack Conway , citing the state 's Open Records Act , which requires that public agencies , such as public universities , open most of their records to the public .

Hospital plans to do heart surgeries again

While the legal battle continues , the University of Kentucky has been doing its own internal review of the events last year .

The Kentucky hospital plans on hiring a new surgeon and opening the program back up again at some point . Karpf , the UK HealthCare executive , said parents do n't need to worry -- when it reopens , the program will be first class .

`` I wo n't be satisfied until our program is as good as anybody 's program , '' he said .

They say it 's troubling that doctors and nurses gave them vague answers when they asked specific questions . For example , their sons had very complex surgeries , and they wanted to know how many times Plunkett had done their specific procedures and what his success rate had been .

`` I want to know statistics , I want to know hard facts , '' said Lucas Rainey , Waylon 's father . `` But they just said , ` We see this all the time . It 'll be fine . ' ''

`` Data is a complex issue , '' he said

Jaxon and Waylon are both at home now , and their parents are very pleased with the outpatient care from cardiologists at the University of Kentucky . But they said they 'll continue to fight to have all safety data released to the public .

`` We 've not lost our child , and I thank God for that , but I 'm standing up for the ones that have lost their kids -- the moms that I 've had to stand in the hallway with and try to console because they 've lost their children , '' Tabitha Rainey said . `` And they do n't know what 's happened and there are still no answers given to them . ''
