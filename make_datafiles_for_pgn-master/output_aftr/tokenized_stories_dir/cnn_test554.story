The FBI announced Tuesday the addition of Daniel Andreas San Diego to the list , hoping a burst of international publicity associated with the move will help investigators find him after six years on the run .

San Diego , 31 , may appear to be out of place on a terrorist list with familiar names like al Qaeda 's Osama bin Laden , Ayman al-Zawahiri and Adam Yahiye Gadahn . The `` strict vegan , '' according to the FBI , is charged with bombing two corporate offices in California in 2003 . The blasts caused extensive property damage but no deaths .

Vegans eat no meat or any other food containing animal products .

The sophisticated homemade bombs had ammonium nitrate brand explosives and relied on `` kitchen timer style mechanical timer devices , '' according to an FBI affidavit .

After both bombings , e-mails from a group called `` The Revolutionary Cells-Liberation Brigade '' claimed responsibility for the acts .

But the computer network specialist also sports several elaborate tattoos . According to an artist 's rendering of the body art , San Diego has one in the center of his chest of a burning hillside and the words `` It only takes a spark '' in a typewriter-style font .

An abdominal tattoo shows burning and collapsing buildings , while his back features a leafless tree rising from a road above buildings that are burning but still standing , the FBI says .
