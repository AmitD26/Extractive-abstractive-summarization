Janice Shih left her career in medicine at age 38 and became a pastry chef .

`` I had always been interested in pastries -- mostly interested in eating them , '' she says with a laugh .

Plenty of possibilities

Students attending the grueling programs , which can last six to 38 months , can dole out as much as $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 for the diploma . And then the real work begins .

Neil Robertson , 44 , was technical director at a graphic design firm in 2003 and felt like he no longer fit the mold . He quit his 18-year career and attended the French Pastry School in Chicago . `` I 've always loved to bake , '' he says . `` But baking in a professional kitchen ? I was n't sure that I could handle it . ''

`` You 're not a chef as soon as you finish culinary school , '' says Michael Ruhlman , author of `` The Making of a Chef , '' an inside look at life at the Culinary Institute . `` You 're a chef only after spending several years further honing your craft and learning the ropes . To say otherwise would be like saying grads of medical school could instantly be called pediatric neurosurgeons the day after graduation . ''

Using the proceeds of their house sale , the couple attended a five-month culinary program in Florence , then a nine-month course in Canada . All the while , they had no idea where their gastronomic education would take them .

`` Some of our friends and family seemed to think we were a bit insane , '' Beltz recalls .

But with their newfound culinary know-how , Beltz and Householder launched Front Burner PR , a boutique public-relations and marketing firm in Portland , Maine , that focuses on restaurants , hotels and other food-related clients .

Think carefully before writing your resignation letter -- culinary school is no cakewalk , says Robertson . `` It 's hot . It 's fast . It 's high-stress . It 's a pressure cooker . ''

Ruhlman agrees . `` I ca n't even tell you how many people have read my book and thanked me for saving them from going to culinary school , '' he says , `` because they had no idea how hard it really is . ''

Before taking the plunge , Robertson and Ruhlman suggest getting a feel for the job via a culinary vacation , like those offered through gourmetontour.com and foodvacation.com , or by shadowing a chef .

For the second option , `` go to a restaurant that you like and respect and ask if you can spend a day in the kitchen , '' suggests Ruhlman . It 's called trailing , and some restaurants are open to it . If you have some food experience , you might be able to stage -LRB- pronounced stauge -RRB- , which entails working in a kitchen alongside a chef , without pay , for a day or two .

`` You get to see what life is really like in a professional kitchen , '' he says , `` and it will really open your eyes . ''

Looking back , Robertson says leaving his job for the culinary world was a bold move , but worth every deflated souffl√© along the way :

`` I 'm much more excited about what I 'm doing now . '' E-mail to a friend
