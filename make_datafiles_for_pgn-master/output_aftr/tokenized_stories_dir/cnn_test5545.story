-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a warning which will reverberate around the Formula One paddock with more gusto than the sport 's much derided V6 engine .

Nico Rosberg , says the sport 's dominant team `` definitely has n't peaked yet despite Mercedes having won all four of the season 's opening races .

`` It has been three weeks since the last race and the development rate is so fast . We have 600 people back in the factory working crazy hours to make this car faster in every single race .

`` For example , from the start of the season to the end of the season , you can have a car that is 1.5 seconds quicker by the end just with new parts on the car .

`` It 's a good period for the team at the moment . We really have the momentum , a quick car , the best car in F1 -- the Silver Arrow . ''

The Mercedes car 's next outing is at Sunday 's Spanish Grand Prix , providing Rosberg and teammate Lewis Hamilton , who already has three race victories to his name this season , the opportunity to make another giant statement of intent .

`` At the moment , it has been all about the battle against my teammate but of course , we 're all conscious that the other teams are flat out pushing trying to close the gap and we need to keep doing a good job to stay ahead , '' added Rosberg .

While Mercedes has enjoyed a stellar start to the 2014 season , there is no sense of complacency , with Ferrari , Red Bull and Lotus all striving to produce improved performances in Catalonia to prevent the drivers ' title becoming a two-man race .

`` We have seen already that our rivals are relentless in their efforts to close the gap . As a team , it is up to us to rise to that challenge -- to take that relentless mentality to an even greater extent than those around us .
