-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 10-year-old girl , brutally raped , confronts her attacker in court .

The culprit -- a cleric -- tries to pass it off as `` consensual sex . ''

What 's extraordinary is that these scenes played out Saturday in a courtroom in Kabul , Afghanistan .

`` It makes us believe and trust more in the justice system in the country , '' Bahram said , speaking to CNN by phone from Kabul . `` A little young girl from a far province gets justice for herself , this is amazing . This is a success for human rights in the country '' .

The rape occurred in May , in the girl 's village in Kunduz , in northern Afghanistan , according to media reports .

The group sheltered the victim and helped her family navigate the legal process .

The perpetrator , Mullah Mohammad Amin , was a local mullah who taught the girls religious studies .

She went home and was later examined by a doctor , who confirmed the rape .

The police were informed and the mullah was arrested .

Amin was prosecuted under the Elimination of Violence against Women law , passed in 2009 .

Patti Gossman , a senior researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights Watch , agreed that it is uncommon for rape cases to get this far .

`` It 's quite unusual that she would bring this case , '' Gossman said . `` Most women would be afraid . ''

There was also concern , when this case surfaced , about honor killings , she said .

Dramatic courtroom testimony

The trial lasted nearly two hours , she said .

She wept most of the time , Bahram said .

The trial began with the mullah 's two defense attorneys reading his statement given to police after his arrest , in which the cleric admitted to having sex with the girl . The lawyers tried to persuade the court that the sex was consensual and that he should be given only 100 lashes as punishment , Bahram said .

Judge Sulaiman Rasouli rejected that argument because it would mean lashing the girl too and treating her as an adulterer rather than a rape victim , according to news reports .

When Amin , speaking in his own defense , said the victim had seduced him , the girl reacted strongly .

The girl 's father also spoke up in the court , saying he trusted his daughter and that she never lied , Bahram said .

`` The welcome step in this case is that the judge did not charge the child , '' said Gossman . `` In a country where there are several women and girls imprisoned for moral crimes , that 's a positive . ''

The court sentenced the mullah to the maximum 20-year sentence .

Amin 's lawyers are expected to appeal to try to reduce the sentence .

`` She 's a very shy girl ; she does not talk much , but when you ask her about the case she starts to cry , '' Nasim said .

In an interview with Afghanistan 's TOLO news agency , her father , who is deaf , said he hopes the sentencing would dissuade other perpetrators from committing such crimes in the future .

`` When family and victims raise their voice it is unusual , but luckily more and more families are speaking out , '' said Amnesty International 's Mosadiq , who credits the hard work of women 's rights groups for the legal victory .
