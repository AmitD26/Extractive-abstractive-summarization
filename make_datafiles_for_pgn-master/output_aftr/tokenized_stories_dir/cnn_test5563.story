Kim So-Yeon , his personal physician for many years before she defected to South Korea in 1992 , led research at a `` Longevity Center '' set up to help in Kim 's quest for a longer life .

It did n't work -- he died at 82 -- but that 's still far better than the average 64-year life expectancy for the country .

People who made it to 100 and beyond

Those who had been chosen for the honor of donating blood to the `` Eternal President '' were fed special nutritious food beforehand .

Another favorite , according to Kim , was watching young children do funny or cute things to make him laugh .

The center decided happiness brings good health , so prescribed more laughter to the North Korean leader . Kim is seen smiling in many official photos .

After witnessing the stresses and health issues experienced by Kim , the doctor says Kim Jong Un , the country 's current leader and Kim 's grandson , could be suffering from similar problems .

The elder Kim has often often been compared to his grandson , who shares his looks and demeanor .

Walking with a cane , the young leader appeared in public last week for the first time in more than a month amid speculation about his health .

After studying photos , she said Kim 's face appeared to have been swollen due to painkillers and she also speculated that he has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather .

CNN can not independently verify this claim .

`` Kim Il Sung still has a good reputation because he was the founder of the country . So in order to instill in people that it is still Kim Il Sung 's country , I think they are trying to make Kim Jong Un look like more like him . ''
