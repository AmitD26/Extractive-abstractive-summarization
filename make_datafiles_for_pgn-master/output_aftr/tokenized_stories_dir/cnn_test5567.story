-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When men and women enlist in the military , they take an oath to support and defend the Constitution , including the First Amendment , against all enemies , foreign and domestic , and affirm that they will `` bear true faith and allegiance to the same . ''

That oath is betrayed by legislation that sneaked through the House of Representatives last week and was signed into law by the president Monday .

Sen. Olympia Snowe , R-Maine , introduced the bill a month after the Supreme Court ruled in Snyder v. Phelps that , as lawful speech on a public issue , Westboro Baptist Church protests warranted the highest protection of the First Amendment against state tort claims .

The issues raised by this new law are a lot like those in the dust-up after Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy spoke out against same-sex marriage . I agree that Chick-fil-A should n't be celebrated as some sort of free speech hero , and if you choose not to indulge in a Chick-fil-A chicken sandwich in protest of intolerance , more power to you .

But I 'm more concerned by the suggestion of a Chicago alderman that he would go so far as to block a local Chick-fil-A franchise 's building permit simply because of Cathy 's views , rather than any discriminatory policy of the chain . In some ways , a willingness to ignore the law to shut down someone with whom you simply disagree is worse than Cathy spouting off against marriage equality .

Part of living in America means putting up with words with which you not only disagree but that offend deeply . This is especially true when , as in the Westboro Baptist Church case , the words actually carry a political message .
