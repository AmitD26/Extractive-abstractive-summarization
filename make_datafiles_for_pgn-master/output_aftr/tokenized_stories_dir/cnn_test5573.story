Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos Samour Jr. ordered Holmes to undergo an independent exam by the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo by early March , and the report must be filed by July 14 .

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Holmes , who is accused of opening fire in a packed movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , during a July 2012 midnight showing of the latest Batman installment , `` The Dark Knight Rises . ''

Authorities have said Holmes was dressed head to toe in protective gear .

Holmes allegedly threw tear-gas canisters in the theater and then opened fire on the patrons , according to witnesses . Police say he used several weapons , including an AR-15 rifle , before fleeing the theater .

The defense , meanwhile , appears to be focused not so much on what Holmes allegedly did that night but his mental state then and earlier .

A psychiatrist who treated him had warned campus police at the University of Colorado how dangerous he was , prompting them to deactivate his college ID to prevent him from passing through any locked doors , according to court documents .
