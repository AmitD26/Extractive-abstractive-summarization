`` The CDC confirmed EV-D68 after her arrival here , and she subsequently succumbed to her illness , '' Valentini said .

A Facebook page , dubbed `` Team Maddie ! , '' devoted to the 21-month-old 's plight also confirmed the sad news .

`` Madeline Reid became our angel at 2:55 p.m. -LRB- Friday -RRB- , '' read one post . `` She passed peacefully in her mother and father 's arms . ''

Enterovirus is very common , with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States .

But like the flu or other viruses , not all the roughly 100 enterovirus strains are the same . D68 is particularly pernicious .

As of Friday , the CDC and state public health laboratories had documented 691 cases of enterovirus D68 in 46 states and the District of Columbia . Five patients who died had the virus strain , even if it 's not certain all of them died because of it . Madeline 's case is not yet counted in this tally .

There will be more cases , and perhaps more deaths , in the coming weeks , officials said .

The virus also has not yet run its course .

As the CDC pointed out , `` Enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall . We 're currently in the middle of the enterovirus season . ''

CNN 's Ray Sanchez and Jacque Wilson contributed to this report .
