-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Let 's see how far this goes without making a dead parrot reference . Wish me luck .

Monty Python 's Flying Circus can not be stopped . And , apparently , not even contained . The five surviving members of the British-based renegade comedy troupe announced this week they were getting the band back together for live performances , their first together in more than a decade .

In the funny business world , this is equivalent to the Beatles getting back together . And the Rolling Stones , too . -LRB- Oh , wait . They 've never broken up exactly , have they ? Rewind . -RRB-

`` Monty Python 's Flying Circus '' made landfall -- or , rather , pratfall -- on American public television stations in the early 1970s , and its unapologetic anarchy and snide surrealism triumphed here . Oh , there were some who did n't get the jokes , believing the blithe zaniness of the Pythons ' humor to be irrelevant to the Vietnam War and on behalf of women 's rights , black empowerment , gay pride and other white-hot issues of that polarized time . What these solemn spoilsports did n't , or could n't understand at the time is that sociopolitical conflicts come and go , but a dirty fork and a sissy lumberjack are things of lasting consequence and sublimity .

Those who were n't there at the time -- and you know who you are -- can see for yourselves what all the giggling was about thanks in large part to YouTube 's Monty Python Channel , which the troupe initiated in 2008 as a site for showcasing its vintage BBC sketches as well as scenes from such classic Python films as 1975 's `` Monty Python and the Holy Grail , '' 1979 's `` Life of Brian '' and 1983 's `` The Meaning of Life . ''

With Python-esque faux grouchiness , the channel urged its viewers to `` click on the links , buy our movies and TV shows , and soften our pain from being ripped off all these years . ''

-LRB- Almost made it ! Dang ! -RRB-
