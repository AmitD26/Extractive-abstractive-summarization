The policy , which was enacted in 1995 , grants asylum to any Cuban who reaches U.S. soil , or `` dry foots . '' But most Cubans found at sea would be sent back to Cuba . Any change to that policy , which is part of the Cuban Adjustment Act , would need approval by Congress , which is highly unlikely to happen .

`` We recognize that when these rumors continue to perpetuate , they grow . People believe it . They may get desperate . They may try and take to the sea , '' said Capt. Mark Fedor , the chief of response for the Coast Guard 's 7th District , which patrols most of the waters around the island nation .

Since the Obama administration announced a renewal of diplomatic relations with the Castro government on December 16 , the Coast Guard says there has been a 235 % increase in the number of Cubans found at sea , compared with the first two weeks of December . Overall , the final month of 2014 saw a 117 % jump year to year in the number of migrants from the Communist island .

`` These boats are n't just laying around . These people are getting paid to build these boats . That 's the profit motive behind all this , '' said Fedor . `` There are people making money off of this . And they do n't care about the safety of these folks . I think it 's in their benefit to perpetuate these rumors . And we 're trying to combat that . ''

Ever since Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959 , there have been incidents of mass migration from Cuba -- the most famous of which was the Mariel boatlift of 1980 , when roughly 125,000 Cubans landed on Florida 's shores within a six-month span .

Although the recent surge is not considered a mass migration , Fedor says , `` We 're always attentive to that . There 's a variety of factors that could lead to a mass migration . But right now , we 're not at that level . ''
