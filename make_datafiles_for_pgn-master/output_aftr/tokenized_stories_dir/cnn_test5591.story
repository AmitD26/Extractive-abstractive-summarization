-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Twinkly lights and tinsel ?

That 's so last Christmas .

Christmas trees do n't have to be traditional to look spectacular .

In fact , some of the most memorable ones this year are anything but .

Or macaroons ?

Even the odder entrants in this selection of the world 's most amazing Christmas trees on public display tend to be big and bright .

And there are still plenty of sparkly stars to be found and photographed .

They 're just much bigger and much brighter than the ones on the tree in your living room .

Now it 's got one -- and it 's 25 meters tall .

It 's not so much a tree as a metal skeleton covered with fir tree branches .

Lithuanian fir tree branches , though -- they 're not made in China .

Asia 's tallest Christmas tree is in Malaysia , but even more striking than its height is that it 's made from Lego .

The nine-meter tree at Legoland Malaysia is made from 400,000 blocks of the child 's toy .

It 's not a tree , either ?

Weighing 12 tons , the tree is decorated with 45,000 LEDS and topped with a 3-meter-wide Swarovski crystal star .

The tree was donated to the Rockefeller Center by the Vargoshe family , who planted it in the gardens of their Connecticut home 20 years ago .

And eventually wanted to get rid of it .

At 20-meters tall , the world 's highest in-store Christmas tree is an intricate , horology-themed affair standing in France 's chicest department store , Galeries Lafayette .

Batteries not included .

And try getting the thing home .

Rio advertizes its superlative seasonal contribution as `` the world 's largest floating Christmas tree . ''

Nonetheless , its stats are pretty impressive .

6 . National Christmas tree -LRB- Washington , D.C. -RRB-

Last year , the Obamas were criticized for decorating their home with an apparently excessive 54 Christmas trees .

This year , they have only 24 .

Modest .

Barack Obama was tasked with switching on the 10-meter Colorado blue spruce known as the National Christmas Tree , which stands outside the White House gates in President 's Park South .

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall , Norway has given the German capital a Christmas tree every year as a sign of peace and solidarity with the reunified country .

The decorations on this year 's tree , located as always beneath the Brandenburg Gate , are a bit of a contrast .

They 're a freebie from Wintershall , Germany 's largest crude oil and natural gas producer .

Nothing ironic there .

8 . Macaroon Christmas tree , Ritz-Carlton -LRB- Charlotte , North Carolina -RRB-

Using 10,008 egg whites , 110 cups of sugar and 57 cups of almonds , the hotel 's pastry team took 58 hours to create -- or should that be bake -- the tree .

Luxury umbrella brand Fulton made the tree outside London 's Goring hotel , so it 's not hard to guess which popular winter accessory features heavily .

One of the brand 's trademark birdcage-style umbrellas -- supposedly a favorite of the British royal family -- replaces the traditional star at the top of the tree .

10 . Opera Christmas tree , Grand Hotel de Bordeaux & Spa -LRB- Bordeaux , France -RRB-

The hotel and the opera house share a baroque style , as does the tree -- which sings in a nice soprano .

Not really .

12 . Recycled bottle Christmas tree -LRB- London -RRB-

Humble in origin but still impressive , the Christmas tree outside Ealing Town Hall in London was crafted from 900 plastic bottles collected by local school children .

Possibly including these bottles when everyone 's done with the tree .
