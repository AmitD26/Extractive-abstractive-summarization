Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Secret Service offered only vague information in its first criminal filing in federal court about how deep accused fence-jumper Omar Gonzalez entered the White House , in contrast to the dramatic account of the intruder 's dash through the building that was revealed by lawmakers Monday .

In a sworn affidavit filed with the court on the night of the incident , Secret Service officer Daniel Hochman offered details based on his `` personal observations '' of Gonzalez 's sprint inside the White House . In his account , Hochman described how he `` yelled '' at Gonzalez to stop . `` Instead , Omar Gonzalez ran toward the White House , '' Hochman continued .

As it turned out , Gonzalez made it much farther into the White House than the court filing described . The intruder was stopped in the East Room of the building , a law enforcement official told CNN Monday .

`` The federal complaint said he was -- he was in fact apprehended in one place . Is n't it true he was apprehended further into the White House , '' Issa asked .

Once it was apparent Pierson was not directly answering the question , Issa interjected .

`` In fact , the federal complaint and the earlier reports were not accurate , Is that correct ? Yes or no , please , '' Issa asked .

Issa cut her off again . `` I want to know if we can rely on reports from your agency , '' Issa complained .

A federal law enforcement official told CNN the information provided to reporters on the night of the intrusion was based on what was told to Secret Service spokesmen at that time .

Rep. Jason Chaffetz , R-UT pressed Pierson on statements to the media that indicated Gonzalez was unarmed .

On the night of the incident , Leary , the Secret Service spokesman , had told reporters Gonzalez was not carrying a weapon .

`` I have no knowledge of that , '' Pierson replied .

`` I have read the press release before it went out , '' Pierson answered .

Dan Bongino , a former Secret Service agent and Republican who is running for Congress in Maryland , said affidavits from agency officers are sometimes intentionally vague .

But Bongino said Pierson 's handling of the Gonzalez case is indicative of the `` small , insular group of managers '' in charge of the agency .

During Pierson 's testimony Tuesday , lawmakers noted her 30 years of service to the embattled agency .

`` It 's a reflection , sadly , of the cabal , '' Bongino said .
