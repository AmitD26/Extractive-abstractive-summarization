-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joao Victor Marcari Oliva could become one of Brazil 's brightest Olympic talents , if he can step out of the shadows of a legend : his mum .

Oliva is the son of Hortencia Marcari , who led Brazil 's women to the basketball world title in 1994 and Olympic silver at the Atlanta Games two years later .

Oliva says : `` Every time I 'm walking down the street with my mum , there are a lot of fans taking photos of her and people asking for autographs . Sometimes that gets boring -- but it 's nice . ''

A fraction taller than his mother at 180 cm -LRB- 5 foot 10 inches -RRB- , the teen has shunned a career in basketball . His heart is set on an entirely different sport : dressage .

`` I have my mother 's blood when it comes to sport , but my father bred horses . When I was young , I spent all my time with them , '' says the 18-year-old , whose mother played in the Atlanta '96 basketball final just months after he was born .

With a home Olympic Games two years away , the Brazilian equestrian team is in the middle of an unprecedented push for success on the world stage .

Brazil has virtually no history of dressage -- one of three equestrian disciplines at the Olympics -- so Oliva has moved to Germany , one of the sport 's leading nations , to find better tuition .

`` I do n't want to win in Rio -- I do n't think that 's possible , '' he says . `` I have a lot to learn and Europe is too strong in the sport . But I 'm here , and I will learn like a European . I think I can be a good rider . ''

The nation has hired world-renowned experts to help its riders develop . New Zealand 's Mark Todd , for example , is coaching the Brazilian eventing team .

`` One of the things which struck us most is how little they knew . Yes , they could all ride . But as far as training horses goes ? A lot of them did n't have much of an idea about basic stuff .

Moving to Europe , like those who have moved to train with Todd , is a rite of passage for many Brazilian riders . Standards are markedly higher east of the Atlantic .

`` There will never be another Rodrigo but I want to win medals and events like he did . ''

The 26-year-old spent his childhood on the road with his father , a moderately successful eventer named Mario , at tournaments across Brazil .

`` Everything is completely different in Europe , '' says the younger Zanotelli . `` In Brazil almost everyone has grooms , everyone is spoiled . Here in Europe , most people do all the jobs themselves -- they help the horse themselves , they know how to do everything .

`` Luckily , my dad always made me do everything too , so I had some experience of that . Otherwise , I would have arrived here and been completely lost . ''

Brazil has no shortage of aspiring talent : comparatively new faces like Oliva and Zanotelli line up alongside the likes of Doda Miranda in showjumping and Roger Clementino -- the first African-Brazilian to reach the Olympics , who taught a young Oliva -- in dressage .

Then there is Luiza Almeida , who made her Olympic dressage debut at Beijing 2008 aged just 16 , the youngest equestrian rider in the history of the Games .

But Todd says Brazil 's success in 2016 will depend on finding quality horses before Rio .

`` No matter how good the riders are , you 've got to have good horses , too , '' he cautions . `` And good horses take time to produce .

`` Brazil will put on a great party , '' says Zanotelli , who rode well to sit 22nd , seven places behind compatriot Pessoa , after two rounds of showjumping at the World Equestrian Games .

`` This is a big country , and we have a lot of issues , but when the time comes for an event we have really good people who love to host foreigners and put on a good show .
