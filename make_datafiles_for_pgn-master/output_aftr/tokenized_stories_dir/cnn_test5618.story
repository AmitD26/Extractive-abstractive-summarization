Bettina Rodriguez and her daughter Isabel had planned their cruise for half a year . They would sail on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship and celebrate Isabel 's birthday .

`` Just on our deck alone , there were the biohazard bags lined up across the floor , '' Bettina Rodriguez said . `` We 're talking about raw sewage at just the end of our deck alone . It was repulsive . ''

It was a nightmare , Rodriguez said . Now the nightmare has been made worse , she said , because of company documents that have just come to light . The cruise line 's own reports , inspections and maintenance records detail a problem that had been developing on the Triumph more than a year before Rodriguez and her daughter were on board .

More than 4,000 passengers and crew members were stranded aboard what 's now known as the `` poop cruise '' after a fire knocked out the ship 's power . The ship drifted four days before it could be towed into Mobile , Alabama -- the whole time without air conditioning , and largely without lights , water , food and working toilets .

CNN has learned that the crew of the Triumph set sail in February with only four of six generators fully operational , knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard in ships across its fleet , including Triumph .

`` That ship never should have set sail in February , '' Spagnoletti said . `` It was unseaworthy at the commencement of the voyage . These documents tell you that the company -- and I 'm saying to you the corporation back in Miami -- had knowledge of the fact that this vessel had a propensity for fires ; that there were things that could have been , should have been , and were n't done in order to make sure that fires did n't take place . ''

The first trouble with Triumph was in diesel generator No. 6 -- the one that wound up catching fire . Starting more than a year before the infamous cruise , that generator was overdue for maintenance , often not in compliance with the safety laws of the sea , known as SOLAS , according to the ship 's engineer .

Over and over again , Carnival 's own maintenance reports stated the same thing : Diesel generator No. 6 was overdue for maintenance . The company says the fire that originated with the generator was not connected to the lack of maintenance . But , during that same time period , Carnival learned about another , even more alarming safety problem in the engine room : fuel lines .

That would be eerily similar to what started the fire on board the Triumph one year later .

Carnival says it proactively began investigating after the Costa Allegra fire and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line . There had been nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years .

But Carnival did not in fact shield the part of the one hose that wound up causing the tragedy on board the Triumph in February .

`` That hose was beneath the deck plates , and it was believed the deck plates would provide that shield , '' Jackson said . `` In this case , it -LRB- the fuel leak -RRB- found that gap in the hose ... in the bilge plates and caused the fire . ''

`` We were totally in compliance ... with all the rules and regulations , '' Jackson said . `` We had ... our regulating bodies on board the ship less than two weeks prior that had certified the ship to sail . Obviously , you learn things on a situation , on an incident such as the Triumph . ''

While Carnival Cruise Lines insists that what happened on the Triumph was just an accident , the company has dedicated $ 300 million in a fleet-wide safety upgrade , focusing on detecting and preventing any potential fire hazards in its engine rooms .

Carnival 's court filing says the `` ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage , a seaworthy vessel , adequate and wholesome food , and sanitary and safe living conditions . '' Since the Triumph fire , Carnival says it has instituted a 110 % money-back `` Great Vacation Guarantee '' on its cruises .
