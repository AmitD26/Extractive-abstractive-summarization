As his plane made a rapid descent to normalize cabin pressure , a Southwest Airlines pilot went on the plane 's loudspeaker and apparently told passengers the aircraft was going down .

`` At first it sounded like someone was coming over the PA to talk . Then it sounded like shots through the cabin , twice , back to back , '' passenger Grace Stroud told CNN . `` Seconds later , the panicked captain said , ` We 're in trouble ; we 're going down . ' ''

The flight attendants then began securing the bins , she told `` CNN Newsroom '' in a separate interview . One told the captain to deploy the oxygen masks .

`` I 'm sure everybody went through their private moments , '' Stroud said . `` My moment was , ` OK , so this is how I 'm going to die , ' and ` At least it will be quick . ' ''

Soon after , the Boeing 737 leveled out and made an emergency landing at the Raleigh airport .

Asked about the WTVD report , a Southwest spokeswoman said it was inaccurate .

`` As the captain was communicating his plan with the flight attendants , he inadvertently activated the PA system in the cabin , '' the e-mail said . `` We sincerely regret any confusion caused by the relay of the information . ''

`` As the checklist mandates when there is a pressurization issue , our captain did communicate with flight attendants over the PA that he was initiating a descent to a lower altitude , '' Eichinger said . `` The issue resolved itself , which is also not uncommon , and the aircraft landed normally at Raleigh-Durham . ''
