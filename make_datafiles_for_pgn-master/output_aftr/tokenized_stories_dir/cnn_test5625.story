It is , after all , the first convention for an icon whose image of irrepressible cuteness can send its worshippers swooning .

As celebratory as it is , the owners of Hello Kitty forbid any use of Happy Birthday Kitty salutations .

Instead , they insist on calling the first `` Hello Kitty Con '' an anniversary party . Though the icon 's official `` birthday '' is November 1 , the faithful never use an age for her , explains Harvard professor Christine R. Yano , who 's written a book about Hello Kitty .

`` We are celebrating Hello Kitty 's 40th anniversary , and it 's just a global gathering of Hello Kitty fans from around the world to celebrate their love for Hello Kitty , '' said Dave Marchi , senior director of marketing for the Japanese firm Sanrio , owner of the character and its global merchandising .

Hello billion of dollars in sales

That 's a lot of T-shirts , purses , notes , stickers , backpacks , school supplies , pencils and so on -- all bearing the icon 's image .

Not surprisingly , enthusiasts are stampeding to the conference site , which includes the participation of the Japanese American National Museum in the nearby Little Tokyo neighborhood , where an exhibit shows the brand 's influence on art and culture .

`` This has been overwhelming , '' Hsu said . `` Over the course of the four days , we have sold over 25,000 tickets . We wished we could of actually had more people come , but the fire marshal gave us the no , no ! , and it 's just 100,000 square feet of just eye candy . ''

Alexis Hernandez , who 's been collecting Hello Kitty items since childhood , said she felt like she was in a fantasy land .

The kitty appeals to men , too .

Gary Slaughter , who traveled more than 100 miles from San Diego , became a Hello Kitty fan about two years ago when one of his friends introduced him to the character .

`` Hello Kitty makes everyone happy . She makes me happy , so it was a natural thing , '' Slaughter said .

Another gentleman , Allan Tea , got a free tattoo bearing the character 's image on his bicep .

`` Hello Kitty is forever . She really does n't have no gender . As you can see from the Con , millions of people love her , '' Tea said .

Hello from another continent

Jessica Perez , 40 , flew almost 8,000 miles from Lima , Peru , to attend the conference because she 's been dreaming about this event .

`` She 's my friend , my companion . She 's with me at home , at the office and people who know me know that I 'm her fan , '' Perez said .

The event comes two months after the Hello Kitty world was rocked with the revelation that the icon is n't a cat at all .

The image is really a cartoon character of a little girl with strong feline features , according to Yano , who is visiting professor of Japanese studies at Harvard and an anthropologist at the University of Hawaii .

Perhaps , it 's a good thing that Hello Kitty represents a little girl and not a little cat .

If it were a feline , its 40 years would equate to 177 human years old .
