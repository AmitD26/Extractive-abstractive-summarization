It is one key change in guidelines stemming from controversial federal investigations over leaks of classified information that resulted in efforts by prosecutors to obtain journalist records about reporting on national security issues .

Holder says he did not mislead Congress over reporter leak probe

The revised guidelines used by prosecutors nationwide will be implemented quickly . No congressional action is necessary .

There was also concern from civil libertarians , privacy advocates and some members of Congress that prosecutors had gone too far . Obama said he was troubled at the possibility the leak investigations might chill the work of journalists aiming to hold government accountable .

`` Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs . Our focus must be on those who break the law , '' Obama said in May .

In addition to the change on search warrants , prosecutors now have to give news organizations advance notice of subpoenas unless notification would `` pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation , risk grave harm to national security , or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm . ''

That is a switch from current rules , which presumes prior notification would not occur unless an assistant attorney general finds there would be no harm .

The attorney general now must make the decision about whether prior notification of a search warrant would harm an investigation .

If the attorney general determines a delay is necessary to protect an investigation , it can last no longer than 90 days . But under the new rules the working presumption is that news organizations will be notified in advance and would have the opportunity to challenge subpoenas for material .

In the case involving the AP , the Justice Department last year obtained two months of phone records for reporters and editors at the news service as part of a probe that AP said was focused on its account of a foiled plot in Yemen to bomb a U.S. airliner in May 2012 . AP was not informed until a year later .

Justice says it followed rules in leak probe , but key question unanswered

In the second probe , the department obtained a search warrant in 2010 for e-mail correspondence between Fox reporter James Rosen and a former State Department contractor accused of leaking Rosen classified material on North Korea .

The changes announced by the Justice Department include a requirement that the intelligence community certify a leak has caused harm before the attorney general would allow prosecutors to seek media-related records .

The department also will provide yearly reports on the number of requests made for information from reporters .

The Justice Department also will create a News Media Review Committee . That panel will include the department 's chief privacy and civil liberties officer as well as the director of public affairs , two officials who might take a hard look at requests to interview reporters or obtain their records .
