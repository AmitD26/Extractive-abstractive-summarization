Not remembering could get you in trouble .

The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has seized a record 2,000 firearms from carry-on luggage this year , as of December 1 .

That 's more than the TSA has ever seized in any other full year of its existence . And we still have another month to go .

Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security has seized the most guns this year , with 109 guns as of December 1 . Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is in second place with 93 gun seizures , and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is in third place with 73 gun seizures .

Forgetting can be costly .

Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges , and the TSA can impose civil penalties . And TSA Pre-check members can be temporarily or permanently banned from the expedited screening program .

`` It is a reminder that passengers should check their personal belongings before arriving at the TSA checkpoint , to ensure they do not have any prohibited items in their possession , '' Feinstein said .

In 2013 , the TSA seized 1,813 guns , up from 1,556 in 2012 and 1,320 seized in 2011 . The agency seized 1,123 guns in 2010 , 976 guns in 2009 , 926 guns in 2008 , 803 guns in 2007 and 821 guns in 2006 .
