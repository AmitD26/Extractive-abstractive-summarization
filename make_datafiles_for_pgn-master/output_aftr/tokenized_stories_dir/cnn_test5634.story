The loudspeaker at a nearby mosque warned Ifat Najeeb what was coming .

`` I woke up suddenly and felt something was wrong , '' Najeeb told CNN . `` Soon there was a thud and our main gate had been flung open by gushing waters which were rising alarmingly . ''

`` Within no time our first floor was inundated . We rushed upstairs to the third floor as we watched dreadfully the waters covered the second floor in no time as well , '' Najeeb said .

Najeeb and her husband were rescued by authorities , eventually relocating to an unaffected area in uptown Srinagar .

They consider themselves lucky .

Recent flooding brought by heavy monsoon rains has wrought death and destruction in India and Pakistan since the rains began on September 2 .

Floods are n't uncommon in Kashmir , but these have been particularly severe in terms of damage and loss of life .

And at least 200 people have died in flooding in Indian-administered Kashmir , Indian Home Ministry spokesman Kuldeep Dhatwalia told CNN .

Some volunteers in that country fear the toll could be much higher .

Home to 12 million people , the state of Jammu and Kashmir is India 's 19th most populous province .

Public anger

Indian officials said rescue efforts continued on a massive scale , but refused to confirm reports that hundreds of thousands of people still remained stranded a week after floods wreaked havoc in the Himalayan valley .

TV footage showed frustrated residents shouting slogans and heckling at least one senior Kashmiri politician , who visited a relief camp in Srinagar in the aftermath of the catastrophe . There have also been reports of sporadic attacks against rescuers .

In Pakistan , the flooding has affected more than 2 million people , the government said .

The military has blown up dykes in the central part of the country to prevent overflowing rivers from swamping cities , according to the government .

Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited flood-affected residents in Athara Hazari in Jhang district Saturday , according to his office .

Sharif said the federal and provincial governments were working together to help the flood victims , adding that `` this is not a favor , but the responsibility of the government to extend a helping hand to the calamity-hit people . ''
