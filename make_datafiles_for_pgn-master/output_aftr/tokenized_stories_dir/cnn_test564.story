CNN : Graphene has been described as a ` miracle material ' , but what exactly is it ?

Andre Geim : It 's the thinnest material you can get -- it 's only one atom thick . A tiny amount can cover a huge area , so one gram could cover a whole football pitch . It 's the strongest material we are aware of because you ca n't slice it any further . Of course , we know that atoms can be divided into elementary particles , but you ca n't get any material that is thinner than one atom , or it would n't count as a material anymore .

CNN : Your scotch-tape method for discovering the material has gone down in science history . Tell us about that .

AG : We were trying to make graphite as thin as possible using lab equipment and for many months we struggled to make it thinner than 10,000 layers . Then we had a kind of Eureka moment . We were using scotch tape on a regular basis in the lab to clean the surface of the graphite . We would look at what was happening on the surface of the graphite and throw the scotch tape in the bin . Then we decided to take the tape out of the bin and look at it under the microscope and we saw really transparent pieces of graphite -- graphene .

CNN : Your discovery was certainly a surprise to the science world , but was it a surprise to you ?

AG : Yes . We live in a 3-dimensional world . My physics intuition , developed over the last thirty years , told me that this material should n't exist . And if you had asked 99.9 % of scientists around the world they would have said the idea of a 2D material was rubbish and that graphene should n't exist . And in most cases they would have been right , but in the case of graphite or graphene , and a dozen other materials like it , our intuition was completely wrong . You can reach this limit of one-atom-thin layers .

AG : Because of its range of extraordinary properties , people are considering using graphene in a myriad of different applications . For example , because graphene is so strong , people want to use it to reinforce plastics , making them conductive at the same time . Because it 's transparent and conducts electricity , people want to use it in applications like mobile phone screens , touch screens , TV screens and so on . People are also considering using it to go beyond silicon technology and make our integrated circuits even denser and speedier . Those are just few examples .

` Miracle material ' chips away at silicon dominance

@highlight

Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselow discovered graphene in 2004 .

@highlight

At one atom thick , it is the thinnest material ever discovered .

@highlight

They made their discovery by pulling scotch tape off graphite .

@highlight

Graphene is very strong , flexible and a good electrical conductor .
