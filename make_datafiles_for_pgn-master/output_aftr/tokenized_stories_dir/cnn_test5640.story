And reports from Iraq 's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it 's not clear whether he was wounded , whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck .

But if al-Baghdadi is dead , what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group ?

`` It will morph , and new leaders will emerge , '' retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James `` Spider '' Marks said . `` In fact , bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam 's military . These are very conventionally trained , very professional leaders . ''

Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council , which handles the group 's religious and military affairs , has planned this scenario in advance .

Top two deputies

Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani , who oversees ISIS ' mission in Iraq , and Abu Ali al-Anbari , who is in charge of operations in Syria , according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium .

Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein .

Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out .

Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria . Those governors handle financial , military , legal , media and intelligence councils , among others .

What 's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there 's no democracy involved and there 's a council tasked with considering who to behead .

Another possibility

Then there 's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani , the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group .

The Shura Council 's importance

If al-Baghdadi is still alive , there 's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence .

She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley , Steven Sotloff , and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council 's purview .

But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now . While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike , U.S. officials say they ca n't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all .
