`` I do n't think the person who they spoke with realized that drones could n't be flown in the park or the implications of what they were being told , '' Amy Bartlett , spokesperson for Yellowstone National Park , told CNN .

Drones are banned in national parks . The National Park Service announced in June that it was prohibiting unmanned aircraft from all park service-controlled lands and waters , totaling about 84 million acres throughout the country .

Park rangers have not yet spoken to the drone 's operator and are still trying to determine if they can even track that person down .

`` The technology certainly has been around for a while , but this is the year that the problem has seemed to come to light for us , '' Bartlett said .

Visitors watching the sunset over the Grand Canyon were interrupted by a loud drone in April . And volunteers reported that a herd of bighorn sheep at Zion National Park in Utah scattered after being harassed by a drone .

Also , a Seattle woman called police in June to report a peeping Tom drone . The drone was hovering outside of her high-rise window , and the woman saw operators on the ground below with camera equipment .

The drone operators insist that they were not spying on the woman , but rather her view . They were working on plans for a new building .
