In both bombings , the attackers were mentally disabled women whose explosive belts were remotely detonated , Gen. Qasim Atta , spokesman for Baghdad 's security plan , told state television .

Atta said the women were strapped with dynamite and ball bearings , citing members of the bomb squad . The explosives were detonated via cell phone , he said .

An Atta aide said that people referred to the bomber at central Baghdad 's al-Ghazl market as the `` crazy woman '' and that the bomber at a second market had an unspecified birth disability .

U.S. military officials referred to the two attacks as suicide bombings , saying both women detonated the explosive devices .

The U.S. officials also gave a much lower casualty toll , with 27 civilians dead and 53 others wounded .

The Pentagon attributed the attacks to al Qaeda in Iraq and made no reference to the mental conditions of the women .

`` By targeting innocent Iraqis , they show their true demonic character , '' said Lt. Col. Steve Stover , spokesman for the Multi-National Division-Baghdad .

`` They care nothing for the Iraqi people ; they want to subjugate them and forcefully create a greater Islamic sharia state , '' he said , referring to Islamic law .

The violence marked the bloodiest series of attacks in Baghdad since August , breaking a brief stretch of relative calm as attacks and deaths dropped after the 2007 increase in U.S. troop strength called the surge .

`` It certainly underscores and affirms the decision of the Iraqi people that there is no political program here that is acceptable to a civilized society , and that this is the most brutal and the most bankrupt of movements that would do this kind of thing , '' she said at a press briefing . `` And I think that will underscore for the Iraqis , and it will make them tougher in the fight . ''

Al-Ghazl pet market is a popular destination where people buy and sell cats , dogs , monkeys and other animals . Attackers have struck the market on Fridays -- its busiest day -- several times in the last year or so .
