-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night , Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they 'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January .

Counting Obama , the country has had 44 Presidents , and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets .

Here are a few of our favorites : Watch Obama on `` mutts like me '' ''

Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence , but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets .

He had six dogs , a bobcat , a goose , a donkey , a cat , two lion cubs , an antelope , and a wallaby . The main attraction in his personal zoo , though , was Billy , a pygmy hippopotamus . Watch new baby pygmy hippo ''

Billy was born in Liberia , but was captured at a young age .

He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone , who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift , possibly because Firestone did n't want to feed the critter . -LRB- Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund ; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds . -RRB-

Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park . Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time , Billy quickly went to work as a stud , an endeavor at which he found some success .

He sired 23 little hippos , and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring . Mental Floss : 7 crafty zoo escapes

Hoover owned a slew of dogs , but those were n't his only pets . His second son , Allan Henry Hoover , owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds .

In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend .

FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill , after a Scottish ancestor . For the sake of simplicity , though , he called his new pal Fala .

The dog `` gave '' $ 1 a day to the war effort , generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army . Each morning when FDR 's breakfast tray came in , it included a bone for Fala .

4 . Millie : Literary sensation

The bubbly canine won over the nation 's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie 's Book : As Dictated to Barbara Bush .

Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989 .

5 . Barney , Miss Beazley & India : The current residents

Sadly , Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004 , but the Bushes are n't pet-deprived now .

The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs `` Bush . ''

The name was n't meant to be controversial , though ; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben `` El Indio '' Sierra , who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team . Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher .

Other first pets of note :

Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison 's two opossums . Harrison 's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers .

Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House . She made milk for President Taft 's consumption .

Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I , Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House 's groundskeeping duties . Old Ike , a ram , supposedly chewed tobacco .

Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding 's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 `` interview '' with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs .

Liberty -- Gerald Ford 's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President 's conversations .

Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House .

Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman . Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo .

Jonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name , he wrote to a friend , `` partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear 's character . ''

Dr. Johnson , Bishop Doane , Fighting Bob Evans , and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt 's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs .

Nixon 's dog was immortalized in the `` Checkers speech , '' which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions .

He said the only gift he 'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters . Mental Floss : Why was the ` Checkers speech ' so important ?
