A series of errors by pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems led to the crash of Air France Flight 447 , France 's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said Thursday in its final report on the disaster .

The Brazil-to-France flight plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1 , 2009 , killing all 228 people on board .

The report details how the pilots failed to respond effectively to problems with the plane 's speed sensors or to correct its trajectory when things first started to go wrong .

When ice crystals blocked the plane 's pitot tubes , which are part of a system used to determine air speed , the autopilot disconnected and the pilots did not know how to react to what was happening , the report said .

`` The occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight AF 447 , '' the report said .

The crew responded by over-handling the aircraft , which destabilized its flight path and caused further confusing readings , the report said .

The Airbus A330 went into a sustained stall , signaled by a warning message and strong buffeting of the aircraft , the report said .

Some of the recommendations have already been implemented , but it could take years for others fully to come into effect , chief investigator Alain Bouillard told reporters as he introduced the report .

Opinion : Why do planes still crash ?

It 's a crash that never should have happened , said CNN 's aviation specialist Richard Quest . The industry will be studying the human factors of the crew on the plane for many years to come .

History 's deadliest plane crashes

It took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of Flight 447 's wreckage and the majority of the bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean .

The Bureau of Investigation and Analysis said the data indicated that Flight 447 crashed because the aircraft 's speed sensors gave invalid readings .

Who 's really flying the plane ?

Last year 's report from the bureau said the airplane climbed to 38,000 feet when `` the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled . '' It then descended , crashing into the Atlantic . The descent lasted three minutes and 30 seconds , and the engines remained operational , the report said .

Studies of the debris and bodies found soon after the crash led the French agency to conclude the plane hit the water belly first , essentially intact . Oxygen masks were not deployed , indicating that the cabin did not depressurize , the bureau said in a 2009 report .

Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone when it went down . The zone is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet . Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world 's hemispheres meet .

Pilot : ` Damn it , we 're going to crash '

A previous report from the French agency also raised questions about the training of the pilots on the flight .

The recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and `` had received no high altitude training '' to deal with the situation , the bureau said .
