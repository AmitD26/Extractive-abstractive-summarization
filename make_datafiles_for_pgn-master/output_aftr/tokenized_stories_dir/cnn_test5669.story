The operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has said they need help from outside Japan to stabilize and safely decommission damaged reactors at the facility .

`` In that sense , we need support , not only from the Japanese government but from the international community to do this job . ''

Earlier Wednesday , Japan 's Nuclear Regulation Authority -LRB- NRA -RRB- said the new leak was expected to be classified as a level 3 incident on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale , though this will be done once they have received an opinion from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- . The NRA said they have received a first response from the IAEA asking for more details about the leaking tank , especially the structure and its initial role .

`` The current situation is at the point where more surveillance wo n't be enough to keep the accidents from happening , '' Shunichi Tanaka , chairman of the NRA , said at a news conference Wednesday .

`` Our job is now to lower the risk of these accidents from becoming fatal . ''

Water pumped out of the stricken reactor buildings is being stored in large water towers at the site .

In response to the latest leakage of 300 tons of toxic water , a TEPCO spokesman said Wednesday the company has finished removing radioactive water from a leaky tank and transferred it to another tank at the plant .

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was aware of reports that the Nuclear Regulation Authority plans to rate the leak as a level 3 incident .

Scientists have pointed to high radiation levels in the waters off the plant for more than a year as evidence of problems with the company 's efforts to contain the water .

In July , TEPCO admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the plant , even though an underground barrier was built to seal in the water , underscoring a growing sense of crisis at the site .

The authority said in a statement on its website that the plant `` remains in an unstable condition , with various risks to be addressed , and in particular managing the issue of contaminated water as a high priority . ''

Michael Friedlander , a nuclear engineer and former U.S. power plant operator , said the level 3 classification was warranted for the type of situation faced by TEPCO , but he said the risk to the public outside the plant was very low .

`` This is extremely radioactive water , and it would pose a very significant risk to the workers who are going to be in a position to clean it up , '' he told CNN .

But TEPCO spokeswoman Mayumi Yoshida disputed Friedlander 's assessment of the risk posed by the contaminated water . She said workers removing the water from the tank have sufficient protective clothing to prevent exposure .

But experts say that any potential solutions are likely to be difficult , technologically and politically .
