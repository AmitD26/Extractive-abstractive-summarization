It 's called Yik Yak , a location-based app that creates an anonymous social chat room where up to 500 nearby users connect through GPS tracking on their phones . Less than 4 months old , Yik Yak has `` a couple hundred thousand users , mainly in Southeast/East coast campuses , '' its co-founder Brooks Buffington said .

Users are limited to 200 characters , and no pictures are allowed . If a post is `` down voted '' enough times by other users on the forum , the comment disappears . Tech experts are comparing the new Atlanta-based app to a cross between SnapChat and Twitter .

`` The app was made for college-age users or above , for college campuses and to act as a virtual bulletin board , so it acts as local Twitter for their campus , '' Buffington told CNN .

Although the app is meant for users age 17 and older , younger users can still sign up , and that 's where the issues have sprouted .

`` Students were actually coming downstairs to talk to administration , and they were mentioning remarks posted and student names that were obvious , so of course that is going to impact you , '' Melvin Soto , assistant vice principal at Whitney Young High School , told CNN affiliate WLS .

Some students have compared it to a virtual bathroom wall where users post vitriol and hate .

`` They ripped on someone for getting raped , and that 's just so wrong . They said a whole lot of bad things about this girl , '' Whitney Young student Rachel Brown told WLS .

In southern California , a San Clemente High School resource officer told CNN a threatening Yik Yak post caused a bomb scare on campus .

`` The school was placed on lockdown , we conducted a sweep utilizing our bomb squad and bomb-sniffing dogs and nothing suspicious was located on or near the campus , '' Orange County Sheriff 's spokesman Jeff Hallock told CNN .

In Georgia , the principal of Webb Bridge Middle School in Fulton County wrote a cautionary letter to parents warning them about the `` inflammatory -LSB- Yik Yak -RSB- app , '' encouraging them to talk to their children about the `` dangers of social media . '' The school district has blocked the app from its network , but Principal Susan Opferman writes , students have found ways around that too .

These types of incidents have caused the app 's developers to disable it in some areas . Buffington told CNN he does n't want high school students using the app .

But cyberbullying expert Justin W. Patchin says that 's just a short-term solution . He says teens will figure out a way around it .

`` It is pretty impossible to limit it to the ages that the founders have intended , '' said Patchin , who is the co-director at the Cyberbullying Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire . `` When I signed up for the app , it said that you have to be 17 or above to sign in , and of course , there was n't any way of them checking my age so anybody could sign up . ''

`` Anonymity can be a really beautiful thing , and one of the reasons we made it anonymous is it gives people a blank slate to work from , so you 're not judged on your race or sexuality or gender . On Yik Yak you are purely judged on content you create . '' Buffington said .

As more applications pop up and the environments of social networking sites change , Patchin says the emphasis should be on teaching younger generations about respect in online communities .
