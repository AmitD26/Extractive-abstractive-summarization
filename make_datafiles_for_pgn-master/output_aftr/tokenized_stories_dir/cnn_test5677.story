As season 5 of `` Duck Dynasty '' wraps up , co-star Willie Robertson is not backing down from either his faith or the controversy those beliefs helped stir .

New Day : Before season finale , a behind-the-scenes look at ` Duck Dynasty '

Robertson said he believed the GQ interviewer already `` had what he wanted to put , and he was specifically asking this and that . ''

`` Phil just said what he thought , what was on his heart , '' his son said . `` He did some paraphrasing there . ''

The `` Duck Dynasty '' patriarch paraphrased a verse from Corinthians and said , `` Do n't be deceived . Neither the adulterers , the idolaters , the male prostitutes , the homosexual offenders , the greedy , the drunkards , the slanderers , the swindlers -- they wo n't inherit the kingdom of God . Do n't deceive yourself . It 's not right . ''

`` You have to read the Bible and make up your own mind , '' he said . `` You have to decide , and God will ultimately decide then . We do n't profess to be God , and we certainly do n't profess to be perfect . Because we have our own sins that we deal with . ''

`` Anybody who knows -LRB- Phil -RRB- ... any gay , straight , black , white , anybody who knows Phil knows that he is about love and his message is about God 's love , God 's grace and his forgiveness , ultimately , '' Korie Robertson added .

But `` Duck Dynasty '' ratings have slipped since the controversy . And if it all ended tomorrow , both the fame and the TV show , the couple says , the family would be just fine .

`` We were able to use that platform to get out God 's message , and if it ended right there , it ended right there , '' Willie Robertson said . `` I felt like that was pretty much what God prepared us to do . ''
