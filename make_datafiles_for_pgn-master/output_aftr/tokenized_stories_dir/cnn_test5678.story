-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eric Abidal is a fighter . He 's also a philosopher .

The football star 's fate is now firmly in his own hands -- something he thanks God for each and every day .

His faith , and fighting spirit , has helped him climb out of an abyss -- not once , but twice -- recover his strength and stand proudly tall once more .

But the future did not seem so certain in March 2011 . The Frenchman , then at Barcelona , was diagnosed with a cancerous liver tumor following a routine examination .

It was a moment that would not only change his life , but would transform him as a person .

`` It was complicated to come back , but like I always say , sport enabled me to have this mental strength to fight .

`` It was certainly because of that that I managed to be even stronger in that battle . ''

Abidal 's fight with cancer shocked the world of football .

Even the players and president of Real Madrid , Barcelona 's fiercest rival , showed public support for Abidal while he was laid up in a hospital bed following the operation , which took place just days after the tumor had been found .

Teams wore t-shirts urging Abidal a quick recovery , Twitter and Facebook were awash with good wishes and television pictures showed Barcelona fans singing his name in the 22nd minute of each half -- the shirt number which he wore with such distinction .

`` All of that certainly helped me and proved that I was cherished and liked in Catalunya and in the Barcelona team .

`` It motivated me to tell people that , ` Although I am ill , I wo n't let myself go down . I will do everything to come back and try to finish the season with the club . ' ''

`` I always had fighting spirit , '' he says . `` Yes I had the illness but I still had a chance of playing sport at a high level . There are similarities between illness and sport -- you ca n't get beaten .

Abidal surprised everyone by returning to training within weeks of his diagnosis , hoping to make an incredible comeback before the end of the 2010-11 season .

Such was Abidal 's willpower that he did indeed return to the Barca side -- making a substitute appearance against Real Madrid on May 3 .

Just 25 days later he played the full 90 minutes at Wembley as Barca defeated Manchester United 3-1 , and Abidal was afforded the honor of lifting the European Champions League trophy -- a gesture which he will never forget .

`` It was an utter privilege and an honor . I will always thank my teammates for that gesture . ''

Teammate and close Dani Alves offered part of his , but it was not possible due to the impact it would have on his own playing career , so Abidal instead turned to his cousin Gerard .

Abidal again made a heroic comeback , returning to action a year later on April 6 , 2013 as Barcelona went on to regain the Spanish league title from Real .

`` We had a good feeling , we have a similar personality . Everyone knows about the gesture he did for me when I was ill . He remains an important person in my life . ''

After winning 15 trophies in his time with Barca , Abidal returned to where it all began for him as a professional -- Monaco .

His form this season looks likely to secure him a place in France 's World Cup squad in Brazil next year -- not bad for a man who almost lost his life .

`` The move back to Monaco gave me the chance to close a full circle , '' he said .

`` It was important for me . It was n't an easy choice but it was important because I started here and I wanted my kids where their dad started back in the day .

`` I have pictures to show them of me when I was a little younger and things were a bit different . It 's a club which gave me a lot -- a club which gave me a start as a professional and I wanted to give them something back . ''

`` It 's important for me whatever the situation to know that we are not here by accident , '' he said .

`` We certainly all have a mission on earth , mine is to help people .

`` The illness I went through was n't by accident . The way I see it is that God gives you challenges . ''
