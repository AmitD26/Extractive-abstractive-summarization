The family spent Monday at Waza National Park -- a thickly-forested area popular with tourists close to the borders with Nigeria and Chad . Tuesday morning , they began the drive south when they were ambushed and abducted by several armed men on motorbikes , officials said .

The children 's father is an employee of the French company GDF Suez and is based in Yaounde , in the south of Cameroon .

Waza is in a remote part of the country where the borders are porous and criminal and terrorist groups are able to operate freely , according to regional analysts .

French officials immediately pointed the finger at the Nigerian group Boko Haram , which has waged a three-year terror campaign against Christians in northern Nigeria as well as attacking police stations and more moderate Muslims in authority .

French President Francois Hollande said during a visit to Athens on Tuesday : `` I am aware of the presence of Boko Haram in that part of Cameroon , and that 's worrying enough . ''

Hollande said it was likely the kidnappers planned to take the family of seven across the border into Nigeria and said France would do everything possible to prevent that .

Altogether , 15 French citizens are now being held by various groups in the region , six of them by groups aligned with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .

In December , Francis Collomp , a French engineer working in the northern Nigerian state of Katsina , was kidnapped by a jihadist group calling itself Ansar al-Muslimeen . And on Sunday , Ansaru , as it 's also known , launched a much more ambitious operation in Bauchi state , kidnapping seven foreign contractors working on a construction project in response to the `` transgression and atrocities done to the religion of Allah by European countries in places such as Afghanistan and Mali . ''

Boko Haram has links with some of the Islamist militant factions in Mali , and there have been persistent reports that fighters from the group had joined jihadist camps around the city of Gao , which until this month was under the control of a group associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb -LRB- AQIM -RRB- .

More recently , Ham said the U.S. Defense Department had begun feeding intelligence about the group to the Nigerian military .

Nigeria is leading a group of West African countries supporting the French mission in Nigeria , further straining its ability to deal with Islamic extremism at home .

Campbell told CNN on Tuesday that until there was some claim of responsibility , it was difficult to be sure that the abduction in Cameroon had a political dimension .

Campbell also noted that while Ansaru has been quick to claim responsibility for its previous actions , Boko Haram had been largely silent in recent months . The relationship between the two is unclear , according to analysts of jihadist groups in West Africa .

Both Boko Haram and Ansaru first emerged in the northern Nigerian city of Maiduguri .

Andrew Lebovich , who has followed the evolution of both groups , says Ansaru broke away from Boko Haram a year ago and `` has since become known for its similarities and suspected links to AQIM and allied groups such as the Movement for Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa -LRB- MUJAO -RRB- . ''

Ansaru has taken a more hostile attitude toward France . It said the abduction of Collomp was in response to the French government 's stance on Islam -- including the ban on the wearing of the veil in public and in French schools .

The emergence of two apparently resilient terror groups in northern Nigeria , and the surge in attacks on foreigners , pose growing challenges for a government and military already struggling to exert their authority across large areas of Africa 's most populous nation .
