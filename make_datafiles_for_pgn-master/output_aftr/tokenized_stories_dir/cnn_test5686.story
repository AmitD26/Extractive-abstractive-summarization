Good questions , but perhaps more wishful than informed . Teachers should indeed be in charge of classroom instruction , but quality standards are an important piece of a comprehensive effort to boost student achievement . That effort also depends on quality assessments , clear information for parents and teachers to find out whether students have mastered the knowledge and skills they need , and some way to hold schools accountable for meeting the needs of the students they serve .

Before state standards , schools , districts , and teachers held different students to different expectations . Affluent youngsters , especially if they were also white , were much likelier to get rigorous curricula , advanced courses , college-prep `` tracks '' and `` gifted and talented '' classes . Poor and minority students were apt to be placed into low-level courses and into vocational tracks .

More than that , reliable studies show that even the hardest-working teachers with the best of intentions can unconsciously hold students to lower expectations , depending on where those students come from .

For instance , one study published in 2012 by Rutgers psychology professor Kent D. Harber reported what happened when his team gave a poorly written essay to 113 white middle-school and high-school teachers . The teachers were told that the essay was written by a black student , a white student , or a Latino student , and that their feedback would be given directly to the student to help him or her improve .

The result ? The teachers provided more praise and less criticism if they thought the student who wrote the essay was black or Hispanic .

In 2005 , for instance , research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that state achievement growth as measured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress shows that `` accountability systems ... had a clear positive impact on student achievement . ''

Since 2000 , `` the bottom 10 % -LRB- of students -RRB- had gained far more than the national average ... in math and reading , more than a full grade level in math . ''

In math , they focus on the content that matters most and give teachers and their students the time and space they need for deep mastery of the knowledge and skills most needed for college and beyond .

In literacy , the Common Core emphasizes three things that are essential to improving reading comprehension . These are :

The critical link between content and comprehension . Once students learn how to decode , reading comprehension is directly linked not just to their fluency with reading skills , but also with their knowledge and vocabulary . The Common Core underscores this connection and calls for curricula that build knowledge over time .

The importance of `` close reading . '' In a world that discourages us from giving careful attention to much of anything , the Common Core stresses reading closely and carefully , focusing on the author 's words , and using important , rich texts to build knowledge and deepen comprehension . These are essential not just for college readiness , but for full participation in any society 's civic culture .

Now is the time to move past politics and give teachers the space they need to make the promise of these expectations a reality for our children .
