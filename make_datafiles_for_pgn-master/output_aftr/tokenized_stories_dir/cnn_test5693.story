-LRB- CNN -RRB- Talk about a traveler 's nightmare .

`` I had on leggings , a pair of wool socks , winter boots , a long-sleeve shirt , zip-up pullover , a fleece , a winter down jacket , hat , gloves and scarf , '' said passenger Kristine Charbonneau . `` I ended up adding my sweatpants and blankets . ''

Some of the Amtrak passengers shivered inside Union Station during the wait , she said .

Winter weather caused other transportation problems , especially in the Midwest .

In Chicago , the Amtrak assengers arrived at the station expecting the train to leave at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday . After the long wait , the train finally headed to New York and Boston at 11:08 a.m. Thursday , he said .

It 's expected to arrive about 5:30 a.m. Friday at Penn Station in New York , he said . Amtrak sold 144 tickets for the train , plus another 20 that will go to Boston only .

Magliari said waiting passengers could sit in the station or on the train , which has sleeping compartments and reclining seats .

To add to their frustration , the passengers endured a false start toward their destination .

The train initially left Chicago about 8 a.m. Thursday , but Norfolk Southern realized train employees had been on the clock too long , said Robin Chapman , director of public relations for Norfolk Southern . The train was ordered back to Union Station for a fresh crew , Chapman said .

`` Amtrak 48 was ready to go but it was 10.5 hours late because it had had an engine failure , '' Chapman said . `` The crew only had 15 minutes left on their service time because of the hours of service regulation . We could not let them go . ''

For the passengers , it was one more thing .

`` We passed White Sox Stadium and stopped for about half an hour , '' Charbonneau said . `` Our conductor got back on and said that our replacement crew can only work for so many hours . ... There were some people who were really upset . ''
