-LRB- CNN -RRB- The political party of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas posted a drawn image online showing a large pile of skulls and skeletons with Jewish stars on them .

An Israeli government spokesman called it `` despicable . ''

Along with the image , posted Wednesday to the Facebook page of the Fatah party , are the words `` lingering on your skulls . ''

`` Fatah did not design this image , '' Mahmoud al-Aloul said . The person who posted it to Fatah 's page `` is currently being asked to remove it . The image and the text do not reflect the opinions of Fatah . '' The image was then pulled from the page .

Fatah is considered the more moderate of the two major Palestinian political parties . Hamas , which controls Gaza , has engaged in repeated battles with Israel in recent years . Fatah controls the West Bank .

Ehud Yaari of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy called the latest image `` typical of their ongoing propaganda . ''

It 's not the first time Fatah Facebook images have sparked anger . After three Israeli teens were kidnapped and killed last year , `` The Facebook page for Fatah , the Palestinian Authority 's main party , had a number of cartoons , including one showing the three teenagers as Jewish rats , wearing yarmulkes , caught on a fishing line , '' world affairs columnist Frida Ghitis wrote on CNN.com .
