Apollo Nida , who appears on the reality TV series with Parks , was arrested last week following a year-long investigation by the U.S. Secret Service , according to the criminal complaint .

Nida , who served five years in a federal prison for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009 , allegedly set up several fake collection companies as part of the scheme , Special Agent Alexandre Herrera said in a sworn affidavit .

But the only thing the collection companies collected was the personal information of people that Nida used to get fraudulent auto loans , according to the complaint .

She turned on him and agreed to let agents record their phone calls , it said .

Nida `` knowingly and willfully execute and attempt to execute a scheme to defraud federally insured financial institutions by depositing stolen and fraudulently obtained checks and fraudulently obtained auto loan proceeds into bank accounts opened in the stolen identities of real persons , and conspire with others to do so , and knowingly convert to his use and the use of others stolen and fraudulently obtained United States Treasury Checks , '' Agent Herrera said .

Along with the fraudulent auto loan checks , Nida stole U.S. Treasury checks , `` retirement checks issued to Delta Airlines employees , and checks in the names of real people that were owed unclaimed property from various state and federal government agencies , '' the complaint said .
