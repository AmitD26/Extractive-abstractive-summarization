This week , as the Senate decides whether to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and Valentine 's Day approaches , it 's worth noting that most domestic violence victims do n't ask for roses , chocolate or federal funding . Instead , we have one simple wish : We want the abuse to end .

Watch Leslie Steiner 's TEDx Talk

Many victims know instinctively what friends and family usually do n't : The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after you leave . More than 70 % of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out . Like 20-year-old Selina Brown , who was shot in the face last year as she and her toddler daughter tried to board a bus . So safe shelter is , naturally , our biggest priority .

So I went to court alone .

Fortunately , a young legal aid attorney from a local women 's shelter showed up . She spoke to my husband and the judge . She pointed me in the direction of the bullet-proof glass window where my new restraining order awaited . She recommended a divorce lawyer I could hire immediately .

Thanks to her , and dozens of other strangers who helped me , I left my ex-husband . Today I 'm happily remarried and the mother of three wonderful children . I have a black lab and drive a Honda Odyssey minivan . I could n't have left and rebuilt such an ordinary , happy life without the kindness of others .

Here in Washington , 700 registered pro bono lawyers have joined forces with a new nonprofit , the D.C. Volunteer Lawyers Project . It now has more attorneys than Washington 's largest law firm . The lawyers are typically stay-at-home moms craving volunteer work that puts their legal training to good use .

I call that true love .

This Valentine 's Day , I 'd like to call on all lawyers in Washington and elsewhere to consider helping stop domestic violence for good . The D.C. Volunteer Lawyers Project model can be replicated in any small town or big city . By giving victims a little pro bono assistance , lawyers can help make our nation 's dinner tables , homes and families the safe and peaceful oases they should be . By giving a small amount of time , like the advocate who helped me so many years ago , we can all help victims of domestic violence .
