Another day , another storm , in what 's proving to be a wet , wild and nasty winter .

Some are taking it in stride .

Others were ready for it to be all over . One item frequently shared Wednesday over social media was a picture of an angry-looking baby , with the words `` What do you mean more snow ... '' superimposed on it .

Here 's a look at what winter 's bringing around the country :

For snow and ice , parts of the Midwest and Northeast in a band running from Illinois east all the way to Maine . For cold temperatures , it 's the nation 's midsection , from Montana east to Wisconsin all the way south to northern Texas .

Snowy , icy conditions are expected from eastern Missouri into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England . Up to 2 inches of snow per hour may fall around Boston , with as much as a foot of snow predicted in parts of Massachusetts .

`` New Yorkers in affected regions should stay off the roads , check on their neighbors and loved ones , and stay inside their homes until the worst of the storm has passed , '' he said in a statement .

Transportation regulators waived rest rules for salt-truck drivers to get remaining salt stockpiles moved to where they are needed : New York City and Long Island .

In Boston , the weather seemed little nuisance .

CNN iReporter Jenifer Schwartz , visiting from California , marveled at how the city handled the storm .

Relative Boston newcomer and native Southerner Josh Parsons was just trying to process it all .

`` Since this is my first winter in the North , the snow still feels like a novelty to me , '' he told CNN on Wednesday . `` I enjoy seeing it falling and enjoy walking around in it right after the fresh snow . Having said that , I do not like some of the things that come along with the snow . ''

Such as ? Salt , slush and the simple fact all the snow just wo n't go away .

`` The roads get cleared , the sidewalks get cleared , but then there are just mounds or brown , dirty ice piled up everywhere , '' he said .

Meanwhile , in Michigan , two Delta Air Lines aircraft got stuck in the snow in unrelated incidents at Detroit Metro Airport .

This comes a day after a Southwest Airlines plane hit a snowbank as it was taxiing to a gate in Kansas City , Missouri , according to airline spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger .

Nationwide , airlines had canceled nearly 2,800 flights , according to flight tracking website Flightaware.com .

The Federal Aviation Administration also reported significant delays at airports in Chicago , Philadelphia and Charlotte , North Carolina .

Why all the severe weather this winter ?

It 's not unusual or unprecedented , Radley Horton , a climate scientist with Columbia University , told CNN 's New Day .

`` There 's always going to be variability , '' Horton said . `` There 's always going to be these waves in the jet stream . But it does seem , according to some research , as we lose that sea ice in the Arctic , one possible surprise could be more cold air spilling south , more warm air going north . ''
