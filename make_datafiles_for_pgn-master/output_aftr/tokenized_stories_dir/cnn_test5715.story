WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iran halted work toward a nuclear weapon under international scrutiny in 2003 and is unlikely to be able to produce enough enriched uranium for a bomb until 2010 to 2015 , a U.S. intelligence report says .

A file satellite image shows Iranian nuclear facilities .

The estimate is less severe than a 2005 report that judged the Iranian leadership was `` determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure . ''

But the latest report says Iran -- which declared its ability to produce enriched uranium for a civilian energy program in 2006 -- could reverse that decision and eventually produce a nuclear weapon if it wanted to do so .

Enriched uranium at low concentrations can be used to fuel nuclear power plants , but much higher concentrations are needed to yield a nuclear explosion .

`` We judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date Iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon is late 2009 , but that this is very unlikely , '' the report says . A more likely time frame for that production is between 2010 and 2015 , it concludes . Watch what new report says about Iran 's nuclear ambitions ''

Iran has insisted its nuclear program is strictly aimed at producing electricity , and the country has refused the U.N. Security Council 's demand to halt its enrichment program .

Monday 's report represents the consensus of U.S. intelligence agencies . It suggests that a combination of `` threats of intensified international scrutiny and pressures , along with opportunities for Iran to achieve its security , prestige and goals for regional influence in other ways , '' could persuade the Iranian leadership to continue its suspension of nuclear weapons research .

Available intelligence suggests the Iranian leadership is guided `` by a cost-benefit approach , '' not a headlong rush to develop a bomb , the report concludes .

U.S. National Security adviser Stephen Hadley expressed hope after Monday 's announcement , but he said Iran remains a serious threat .

He said U.S. policy toward Iran has not changed because of the new report .

`` If we want to avoid a situation where we either have to accept Iran ... with a path to a nuclear weapon , or the possibility of having to use force to stop it , with all the connotations of World War III -- then we need to step up the diplomacy , step up the pressure , to get Iran to stop their so-called civilian uranium enrichment program , '' he said . `` That 's our policy going forward -- no change . ''

Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV , chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , welcomed the news .

`` The key judgments show that the intelligence community has learned its lessons from the Iraq debacle , '' the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement . `` It has issued judgments that break sharply with its own previous assessments , and they reflect a real difference from the views espoused by top administration officials .

Sen. Joe Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said the fact that Iran was several years away from nuclear weapons capability meant `` the international community has a significant window of opportunity in which to act to avoid the stark choice between going to war or accepting a nuclear Iran .
