Officials had said earlier both controversial policies were under review , but that did not diminish the force of Friday 's announcement .

Set up in 1957 , the system allows the police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves , prostitutes and drug addicts -- in labor camps for up to four years without a trial . China 's judicial process itself is already controlled by the ruling Communists in a one-party regime . In a 2009 report to a United Nations human rights forum , the Chinese government acknowledged 320 such facilities nationwide holding 190,000 people . Other estimates have put the number of inmates much higher .

As part of the reforms , China said it will reduce the number of crimes subject to the death penalty .

Even those who know little about China have likely heard about its one-child policy . China 's family planning laws require most families living in urban areas to have one child .

The one-child policy , though applauded by many for slowing down China 's population growth , has been widely criticized for resulting in forced abortions and hefty fines that are sometimes used to enforce it .

Another man , walking through the Beijing metro with his girlfriend , agreed .

`` When I get married , I would prefer having two children as I 'm the only child in my family . My childhood was a bit boring , '' he said .

A third commuter also praised the changes : `` It 's a great new policy . Raising three kids is a bit stressful , but two are just perfect . ''
