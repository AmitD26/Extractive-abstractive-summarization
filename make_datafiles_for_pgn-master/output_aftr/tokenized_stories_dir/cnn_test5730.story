The administration 's policy in the increasingly unstable country has come under scrutiny in recent days as the U.S.-backed government crumbled under pressure from Shiite Houthi rebels .

`` The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country , '' Obama said .

In the capital , Sanaa , last week , the presidential palace was overrun by Houthi rebels and President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi announced he was resigning .

Amid the uncertainty in Yemen last week , it was reported the U.S. had suspended its counterterror efforts there . Obama said definitively on Sunday those reports were wrong .

`` We continue to go after high-value targets inside Yemen , '' he said .

Explaining why he was ruling out sending American troops to fight ISIS , Obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in Yemen and Somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists .

What that strategy relied on , however , was a strong partnership between the United States and the existing government in Yemen , led by Hadi . Hadi reorganized Yemen 's military to better go after AQAP , a strategy that worked for a time . But the plan was waylaid when resources were diverted to battle the militant Houthis , a group of Shiites who say they feel marginalized in the majority Sunni country .

Obama was confident on Sunday that U.S. anti-terror efforts would continue in Yemen .
