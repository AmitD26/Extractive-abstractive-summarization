Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- With an unrestricted , panoramic night view of the city 's twinkling skyline and the breezy air right outside the front door , a 15th floor penthouse apartment ticks all the boxes for a million-dollar property in the heart of Hong Kong .

Fung , 59 , who prefers not to divulge his full name , lives in an illegal rooftop slum -- a 75-square-feet shack just big enough to host a bed , a cupboard , and everyday knick-knacks thrown pell-mell in the dusty room . The rent costs $ 1,700 Hong Kong dollars -LRB- US$ 220 -RRB- a month .

Local authorities have been taping eviction notices on his front door for the past month , saying that he has to move out . But with high property prices and hundreds of thousands waiting for public housing in Hong Kong , Fung , has no other places to go .

The authorities offer a relocation settlement for rooftop residents , to Fung -- it is too meager . Most people in his position do n't have a stable income to start again elsewhere .

Clearing out

Constructed on top of buildings since the 1950s and 60s without government approval , these makeshift communities clutter the rooftops in old working-class neighborhoods such as Kowloon . Corrugated metal sheets roughly cover concrete-walled shacks . And they 've provided vital accommodations for low-income people such as migrants from mainland China and Southeast Asia for more than half a century .

According to the latest figures from Hong Kong 's Census and Statistics Department , there were 3,747 rooftop dwellers in 1,588 households in 2011 . This is a dramatic drop from 2001 when more than 16,000 people lived illegally in these sky slums .

Limited space

Atop an industrial building that houses textile and publishing companies , Fung and around 40 other residents navigate their way through dark and haphazardly boarded walkways , occasionally lit up by an overhanging light bulb , or the glowing screen of a smartphone .

Tangled electric wires that also double as laundry lines , criss-cross from one end of the roof to the other . An open square lies in the middle , scattered with pieces of unwanted furniture , flower boxes and kids ' toys , which strangely bring color and cheer to the crowded space .

Fung works mostly in the construction sector and earns around $ 8,000 Hong Kong dollars -LRB- US$ 1,000 -RRB- a month , barely enough to take care of his 10-year-old daughter and to cover the rent .

`` I used to own property in Shenzhen , but I moved back to Hong Kong four years ago so my daughter can have a better education here , '' Fung said , as his neighbors trickled out to join the conversation .

The rooftop slums in the neighborhood are unofficially rented out by the building 's top floor owners who want to earn some cash on the side , according to Fung . For Ngan 's mother , she says she has no idea who she 's been paying her rent to for the past three years .

`` I just put the money in an envelope that comes every month on time and that is it , '' says Sze Suk Pui .

The housing crunch highlights the widening economic divide for the city of seven million residents .

A survey published in early 2014 by Demographia International Housing Affordability revealed that Hong Kong 's property market has become the world 's most expensive , with the median housing price reaching $ 4,024,000 Hong Kong dollars , or US$ 519,216 .

The hike in property prices signifies a thriving economy in Hong Kong , and construction jobs have been on the rise to meet the housing demand . They provide increasing job opportunities for people like Fung who work in the sector , but their financial struggles suggest that little of the money generated from the construction boom trickles down into their pockets .

With inflating property prices , and an ever widening income gap , what future lies in store for these rooftop dwellers ?

When construction worker Fung was asked about his future plans after his imminent eviction , he just chuckled .

`` I 'll think about that when they really come and tear this down . If I can live here for one more day , I 'll continue to stay here . '' he says .
