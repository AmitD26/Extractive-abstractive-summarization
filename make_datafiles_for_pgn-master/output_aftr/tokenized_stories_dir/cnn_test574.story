Nearly a year after receiving approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , a new obesity drug will be available to certain patients by prescription , starting Tuesday .

The FDA approved Belviq , an oral medication , in June 2012 . The delay in availability was in part because the Drug Enforcement Administration needed to review the drug .

Belviq , as the FDA pointed out in its statement announcing approval last year , is intended `` as an addition to a reduced-calorie diet and exercise . ''

Belviq , or lorcaserin hydrochloride , works by activating a serotonin receptor in the brain , which may help a person eat less and feel full after eating smaller amounts of food , according to the FDA .

At the time of approval , the FDA said Belviq 's manufacturer , Arena Pharmaceuticals , would be required to conduct six post-marketing studies , including a long-term cardiovascular trial to assess the risk of heart attack and stroke .

The most common side effects of Belviq in nondiabetic patients included headache , dizziness and fatigue , according to the FDA . In diabetic patients , side effects included pain and low blood sugar .
