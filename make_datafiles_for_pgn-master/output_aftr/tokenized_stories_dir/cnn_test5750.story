We could learn a thing or two by looking at what Prohibition brought to the United States : an increase in consumption of hard liquor , organized crime taking over legal production and distribution and widespread anger with the federal government .

Here we are , four decades after Richard Nixon declared the war on drugs in 1971 and $ 1 trillion spent since then . What do we have to show for it ?

The U.S. has the largest prison population in the world , with about 2.3 million behind bars . More than half a million of those people are incarcerated for a drug law violation . What a waste of young lives .

Opinion : The end of the war on marijuana

In the United States , if illegal drugs were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco , they would yield $ 46.7 billion in tax revenue . A Cato study says legalizing drugs would save the U.S. about $ 41 billion a year in enforcing the drug laws .

Have U.S. drug laws reduced drug use ? No . The U.S. is the No. 1 nation in the world in illegal drug use . As with Prohibition , banning alcohol did n't stop people drinking -- it just stopped people obeying the law .

About 40,000 people were in U.S. jails and prisons for drug crimes in 1980 , compared with more than 500,000 today . Excessively long prison sentences and locking up people for small drug offenses contribute greatly to this ballooning of the prison population . It also represents racial discrimination and targeting disguised as drug policy . People of color are no more likely to use or sell illegal drugs than white people -- yet from 1980 to 2007 , blacks were arrested for drug law violations at rates 2.8 to 5.5 times higher than white arrest rates .

How would our society , our communities and daily lives improve if we took the money we use running a police and prison state and put it into education and health ? Treating drugs as a health issue could save billions , improve public health and help us better control violence and crime in our communities . Hundreds of thousands of people have died from overdoses and drug-related diseases , including HIV and hepatitis C , because they did n't have access to cost-effective , life-saving solutions .

A Pew study says it costs the U.S. an average of $ 30,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate , but the nation spends only an average $ 11,665 per public school student . The future of our nations and our children should be our priority . We should be helping people addicted to drugs break their habits rather than putting users in prison .

When it comes to drugs , we should focus on the goals we agree on : protecting our kids , protecting public safety and preventing and treating drug abuse and addiction . To help unlock barriers to drug reform , last June , I joined the Global Commission on Drug Policy , which is bringing global leadership to drug reform to make fact-based research public and draw attention to successful alternative approaches .

As part of this work , a new documentary , `` Breaking the Taboo , '' narrated by Oscar award-winning actor Morgan Freeman and produced by my son Sam Branson 's indie Sundog Pictures , followed the commission 's attempts to break the political taboo over the war on drugs . The film exposes the biggest failure of global policy in the past 40 years and features revealing contributions from global leaders , including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter .

It is time we broke the taboo and opened up the debate about the war on drugs . We need alternatives that focus on education , health , taxation and regulation .
