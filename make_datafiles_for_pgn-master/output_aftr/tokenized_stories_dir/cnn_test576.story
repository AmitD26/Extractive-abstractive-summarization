Republican victories nationwide in this Tuesday 's midterm elections gave the GOP 's possible presidential hopefuls a surge of momentum Tuesday night as they enter a period of serious consideration of their own White House bids .

`` Hillary Clinton was very active in Kentucky , '' Paul told CNN 's Brianna Keilar at an event for Sen. Mitch McConnell , referring to Clinton 's multiple stops in the Bluegrass State for Democratic challenger , Alison Lundergan Grimes .

`` The interesting thing is , Ms. Grimes decided she was going to run as a Clinton Democrat , '' he continued . `` Well I think we soundly rejected that in Kentucky , also in Arkansas . ''

-LRB- Sen. Mark Pryor , a Democrat with close ties to the Clintons , was defeated in Arkansas Tuesday night by Republican Tom Cotton . -RRB-

Paul has been hounding Clinton and her record as Secretary of State for much of the past year . But with the midterms mostly over now , his attacks will carry more weight with 2016 now squarely in the political spotlight .

`` We say to Hillary Clinton : Yes , businesses do create jobs , '' he said .

While Paul was by far the most brazen about tying the election to Clinton , others expressed optimism about the party 's future -- and their place in it .

In effort to set himself apart in a way that could promise more trouble ahead between him and other Republicans , Cruz even refused to say if he would support McConnell as Senate Majority Leader .

`` That will be a decision for the conference to make , '' Cruz told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . Cruz declined to answer further questions about whether he would vote to support McConnell or not .

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , who also spent Election Night in Texas , expressed a completely different message about the aftermath of the evening 's results . Bush emphasized governing -- which would require Republicans to work with Democrats , given that the party wo n't have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and Obama 's continued presence in the White House .

`` Republicans in Congress now have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to demonstrate to American voters that our party can effectively govern , '' Bush said in a statement . `` That requires pursuing and passing a serious growth agenda for our nation that expands opportunity for all Americans . ''

Democrats , meanwhile , remained mostly silent Tuesday night in the face of a wave of party losses . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Vice President Joseph Biden and outgoing Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley , all Democrats considering White House runs , did not release statements on Election Night .
