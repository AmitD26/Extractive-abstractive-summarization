Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- Maybe the thieves did n't know what they were stealing .

The car normally travels in an 18-wheeler , but the hauler arrived at the Speedway early to escape bad weather back in Charlotte , North Carolina , the team said . The car remained behind for some minor work , said the team and driver Travis Kvapil .

`` It was n't quite ready to go to the racetrack yet , '' Kvapil told CNN on Saturday . `` The guys had to continue to do some more work on it at the shop , so they stayed back with the car and then just sent it down a day later with the truck and smaller trailer and parked it in the hotel parking lot . ''

Early Saturday , the team tweeted photos of the recovered orange and blue car , in the dark on the side of a road . The Chevrolet was found by itself , minus the stolen Ford truck and trailer , in Loganville , about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta Motor Speedway , the team wrote in a series of tweets Saturday .

The man who found the race car , Philip Whitmer , says he was in disbelief when he saw it a few feet off the road . It was 2:30 a.m. and he was driving to his fianc√©e 's house when he spotted it .

Whitmer says he called police , who at first did n't believe him . In front of the car were ramps and next to it were the straps that secured the car in the trailer , he said .

There were also dusty handprints above the driver 's door , he said -- though it 's not clear whether they were from the thieves .

`` The biggest thing is , we found that racecar , '' Kvapil said . `` It 's a small team and this -LRB- would have been -RRB- a big setback for us if that was missing . It was enough of a setback as it was , not being able to qualify and run the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway this weekend . ''

Kvapil said he is `` really thankful and happy for all the guys who worked so hard on this car . They put a lot of hours into it , and it would have been a real shame if it was gone . ''

By Saturday afternoon , the No. 44 car was back at the team 's shop in Mooresville , North Carolina , where it will be given a thorough inspection . So far , Kvapil said , `` it looks shipshape . ''

Team owner John Cohen said they plan to compete in the rest of the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season .

The next race is March 8 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway .
