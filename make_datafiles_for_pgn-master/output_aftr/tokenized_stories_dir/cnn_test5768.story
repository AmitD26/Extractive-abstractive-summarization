For travelers , this means a renewed opportunity to explore one of Africa 's most interesting states .

At 679,362 square miles , Libya is second in size only to neighboring Algeria among North African countries . It 's two and a half times bigger than Texas , almost 85 times the size of Wales and 90 % desert .

2 . Road travel is exciting but hazardous

By car , the 600-mile journey along the coast between Tripoli and Libya 's second city , Benghazi , takes around 12 hours .

Heading south from Tripoli to the ancient Berber trading town of Ghadames is an eight or nine hour slog , while the Ubari Lakes in the southern desert region of Fezzan lie some 13 hours from Tripoli .

As well as recalcitrant camels , encroaching dunes , sand storms and wildly unpredictable driving conditions and drivers , the insecurity of postrevolutionary Libya demands travelers ' full attention before any overland journey .

Stifling Gadhafi-era group travel restrictions no longer exist , but for tourists with limited time , complicated land explorations are best made through tour operators utilizing their vehicles and drivers .

3 . There 's no drinking -LRB- except there is -RRB-

The `` Free Officers '' of Gadhafi 's 1969 coup d'etat banned alcohol , and there 's no chance of change .

Despite public conservatism , however , Libyans close to a suitable land border are no strangers to losing themselves in a foreign bar , and regular cross-border traffic means lots of illicit alcohol enters the country from Egypt and Tunisia .

It 's an open secret that cars of young men parked in out-of-the-way places are often de facto drinking dens .

As well as smuggled booze , a drink known as bokha , distilled from dates , figs or grapes , is widely consumed .

4 . The ATMs do n't work

Plastic cards can not be relied upon , either to pay bills or get money from ATMs or banks .

As a result it 's not uncommon to see large , tightly bound bricks of dinars exchanged as a matter of course .

Those accustomed to cashless card-driven lifestyles may feel uncomfortable when carrying large quantities of banknotes .

Despite recent high-profile outrages perpetrated by militias , religious ideologues or both , crimes against individuals such as muggings and thefts are rare . And in commerce , Libyans are straightforward and honest to a fault .

It 's a constant refrain among the postrevolutionary populace , however , that `` Libya is a rich country but the people are poor . ''

Walking around the neglected , crumbling streets of Benghazi , a city that has seen little investment since World War II , one can only wonder where the oil revenues were spent .

Economic prospects for Libya may about to improve . The World Bank estimates 16 % to 18 % growth in GDP for 2013 , the International Monetary Fund suggests nearer 20 % .

6 . It 's not all sand

Jebel Akhdar -LRB- Green Mountain -RRB- is an achievable day-trip from Benghazi , a good reminder that Libya is n't all desert . Quite literally , the trip provides a breath of fresh air .

Relatively high rainfall means these uplands live up to their name -- fields yield healthy cereal crops and orchards produce succulent fruit , while Libya 's luckiest sheep graze rolling green hillside pastures .

Before the revolution , Moammar Gadhafi portrait was everywhere in Libya . Without turning your head , it was easy to reach double figures when counting reproductions of his all-seeing image .

Now they 're gone , often replaced by images of an elderly man in white robes -- Omar Mukhtar .

Who is he ?

Opposition was quelled only when a 73-year-old Mukhtar was captured and executed by Italian armed forces in 1931 .

Gadhafi was right to be worried . Omar Mukhtar remained an inspiration to modern revolutionaries , and in 2011 , his battle cry of `` We will win or we will die '' was heard once more .

8 . It 's filled with Greco-Roman heritage

And 120 miles east of Benghazi , the ruins of Cyrene reflect enduring Greek influences of language and architecture ; the city 's Temple of Zeus is larger than the Parthenon in Athens .

Leptis Magna and Sabratha are easy day trips from Tripoli ; Cyrene is reached from Benghazi and with an early start can also be visited in a day . Because of poor security , travel eastward to Derna is n't recommended .

Though it 's easy to visit sites independently , a knowledgeable guide can bring the ruins to life . Temehu -LRB- www.temehu.com -RRB- can organize excursions in advance .
