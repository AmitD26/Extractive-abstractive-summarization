-LRB- CNN -RRB- Its a high stakes game of stick or twist with billions of dollars at stake .

Traditionally at this time of year , a clutch of nervous owners in charge of struggling clubs in England 's top flight grapple with the prospect of relegation , and the enormous hole it threatens to blow in their finances .

Do they stick by a floundering manager hoping he can regroup and lead his team out of the mire , or do they get rid and hope the appointment of new coach can transform its fortunes ?

Less than a year ago Poyet masterminded a miraculous run of form that saw the north east outfit triumph at Chelsea and Manchester United in order to stave off the threat of demotion .

`` It 's inevitable Sunderland will have been thinking about money , '' Simon Chadwick , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at Coventry University , told CNN .

`` Particularly television money , because it now accounts for over 50 % of most , if not all , Premier League clubs ' turnover .

`` It 'd be very easy to say they are thinking long term about money and long term about the next television contract but in reality , very often it is short term thinking .

`` Whilst I 'm sure Sunderland are mindful of what 's going to happen in 2016 , they 'll be even more mindful of what 's going to happen in the summer of 2015 if they go down . ''

`` Most obviously , the TV revenues from the Premier League deal , '' Chadwick answered when asked what Sunderland stands to lose if it does fall through the trapdoor .

Villa 's American owner Randy Lerner , who is in the process of trying to sell the club , decided to act after a miserable run of form that saw them score just 12 goals in its opening 25 EPL matches .

After Saturday 's win , the Birmingham club is now three points clear of the relegation places and Short will be hoping for a similar bounce when he appoints a new man .

According to Chadwick , research shows a change of manager at this late stage of the campaign can provide all-important impetus , but he argues there are few `` impact managers '' available at present .

And he suggests the approach of Short and Lerner proves American owners still do n't fully understand the dynamic of English football as well as they perhaps should .

`` It 's easy to succumb to fan pressure and results but there 's a particular culture in football generally -- obviously inside clubs as well -- and I 'm not sure American owners are in tune with that , '' he said .

Chadwick also says the bumper television revenue afforded to clubs in modern football has created a tiered Premier League in which few teams outside the established giants can realistically expect to compete at the top end .

`` In one sense , it 's always been like this , '' he said . `` You go back to the 1980s when Liverpool were dominant -- some teams knew they were n't going to be champions .

`` Whilst the Premier League would argue it 's a progressive system in the sense that the collective deal does allocate finances to clubs that perhaps those in Spain do n't have , even so , such is the magnitude of the payments made to the achieving clubs its almost inevitable you will get the likes of Manchester United , Arsenal and the rest dominating .

`` For the likes of the north east clubs Sunderland , Newcastle and Middlesbrough it is great if they can get there , even better if they can stay there . ''
