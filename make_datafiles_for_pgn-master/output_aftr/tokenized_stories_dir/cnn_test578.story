Experts say prevention and improved treatment has lowered the U.S. cancer death rate .

The findings are published in the July/August issue of CA : A Cancer Journal for Clinicians .

A drop in hormone replacement therapy leads to a decline in breast cancer cases

`` It 's great news that a large chunk of the decreased death rates in women can be attributed to breast cancer , '' she said . This is largely due to a decreased use of hormone replacement therapy -LRB- HRT -RRB- , which has been shown to increase a woman 's risk of developing breast cancer . HRT fell from grace after a large government-funded study known as the Women 's Health Initiative was stopped early because the risks of HRT , including an increased risk of breast cancer , greatly outnumbered the benefits of the therapy .

Another reason for the decline in breast cancer deaths , however , is delayed diagnosis due to the fact that many women are not getting their yearly X-ray or mammogram .

`` Fewer women are getting mammography and that 's why fewer women are getting diagnosed with breast cancer , so eventually that will come back and bite us in the rear end , '' Weiss said .

Black women continue to die of breast cancer at a greater rate than their white counterparts , she pointed out .

What 's more , the current obesity epidemic may fuel a rise in the rates .

And that 's not all : `` Fat brings on puberty earlier and early puberty is a risk factor for breast cancer , '' Weiss said .

`` These areas of disappointment are areas of opportunity , '' she added . But greater efforts are needed to encourage healthy eating and exercise to help combat obesity , especially in adolescents , she said . Health.com : Melt pounds with mix-and-match cardio routines

Another encouraging sign is a drop in colorectal cancer deaths due to better and more widespread screening .

`` Colorectal cancer screening saves lives because it detects cancer at early stages when treatment is more effective , and it also removes precancerous lesions , '' said Jemal . The current recommendation for people at average risk of colon cancer is to get regular screening tests starting at age 50 .

Not all good news

`` We have n't seen a decrease here yet , but cigarette smoking in women peaked about 20 years later than it did in men , '' Jemal said . He predicts a decrease in lung cancer deaths in women in the next 5 years .
