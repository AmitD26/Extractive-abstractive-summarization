-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some Democrats say they fear their party 's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination .

But even some superdelegates are questioning the system , as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome .

At least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses .

While pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they 'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus , superdelegates are free to vote however they want . And even if they pledge their support to a candidate , they 're free to change at any time .

Clinton already has 234 superdelegates and Obama has 157 . But Obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates , 1,096 to 977 , and is on a roll , having won all eight nominating contests since Super Tuesday . See which states pledged delegates come from ''

`` The problem is -LSB- if -RSB- people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead , insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process , particularly the young people who are voting for the first time , will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated , '' he said .

'' -LSB- Superdelegates -RSB- are the keepers of the faith , '' said former San Francisco , California , Mayor Willie Brown . `` You have superdelegates because this is the Democratic Party . You do n't want the bleed-over from the Green Party , the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be . ''

Devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984 .

Mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor .

Each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side .

Rae said he has n't yet decided how he 'll vote in Wisconsin 's primary on Tuesday .

Crystal Strait , a party activist from California , said she 's received calls from Clinton herself and daughter Chelsea but she remains uncommitted .

Massachusetts superdelegate John Walsh said he 'll stay loyal to Obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in Walsh 's state . So will fellow Massachusetts superdelegates Sens. Edward Kennedy and John Kerry .

Among Clinton 's committed superdelegates are Harold Ickes Jr. , her husband 's former deputy chief of staff ; Terry McAuliffe , who led her husband 's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign ; and her husband .

Whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates , even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote , could split the party .

Devine said it could hurt the party in the general election .

`` I think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we 're saying we will pursue in government as Democrats are based on fairness , whether it 's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance , there 's a fairness component in all of that , '' he said . `` People need to believe , I think , that our process is fair as well , if they want to believe that our policies will be fair .
