-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chevy Chase did n't look like Gerald Ford and did n't sound like Gerald Ford . But in the mid-1970s , when `` Saturday Night Live '' first went on the air , Chase -- then a writer and cast member of the show -- made his impression of the president , rife with pratfalls and slapstick , the talk of the country .

He also made the president a butt of jokes , which was intentional , Chase told CNN in an interview .

More recently , Dana Carvey 's malaprop-laden impression of George H.W. Bush , Hartman 's puppy-dog Bill Clinton , Will Ferrell 's George W. Bush and Tina Fey 's Sarah Palin have embedded themselves in the culture .

Certainly , `` SNL '' -- which began as one of the old '60s counterculture 's first forays into network TV -- has also mocked Democrats . Indeed , sketches about the Democratic debates in the spring , one of which portrayed the media as fawning over Barack Obama , gave Hillary Clinton ammunition in her pursuit of the nomination . The writer of that sketch , Jim Downey , has been described as leaning conservative , though he was quoted in a March New York Times article as calling himself a registered Democrat .

In the same article , `` SNL '' creator Lorne Michaels said , `` We do n't lay down for anybody . ''

Chase talked about his Ford impression and the political impact of `` Saturday Night Live '' with CNN 's Alina Cho . The following is an edited version of that interview .

CNN : Let 's go back to ' 76 .

Chevy Chase : It was Gerald Ford that was president but had n't been elected and was running again and I just ...

CNN : Some people say he was an accidental president and you made him accident prone .

Chase : Actually , he was accident prone and he was a sweet man , a terrific man , became good friends later , and a relatively good athlete in college too ... but he just tripped over things a lot . ... You know , after a while , you just start writing the jokes and start doing it .

CNN : You mean to tell me in the back of your mind you were thinking , hey I want Carter ...

Chase : Oh yeah . What do you think they 're doing now , you think they 're just doing this because Sarah 's funny ? No , I think that the show is very much more Democratic and liberal-oriented , that they are obviously more for Barack Obama . -LSB- In the '70s -RSB- , out of the Nixon era , and it was not unlikely that I might go that direction .

CNN : What do you think of Tina Fey 's portrayal of Sarah Palin ?

CNN : So having said that , what do you think then the impact is ? You touched on your impact on Ford and his presidency ...

CNN : Is -LSB- `` SNL 's '' politics -RSB- fair ?

Chase : Fair ? What do you mean fair ? They 're an all-purpose comedy show . Of course it 's fair , it 's satire , it 's what it is , and it 's fair , if you have your own television show , to give your own opinion . ... They did n't let Barack off the hook a lot either , you know , when they said , `` Is there anything you would like sir , a little more coffee . ... ''
