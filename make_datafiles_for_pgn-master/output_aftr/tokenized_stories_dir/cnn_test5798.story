-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy . I may not have the answer for how to thrive in a lousy economy . But the truck stop dentist figured it out a long time ago .

`` When your dental practice is in a truck stop , you do n't have a lot of patients coming in for their six-month cleanings , '' said Dr. Thomas P. Roemer . `` You have people walking in holding their jaws in pain . Treatment is not optional -- they need to see a dentist , and they need to see me now . ''

Dr. Roemer 's one-man dental office is inside the Iowa 80 Truckstop , at Exit 284 of Interstate 80 , near the small town of Walcott . The complex proclaims itself to be the world 's largest truck stop , and if you 've never been there -- well , the truck stop itself is probably a story for another time . Suffice it to say that the establishment is spread over 200 acres , that it features its own movie theater , a 300-seat restaurant with a 50-foot salad bar , the Super Truck Showroom -LRB- more than 75,000 truck-related items for sale , festooned with enough gleaming chrome to make you reach for your sunglasses -RRB- .

But the topic for today is Dr. Roemer , and how he ended up offering root canals in a building where people stop for diesel fuel .

These desperate economic times highlight the importance of individual inventiveness and ingenuity -- and a dentist has to be beyond ingenious to gaze upon an Iowa truck stop and figure out : A fellow could make himself a pretty nice living in there .

Business is good , he said , even during the recession . There have been stories from around the country about doctors and dentists seeing fewer patients , because people just do n't have the money to come in for regular checkups . But a truck stop dental office is not a place where patients come because they have planned it -- a truck stop dental office is a place where patients come because they need immediate relief .

But how do truckers learn about Dr. Roemer 's practice ?

`` Word of mouth , '' he said .

-LRB- So to speak . -RRB-

`` I usually see a patient once , and then never see him again , '' he said . `` Truckers are n't going to say to me , ` I 'll be back for a cleaning on September 23 at 2 in the afternoon . ' They ca n't plan where they 're going to be . I make patient files for the people who come in , but I know that I 'll probably never have a reason to open the files after they walk out the door . These are mostly one-time patients . ''

Dr. Roemer 's success , he said , is based on two factors : the steady flow of those 35,000 people who pull in to the truck stop every week , and the actuarial certainty that some of them will be truckers with a mouthful of hurt .
