LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spain remain top of the world rankings for the ninth straight month , according to newly released standings by FIFA , the world game 's governing body .

European champions Spain are ranked No. 1 by FIFA in their world rankings .

They top their 2010 World Cup qualifying group , with four wins from four games , and have only conceded one goal in their last 10 internationals .

Their rankings are based on team performances over the last four years , with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team .

Yet fans all over the world have long questioned how much can be read into the rankings .

Do you think FIFA 's rankings count for much ? Let us know in the Sound Off box below .

For example , France , who reached the World Cup final in 2006 are down in 12th , while England , who failed to even qualify for Euro 2008 , are ninth .

From 2001-06 , Mexico were anchored in the top 10 , at one point as high as fourth , which left many European fans wondering how that was possible . They were ahead of many a supposed European powerhouse , such as Portugal .

Not only did the Iberian country reach the final of Euro 2004 , they also made the semi-finals of the World Cup in Germany two years later .

Mexico were even in the same group as Portugal at the World Cup and finished five points behind them in second place . In the round of 16 Mexico fell to skilful but flawed Argentina side .

At the tournament , the Americans went home early after picking up one point and two goals in their three group games , which made a mockery of such a high placing .

As of March 2009 , Brazil and Argentina are the only non-European teams in the top 10 , Cameroon -LRB- 16 -RRB- are the highest African nation , the United States are 17th , while Australia are the top Asian nation at 32 .

But regardless of your opinions of the rankings , they are here to stay . And Spain deserve respect for becoming only the sixth team after Germany , Brazil , Italy , France and Argentina to top them .
