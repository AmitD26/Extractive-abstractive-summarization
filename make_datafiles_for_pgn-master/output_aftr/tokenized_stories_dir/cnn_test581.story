Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When a U.S. Air Force fighter jet crashed Monday during a mission over Libya , it quickly set off a chain of events on four continents involving at least nine aircraft and a platoon of Marines .

By 12:50 a.m. Tuesday , two Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers took off from the USS Kearsarge , an amphibious assault ship about 100 miles away in the Mediterranean Sea , to assist in the rescue .

As the unit prepared to launch from the ship , at about 1:20 a.m. , two Marine Harrier jets arrived over the crash site and established communications through the crew of an F-16 fighter jet that also is in contact with the downed crew .

At about the same time , a KC-130 tanker took off from an air base at Sigonella , Sicily , in case the Harriers or other aircraft needed to refuel in midair during the rescue mission .

An hour after the crash -LRB- 6:30 p.m. ET Monday -RRB- , Adm. Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington informs the National Security Adviser Tom Donilon . Fifteen minutes later , President Barack Obama , who was in Chile , was told .

At 1:33 a.m. Tuesday -LRB- Libya time -RRB- , 13 minutes after the Harriers arrived over the crash scene -- the F15E pilot saw a crowd moving toward him . The Harriers dropped two 500-pound laser-guided bombs between the pilot and the crowd . At least five Libyans in the crowd were injured by shrapnel .

Back on the USS Kearsarge , two MV-22 Ospreys took off . The tilt-rotor planes take off and land like helicopters but fly as fast as airplanes .

At about 1:51 a.m. , two CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters launch carrying a quick-reaction force , a platoon of Marines ready to hit the ground and help rescue the pilot if needed .

It took the Ospreys nearly 45 minutes to fly to the crash site . At 2:38 a.m. , one of the Ospreys landed and the pilot was rescued . The Osprey landed back on the USS Kearsarge at 3 a.m. and the pilot walked off the aircraft . The platoon of Marines was n't needed .

As of 7 p.m. ET Tuesday , the Department of Defense had not released the name of either airman or the exact cause of the crash .

All told , at least nine U.S. aircraft , not counting whatever plane flew the WSO to Europe , were involved in the rescue .

Meanwhile , U.S. and coalition airstrikes continue in Libya . So far , 336 air missions have been flown , including 108 strikes against Libyan military targets , since Friday .
