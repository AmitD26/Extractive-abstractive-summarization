Like when a great date is followed by the deafening silence of the phone . Or when the big relationship talk results in a boyfriend-shaped hole in my wall .

Those are the times I want nothing more than a dictionary that translates every deer-in-headlights look , ambiguous voicemail , and cryptic text message .

That 's where Jeff Mac 's `` Manslations : Decoding the Secret Language of Men '' comes in .

Mac 's Golden Rule ? Whenever there is any conflict between what a man says and what he does , always , always ignore what he says .

`` This is not how it went , '' says Mac . `` If you called him and he blew you off , it went like this :

1 . You had a great date , and he did not .

2 . He planned to blow you off .

3 . You called him , and nothing changed . ''

The bad

All men are obsessed with cars , the remote , sports , and video games . Yawn .

According to Mac , men are like dogs because , among other things , they have short attention spans and pay a lot of attention to their own crotches and the crotches of others . I 'm willing to bet short attention span is n't an inherently male trait , and I can personally testify that neither is an interest in crotches .

But when your girlfriends refuse to help you decode , for the eighth time , what he meant when he said , `` I 'll call you later , '' Jeff Mac 's sometimes trite , always funny advice comes in handy .
