Since the election , President-elect Barack Obama has posted weekly video addresses on YouTube .

Judging by Obama 's savvy use of social-networking sites during his campaign and the interactive nature of his transition team 's Web site , Americans can expect a president who bypasses the traditional media 's filters while reaching out to citizens for input , observers say .

`` The rebooting of our democracy has begun , '' said Andrew Rasiej , founder of Personal Democracy Forum and the techPresident blog . '' -LSB- Obama -RSB- has the potential to transform the relationship between the American public and their democracy . ''

Obama has more than 1 million MySpace `` friends '' and more than 3.7 million `` supporters '' on his official Facebook page -- some 700,000 more than when he was elected in November . His campaign also has a database of almost 13 million supporters and their e-mail addresses .

Facebook , MySpace , YouTube and Twitter did n't exist when George W. Bush took office eight years ago . But since last November 's election , Obama has wasted no time embracing these online communication portals . In recent weeks he has taped weekly video addresses and posted them to YouTube , where most have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times .

Obama 's staffers also have stopped posting information to social-networking sites since the election , preferring to reach out to constituents through YouTube and Change.gov , the official site of the president-elect 's transition team . Visitors to Change.gov can read a frequently updated blog , post their ideas on issues facing the country , and rate others ' ideas . Top-rated ideas will be gathered into a briefing book and given to Obama after he takes office .

A statement on the president-elect 's transition site says that Obama hopes to `` use cutting-edge technologies to create a new level of transparency , accountability , and participation for America 's citizens . ''

It 's fitting , then , that Obama 's inauguration next week could be one of the most watched video events in Internet history . Rasiej expects that hordes of users will be watching online when Obama takes the oath of office , visiting WhiteHouse.gov and refreshing their browsers to capture the moment the site switches to proclaim Obama , not George W. Bush , as president .

'' -LSB- Obama -RSB- is using the tools that are available to him today , '' All told CNN . `` The next president will be using some of the same tools , and also some tools that have n't been invented yet . ''
