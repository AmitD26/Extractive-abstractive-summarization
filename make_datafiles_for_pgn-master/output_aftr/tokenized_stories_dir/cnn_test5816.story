-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lectures , slide shows and notes are often boring , but people are using technology to find entertainment in these unlikely places .

Spoof notes of `` Star Wars '' are scribbled into a fun online `` pencast . ''

Some quirky SmartPen presentations come off as comedy sketches . One popular presentation muses about how George Lucas might have come up with the idea for Star Wars .

Some university students love the technology because they can record and play back what their professor was saying at an exact point in their notes -- which is especially useful when you ca n't read your own writing . And many professors are all for it , too .

That potential -- for entertainment and serious uses alike -- can be gleaned from pencasts posted on the Livescribe Web site 's community section , which is about a year old . The pencasts posted there have collectively received more than 1.5 million views .

Soon , it will be easier to embed pencasts on other sites , like personal blogs , the company says .

Slide shows are further along in popularity .

A startup called SlideShare launched in late 2006 with the idea of allowing people to easily share their PowerPoint presentations . Its site had more than 15 million visitors last month , and its 2008 contest for the best presentations showed off the form 's potential .

The best are far removed from the dull bullet-point presentations you might have fallen asleep to . Many use dramatic images , striking design and memorable phrases .

Others are more light-hearted . The No. 2 spot -LRB- with more than 60,000 views -RRB- went to a presentation called `` Foot Notes . '' It shows pictures of the narrator 's feet in various places she 's been -LRB- like on cobblestone corridors in Prague and a dance floor in Chicago -RRB- , interspersed with inspiring quotes related to feet and walking .

Finally , for many people , the most dreaded , boring form of communication of all is the lecture . But then , how to explain the popularity of the TED videos ?

In one , the amputee athlete and model Aimee Mullins talks about how her many pairs of artificial legs often beat having a single pair of regular ones -- some make her taller , others are works of art . In another , Jill Tarter , an astronomer and director of the Center for SETI Research , discusses how insanely large the universe is and what a `` waste of space '' it would be if life on Earth were indeed all there is .

It 's hard to watch a handful of TED videos and not feel your perspective broadening . That helps explain how , despite the lecture format , TEDTalks has become hugely popular . A few months ago , the videos surpassed the 100 million views mark -- not bad for a bunch of lectures .
