BEIJING , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Chinese women 's gymnastics team did not use underage competitors during this year 's Summer Olympic Games in Beijing , the International Gymnastics Federation said Wednesday .

Widespread reports claimed that gold medal winner He Kexin was only 14 years old .

The federation said it has concluded its inquiry into the matter after it confirmed the gymnasts ' ages through official documents that the Chinese Gymnasts Association provided . The documents included passports , identity cards and household registers .

Athletes must be at least 16 in the year the games take place . In women 's gymnastics , younger girls can have an advantage over older competitors on account of their often smaller , lighter and more agile bodies .

The Chinese women 's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition at the Beijing games , and five members won individual medals .

CNN was not been able to independently verify the information , but snapshots of the Web pages appeared to back up the claim . Other bloggers joined the search and reported similar results .

Chinese gymnastics coaches also defended their team .

`` Asians have different figures than people from the West , so that 's what caused their suspicion , '' said Huang Yubin , head coach of the men 's and women 's teams , referring to media inquiries . `` They should n't be suspicious . ''
