-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been nine years since Kim and Curtis Christiansen were married . Since then they 've had their ups and downs , but they 've remained close . But when Curtis began snoring about three years ago , Kim began sleeping on the couch .

`` His snoring was so loud . At first I would just elbow him to wake him up , '' she said , `` But then I became concerned . He would just -LRB- she gasps for breath -RRB- . It would take his breath away . ''

Kim Christiansen finally persuaded her husband to go to a sleep specialist . The diagnosis : obstructive sleep apnea .

According to the National Sleep Foundation , more than 18 million American adults have sleep apnea , and many of them do n't know it . Some people think their snoring is just a side effect of a busy lifestyle . Watch more on the difference between sleep apnea and snoring ''

In some cases , that 's true . But the foundation says it 's trying to get more people to realize how important it is to know the difference between occasional snoring and apnea .

A disorder in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep , apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open , despite efforts to breathe . That can cause broken sleep patterns and low blood oxygen levels . Doctors say these side effects can lead to hypertension , heart disease , and mood and memory problems .

And because sufferers are usually sleepy during the day , apnea can increase the risk of automobile crashes . There 's no question it can be life-threatening , doctors say .

`` A bed partner may notice that the patient stops breathing and snores loudly , '' LoRusso said . `` And the daytime symptoms are sleepiness , poor concentration , problems waking up in the morning . ''

Specific lifestyle changes can help you avoid sleep apnea , the sleep foundation said .

And watch your weight . Losing pounds can `` cure '' sleep apnea , especially for overweight people , LoRusso said . If you smoke , try to quit , he said . Smoking creates swelling in the upper airway , making apnea worse .

These seemingly small changes can have dramatic results .

`` In some cases , changing these factors can eliminate sleep apnea from some patients , '' LoRusso said .

Since his diagnosis , Christiansen has gotten his blood pressure under control .

When he started wearing the CPAP , he confesses , he 'd leave it behind when he went out of town .

`` But I found I was n't getting a good night 's sleep , so now I take the CPAP along , '' he said with a smile , `` and I have a restful vacation with my wife . ''
