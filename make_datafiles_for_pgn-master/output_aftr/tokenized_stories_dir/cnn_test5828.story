WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The case of Janet Jackson 's `` wardrobe malfunction '' on national television -- and subsequent fines against CBS -- will be re-examined at the order of the Supreme Court .

The justices Monday sent the case back to a federal appeals court in Philadelphia that had thrown out a $ 550,000 government fine against the broadcast network and its affiliates for airing the incident during halftime of the 2004 Super Bowl . The pop singer 's breast was briefly exposed during a performance with singer Justin Timberlake .

After viewer complaints and national media attention , the Federal Communications Commission said the Jackson incident was obscene . In addition to CBS Inc. , 20 of its affiliates also were fined .

But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the communications commission had acted `` arbitrarily and capriciously . ''

The Supreme Court 's action marks the second time in recent days that it has dealt with cases involving broadcast standards . Last week , the justices narrowly upheld the authority of the Federal Communications Commission to punish networks for airing profanity .

Critics call that laughable .

The Jackson incident was not on a five-second delay .

CBS issued a statement Monday afternoon it is confident that the appeals court `` will again recognize that the Super Bowl incident , while inappropriate and regrettable , was not and could not have been anticipated by CBS . ''

The issue is an important one `` for the entire broadcasting industry , '' it said , `` because it recognizes that there are rare instances , particularly during live programming , when despite best efforts it may not be possible to block unfortunate fleeting material . ''

But the justices in that case refused to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech . It ruled only on their enforcement power . The justices ordered the free-speech aspect to be reviewed again by a federal appeals court .
