Talking about race and class makes people uncomfortable .

If that were not the case , we 'd have more open conversations about these issues with our friends , families and co-workers , and would no doubt be a more understanding and loving society across the board .

Riley , who is African-American , told me her main priority when she talks to her 5-year-old daughter Ayva about race and class is teaching her that it 's OK to be different .

`` I do n't want her to think that we 're all the same , or to grow up not seeing color , '' said Riley . `` That 's not realistic , and what happens to children that grow up like that is they are n't able to empathize or understand when things like Ferguson happen because ` they do n't get what the problem is . ' ''

Riley , who blogs about parenting at Mama Knows It All , encourages parents not to be afraid to talk about race with their kids . One of the easiest ways to discuss it , she said , is to read books with children that showcase diversity .

`` Expose them to cultures outside of their own through classes , or travel , and be intentional about it , '' she said . `` As much as we 'd like to believe it , racial tolerance -LRB- and -RRB- acceptance does n't just happen . It takes work . It takes being open to understanding and learning about each other 's history , and making the commitment to teach our children as well . ''

Opinion : Are we Ferguson ?

For some white parents , there is a discomfort about talking about race especially since it 's not something they live every day . There is also the painful realization of some of the social and economic benefits for whites of systemic racism , said blogger Elizabeth Broadbent , creator of the site Manic Pixie Dream Mama .

In a blog post that has been widely shared in social media , the mom of three sons challenged white parents to recognize and talk with their children about `` white privilege . ''

`` It carries another burden instead . White privilege means that if you do n't school your sons about it , if you do n't insist on its reality and call out oppression , your sons may become something terrifying . Your sons may become the shooters . ''

`` What I think is often very frustrating to poor and low income people who tend to be disproportionally people of color is the sense that people in positions of power do n't recognize that and are still sort of in denial about that , '' said Pimpare , who is also an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University and New York University .

Parents who live that reality day-in and day-out ca n't help but share their experiences with their children .

Shelly Watson of Berkeley , California , an African-American woman with a biracial father , said her parents talked with her about race when she was very young and she has had similar conversations with her daughter , now 21 .

`` I 've always taught my daughter that racism is still there and a lot of times it 's very subtle , '' said Watson , who works at a major health care company as a computer coder specializing in electronic medical records .

She said she 's always told her daughter that as an African-American woman , she is `` going to be looked at differently . ''

`` So when people say race does n't matter , that is not true , '' she said . `` Racism will never die in this country until people change the way they perceive others and otherness in general . ''

`` If I had on , let 's say , clothes just like you , let 's say I even worked at CNN , it would n't make a difference . People still treat me the same way because I 'm African-American , '' said Acorn , a senior at Howard University .

Opinion : Ferguson : The signal it sends about America

`` People still scoot away from me on the subway . I 've had open seats and no one sits next to me , and it makes me wonder why . ... For some reason , there 's still almost a fear or a distaste for me just because of my race . ''

One way to bridge the distance , Pimpare said , is to embrace the scary and uncomfortable -- and have conversations about race with our children .

`` We 're terrible about talking about race in particular and the way that we get better at talking about race is talking about race , and we have to find ways to do it , '' he said .
