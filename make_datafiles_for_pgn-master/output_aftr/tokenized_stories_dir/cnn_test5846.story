KILLEEN , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spc. Logan Burnette arrived at Fort Hood , Texas , a week ago Wednesday to prepare for an upcoming tour of Iraq . The following day , he , like all deploying soldiers , reported to the `` ready room '' on post to fill out final paperwork .

But on November 5 at Fort Hood , he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere .

`` Seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend 's head , seeing friends grabbing their arms , and blood just everywhere . It 's a pretty hard thing to see , '' Burnette recalled .

The gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his Army combat uniform , his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest . No one had reason to pay him heed , Burnette said .

He reloaded . And fired . Reloaded . And fired again .

`` He was very swift , very tactical , '' said Burnette , sitting in a wheelchair at the Metroplex Adventist Hospital near Fort Hood , his left arm and hand bandaged .

They were victims of a soldier who turned on his own , authorities say .

Burnette saw the laser sights on the gunman 's weapon . The shooter looked serious , intent . He screamed at the top of his lungs , `` Allahu akbar , '' which means ` God is great ' in Arabic .

Burnette dropped to the floor , hugging the ground for dear life . His mind was spinning . What insanity was this ?

`` Once I saw the blood , I realized I had to move , '' he said . `` I had to get out of there . ''

Burnette began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction . He picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter . He knew it would draw the gunman 's attention and divert his line of sight from others .

Burnette said he was n't trying to play a hero .

`` There are guys overseas doing more than what I did , '' he said . `` I just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully I made a difference . ''

He was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter 's aim .

`` He wanted to kill all of us , '' Burnette said . `` We were all unarmed . ''

Burnette knew he had to get out of that building .

`` As I started to run , I fell again , not realizing I could n't use my left leg . ''

A staff sergeant grabbed him by his uniform collar and dragged him into an office and locked the door .

`` Everything is going to be all right , '' the sergeant told him , as he began administering first aid . Burnette said he does n't know the sergeant 's name , but he will recognize him instantly if their paths ever cross again .

`` Our Father who art in heaven ... hallowed be thy name . ''

Burnette , a practicing Catholic , lie on the ground , repeating the prayer over and over again . He did n't know whether he would see his wife again .

`` I ca n't really think about it , '' Burnette said . `` I have a lot of faith in our military , our judicial system -- and God . ''

`` Do n't get me wrong , '' he said , `` Everything in your heart wants to -LSB- unleash -RSB- anger at this person , but we have to trust that our system works somehow .

`` By no means am I happy that he is in better shape than a lot of my comrades , '' Burnette said about the suspect . `` But I 'm not here to play God , either . ''
