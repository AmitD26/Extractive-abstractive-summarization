Fort Hood , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The call came over the radio . `` Shots fired . '' And then , even worse : `` Officer down . ''

Billy Rhoads , chief of the Fort Hood Fire Department , grabbed a radio and donned his flak jacket . He jumped into his SUV and tore down the road . A dozen or so blocks away , at the Soldier Readiness Center , a gunman had opened fire on soldiers .

Rhoads stepped from his truck . His department 's motto is `` Protecting those who protect us . '' He hoped he was not too late for that .

The scene was chaotic . Wounded and dead soldiers were everywhere .

`` I was listening to people hollering for help , and I was trying to get in there to see what we had , '' Rhoads recalled three days after the November 5 attack . `` I assumed that we would have maybe several victims . I had no idea , I just could not fathom what we were going to encounter . ''

Amid all the army uniforms , one dark blue uniform stuck out .

It was Fort Hood police Sgt. Kimberly Munley , who , officials say , shot the alleged gunman , Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan , to end the rampage . She suffered three gunshot wounds .

Rhoads and Munley had worked closely in the past . He considers her a friend .

Army medics had fashioned a makeshift tourniquet on her leg . He bent down to comfort her . She was extremely weak and unable to speak loudly .

Even as the first responders worked on the dozens of wounded soldiers , they were n't certain whether there were other shooters on the post .

As for Hasan , the fire chief says that discussing the shooting suspect is too emotional . `` I saw the suspect from a distance , but I never got a look at him . ''

Rhoads ' prayers remain with the soldiers he tries to keep safe . `` It 's very emotional for everybody when we lose our soldiers . But when we lose them here at home like this , it takes it to a different level . ''

But the main thing his firefighters have relied on , he says , is each other .

`` Afterward , everyone started to console each other and talk to each other . It 's a brotherhood . ''
