WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A soldier who reported for duty with her children in tow has been granted her request for a discharge , her lawyer said Monday .

Lisa Pagan , of Davidson , North Carolina , reported for duty Monday morning at Fort Benning , Georgia , with her two preschool children . She had been honorably discharged from active duty at the rank of specialist nearly four years ago but was recalled as part of the Individual Ready Reserve program .

Late Monday afternoon , Pagan 's lawyer told CNN the Army would grant her request and begin the process of discharge again , this time for good .

`` We are definitely heading in the right direction for Lisa and her family and her children , '' said Mark Waple , Pagan 's attorney . `` She has been told by her chain of command they plan on doing everything they can within reason to do this as expeditiously as possible . ''

She said her family could n't afford having her husband give up his job . They would lose their house , she told the Charlotte , North Carolina-TV station .

`` I 'm a human being . I need to take care of my children . They do n't have anybody else , '' Pagan told WCNC .

Since September 11 , 2001 , the Army has recalled about 25,000 soldiers . Nearly half requested a delay or a full exemption . Some just wanted to finish their school semester before reporting . Others had financial or medical problems that made it difficult to report for duty .
