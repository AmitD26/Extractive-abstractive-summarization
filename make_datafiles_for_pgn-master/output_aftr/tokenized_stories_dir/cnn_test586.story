Here 's a look at the befuddling outcomes in ballot measure contests , contrasted with the other results on Election Night , and what they might portend for the future .

Minimum wage

Voters in three states -- Arkansas , Nebraska and South Dakota -- voted to approve increases in their state minimum wage rates . In Nebraska , for instance , voters decided to raise the state minimum wage from the current federal minimum of just $ 7.25 an hour to $ 8.00 in 2015 and $ 9.00 in 2016 .

This happened even as the same voters chose to send Republicans to Washington and their state capitols -- the same Republicans who have been blocking minimum wage legislation . Confused ? Perhaps the voters were , too .

Marijuana legalization

Meanwhile , voters in at least three Michigan cities backed measures to remove fines for small amounts of marijuana possession -LRB- as have other Michigan cities in past elections -RRB- . And while voters in Lewiston , Maine , voted against pot legalization , the city of South Portland just down the road voted to endorse legalization .

The main buzz kill was in Florida , where a constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana failed to garner the 60 % of votes needed to pass . The measure got just 58 % support .

Thankfully , yet again , Colorado 's `` personhood '' amendment failed by an almost 2-to-1 margin . Oddly , Colorado voters elected Republican Cory Gardner , who co-sponsored and defended similar `` personhood '' legislation -- though Gardner tried to run away from his anti-abortion stance late in the race .

Also Tuesday night , a similar measure to restrict the rights of pregnant women was struck down by a roughly 2-to-1 margin in North Dakota -- a state that Mitt Romney won in 2012 by a similar margin .

Gun safety

A little over a week before the election , a student in Marysville , Washington , opened fire inside a high school , shooting five classmates . Three of the victims died , as did the shooter , who took his own life . This undoubtedly was fresh in the mind of Washington state voters as they considered two competing ballot measures in the election : one to require background checks on all gun sales , including those bought at gun shows and online , the other to prevent the state from passing any background checks measures unless or until the federal government does so first .

Voters passed the first measure and rejected the second . Polling before the vote found that support for expanding background checks increased following the shooting . Hopefully , other states wo n't wait for mass atrocities before enacting similar common-sense gun safety laws .

Voters in California backed a major change in the state 's criminal justice code . Minor drug and theft charges will now be considered misdemeanors instead of felonies and come with shorter prison sentences -- a maximum of one year in jail instead of three years under current law .

The change will affect 1 in 5 of those incarcerated in the state who are sentenced for minor drug possession or writing bad checks . Thousands will be able to petition to have their sentences immediately reduced . The ballot measure was supported by everyone from George Soros and his Open Society Institute to Jay Z to CNN 's own Newt Gingrich , all of whom think California has better things to spend its money on than warehousing citizens for petty offenses .

Voters in Massachusetts voted not to repeal a 2011 law that allowed gambling in the state , in effect revoking the license of three already-operating casinos there . California voters looked likely to reject an off-reservation casino by one Indian tribe .

And Colorado voters rejected a measure to allow expanded betting at horse tracks -- which is probably a good thing being that it 's Colorado , the first state to legalize marijuana . Though it is presumably still legal for Coloradans to informally bet on whether the horses are high .
