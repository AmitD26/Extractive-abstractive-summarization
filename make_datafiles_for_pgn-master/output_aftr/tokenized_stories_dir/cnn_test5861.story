Vonn , who is a medal favorite in several disciplines for February 's Winter Games in Vancouver , damaged her left arm after sliding out on the first run , losing her balance on a bump after a sharp left turn before thumping into a gate .

But scans at a local hospital showed only severe bruising and the 25-year-old may even compete in Tuesday 's slalom at the same venue , U.S. team medical director Richard Quincy told reporters .

Vonn 's arm has been placed in a splint to speed recovery and she was said to have been in considerable pain .

`` Hurting my arm is way better than hurting one of my legs , '' Vonn was quoted on her personal Web site www.lindseyvonn.com .

Vonn retains her lead in the overall standings with 581 points ahead of second-placed Maria Reisch , who appeared distracted by her friend 's crash and also skied out first time down .

The German is 50 points adrift as Vonn looks to defend her overall crown .

Celebrating a medal success , she sliced her thumb open on a champagne bottle and competed for the rest of the season with heavy strapping .

Vonn 's appearance in Vancouver is being heavily plugged by sponsors and television rights holders , but she is still seeking her first Olympic medal after missing out in Salt Lake City and Turin .

Hoelzl takes the lead in the giant slalom discipline standings , leapfrogging Kathrin Zettel of Austria , who finished fifth .
