The 41-year-old Swedish man was poised to fly on Tuesday night from Amsterdam , in the Netherlands , to Ankara , Turkey , when investigators `` caught the pilot red-handed during his flight preparation , '' according to a statement from the Dutch National Police Services Agency .

The Swedes got a tip recently that the man was flying for a Turkish company and that he would soon be in the Netherlands , Lundblad said . They passed that information to Dutch police , which led to the pilot 's arrest at the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam .
