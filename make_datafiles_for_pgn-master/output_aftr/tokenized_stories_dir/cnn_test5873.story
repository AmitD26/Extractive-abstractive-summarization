The plight of Sam the Koala became a huge hit on video-sharing Web site YouTube .

Sam , the 4-year-old Koala who became famous after he was injured and rescued from the historic wildfires , died Thursday , an Australian wildlife shelter said .

Sam was catapulted into fame in February when a photograph surfaced showing a firefighter , marked with soot , holding her injured paw and pouring water into her mouth .

As firefighters continued to battle the brush fires that killed more than 200 people and torched 2,000 homes , Sam was taken to Southern Ash Wildlife Shelter to heal from burns on her paws .

Her paws healed but soon she developed ovarian cysts associated with chlamydia , an ailment that affects 50 percent of Australia 's koala population , the shelter said .

`` Sam had severe changes in her urinary and reproductive tract that was non-operable and unfortunately had to put Sam to sleep , '' the statement said .
