Piccard , who won the first transatlantic balloon race and commanded the first balloon flight around the world , told CNN , `` Each time we asked the aeronautical industry to build that airplane , they told us it 's impossible . We can not make an airplane so light and so big . So who did we ask for some help ? A boat manufacturer . They had no idea it was impossible , so they built the pieces in carbon fiber and now we have an airplane . ''

`` A lot of industries say we have a society based on oil dependency , so let 's continue . ... We know how to deal with oil . The result is General Motors and Chrysler going bankrupt . It 's a typical example of people who did not make the turnaround early enough . If GM made engines with much lower fuel consumption , they would not have gone bankrupt . ''

`` We have to get rid of certainties , habits , paradigms , common assumptions , '' Piccard says . `` These are the limits to creativity . ''

Piccard , who is 51 , spoke about his new venture at the TED Global conference in July 2009 and elaborated on it in a recent interview with CNN.com .

Bertrand Piccard : My life and the life of my family has to do with exploration , with adventure . My grandfather was the first man in the stratosphere , and my father was the first to touch the deepest point in the ocean . ... For me adventure and exploration is something in the blood . So that 's why I flew around the world in a balloon in 1999 . ... It was considered to be impossible , I said , `` Let 's try it . ''

I succeeded after two failures , and I came to the middle of my life , thinking now that adventure has to go on , and a pioneering sprit has to go on , but how can the adventure be useful -- not a personal dream like flying around the world in a balloon -- but really useful ?

I came up with idea of a solar airplane flying around the world with no fuel -- that would be a beautiful message in terms of technology , the energy of the future and the environment .

CNN : How fast will the plane travel ?

Piccard : The plane will travel very slowly . Otherwise it would take too much energy . The average speed will be 40 knots , roughly 55 miles per hour .

CNN : And so a flight around the world will take how long ?

We need an airplane that is very big , that is very light , and full of batteries , lithium polymer batteries , and it can take only one person . We have to see afterward if the technology can improve -- and transport people .

CNN : What is the biggest technical challenge in building this airplane ?

Piccard : There are several challenges . One challenge is to have this airplane light enough despite its huge wingspan . The construction has to be done with carbon fiber with completely new technologies . The structure of Solar Impulse ... is 10 times lighter than the normal glider . It 's a breakthrough in construction technologies .

Piccard : I will be one of the pilots , and Andre Borschberg will also be a pilot .

CNN : What 's the greatest risk on the flight ?

CNN : So you will not be flying above the cloud cover ?

Piccard : We will be flying above the cloud cover , but during the night we have to fly lower because the efficiency of the batteries on the market is not yet sufficient for us to stay at high altitudes .

CNN : Why ca n't you go up through clouds ?

Piccard : Because we will have almost empty batteries every morning ... so if we have clouds in morning , we can not load the batteries to go back up . ... This will be the big weather challenge for the team .

CNN : Where will you land the plane ?

Piccard : We need an airport with a large runway . We do n't need a long runway . We 'll have one stop in the U.S. ... We have not yet decided where it will be .

We 'll have five legs , and each leg will be five days and five nights on average . So we 'll stop in China , Hawaii , the U.S. mainland , Europe and one stop probably in the Arab Emirates and then back in China .

CNN : What 's your projected date for takeoff ?

Piccard : The schedule is like this : In 2010 , we fly day and night . In 2011 , we 'll make international flights , several days and nights . In 2012 , we 'll cross the Atlantic , and in 2012 or 2013 , we 'll go around the world .

CNN : How much does this project cost and who 's paying for it ?

Piccard : The entire budget is 100 million U.S. dollars , coming from private sponsors .

CNN : Do you have children ?

Piccard : Yes I have three kids .

Piccard : Well , they fly with me with hang gliders , with balloons , paragliders , micro-lights . They like it very much . But I 'd say they 're a little too young to show really what they 're going to do , they 're 15 , 17 and 19 . ...

Piccard : No , I hope they will take on the challenge of improving the quality of life , bringing a pioneering spirit and new ways to think about political issues , environmental issues , technological issues , charity issues .

In the 20th century , the heroes were the ones who went to the North Pole , the South Pole , Everest , the bottom of the ocean , space and the moon .
