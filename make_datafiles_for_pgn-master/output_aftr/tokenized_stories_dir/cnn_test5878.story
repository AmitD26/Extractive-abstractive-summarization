-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. senator is calling for a federal probe into the system of background checks for employees at nuclear plants after learning that a suspected al Qaeda member from New Jersey worked at five such sites .

`` We simply can not tolerate at any time having someone with terrorist ties working at a nuclear plant , period , '' Sen. Chuck Schumer , a New York Democrat , said in a written statement Saturday .

Mobley 's father said Saturday , `` My son is no terrorist . '' He would not comment further .

Mobley worked at nuclear plants operated by PSEG Nuclear for different contractors from 2002 to 2008 , doing routine labor such as carrying supplies and assisting with maintenance activities , company spokesman Joe Delmar said Thursday .

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it was working with the FBI to determine whether Mobley had access to any sensitive areas of the nuclear plants where he once worked , spokeswoman Holly Harrington said .

`` It 's important to note that for him to even be in the plants , he 'd have to undergo a background and criminal history check , '' she said . She said Mobley worked at five plants between 2002 and 2008 in `` labor -LSB- and -RSB- maintenance kind of positions . ''

He said the current background checks include an examination of criminal and employment histories , a psychological assessment and behavioral observation .

However , `` the NRC delegates the authority to complete background checks , which results in a certain degree of disparity in how checks are carried out , and what information is ultimately covered , '' Schumer 's statement said .

He said the checks are not required to cover such information as past travel and ties with other countries .
