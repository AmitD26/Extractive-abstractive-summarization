Authorities seized a gun from the scene where the body was found . Cumbria Police Deputy Constable Stuart Hyde said investigators believe Bird committed suicide .

`` I 've never known anything like this , where somebody would want to walk out and kill so many people in such a beautiful place in such a short space of time , '' Hyde said .

Police were working 30 separate crime scenes and are still attempting to determine the motive , Hyde said . Investigators are looking at Bird 's history and his access to firearms , he said .

Police named Bird as a suspect following reports of the first shooting mid-morning on Wednesday in the Irish Sea port town of Whitehaven .

`` Our focus is now on the movements of Mr. Bird this morning , '' authorities said . `` Our thoughts are with the families in these tragic times . We are asking for any witnesses to come forward and help us with our investigation into the events of this morning . ''

`` When lives and communities are suddenly shattered in this way , our thoughts should be with all those caught up in these tragic events , especially the families and friends of those killed or injured , '' he said .

Police issued a photo of the Bird and urged members of the public to stay indoors until further notice .

More shots were fired in the small towns of Seascale and Egremont , with officers attempting to track the suspect on land and by air while ambulance crews attended the victims . Footage from one of the shooting scenes showed a covered body lying on a street .

Soon afterwards police said they had found a body in a wooded area .

He said his friend enjoyed scuba diving , went on several diving trips abroad and practised regularly at the Whitehaven swimming baths .

The vehicle police said Bird was driving at the time of the shootings was his regular taxi cab , Leder said .

A police hotline was set up for concerned relatives of those involved .

John Bevir , a reporter for CNN affiliate ITV , described nearby Whitehaven as a sleepy seaside town . `` Things like this just do n't happen here , '' he said . `` Well , they did n't , until this morning . ''
