London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Stepping on the London subway train five years ago , the thirtysomething marketing manager never imagined her morning commute might eventually lead to the Paralympic Games . Now , that 's exactly where Britain 's Martine Wright is setting her sights .

Wright lost both legs when a suicide bomber blew himself up on a subway train near London 's Aldgate station on the morning of July 7 , 2005 . She also suffered a fractured skull and severe arm injuries .

`` I would love , absolutely love , to be part of the Paralympics in 2012 , '' Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month . `` I mean , if you had said that to me five years ago , I would have thought that you were absolutely mad . But to go back to London , where I was born , and to do something so positive -- after I left on such a negative -- would be absolutely amazing . ''

Wright said she made a promise to herself and her family after the attacks to `` grab every single opportunity '' that she could .

She competed for -- and won -- a place on Britain 's sitting volleyball squad . The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month , and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma .

John Bestebroer , the head coach of the women 's team , calls the championships `` a great training opportunity for 2012 . ''

Wright told London 's Evening Standard that the 2012 Games will have an added poignancy because her last real memory before the bombings was celebrating with colleagues when London was chosen to host the Olympics .

She was the last person pulled from the station that day , and Wright said she feels she 's one of the lucky ones .

`` Even on your darkest days , there will always be someone that 's worse than you are , unfortunately , '' Wright told ITN . `` There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me , 'cause I 'm still here . ''
