Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Global financial reform topped the agenda Tuesday as President Obama huddled with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou , whose country is at the center of Europe 's debt crisis .

It also has a public-sector debt equivalent to 113 percent of its entire economy .

Athens recently unveiled a package of budget reductions to try to bring its deficit down to the 3 percent level allowed under the rules for the eurozone -- the European Union countries that have adopted the euro currency .

Finance ministers from those 16 countries met in Brussels last month to try to find a way to end the crisis that some analysts say could spread to other heavily indebted European nations , such as Portugal , Spain and Italy .

Greece 's `` deficit is more a credibility deficit than a financial deficit , and we need to bring back the sense of credibility , '' Papandreou said recently .

His unpopular budget cutbacks have met with stiff political resistance and strikes at home .

Two weeks ago , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the Federal Reserve is looking into actions taken by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms that may have contributed to Greece 's debt problems .

Goldman Sachs and other banks have been in the news over reports they secretly helped raise $ 1 billion in credit for Greece in a way that was off the balance sheet , and that they helped hide the country 's debt woes from European Union regulators .

The New York Times reported recently that some of these same banks also were making side bets that Greece would default on loans it owes American banks and hedge funds . By betting in favor of default , the U.S. banks and hedge funds would win whether Greece pays off its loans or not .

Dodd asked whether Bernanke thought there should be limits on the use of these types of bets to prevent firms from creating intentional runs against governments .

`` The rising price of these contracts contribute to an atmosphere of crisis , making it even more difficult for the Greek government , in my opinion , to borrow , '' Dodd said .

Congress is considering legislation to make such financial bets more transparent .
