NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With strong sales and equally powerful praise , the July issue of Italian Vogue can be judged a resounding success .

Chanel Iman is one of several models of color featured in the `` Black Issue '' of Italian Vogue .

Within 72 hours , the magazine sold out in the United States and Great Britain . Blog posts and e-mails about the beauty and historical significance of the issue began to flow -- and industry insiders were equally pleased .

Praising renowned photographer Steven Meisel , who shot most of the issue 's fashion pictures , The New York Times fashion critic Cathy Horyn gushed , `` I think they are some of the best he 's done . ... They are crazily , softly beautiful , plainly the work of someone who knows women and fashion . '' See what all the fuss is about ''

`` All the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that it 's OK to use more black girls , '' said Carlos Ojeda , an agent at New York Models . `` It 's OK to have more than just one , and she does n't have to always be Naomi . ''

Bethann Hardison , a legendary model agent-manager , said she has noticed a shift in the industry since she began holding town hall meetings last September to address the lack of diversity in fashion . The packed-to-the-rafters events quickly became the talk of the industry , and Hardison is widely credited with sparking the current movement .

Not all are nearly as optimistic , and fear the diversity issue will become as passe as the skinny-model debate of a few years ago .

`` Let 's see if Italian Vogue is going to be able to live up to the standards that they 've now set , '' added one prominent New York-based stylist . `` You ca n't have an issue with all black girls , pat yourself on the back and say ` that 's it for the year . ' ''

Hardison is working hard to make sure that does n't happen . She 's already scheduled another town hall meeting for September , and she 's also planning a mixer to introduce fledgling models of color to industry players .
