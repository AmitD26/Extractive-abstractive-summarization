-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is one thing people seem to like about flying : Southwest .

The airline also got nods for best luggage policy , best check-in experience , best consumer on-time estimates , and most eco-friendly -- the most top finishes of any airline .

`` Bottom line , we have fun . Southwest takes our business very seriously , but is known for having employees who care about our customers which , in this industry , separates us from our competitors . ''

The survey , conducted on Zagat.com , includes 8,000 opinions from frequent fliers and travel professionals , flying an average of 17 times per year . It covers 16 domestic airlines and 74 international airlines , as well as 30 airports within the United States .

Singapore Airlines was the top-rated international airline for both premium seating and economy seating , receiving a survey-high score of 28 out of 30 for its premium seats .

In order to move up in the rankings next year , Zagat said they should `` knock it down and start over . ''

Travelers said that direct routes were the most important factor when choosing a flight , followed by ticket price and past experience with an airline . Forty-five percent of people try to avoid flying airlines that charge for checked luggage .

`` My bags get better service , but they pay extra , '' one survey respondent joked .
