-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Florida judge set bail at $ 15,000 Wednesday for a man who wrote a controversial book considered a `` how-to '' guide for pedophiles .

Phillip Greaves , who was arrested in Colorado on Monday , said the book , `` The Pedophile 's Guide to Love and Pleasure : A Child-Lover 's Code of Conduct , '' can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles . And , instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest , it teaches them to avoid illegal actions , he said .

He said he has no children and `` I do n't keep children around my house . ''

`` He wrote this book , he published this book , he put it on Amazon to sell , '' Judd told reporters as Greaves was being booked into the Polk County Jail , `` and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it . ''

Greaves and his book gained national attention earlier this year after Amazon.com defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people . The book was removed from the website in early November .

Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children , grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents .

Judd said Greaves ' book outlines a `` code of ethics '' that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children .

`` Once I got into adolescence , I suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile , '' he said . But now , he said , he is an example of the fact that people can reform .

`` I think all speech should be protected , '' Greaves said . But `` I was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to Florida . I think Florida law is for Floridians and Colorado law is for Coloradoans . ''

He told reporters he will not be able to make bond : `` I 'm actually quite poor . ''

Judge John Kirkland said Wednesday in court that if Greaves does not post bail he must remain in Florida , can not have contact with anyone younger than 18 and can not have access to a computer .

CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on CNN 's `` AC360 '' Monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting Greaves , and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional .
