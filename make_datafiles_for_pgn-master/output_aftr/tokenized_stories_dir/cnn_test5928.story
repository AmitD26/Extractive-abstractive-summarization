Forty years later , with climate change looming and no strong international agreement in place despite the Copenhagen Climate conference , environmental activists are taking a proactive stance . They are arming themselves with the internet and social media to create another grass-roots movement for change , even larger than the first .

How countries like India and China solve their future energy needs has an impact on people everywhere -- many developing countries are now pulling ahead of the United States on renewable energy -- and how the United States addresses its key issues will have an equal impact .

Americans of all political stripes can agree on certain essential goals , such as how we must preserve the world 's natural wonders for generations to come and how we must live in harmony with this world of finite natural resources .

It took 150 years to transform our agrarian society to an industrial one . But today , we do n't have the luxury of time . Climate solutions are urgently needed .

The Earth Day Network and its partners are orchestrating large events in New York ; Rabat , Morocco ; Kolkata , India ; Buenos Aires , Argentina , and Tokyo , Japan . A massive climate rally is planned for Washington on April 25 .

Earth Day Network is backed by more than 20,000 organizations spanning 190 countries . All these organizations have a stake in climate change , development and growth , national security and energy policy -- geopolitical issues that must be addressed .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen Rogers .
