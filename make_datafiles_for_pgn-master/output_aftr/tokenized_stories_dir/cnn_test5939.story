Murray , who is charged in the death of pop star Michael Jackson , invoked his right to a speedy trial within 60 days of his arraignment , but the prosecution complained the defense has not met its duty to share information about potential witnesses .

`` I do not take notes when talking to a witness , '' defense lawyer Michael Flanigan told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor during a hearing Thursday .

Judge Pastor scolded Flanagan and his co-cousel Ed Chernoff for not providing more details to the prosecution about the testimony they expect from the 93 people listed as potential defense witnesses .

Judge Pastor appeared caught by surprise at Murray 's arraignment last month when defense lawyers invoked his right to hava a trial within 60 days .

Flanagan , outside of court Thursday , said the defense will be ready when jury selection is scheduled to start on March 24 .

Judge Pastor ordered Murray 's lawyers to create written summaries of what they 've been told by witnesses in interviews .

The lawyer , Nareg Gourjian , had worked on Michael Jackson 's child molestation defense .

Gourjian 's former law firm , headed by lawyer Mark Geragos , raised the possible conflict of interest because the firm represented Jackson for two years starting in 2003 , when he was charged with child molestation .

Gourjian told the judge last week that he was `` in no way involved '' in the Jackson case because he was `` a brand-new lawyer '' busy working on the a murder case at the time .

Jackson died on June 25 , 2009 from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol .
