Port-Au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anger swept Port-au-Prince on Wednesday as protests erupted throughout the Haitian capital the day after election results were announced .

Mobs charging election fraud burned the headquarters of the government-backed candidate and blocked roads using earthquake rubble and flaming tires .

At the smoldering headquarters of candidate Jude Celestin , one man shouted that life was better under the Duvaliers , referring to years of Haiti 's father-son dictatorship .

At least one person died in the post-election violence , authorities said .

`` People are very angry , '' said Franz Large , a Haitian doctor who lives near the burned headquarters . `` People expected there would be a fair election . ''

He also said many people feared they would lose out on cash-for-work programs if they did not vote for the government .

Early Wednesday , the normally bustling city felt an eerie quiet as residents hunkered down in their homes , fearful of potential danger on streets normally jammed with people and traffic .

Many shops and businesses remained shuttered throughout the day .

Some of the protesters wanted Martelly to speak publicly . Martelly had planned a news conference but canceled due to security concerns . Instead he issued a short statement Wednesday evening .

`` I understand your frustration , '' he said . `` You have the constitutional right to peacefully protest . I am with you and will be all the way to victory . Tet kale . ''

Polls had suggested Martelly , a political novice , had emerged as a front-runner , but the Provisional Electoral Council announced Tuesday night that he had come in third behind former first lady Mirlande Manigat and Jude Celestin , the head of the state-run transportation company who was handpicked by President Rene Preval as his successor .

No candidate won a majority , forcing a runoff set for January 16 , four days after the first anniversary of the quake . If the results hold , Martelly will not be in that runoff .

The Joint OAS -LRB- Organization of American States -RRB- - CARICOM -LRB- Caribbean Community -RRB- election observation mission said Wednesday the results were not the last word on the Haitian election . It said candidates have a legal recourse to pursue a challenge -- and they should use it .

The mission said in a statement that it called on the electoral council to `` ensure that these claims and challenges that are part of the contestation process are treated with the strictness , transparency and fairness they deserve in this difficult electoral environment where suspicions abound . ''

A final outcome in that process is expected on December 20 .

Martelly 's political advisor , Daniel Supplice , said that Martelly was huddling with his advisors to decide how he would proceed but the campaign has already said it will challenge the results .

Supplice said it was the government 's responsibility to ensure that the protests do not spiral into chaos .

The next president of Haiti will inherit the daunting task of leading this Caribbean nation in its struggle to recover from years of dictatorship and poverty compounded by the killer earthquake , Hurricane Tomas and now a cholera epidemic that has sickened almost 100,000 people .

Protests erupted immediately after the result were announced Tuesday night and spilled over into Wednesday .

In a radio speech Wednesday , Preval appealed for calm and urged the candidates to thoroughly review the electoral council 's data .

Celestin narrowly ranked second with 22.48 percent of the votes while Martelly received 21.84 percent .

But the vote was fraught with allegations of fraud . Martelly said aloud what many others in Haiti were thinking : Preval would go to any lengths to ensure a win for Celestin and preserve the power of his party , INITE .

`` Like others , the government of the United States is concerned by the Provisional Electoral Council 's announcement of preliminary results from the November 28 national elections that are inconsistent with the published results of the National Election Observation Council -LRB- CNO -RRB- , which had more than 5,500 observers and observed the vote count in 1,600 voting centers nationwide , '' the embassy said .

The CNO , a European Union-backed local election monitoring group , had said Celestin was running behind the other two candidates .

`` A peaceful solution to the current situation is crucial not only to confront the cholera epidemic in the short-term but also to create the conditions in the medium term for recovery and development from the earthquake , '' Ban said in a statement .

`` No peace mission . No MINUSTAH , '' protesters said , referring the United Nations Haiti mission by its French acronym .

Veteran Haitian journalist Ernest Moskolot said Haitian people were simply fed up . They endured an earthquake , a hurricane and cholera . It was time , he said , for the government to deliver .
