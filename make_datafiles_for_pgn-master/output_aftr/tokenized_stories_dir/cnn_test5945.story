`` At this juncture of the case , given the likely continued period of pre-trial confinement , we have determined that the new pre-trial facility at Fort Leavenworth is the most appropriate one for Private Manning going forward , '' Defense Department General Counsel Jeh Johnson told reporters .

A defense official initially told CNN Manning was moving to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth , but later corrected that information .

Johnson told reporters that the decision to move Manning is not meant as a criticism of the Quantico facility and congratulated the military personnel there for the job they did `` in difficult circumstances . ''

Manning 's case -- and the details of his detention -- drew attention last month in the aftermath of comments by former State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley and Crowley 's sudden resignation .

Amidst reports that Manning had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day , Crowley had criticized how Manning was held at Quantico , calling it `` ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid , '' according to news reports . He later stepped down from his post .

The Pentagon has maintained that Manning is held in accordance with rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico , for his protection and the safety of others , and that Manning is on `` POI '' status , for `` prevention of injury . ''

Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio , released a statement Tuesday after news of Manning 's pending transfer broke , promising to demand written assurances from Defense Department officials that Manning 's rights will be protected .

`` Any move of Pfc. Manning does not change the underlying fact , which has not been disputed by the Department of Defense , that he has been held under conditions which may in fact constitute ` cruel and unusual punishment ' in violation of the 8th amendment , '' he wrote .

A statement from the Army said the prosecution team `` has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty , '' but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision .
