-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The health of legendary golfer Seve Ballesteros has taken a turn for the worse , his family revealed on Friday .

The 54-year-old had a brain tumor removed in late 2008 , more than a year after he ended his illustrious career in the sport .

`` The Ballesteros family informs that Seve 's neurological condition has suffered a severe deterioration , '' read a statement on the Spaniard 's website .

`` The family will inform accordingly about any change in his health condition and takes this opportunity of thanking everyone for the support that both Seve and his own family have been receiving during all this time . ''

CNN contacted Ballesteros ' office in Santander to ask if he had returned to hospital , but was told that no further information would be given outside his personal website .

Ballesteros met with his close friend and former European Ryder Cup teammate Jose Maria Olazabal before it teed off this week , according to the UK Press Association .

`` Seve 's physical condition was not good when Jose Maria went to see him , but they talked about golf and everything , '' Olazabal 's manager Sergio Gomez told PA on Friday .

He won the British Open -- one of golf 's four major tournaments -- three times , and was twice victor at the Masters in Augusta .

As well as his success in stroke play tournaments , Ballesteros was also a mighty competitor in the match play format -- winning the world title five times and helping Europe claim the Ryder Cup on four occasions against the United States .

He was also a victorious captain in 1997 , the first year that the teams event was hosted by Europe outside of Britain and Ireland .

Meanwhile , South Africa 's Thomas Aiken claimed a one-shot lead at the halfway stage of the Spanish Open on Friday .

The 27-year-old , seeking his first victory on the European Tour , shot his second successive four-under-par 68 at El Prat with a birdie at his final hole for the second day in a row .

`` I belong to another generation and never actually saw Seve play , but his fight these last years has been an inspiration for us all , '' Larrazabal , 27 , told the European Tour website .

Another home hope , Alvaro Velasco , fired a flawless 66 to be on six-under 138 alongside France 's Romain Wattel -LRB- 71 -RRB- , Englishman Anthony Wall -LRB- 70 -RRB- and first-round leader Scott Jamieson -LRB- 72 -RRB- .
