-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded last year , killing 11 workers and leading to what has been called the worst oil spill ever , said Monday that calling 2010 its `` best year '' in safety `` may have been insensitive . ''

Newman also has a $ 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010 , according to the SEC filing .

`` Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico , we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate , '' the SEC statement reads . `` As measured by these standards , we recorded the best year in safety performance in our company 's history . ''

The company called that record `` a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment , all the time , everywhere , '' the SEC filing said .

The April 20 , 2010 , explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others , including nine Transocean employees , according to the SEC filing . It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history . The well was capped three months later , but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf .

In January , President Barack Obama 's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean , BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton , which installed the rig 's cement casing .

The commission said problems with deepwater drilling are `` systemic '' and that only `` significant reform '' will prevent another disaster .

The Interior Department has said a much broader report that relies on additional sources of data , including eyewitness accounts and photos , will be released this summer .

The oil spill has prompted a flood of lawsuits against BP , Transocean and Halliburton from a variety of plaintiffs , including owners of Gulf businesses who say they suffered heavy financial losses because of the spill .
