Since 1956 , European nations have sent representative artists and songs to battle for the boasting rights as top songsmiths .

On Tuesday evening the first semi-final of 2011 took place in a Dusseldorf , Germany , arena . And just like on U.S. shows such as `` Idol , '' losers went home and winners advanced . The only difference is that in this competition , entire countries are left saddened when songs fail to impress the voting public in Europe -- and members of a jury : The vote is split 50/50 between fans and a panel of experts .

Serbia , Greece , Lithuania , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Switzerland , Hungary , Iceland , Russia and Finland all advanced Tuesday evening , while countries such as Turkey , Norway , Armenia , Portugal , Malta , Croatia , Albania and Poland were sent packing . The biggest shockers were arguably Iceland 's inclusion and Norway 's exclusion from the finals .

But this year , some in the United States are taking more interest than ever , thanks to a fresh crop of singers and increased exposure of the Eurovision brand brought about via Facebook , YouTube and Twitter .

To be sure , the European Broadcasting Union has a long way to go to gain fans in North America .

Many view the competition as a curiosity . This year 's crop at Eurovision has already produced two giggle-inducing entrants : Israel 's official song in contention this year is simply titled `` Ding Dong '' while Belarus went with the not-exactly-subtly titled `` I Love Belarus . ''

But the level of songwriting across the board seems to be on the rise at Eurovision . After all , this is where ABBA first made their mark on the world stage and every year great songs rise above the din at the event , with several this year piquing interest -- many are raving about a song from Azerbaijan .

This year 's hopefuls might surprise curious American pop fans . Blue 's `` I Can , '' from the U.K. and Eric Saade 's `` Popular '' from Sweden , rival anything on U.S. Top 40 radio at the moment , with slick production and memorable hooks .

Whatever transpires at Eurovision this week , one thing is certain : It wo n't be dull .
