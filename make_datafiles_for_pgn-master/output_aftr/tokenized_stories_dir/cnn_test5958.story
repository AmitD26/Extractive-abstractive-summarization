-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was wet , cold and windy , and he had n't been in contention to win golf 's oldest tournament for 10 years , but Darren Clarke finally made the breakthrough at the British Open on Sunday .

Two decades after he first entered the season 's third major event , the 42-year-old made history as he triumphed by three shots from Americans Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson in its 140th staging at Royal St. George 's in England .

Clarke , whose previous best finish was runner-up in 1997 , lifted the coveted Claret Jug at his 21st attempt -- breaking the record of the tournament 's previous longest wait , the 15-try streak that Zimbabwean Nick Price snapped in 1994 .

`` It 's been a long and bumpy road , I have had some good things happen to me and some bad things , but I 've had so much support from an awful lot of people , '' Clarke said at the prize-giving ceremony .

`` I 'd like to thank my parents and my fiancee Alison , and there 's someone up there watching as well . To everybody , thank you very much . ''

Clarke became the third player from Northern Ireland to win a major title in the past 13 months , following Rory McIlroy 's U.S. Open triumph last month and Graeme McDowell 's success at the same tournament last year .

Clarke 's agent Chubby Chandler now has three current major champions in his stable , with South African Charl Schwartzel winning the Masters in April before McIlroy 's eight-shot triumph at Congressional .

Clarke has twice won World Golf Championship events , in 2003 and 2003 , while he has finished second on the European Tour 's money list three times .

He famously helped Europe win the Ryder Cup against the U.S. in 2006 -- his fifth appearance in the prestigious teams event -- a month after his wife Heather died from cancer .

Clarke , who last finished in the top-10 when he placed third at Royal Lytham & St. Anne 's in 2001 , could afford to bogey the final two holes as he carded a level-par 70 .

The left-hander , seeking to add the British Open to his three Masters and one U.S. PGA Championship crown , carded three birdies and an eagle to grab a share of the lead .

But Clarke restored his advantage as he also picked up two shots at the par-five seventh and then rattled off nine successive pars despite the difficult conditions , while his main rivals faltered .

Mickelson 's challenge fell apart at the 11th hole , where he missed a routine short par putt . More bogeys followed at 13 , 15 and 16 as he finished with a 68 to be two-under 278 for the tournament .

Johnson , seeking his first major title , drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double-bogey there handed Clarke a four-shot buffer . He also dropped a shot at 18 to fall back level with Mickelson .

First-round leader Thomas Bjorn , whose father died in May , finished fourth on 279 after the 40-year-old Dane closed with 71 .

France 's Raphael Jacquelin was eighth on 281 , while Spain 's Sergio Garcia , Englishman Simon Dyson and U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love tied for ninth on 282 .
