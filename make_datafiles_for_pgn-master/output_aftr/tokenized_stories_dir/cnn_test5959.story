Is Jose Mourinho the master of mind games ?

'' -LSB- Wednesday -RSB- we 'll face each other on the pitch . He 's won his games off the pitch and I 'll give him his personal Champions -LSB- League -RSB- for that -- just take it home and enjoy it . ''

According to British newspaper The Guardian , Guardiola responded in strong fashion and said : `` In this room -LSB- Real 's press room -RSB- , he is the chief , the f ***** g man . In here he is the f ***** g man and I ca n't compete with him .

`` I simply congratulated Madrid after the -LSB- Copa del Rey -RSB- final . If you think that his allegation that I always complain about the referees is true after you 've all heard me over the last three years , well there 's nothing I can do .

`` Off the pitch , against his media supporters , there 's nothing we can do to fight that . I 've seen it before with Mourinho , he did it at Chelsea and now he 's doing it here . ''

The Catalan club , who are three-time European champions , will be without Spain midfielder Andres Iniesta for the first match of the last-four tie .
