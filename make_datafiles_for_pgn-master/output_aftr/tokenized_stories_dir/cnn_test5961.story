Clicking either button will open up a list of time-specific daily deals , based on his or her location .

The familiar $ 10 coupons for $ 20 worth of food are still there , but they 're not one-time offers . Instead , businesses can choose when they want these deals to be available .

That 's the beauty of Groupon Now : local businesses have never really had a simple way to manage their perishable inventory , especially labor and food . Why waste those resources during slow periods when you can bring savings-savvy consumers through the doors with a highly targeted Groupon deal ?

`` For merchants , the daily deal is like teeth whitening , and Groupon Now is like brushing your teeth . It can be an everyday thing to keep your business going , '' Groupon founder and CEO Andrew Mason told Bloomberg Businessweek in an extensive interview on the new product .

The daily deals company has been on a tear recently -- in fact it is the fastest growing company in history -- but it faces stiff competition from companies with increasing muscle .

Groupon is reportedly preparing for a $ 25 billion IPO just months after famously rejecting a $ 6 billion acquisition offer from Google , but its biggest competitor , LivingSocial , is preparing to raise half a billion dollars in funding .

While the market has made it clear that the group-buying business model is easily replicable , the coupon giant believes that its new offering will provide it with a unique technology and value proposition that will keep it ahead of the pack . With 70 + million subscribers and growing , Groupon will also have a big head start .

It wo n't be long until we find out if Groupon Now is the future of local commerce ; the mobile app launches in April .
