Police in the town of Grenchen uncovered the pigs Friday after they received an anonymous message claiming that someone had buried the body parts and spilled 120 liters of blood from the animals in an effort to desecrate the ground to halt the construction of the mosque .

Thomas Suber , chief of the Solothurn Canton police , told CNN by phone that there were no suspects currently , but that a full investigation is under way .

`` We ca n't say yet it is a hate crime in those words , but it could have been done to stop the mosque , '' said Suber .

Suber said that whoever is responsible may be brought up on environmental pollution charges .

But for Muslims in Switzerland , it 's just the latest sign that they are being victimized by some in the far right .

Abdel Azziz Qaasim Illi , spokesman for Switzerland 's Central Islamic Council said the deed `` crossed a line '' that had already been pushed against Muslims since a popular referendum in 2009 banned the construction of new minarets .

`` Since the ban on minarets there 's been an increase in Islamophobia and Islamophobic events , so it was not really surprising '' said Illi . `` But it is an escalation in Switzerland because this is a peaceful country where Christians and Muslims have all been living together ... and we are a bit afraid this may increase . ''

`` We can just wait for the next rain or snowfall to cleanse the ground , so we do not fear from this side anything , '' said Illi .

`` But on the other hand it 's an emotional thing , it means that there are actually people in this society who deny the right of Muslims when it comes to a mosque in Switzerland and this is something that hurts us . ''
