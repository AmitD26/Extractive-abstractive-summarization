-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad was stung by a sea creature for a second time Saturday night and was being treated by doctors , her team said in a blog post , leaving the continuation of her swim in question .

The incident was another setback for the athlete , who was stung by Portuguese man o ' war earlier in the day .

At 6:30 p.m. , Nyad was 49 miles from Havana .

Having passed the 24-hour mark , she was entering a critical time in her quest to cover the 103 miles .

`` Tonight , her second night in the open water , may be the most critical , '' the team wrote . `` Steve Munatones , the independent observer for the International Swim Federation who is accompanying the expedition , says that swimmers have a much better chance of success if they can make it through the second night . ''

There was a bit of excitement early Saturday afternoon . An oceanic whitetip shark swam near Nyad , but a diver on her team faced it off and it meandered away .

The swimmer improved her performance late Saturday morning after struggling to maintain her usual stroke rate , her support team said . Fortified by chicken soup , Nyad was making good progress until the Saturday evening incident .

The going was rough before dawn Saturday , when Nyad had stopped her freestyle stroke and complained that she could n't breathe properly after getting stung .

Candace Hogan , a friend who has been on most of Nyad 's swims since 1978 , said she could recover and complete the 100-plus mile marathon , the blog said .

The team initially said Nyad had likely been stung by a moon jellyfish but revised that to say it was the more troublesome Portuguese man o ' war .

`` It was scary , '' Stoll said . `` But Diana is happy that this happened early while she is still at her strongest . ''

Nyad began her swim just after 6 p.m. Friday from Havana 's Hemingway Marina .

The former world champion swimmer expects the swim to take close to 60 hours , which would put her into Florida sometime Monday .

Her first Cuba-Florida attempt , back in 1978 , was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water , according to her website .

CNN 's Matt Sloane and Shasta Darlington contributed to this report .
