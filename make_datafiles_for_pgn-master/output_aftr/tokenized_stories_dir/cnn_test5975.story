Now 77 , Noriega is being extradited this weekend from France , which got Noriega in April 2010 after he spent two decades in an American prison .

Panamanian officials want him to face justice in the case of the killing of Hugo Spadafora , a doctor and political opponent of Noriega . Noriega was convicted in absentia of being involved with the kidnapping and killing of Spadafora in 1985 .

After a stop in Spain , Noriega is expected to arrive late Sunday afternoon in Panama City .

For almost two decades , Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal , a key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas .

While in U.S. custody , Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke .

Authorities have strengthened security to guarantee Noriega 's safety in prison , Panamanian Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez said .

`` We have to be ready for all the possibilities in all aspects . Noriega inspires very big emotions , and Noriega 's life could very well be at risk in Panama , '' Henriquez said .

Interior Minister Roxana Mendez said Noriega will receive the same treatment as other inmates at the Renacer prison complex .

`` The Panamanian state has no special consideration when it comes to him serving his sentence inside the prison complex , '' Mendez said . `` However , based on our laws , and if there 's a valid request from his attorneys , they can ask that he be transferred from the prison to house arrest if the inmate 's health is in jeopardy or if the inmate , being over 70 years old , may face risks inside the prison complex . ''

The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments . He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States .

Born in 1934 , Noriega was abandoned by his parents at the age of 5 and raised by an aunt in a rundown district of Panama City . After failing to get into medical school , Noriega joined the army , studying at Peru 's Military Academy of Chorrillos and quickly rising through the ranks .

In the 1970s he served as head of military intelligence to Gen. Omar Torrijos , who had seized power in a military coup in 1968 . Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981 , and Noriega emerged as his de facto successor . By 1983 he controlled both Panama 's armed forces and civilian government .

Amid growing unrest in Panama , U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989 , claiming that Noriega 's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property . Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City .
