How he did it : Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather . He started doing cardio for 45 minutes , five days a week . The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare .

He stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind : $ 1,200 . `` I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted , '' he said . `` I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself . ''

Maintaining workouts : Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week . He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine .

Notes of success : His mother said she has seen a distinct change in him , and she said she is proud of her youngest son 's accomplishments . `` I think he takes more pride in himself , '' she said . `` I 'm proud that Kevin is taking charge of his health . ''

Final thoughts : `` You ca n't just go on a diet for a few months and lose weight and then go back to exactly how you were living before and expect everything to be the same , '' Evans said . `` Ironically , it seems like the older I get , the better I get . I am also more self-confident and proud that I have been able to accomplish this . ''

Doctor 's take : Talking to loved ones about their weight can be hard . Dr. Jan McBarron , who is certified by the American Board of Bariatric Medicine , suggests approaching a friend or family member from a nonaccusatory standpoint by asking questions such as , `` How do you feel about your weight ? '' Then , if he or she seems ready to change , offer to help find credible sources for weight loss information .
