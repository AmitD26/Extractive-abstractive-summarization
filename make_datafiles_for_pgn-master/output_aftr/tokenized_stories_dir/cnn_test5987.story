San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At the pep rally where Apple debuted its third-generation tablet computer , one question was on everyone 's lips : So , what do we call this thing ?

The answer , according to an Apple spokesman : `` It 's just ` iPad . ' It 's what it is . ''

Or it is what it is n't . It 's not the iPad 3 , and it 's not the iPad HD . Both names were widely rumored before Apple 's coming-out party for the device on Wednesday in San Francisco . It 's not New iPad , which is what people on Twitter started calling it during a nearly 90-minute press conference about the device .

The longer Apple execs talked about the tablet computer 's new features -- better screen , faster connection -- without actually giving it a name , the more anxious the People of the Internet became .

`` Come on Apple , name it already , '' one person wrote .

`` Is it an Anonymous iPad ? '' asked another .

Tech writer Omar Gallaga : `` Screw it , I 'm just going to call it ` Lover . ' ''

Maybe `` iPad 4 . '' That would seem logical if unlikely at this point .

On the other hand , Apple has been through this sort of thing before .

A few million , that is . The company says it has sold 55 million iPads since the device debuted two years ago . When it comes to tablets , Apple 's competitors are scrambling to catch up .
