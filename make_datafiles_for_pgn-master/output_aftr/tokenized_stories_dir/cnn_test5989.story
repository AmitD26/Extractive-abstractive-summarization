Jean-Gilles was owner of the Peace of Mind Hotel in Jacmel , Haiti , a three-story , 30-room hideaway in a quiet tropical valley on Haiti 's southern coast , 25 miles from the bustle of the capital , Port-au-Prince . Jean-Gilles and his wife , Marie , lived in an apartment on the property , close enough to watch carefully over the guest rooms , conference rooms , boutique and restaurant , close enough that they pledged to know the first name of every guest .

Jean-Gilles figured a split second was the difference between life and death when the temblor struck . He was working in a ground-floor conference room and first heard , then felt the quake . He asked his electrician , Roberne St. Louis , who was working nearby , what was happening .

`` Get out . Now . Get out . Now , '' St. Louis said .

`` I am alive . God is good , '' she repeated over and over on Saturday .

The Peace of Mind Hotel was a dream come true for Jean-Gilles , 57 , and Marie , 59 . Born in Port-au-Prince , they moved to the United States shortly after meeting 34 years ago . Together , they owned a beauty supply store in Jersey City , New Jersey , and invested in real estate . In 2003 , they cashed out their U.S. investments , returned to Haiti and began building the Peace of Mind Hotel , looking to make a future for themselves and the people of their homeland .

They did just that . The Peace of Mind , which they valued at about $ 2 million , was theirs free and clear . They employed 40 people during the construction and had 25 on staff when the quake struck .

One employee , who is also a relative , was killed in the collapse . Her body was retrieved on Saturday . One other body remained in the rubble of the Peace of Mind , that of an American working in Haiti who 'd stopped in for a few drinks and to use the Internet . Heavy machinery pulled away chunks of debris and the smell said searchers were close to finding that body , too .

She said she and other relatives were going crazy with worry until they saw the picture . The relatives in the United States still have n't been able to reach the couple , but Karen Jean-Gilles ' husband plans to go to Haiti and find them as soon as commercial flights resume , she said .

`` We do n't have a source of revenue . This hotel was the source of our revenue . All we 've worked for our whole life . And it 's gone , '' he said .

Still , he tossed around options . An outbuilding that served as a kitchen survived . Maybe he could build around that . And there 's a swimming pool that was just about complete . That was something to work with .

`` God is good . Remember , God is good , '' Jean-Gilles told a neighbor in the valley as he contemplated rebuilding . `` This time it will be flat . I am not building up anymore . ''

Karen Jean-Gilles said her father-in-law and mother-in-law spent their life savings and did `` everything they could possibly think of doing to get this hotel up and running . '' Clark Jean-Gilles looked at the hotel as `` being the legacy to his grandchildren , '' she said .

`` I 'm just so happy that they are OK , but I 'm sad about the hotel , '' Karen Jean-Gilles said . `` We do n't know what they 're going to do now . My husband wants to get to Haiti to help them , but the airlines are closed . So , it 's really complicated , but we 're just thankful that they 're alive . ''
