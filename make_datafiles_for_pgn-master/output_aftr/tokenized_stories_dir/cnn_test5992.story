TBILISI , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The leaders of a former Eastern Bloc nation and four former Soviet republics showed support for Georgia in its conflict with Russia at a massive rally in Georgia 's capital Tuesday night .

The leaders of five nations stand on stage with Georgia 's president during a rally in Tbilisi .

Thousands cheered as the presidents of Poland , Ukraine , Lithuania , Latvia , and Estonia stood with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili at a rally in Tbilisi , Georgia , late Tuesday .

Like the latter four , Georgia is a former Soviet republic . At the rally , Saakashvili said the countries represented `` the new Europe , '' and said Russia was trying to occupy `` a real European country '' when fighting started last week .

`` It 's only you people who believe in democracy and freedom that belong in Europe , '' Ilves said .

Later , French President Nikolas Sarkozy said Saakashvili had agreed to the plan , in which Russia would agree to conclude military operations , return its armed forces to the line preceding last week 's start of the conflict and not use force again in Georgia .

The plan stops short of specifically addressing the issue of Georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .

Violence has raged since Thursday , when Georgia launched a crackdown on separatist fighters in autonomous South Ossetia , where most people have long supported independence .

Saakashvili accused Russia of provoking the war to justify a full-scale invasion of the former Soviet state . The Russians said Saakashvili attacked first in an attempt to gain control of South Ossetia .

Hours before appearing with the five presidents Tuesday , Saakashvili made a separate address to the tens of thousands of people rallying in front of the parliament building in Tbilisi .

Waving above the crowd during the rally were dozens of flags : red-and-white Georgian ones ; a few red , blue and-orange striped banners of Armenia ; and at least two American flags .

Another said , `` Soldiers ! The whole Georgia is with you ! '' One person held a poster of the Russian flag with a Nazi swastika imposed on it . Watch Georgians rally in the capital ''

`` This is the nation of Georgia and , you , all Europeans see that we do n't surrender . ... If you want to learn something about freedom , come to Georgia . Long live Georgia , '' one speaker said .
