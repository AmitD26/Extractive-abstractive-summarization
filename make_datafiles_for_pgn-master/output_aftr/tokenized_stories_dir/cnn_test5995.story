-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A manhunt was under way Saturday in Greece for two suspects who tied up a guard , stormed the Archeological Museum of Olympia , smashed glass casings and stole dozens of small statues , state media reported .

Culture Minister Pavlos Geroulanos submitted his resignation after the robbery , the prime minister 's office said Friday .

In January , three art works -- including a painting by Pablo Picasso and another by Piet Mondrian -- were stolen from the National Gallery in Athens .

Dimitra Koutsoumba , president of the Greek Archaeologists ' Association , said Friday that the latest attack was sad and worrying .

`` Such incidents are an issue of national security , '' she said . `` The artifacts that were taken were mainly figurines related to the Olympics , so many were depicting athletes . ''

The museum , built on an ancient site in the Peloponnese peninsula , is considered among the most important in Greece .

The first Olympic Games were held in Olympia in 776 B.C. to celebrate the deity Zeus . A sanctuary at the site was dedicated to him .
