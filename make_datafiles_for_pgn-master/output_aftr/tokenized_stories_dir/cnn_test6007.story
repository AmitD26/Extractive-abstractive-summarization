`` I just could n't have it up there , '' said Michael Pilato , who replaced Sandusky 's picture with that of Dora McQuaid , a Penn State graduate , poet and advocate for sexual abuse victims .

A blue ribbon was added to the rendering a day later , two months ahead of the fall school semester and just as the drumbeat for Nittany Lions football begins .

Attorney : Sandusky to appeal child sex abuse convictions

The team 's home opener against Ohio is scheduled for September 1 , leaving the program with the likely distraction of a Sandusky sentence just as the first post-Paterno season gets under way .

Following Friday 's verdict , Judge John Cleland ordered the former defensive coordinator to a county jail to await sentencing for about 90 days . Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts related to child sex abuse . He continues to maintain his innocence .

But as Penn State grapples with the trial 's aftermath , it still faces the related prosecution of two former university officials : Vice President Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley .

Paterno -- who died on January 22 after a storied career that brought Penn State football to national prominence -- reported to his superiors a child sex abuse incident in a university shower that involved Sandusky , but did not inform police .

`` We determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow up constituted a failure of leadership by Coach Paterno , '' the board of trustees said in a report that explained his firing .

That decision prompted rioting by Penn State students , overturning a news van and clashing with police , who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters .

Months later , the loss of Paterno -- often referred to as `` JoPa '' -- still resonated with students when asked Tuesday about the lingering effects of the scandal .

`` I think the one positive out of all this is that if anything like this ever happens again , people will go directly to the police , '' Pilato said .

The Pennsylvania muralist added that he 'd received dozens of e-mails from survivors of sexual abuse , asking him to paint over Sandusky 's picture on his mural . The image of the former assistant coach had been erased from the rendering in November , but was only replaced with McQuaid 's picture on Sunday .

Following Sandusky 's November indictment , Penn State says it has since required all university employees to complete training on recognizing and reporting suspected child abuse , and has revised its policy on the oversight of minors on campus .

`` The University now requires two or more authorized adults must be present during activities where minors are present , '' said school spokesman David La Torre in a written statement .

The board of trustees also commissioned an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh to investigate `` what failures occurred and what changes we must make to ensure this does n't happen again , '' the statement said .

Freeh 's group has since interviewed more than 400 university employees .

Meanwhile , Matt Sandusky -- one of Jerry Sandusky 's six adopted children -- said through his attorney that he was also sexually abused by his adoptive father , and that he had been prepared to testify against him . The announcement could ultimately bring additional charges against the former coach .

Addressing reporters Friday night , Jerry Sandusky 's attorney said the defense had learned from prosecutors that the younger Sandusky -- who sat with his family on the first day of the trial -- could have testified as a rebuttal witness if his adoptive father had taken the stand .
