-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Metta World Peace has been suspended for seven games without pay over an elbow blow he delivered to the head of an opposing player , the National Basketball Association said Tuesday .

One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest , who changed his name to Metta World Peace , was ejected Sunday from a Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for striking James Harden .

World Peace could miss at least six playoff games as a result of the suspension , the NBA said .

Harden was on the floor for several minutes , and did not return to the game after being diagnosed with a concussion , according to the Thunder .

World Peace was ejected from the game . The Lakers won 114-106 over the Thunder in double overtime .

Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak criticized his player 's actions in a statement Tuesday , but said the team will continue to support him .

`` His actions could have seriously injured another player , and his absence during this suspension will hurt our team as well . While we accept the league 's decision , we will be supportive of Metta and try to help him be more professional on the court , '' Kupchak said .

Back when World Peace was still Artest and playing for the Indiana Pacers , he made headlines in 2004 for his role in a brawl between players and fans at a Pacers-Pistons game after somebody threw a drink on him .

For that incident , the NBA suspended Artest for 86 games .
