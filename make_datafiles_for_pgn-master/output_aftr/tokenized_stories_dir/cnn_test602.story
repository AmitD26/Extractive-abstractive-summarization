On Thursday in Moscow , where former NSA contractor Edward Snowden awaits his asylum papers , a Russian court removed a major critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin from the Kremlin 's list of worries , sentencing the charismatic opposition leader Alexei Navalny to five years in jail on theft charges . Amid intense anger at the verdict and fears that it would raise Navalny 's profile , the court agreed on Friday to release him pending appeal .

Meanwhile , Putin and his backers are having a field day . They claim it is Washington that leads the world in violating human rights , even as dozens of people who dared protest against Putin 's rule face trial or languish in jail , in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances .

When Mikhail Khodorkovsky , once the wealthiest man in Russia , decided to turn his attention from business to politics , the tax authorities turned on him . He was sent to prison in Siberia , and when he became eligible for parole , the state filed another case , winning another conviction which extended his sentence .

Then there 's the case of Sergei Magnitsky . The government auditor was sent to investigate the investment firm Heritage Capital , which was charged with tax evasion . When Magnitsky concluded the tax fraud was actually coming from the government side and became a whistleblower , naming a network of corrupt officials , he was accused of working for Heritage and thrown in jail , where he became ill , was denied medical treatment and died in 2009 , when he was just 37 . The United States responded with the Magnitsky Law , imposing sanctions on those involved in his death .

Death did n't save Magnitsky from Russia 's courts , which found him guilty of tax fraud just last week .

Many others , including the performance group Pussy Riot , have seen even small scale political activism land them in jail .

Still , Putin derived visible satisfaction from having Snowden land in Russia 's lap , armed with material to discredit the United States . Conflicted by the need to preserve a needed relationship with Washington while wanting to maximize the benefit of Snowden 's presence , Putin did his best impression of a protector of human rights . Snowden and Wikileaks ' Julian Assange , Putin said , consider themselves `` human rights activist ... fighting for the spread information . ''

After that carefully crafted media operation , America 's voice in the Navalny case lost its edge . After the verdict , the U.S. ambassador wrote a tweet decrying the `` apparent political motivations in this trial . '' But Russian democrats and human rights activists have a weaker supporter in America now .

Snowden 's days in Hong Kong brought a similar reaction from China . That was particularly ironic , considering that no country on Earth has a more elaborate machine to monitor and manipulate what its citizens do online than does China , where the Communist Party also has complete control of the political system .

China Daily , the government mouthpiece , gloated `` This is not the first time that U.S. government agencies ' wrongdoing have aroused widespread public concern . '' This , from a state that , in the words of Human Rights Watch , `` imposes sharp curbs on freedom of expression , association ... openly rejects judicial independence and press freedom ; arbitrarily restricts and suppresses human rights defenders ... ''

Even if you agree with Snowden that the NSA spying is going too far , as I do , it 's hard to argue with the negative impact Snowden 's revelations have had on human rights activists in other countries . Today , dictators and authoritarian rulers are basking in a viscous moral relativism , feeling their abuses are somehow justified by criticism of America 's spying .

When people say , `` the Americans are just as bad , '' they are not only clearly wrong , they are also hurting the cause of political and personal freedom around the globe .
