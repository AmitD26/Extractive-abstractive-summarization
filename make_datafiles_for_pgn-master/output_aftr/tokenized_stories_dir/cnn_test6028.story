For the short-term bill , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , R-Virginia , told reporters Friday the $ 4 billion in spending cuts would come from terminating eight programs that President Obama included in his proposed 2012 budget and the elimination of earmarks , the same two areas Senate Democrats said Thursday they were considering .

Republicans said the cuts they are offering are intended to find common ground with Democrats . `` These are things that people have agreed to already , '' stressed House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy .

`` If they walk away from this offer they are actively engineering a government shutdown , '' House Deputy Whip Peter Roskam told reporters in a conference call Friday .

`` We are encouraged to hear that Republicans are abandoning their demands for extreme measures like cuts to border security , cancer research and food safety inspectors and instead moving close to Democrat 's position that we should cut government spending in a smart , responsible way , '' said Summers , the Reid 's spokesman .

The positive reaction from Democrats elicited an equally positive response from Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell who said , `` There is now a clear path '' to avoid a government shutdown .

House Speaker John Boehner said he expects the measure will pass the House early next week , effectively tossing the ball into the Senate 's court .

`` I 'm hopeful Senator Reid will quickly hold a vote on our short-term proposal so we can ensure the government remains open and that we 're addressing the need to cut spending , '' Boehner said .
