So confidently and constantly was it mentioned that it became something of a litany . Deval Patrick is for it , Martin O'Malley wants it passionately , Julian Castro sees it as a fundamental right . In case you missed it , the Democrats really , really believe in reproductive freedom .

The electoral message is that Mitt Romney and the Republicans are waging a war on women , or at least a concerted effort to limit access to contraception and abortion . The goal is to expand the gender voting gap to the Democratic Party 's advantage . And also to turn out the base -- reviving the liberal coalition that put Barack Obama in office in 2008

By contrast , Romney seems to be avoiding abortion talk as much as possible . He mentioned it only once in his convention speech , and the ticket has been beset by rumors of flipping and U-turning on the issue . No one doubts that the GOP is as anti-abortion as ever , but it seems to regard the matter as a distraction from this election 's central issue -- jobs .

Historically , this finds us in a very unusual situation . It used to be Republicans who used abortion as a wedge issue against Democrats . Now it 's the other way around .

For more than 30 years , Republicans used abortion partly from conviction , partly to win religious voters and partly just to keep the Democrats on a back foot , forcing them constantly to equivocate in a manner that made them seem muddled or the prisoner of the feminist lobby . When they ran for the White House in 1992 , Bill Clinton and Al Gore had both `` evolved '' on the issue so dramatically or cynically that even the spokeswoman for the National Right to Life Committee described the position as `` pretty slippery . ''

Until recently the Democratic message has been that abortion is almost too complex for a definitive stance . Recall the painful contortions that John Kerry went through in 2004 , trying to explain how a faithful Catholic could regard abortion as a matter of private conscience . The electoral problem was less Kerry 's thoughtful attempt to resolve a painful conundrum than it was George W. Bush 's comparative clarity .

The Democratic Party 's platform theoretically contains no limit on access to abortion . In another historical switch , the Democratic platform is now the more radical .

The political meaning of the president 's approach to reproductive rights is hard to fathom . Conservatives insist that the so-called war on women is a cynical distraction from the poor performance of the economy . But it 's hard to imagine that working . Pollsters repeatedly say that abortion rights ranks low on voters ' list of priorities , and with unemployment seemingly stuck at higher than 8 percent , some may resent the attempted obfuscation . Pollsters also report that the `` pro-choice '' position is at a record low . If the Democrats wanted a moral issue to beat the Republicans with , they 'd probably be better off focusing on same-sex marriage .

But maybe it all comes back to likability -- something that Obama easily outranks Romney on . Todd Akin 's appalling comments on sexual assault , Paul Ryan 's attempt to distinguish between legal varieties of rape , and the conversation among conservatives about abortion in cases of rape and incest -- all of these have communicated the sense that the Republican attitudes toward women are old-fashioned , bordering on medieval . It smacks of precisely what conservatism promises not to be : the state telling people what to do with their lives .

And the language is far removed from the experience of most people , for whom all rape is rape and contraception is a reality , not a theological challenge . Perhaps Obama is using abortion less as a specific issue to wedge between Republicans and women than as a way of accentuating the infamous Romney `` weirdo factor . '' The narrative throughout Tuesday 's proceedings has been that the Democrats are as diverse and ordinary as the rest of America , contrasted with the wealth and social Old World attitudes of the Republicans .
