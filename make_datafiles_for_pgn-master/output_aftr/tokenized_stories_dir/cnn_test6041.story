Real 's margin of victory could have and should have been greater , but Ronaldo somehow contrived to miss from six-yards with the goal at his mercy .

Rayo 's misery was compounded in stoppage time when Jose Manuel Casado was sent off after picking up a second yellow card .

But Real moved up to seventh and to within eight points of Tito Vilanova 's side following this win .

Angel Di Maria latched onto Ronaldo 's pass on the left before crossing for Benzema to fire home from close-range .

New signing Luka Modric should have doubled Real 's lead 11 minutes later but he shot straight at the goalkeeper after finding space inside the penalty area .

While Real looked dangerous in attack , it remained suspect in defense and only a wonderful save by Iker Casillas denied Delibasic an equaliser .

The Rayo striker looked certain to score from close-range only for Casillas to block and Mikel Labaka 's follow-up to be cleared off the line .

The visitors continued to dominate after the break and Benzema wrongly had goal ruled out after the referee inexplicably brought play back for a foul to Real instead of playing the advantage .

That decision could have proved costly for Mourinho 's men , but Jose Carlos ' strike sailed inches over the crossbar with Casillas beaten .

Real finally got the second goal it had been craving 20 minutes from time when Jordi Amrat handled inside the penalty area and Ronaldo stroked home from the spot .

Elsewhere , Sevilla claimed a 2-0 victory away at Deportivo La Coruna .

Alvaro Negredo and Ivan Rakitic scored in the second-half to help Sevilla extend their unbeaten run to five games in the league and move to within four points of the leaders .
