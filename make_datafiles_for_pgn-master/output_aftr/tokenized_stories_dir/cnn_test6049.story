ABC 's country music drama delivered 9 million viewers and a 2.8 rating among adults 18-49 . That 's enough to win the hour in the adult demo , topping CBS ' `` CSI '' -LRB- 10.6 million , 2.6 -RRB- and the premiere of NBC 's new series `` Chicago Fire '' -LRB- 6.4 million , 1.9 -RRB- . But `` Nashville '' was down 15 percent from the launch of `` Revenge '' in this slot last year . NBC 's fire-fighting drama was largely panned by critics and had a disappointing launch , down 21 percent from the debut of `` Law & Order : SVU '' in this slot last fall . -LRB- `` Nashville '' averaged a score of 84 on Metacritic while `` Chicago Fire '' had a 49 -RRB- .

Yet here 's something interesting : Of the three dramas in the hour , the Connie Britton series had the weakest audience retention from its first half to its second . `` Chicago Fire '' did n't shed any of its demo rating between its half hours â € '' which is pretty rare for a show premiering this late at night . Nashville may have a bigger rating , but `` Chicago Fire '' did a better job of keeping viewers in their seat .

Another key debut last night : The CW 's `` Arrow ' -LRB- 4 million , 1.3 rating -RRB- got off to a fine start . This may not be a huge demo rating for the network , but `` Arrow '' marks The CW 's most-watched series debut in total viewers since `` The Vampire Diaries '' in 2009 . The CW 's mission this season is to attract a broader audience than just the `` Gossip Girl '' / `` 90210 '' female 18-34 crowd , and hitting 4 million viewers certainly helps . The performance is also impressive considering the network 's numbers have been soft the past couple weeks . It 's always tougher to jump start a cold engine . `` Arrow '' also gave `` Supernatural '' -LRB- 2.6 million , 1.0 -RRB- a boost at 9 p.m. , spiking the veteran drama to its biggest audience in two years .

Fox topped the night in the adult demo thanks to a steady `` The X-Factor '' -LRB- 9.4 million , 3.4 -RRB- .

` Parks and Rec ' : Christie Brinkley in as ...

The Neighbors has clearly emerged as the weak link in the network 's Wednesday comedy chain , but last night also suggested the show might be stabilizing since it did not drop this week . This puts ABC in a tough position . The aliens-next-door sitcom does n't have a terrible number by this fall 's standards , but you do n't want to have anything potentially dragging down your top-rated comedy , `` Modern Family . ''

NBC also had `` Animal Practice '' -LRB- 3.9 million , 1.1 -RRB- , Guys With Kids -LRB- 4.2 million , 1.4 -RRB- and `` SVU '' -LRB- 6.2 million , 1.8 -RRB- .
