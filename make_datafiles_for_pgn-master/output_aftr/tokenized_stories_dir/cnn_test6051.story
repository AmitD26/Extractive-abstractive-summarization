The 31-year-old took to Twitter to refute the findings of an FA disciplinary panel which cast `` considerable doubt '' over evidence he gave in defense of former England captain John Terry , who was found guilty last month of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand .

Ferdinand is the brother of Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand , whose comments about former England colleague Cole and strained relations with onetime defensive partner Terry have contributed to what one leading football official has described as a '' ` mafia feud '' .

` Hahahahaa , well done #fa I lied did I , #BUNCHOFTWATS , ' Cole tweeted , so courting a possible misconduct charge himself from the very organization he was criticizing .

Cole was responding to the FA 's publication on Friday of a 63-page report which questioned the truth of statements given by himself , Terry and Chelsea club secretary David Barnard about a Premier League game at QPR in October 2011 -- with the commission describing Terry 's defense as `` improbable , implausible and contrived . ''

`` A much more plausible and likely explanation is that Mr. Terry was angry ; angry at Mr. Ferdinand 's taunting and provocation of him , angry at the way the match had gone , and angry at the way in which it seemed likely to end .

`` The much more likely explanation for what he said is that all of this provoked him into saying ` f *** ing black c *** ' as an insult , which is consistent with the fact that insults preceded and followed those words .

`` The Commission is entitled to use its collective experience of life and people to judge demeanor .

`` We have watched the film footage many times . In the critical phase , during which he uses the words ` f *** ing black c *** ' , Mr. Terry can be seen to be smiling initially , before his facial expression changes to disdainful and contemptuous .

`` At no point is his demeanor and facial expression that of someone who is imploring , injured , or even quizzical in the face of an unfounded allegation by Mr. Ferdinand that he -LRB- Mr. Terry -RRB- had just been racially abusive towards him -LRB- Mr. Ferdinand -RRB- . ''

Terry was cleared in a magistrates ' court in July of racially abusing Ferdinand but the FA found him guilty on 27 September , using the `` balance of probabilities '' as its standard of proof as opposed to the `` beyond reasonable doubt '' ruling used in a criminal trial .

The organization stressed that it does not believe `` Terry to be a racist '' , citing a large body of testimonial evidence -- `` including statements from black footballers '' -- to say that he is not , but that it did find the controversy-plagued 31-year-old guilty of making a racist insult .

The FA also stated that it had `` considerable doubt '' over Cole 's claims that he had heard Ferdinand use the word `` black '' when insulting Terry after the pair clashed late on .

The initial evidence given by Cole in the days after the game was amended in November 2011 when Chelsea secretary Barnard asked the FA to add the word `` black '' to the left back 's original statement .

Nearly one year on , the FA panel found Barnard 's evidence to be `` materially defective . ''

The document also found fault with Cole 's claims since it believes abusive comments made by Ferdinand himself towards Terry -- which the QPR defender says were in relation to a perceived marital affair by the Chelsea man with a former team mate 's ex-girlfriend -- were of a sexual rather than racial nature .
