-LRB- CNN -RRB- Throwing your keys at the parking valet as you sashay onto a flight may seem like the stuff of James Bond films , but already a robotic valet is taking the sweat out of getting on a plane at Germany 's Dusseldorf airport .

Rather than getting behind the wheel , however , this robotic valet physically lifts your three tons of road machinery and slots it into pre-designated robot parking bays .

Nicknamed RAY by its creators , the automated forklift truck is the brainchild of Germany 's Serva Transport .

Aimed at business travelers in a hurry , the automated parking system can be controlled and booked via an app . All travelers have to do is drop the car off in a designated area , go to a nearby touch screen to confirm the car is empty , and RAY does the rest .

The company claims that its space-saving system -- which uses lasers and sensors to measure not just the height and width of the cars but accessories such as wing mirrors and fenders -- can park 60 % more cars than a human driver .

The system is also connected to the airport 's flight data system : RAY will retrieve the car based on flight itineraries . The app also lets car owners communicate with RAY if there are any flight delays .

The airport charges € 29 a day -LRB- $ 40 -RRB- or € 4 -LRB- $ 5.50 -RRB- an hour for the service , which the airport 's management said was likely to appeal to time-strapped corporates .

A New Jersey startup called Boomerang also aims to take parking to the next level by using an automated parking system that can park hundreds of cars without human intervention .

According to Boomerang CEO Mark Patterson the advantage of his system is that it is designed with multiple entry bays , multiple robots and multiple lifts so there is no single point of failure .

Drivers put their car into a parking bay that places the car on a large steel tray . Robotic wheeled platforms slide under the vehicle and then transport it to the bays following buried wires in the floor of the carpark .

`` Developers like it because you can park 100 % more cars in the same space and that 's a big value proposition . ''

`` The cars are not running in these garages so there 's a big savings on air handling equipment , '' Patterson said . `` You need seven or eight air changes an hour with traditional carparks versus just one or two with this system . ''

Similarly , there 's also no need to illuminate the building to the sort of levels that would deter muggers or other attackers that lurk in the gloom of multi-story carparks .
