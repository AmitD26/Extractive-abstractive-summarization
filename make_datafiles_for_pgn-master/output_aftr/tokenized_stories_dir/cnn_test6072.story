-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She says she was brought up to be the fastest driver , not the fastest girl .

None of the boys were faster on Sunday .

She 'll start next Sunday 's `` Great American Race '' in the front row , on the inside part of the track . The polesitter begins the race with certain strategic advantages as well as the prestige of leading an elite pack .

`` When the pressure is on and when the spotlight is on , they ultimately become some of my better moments , '' she said earlier .

Not so , said her crew chief , Tony Gibson , who said it 's an even split .

`` She runs so smooth , keeps such a smooth line and that 's what you have to do to carry speed here , '' co-car owner and fellow driver Tony Stewart said .

Only nine of the pole winners in the first 54 Daytona 500s won the race and no one has earned both victories since Dale Jarrett in 2000 , NASCAR spokesman Scott Warfield said .

The rest of the field will be set in two qualifying races scheduled for Thursday .

Patrick and Gordon are guaranteed two of the 43 slots in the final lineup . But they go to the back of the pack if they wreck their cars in the qualifiers , or at any time before Sunday 's race , and have to switch to a backup car , Warfield said .

Patrick , 30 , is in her first full year as a NASCAR Sprint Cup driver . Last year she made 10 Sprint Cup starts , qualifying no better than 23rd .

NASCAR says Patrick still qualifies as a rookie for the 2013 season and she 's the first rookie to win the Daytona 500 pole since Jimmie Johnson in 2002 .

Before racing stock cars , Patrick raced open-wheel IndyCars for several years .

Patrick said winning a pole position in Kansas in 2005 was one of her top moments as an IndyCar driver . She also was the first woman to win a race in that series , in Japan in 2008 , and was the first woman to ever lead a lap at the famed Indianapolis 500 .

Patrick won a pole last year at Daytona in the Nationwide Series , NASCAR 's second division . She finished 38th in that race and in the Daytona 500 and she said on Sunday that she plans on competing in both races again next weekend .

Janet Guthrie previously held both the records for qualifying by a female driver . She qualified ninth for two races in 1977 and her best Daytona starting position was 18th in 1980 .

`` This is great from the sport and the rest of us will benefit from it , '' he said . `` I 'm proud to sit on the front row with her . ''

Patrick told CNN that understanding the scope of her achievement `` is something that happens down the road . In the moment , it 's about thinking about what I need to do for next Sunday and trying to make some more history . ''
