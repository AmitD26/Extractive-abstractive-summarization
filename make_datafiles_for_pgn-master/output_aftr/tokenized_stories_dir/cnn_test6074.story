-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the world 's largest private superyachts is the latest to set sail on an expedition to uncover the secrets of a British battle cruiser lost during World War II .

Octopus -- a 414 foot megayacht -- was donated to the British Navy by Paul Allen , co-founder of Microsoft . Allen will fund the recovery and research expedition , sparing the British government any cost .

A previous expedition by Blue Water Recoveries , a deep sea shipwreck recovery company , located the wreck 11 years ago .

The enduring allure of tall ships

David Mearns , director of Blue Water Recoveries , said the ship 's bell was `` lovingly looked after '' by the crew . Its recovery is seen by those who lost loved ones as a way to commemorate those who died .

The wreck of HMS Hood is designated under the Protection of the Military Remains Act , meaning the recovery team had to seek permission from the British Navy in order to retrieve the bell .

The mission was agreed to by the British Government , and the Ministry of Defence say the bell -- if recovered -- will form a tangible and fitting memorial to the ship and the 1,415 men who died when she sunk in the North Atlantic .

Mearns recalls the astonishment of the team when they located the ship 's bell , on their first dive , in 2001 .

The team , Mearns recalls , `` were just stunned by it . ''

The 40,000 ton wreck is strewn over two and half kilometers of seabed , and uncovering the bell was a stroke of luck for the recovery team .

`` It 's a really iconic item and personal symbol of the ship , but we were there conducting this investigation on a ` do n't touch ' basis . It never occurred to us , even for a second , ` What if we recovered the bell ? Should we attempt to ? ' '' Mearns tells CNN .

Wilcocks added , `` future generations will be able to gaze upon -LSB- the Hood 's -RSB- bell and remember with gratitude and thanks the heroism , courage and personal sacrifice of Hood 's ship 's company who died in the service of their country . ''

If recovered , the bell will go on display in 2014 , at an exhibition at the Royal Navy Museum in the southern English port of Portsmouth -- where the Hood was based .

The Octopus , the world 's 13th largest megayacht , is a `` fantastically capable vessel , '' Mearns says .
