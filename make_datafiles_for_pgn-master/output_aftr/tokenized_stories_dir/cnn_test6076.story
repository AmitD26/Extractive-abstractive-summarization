In an e-mail sent to reporters , Ansaru said it had kidnapped the seven workers Saturday because of `` transgression and atrocities '' against Islam in Afghanistan , Mali and other locations .

Those kidnapped included workers from Italy , Greece and Lebanon , those governments confirmed . Nigerian police said a Briton was also kidnapped ; British authorities said they were aware of such reports and were making inquiries .

They then killed a guard at the Setraco workers camp before kidnapping the workers , Muhammed told the broadcaster .

In December , the group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of a French citizen near the border with Niger and for an attack on a prison in Abuja in November .

U.S. officials say Ansaru is an offshoot of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram , which Nigerian authorities say is behind a recent rash of killings and kidnappings in the country .

Nigeria launched a military crackdown on Boko Haram in January . Security forces have since captured one of the group 's leaders and killed 17 suspected Boko Haram members .

Opinion : Why are Nigerians numb to slaughter ?

Boko Haram and other Muslim groups say the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the Nigerian government . But the U.S. State Department has accused the group 's leaders of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network and of hoping to drive a wedge between Nigeria 's Christian and Muslim communities .

CNN 's Vladimir Duthiers and journalist Hassan John contributed to this report .
