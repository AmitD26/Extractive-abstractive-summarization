Mark Lewis told CNN Friday he expects an initial hearing to be held in New York in about two to three months , as he seeks to begin legal claims in the United States .

Police in London are now investigating the hacking claims as well as allegations of bribery of police .

Senior News Corp. executives have denied that wrongdoing among the company 's staff was widespread .

`` We have been speaking to U.S. lawyers to make applications to U.S. courts in order to assist the investigation of this matter and are looking to pursue legal action on the basis of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the United States , whereby a holding company can be liable for practices outside the jurisdiction where the offence is said to have taken place , '' Lewis said .

`` Proceedings will be issued in the U.S. where we will seek information from the company 's directors about those issues and about corporate governance . ''

This action was being pursued `` because it is in our clients ' interests to pursue their cases as thoroughly and properly as possible , '' Lewis said .

He added that `` compensation is likely to be higher from U.S. courts than courts in the UK . ''

Another lawyer for a number of alleged hacking victims , Mark Thomson , told CNN his clients were pursuing claims in the English civil courts but did not intend to take action in U.S. courts .

Earlier this week , a News International statement confirmed it was involved in `` advanced negotiations with the Dowler family regarding their compensation settlement . ''

CNN 's Jonathan Wald and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report .
