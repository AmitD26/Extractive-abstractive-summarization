-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a dusty corner of southern Chad 's Moula refugee camp , the pounding beat of a skin drum drives a group of young men through a cluster of brick-made huts and into a makeshift soccer field .

They 're summoned here , however , not to kick a football but to engage in an uplifting activity that can help them forget the tough conditions they live in : dancing

Organized by Chadian dancer and choreographer Taïgue Ahmed , these dance workshops are helping scores of displaced people to regain their self-confidence , while having fun and and finding a way of expressing themselves .

`` The first time that I was at the refugee camps , the people were all quiet and in their tents . And now with the dance project , everyone came out , I think it has also changed their outlook , '' says Ahmed , an acclaimed dancer in his own right who has graced stages across Africa and internationally .

`` The idea came to me after reading articles about refugees in Darfur , '' he says . `` The children were exposed to war -- seeing weapons , nothing but war , the kids are traumatized . And the idea I had was , why ca n't I adapt this dance workshop for the refugee camps , to give the children an outlet , a way to have fun and to have a life . ''

According to the United Nations , Chad has been affected by a humanitarian crisis since 2001 . Statistics reveal an alarming picture as the country had more than 300,000 refugees in 2010 , according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees .

`` I see there is hope because this dance that I am doing will help me earn an income , '' says 19-year-old refugee Bienvenue Ndubabe who has lived in a refugee camp for the past four years . `` It will enable me to carry on with my studies , '' adds Ndubabe , who attends school in the local village and has every intention of furthering his studies next year .

Last October , Ahmed also teamed up with friend and colleague Jean Michel Champault -- director of the African Artists for Development foundation -- to start a project together called `` Refugees on the Move . ''

The goal is to create a chain reaction and extend Ahmed 's dance workshops to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa .

`` Through dance we are trying to bring hope to troubled youths and try to reduce violence and bring a sense of social interactions , '' says Champault .

Inside the camp , Ahmed 's dance lessons are life lessons , teaching people of all ages important skills as well as encouraging hygiene and education . Ahmed also does n't shy away from sensitive issues , raising awareness on HIV/AIDS , women 's rights , hygiene and education .

Ahmed has succeeded in giving the refugees that they need as much as food and shelter -- their sense of humanity and belonging .

`` I 've always said that for me , dance is something magical , that does n't have barriers . We can find ourselves in an open space like this one and dance together -- it 's joy , sometimes people meet up and become partners forever . ''
