The Alabama writer has sued her hometown Monroe County Heritage Museum for trademark infringement , saying it is illegally using her fame for its own gain .

`` The museum seeks to profit from the unauthorized use of the protected names and trademarks of ` Harper Lee ' and ` To Kill a Mockingbird . ' It is a substantial business that generated over $ 500,000 in revenue for 2011 , the last year for which figures are available , '' said the lawsuit filed last week . `` But its actual work does not touch upon history . Rather , its primary mission is to trade upon the fictional story , settings and characters that Harper Lee created . ''

The museum fully acknowledges its most famous resident . Its website is www.tokillamockingbird.com and says it `` maintains and operates six historic sites in Monroe County , Ala. , that collectively interpret the area 's rich history , '' including `` the literary legacy of -LRB- fellow author -RRB- Truman Capote and Harper Lee , '' who were childhood friends .

An attorney for the facility strongly denied Lee 's allegations .

`` Every single statement in the lawsuit is either false , meritless , or both , '' said Matthew Goforth , a Birmingham-based attorney hired for the museum . `` It is sad that Harper Lee 's greedy handlers have seen fit to attack the non-profit museum in her hometown that has been honoring her legacy and the town 's rich history associated with that legacy for over 20 years . Unfortunately for Harper Lee , those handlers are doing nothing but squandering her money with this lawsuit . The museum is squarely within its rights to carry out its mission as it always has . ''

Lee in her lawsuit acknowledged the novel 's impact in her community . `` The town 's desire to capitalize upon the fame of ` To Kill a Mockingbird ' is unmistakable : Monroeville 's town logo features an image of a mockingbird and the cupola of the Old County Courthouse , which was the setting for the dramatic trial in ` To Kill a Mockingbird . ' ''

Her lawyers said they had earlier attempted to stop the museum from any unauthorized commercial use of the novel , and claimed it tried to block her federal registration of the `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' trademark .

`` Historical facts belong to the world , but fiction and trademarks are protected by law , '' the lawsuit says .
