-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a question most of us seem to have pondered at some point : When should stores start on the Christmas season ?

For one Canadian drugstore chain , the first week in November is too soon , at least for the sounds of the season .

Shoppers Drug Mart pulled Christmas music from its almost 1,200 stores across Canada at midnight Friday after hearing complaints from customers that they were n't quite ready for the season to be jolly .

The posting has drawn more than 7,300 `` likes '' and almost 6,000 comments as of Monday morning , the majority of them positive .

Some customers said they 'll give Shoppers Drug Mart more of their business .

`` This is awesome . Christmas has been rammed down consumer 's throats earlier and earlier each year . I will be shopping at your store more often to avoid it ! '' wrote Lori Anne Stoute .

James MacFarlane said Christmas music in stores makes him fell `` like being trapped in an endless jukebox . ''

`` Thank you ! '' MacFarlane wrote . `` It turns me off of even going into stores over the holiday season knowing it 's endless Christmas music everywhere . Having two months of it is insane . ''

The sanity of the chain 's employees was on the minds of some who commented .

`` Your employees probably are thanking you too -- having to listen to Christmas music for 2 months is just too long , '' wrote Janet Williams .

But not everyone is happy with the delay of the Christmas music .

Another took her dissent a bit further .

`` What a disappointment to take something so joyful and degrade it with negativity , '' wrote Trisha Trudell . `` Take the commercialism aside , Christmas is the most wonderful time of year to show love and equality and be giving and kind . What 's so wrong with sharing in this early . ''

`` Depending on how -LRB- S -RRB- hoppers handles this situation going forward will determine if I will ever continue to shop at shoppers drug mart again , '' she wrote .

`` Go ahead and boycott the company , though . Shorter line ups AND not having to deal with Christmas music 7 freaking weeks before the day , ... . BONUS !!! '' Cassandra Nadeau wrote .
