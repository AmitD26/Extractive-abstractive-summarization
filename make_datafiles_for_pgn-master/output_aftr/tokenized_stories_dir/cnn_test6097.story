`` Five years ago we raced , it was n't the best race but it was on a circuit which was n't built for Formula One cars , but for IndyCar and NASCAR .

While F1 has spread around the world to new markets , it has struggled to touch the heartland of U.S. motorsport 's fanbase , which favors open-wheel racing -- generally seen as more accessible for fans and competitors alike .

`` Not just as spectators , but actually wanting to be involved in the sport in the future . ''

When Button joined McLaren in 2010 as a newly-crowned world champion , it was hoped he could form an all-British dream partnership with his compatriot .

But after three seasons as teammates neither driver has managed to win the title , and a Twitter row erupted in the aftermath of 2008 champion Hamilton 's announcement he will move to the German outfit in 2013 .

Hamilton will end a career-long association with McLaren after the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix next weekend , but Button insists the pair still enjoy an amicable professional relationship .

`` We have a very good working relationship , '' Button said .

`` We 're competitive , as we should be -- you want to beat everyone and that includes your teammate .

Hamilton , who sits fifth in the drivers ' standings 12 points and one place above Button , accused his colleague of `` unfollowing '' him -- unsubscribing to his tweets -- on Twitter after October 's Japanese Grand Prix .

Button 's new teammate will be young Mexican Sergio Perez , who has made his name in an impressive second season at Sauber .

`` He 's obviously an exciting talent , '' added Button . `` He 's willing to learn , he seems intelligent , those are the three ingredients you need as a racing driver .

`` He 's only 22 , which is quite scary . He 's 10 years younger than me which makes me feel very old ! I 'm looking forward to the partnership . It 's a fresh start and it 's exciting . ''

However , last season 's runner-up has been frustrated by his inability to challenge both Red Bull 's current leader and two-time defending champion Vettel , and Ferrari 's Alonso -- who , like the German , is seeking a third world title .

`` It 's been a tough year , '' Button said . `` You 've got to love the wins . The two wins for me were pretty special , but I 've also had some pretty bad races .

`` I sorted those issues out , but I 'd lost so much ground by then it 's difficult to fight for the championship . The last few races have been fun , I 've really enjoyed it .

`` The racing is great , we 've got a lot of top drivers , a lot of top teams , great partners and sponsors involved -- it should work . ''
