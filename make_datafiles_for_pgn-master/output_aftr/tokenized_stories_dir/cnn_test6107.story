-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The nightmare began around 12:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve .

`` I opened my hand and her arm just fell out of mine , '' said Hermanstorfer . `` She was already gone . ''

Moments later , the staff at Memorial Health System in Colorado Springs , Colorado , sounded a Code Blue -- resuscitation needed for cardiac arrest . They would have to act fast : Tracy Hermanstorfer , 33 , was also in labor . Her baby was perilously close to death .

`` The risk of a woman dying in the course of trying to carry a pregnancy is an incredibly rare event , '' said Dr. Michael Greene , director of obstetrics at Massachusetts General Hospital , who was not involved with Hermanstorfer 's case . `` The number of things that can cause this in an otherwise healthy woman is a very short list . ''

Dr. Stephanie Martin was 100 yards away when the Code Blue sounded . She ran to the delivery room where Mike Hermanstorfer stood next to what he thought was his dead wife .

`` My first thought was that I ca n't allow this father to lose both his wife and his child , especially on Christmas Eve , '' said Martin , director of maternal-fetal medicine at Memorial Health System .

It was a situation she had witnessed only nine or 10 times during her career . Based on experience , Martin had ideas about what might have caused Hermanstorfer 's cardiac arrest , but nothing was certain .

She could rule out things like pre-existing heart problems -- they are rare for someone healthy , young , and with no family history . Hermanstorfer had not experienced excessive blood loss or other major trauma , also common reasons for cardiac problems during childbirth .

But Martin says that if a baby is removed from its mother within five minutes of a witnessed cardiac arrest , the baby will survive 95 percent of the time .

`` We all stopped and took a breath , '' said Martin . `` We had to make sure she was n't going to re-arrest . ''

Tracy was stable . Doctors quickly wheeled her out to an operating room to finish her Caesarean and put her on a ventilator to help her breathe .

Hospital staff continued their resuscitation of baby Coltyn . In a few minutes his skin was flushed ; he gasped for air and let out a loud wail .

`` I thought he was dead until he gasped for air , '' said Mike Hermanstorfer . `` When he let that cry out , that 's when the whole world stops . Most parents ca n't stand the sound of a crying baby , but I 'll tell you from experience that 's one of the best sounds you could ever hear . ''

No sooner had Hermanstorfer absorbed that his son was alive than doctors delivered the news that Tracy was breathing on her own .

Tracy Hermanstorfer still feels a tingle of fear when she thinks about what happened to her .

Tracy will undergo more tests in the coming weeks , but doctors still have no idea what happened to her heart on Christmas Eve .
