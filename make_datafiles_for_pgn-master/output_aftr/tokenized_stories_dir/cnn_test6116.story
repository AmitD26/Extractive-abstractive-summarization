2 . Brighten eyes

`` Smudge a bit of deep navy eyeliner on the inner rims of the upper lids when you 're done with the rest of your eye makeup . Gently lifting lashes with your fingers or glancing down into a handheld mirror will help you see where the eyeliner is going . The blue color makes the whites of your eyes stand out . '' -- Makeup artist Carmindy

`` Mix together one packet of dry yeast with the juice of half a lemon and spread over a blemish for five minutes . This works wonderfully to dry it out . '' -- Esthetician Sonya Dakar

`` Use ash-tone powders to fill in brows for natural-looking definition . The eyebrows provide a frame for the face , so it 's important to keep them well groomed . '' -- Makeup artist Jillian Dempsey

5 . Tame flyaways

`` Carry dryer sheets ; if frizzies threaten to ruin your look , run a sheet over your hair to subdue flyaway strands . When you need to take a model 's photo fast , this trick really does work . '' -- Hairstylist Clyde Haygood

`` Line your lips with a neutral liner . Then fill in both lips -- except for the centers -- so that you can have the look of major shine when you apply a clear lip gloss . '' -- Makeup artist Mally Roncal

7 . Pop your peepers

8 . Lay a foundation

`` Concealer should always follow foundation . If you put it on first and then you blend on the foundation , you 're essentially erasing all your handiwork . If you layer concealer on top , it 's staying where it needs to stay and doing its job . '' -- Carmindy

11 . Angle arches

`` To give your brows color , shine and great hold , take a little bit of MAC Oh Baby lip gloss and comb it through the eyebrows . A word of warning : Make sure you 're wearing your hair pulled back ! '' -- Mally Roncal

`` For subtly fuller lips , overdraw the cupid 's bow with Make Up For Ever 's double-tipped concealer pencil in a shade lighter than your skin tone , soften the line by smudging and then gloss lips . '' -- AJ Crimson

`` To maximize the benefit of a rich conditioner , leave it in and stand in a steamy shower for 10 minutes once a week . It 's great to let the steam break down the conditioner -- and it 's beneficial for your skin as well . '' -- Hairstylist Kimberly Kimble

14 . Skip the cake -LRB- y -RRB-

`` A lot of my celebrity clients like to mix my omega oils with their body foundation for a sheer , non-cakey finish . '' -- Sonya Dakar

`` To make liquid liner less intimidating to use , create a liner ` stencil ' by going over the lash line with taupe pencil first . Then apply liquid liner over that . '' -- Jillian Dempsey

17 . Got silk ?

`` Silk scarves , rollers , bonnets and pillowcases used at night help my clients , like Gabrielle Union , maintain their glossy styles longer . Cotton dries hair out and undoes the hairstyle . Silk keeps the curl and shape of your hair intact . '' -- Kimberly Kimble

18 . Live in color

`` Bring attention to your eyes by using a contrasting shade of mascara . Wearing burgundy or navy instead of ordinary black or brown is a great way to accentuate your eye color . '' -- Jillian Dempsey

19 . Soften up

20 . Get smoky eyes fast

21 . Smooth your strands

`` To care for end-of-summer hair , -LSB- clients like Evangeline Lilly -RSB- coat theirs midway down to the ends with a deep conditioner first , followed with a bodifying shampoo on the roots only . '' -- Clyde Haygood

22 . Stop smudges

`` Extend the life of your eyeliner by setting it with powder and going over it with a matching shade of shadow . It makes the eyeliner bulletproof . '' -- Mally Roncal

24 . Save face

`` Exfoliating is the most important thing you can do to make skin prettier . By cleansing your face every night with a fresh washcloth -- which is more sanitary than reusing a sponge -- and using enzyme-based masks on a regular basis , the outer layer of dead cells is eliminated , leaving the newest , softest skin . '' -- facialist Nerida Joy
