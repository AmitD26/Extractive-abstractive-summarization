The 25-year-old Bolt won the 100m final Sunday in 9.63 seconds , again relegating Blake to second place .

`` It 's the one I wanted I 'm very proud of myself , '' Bolt told BBC Sport .

Blake added : `` Usain Bolt has been motivating me all season . Everything has been going good so far . ''

Victory in the relay would give Bolt his sixth Olympic gold medal .

An epic night was kick started by a sensational victory in the men 's 800m for David Rudisha of Kenya .

Rudisha ran one minute 40.91 seconds to break his own world record , the first in the track and field events at the Games .

The 23-year-old led from start to finish and was never seriously challenged , despite a superb run by 18-year-old silver medalist Nijel Amos of Botswana .

Can ` power posing ' like Bolt make you a winner ?

Amos clocked one minute 41.73 seconds , matching the former world record time set by London Games chief Sebastian Coe back in 1981 , which stood for 16 years .

Rudisha , who was inspired by Coe 's exploits , had promised him something special and did not disappoint .

`` I was well prepared and had no doubt about winning , '' he told BBC Sport .

The qualifiers for the final of the women 's 800 meters were led by gender row athlete Caster Semenya of South Africa .

American Christian Taylor won the men 's triple jump with a 17.81 meters effort to add to his world title from Daegu last year .
