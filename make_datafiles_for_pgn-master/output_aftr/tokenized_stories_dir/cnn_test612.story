Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul joined New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Monday morning in asserting that the choice should be left up to the parents . And BuzzFeed highlighted comments made by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina last week defending parents ' rights on the issue .

With the outbreak of the measles epidemic in December -- after the disease was eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 -- the scientific community is mobilizing to counter the `` anti-vax '' movement , which has grown over the past decade .

Paul , in comments on conservative talk-radio show host Laura Ingraham 's show Monday , said he 's `` not anti-vaccine at all . ''

`` I think there are times in which there can be some rules , but for the most part it ought to be voluntary , '' Paul went on . `` While I think it 's a good idea to take the vaccine , I think that 's a personal decision for individuals to take . ''

And in a later interview with CNBC , Paul suggested he had seen the negative effects of vaccines that those in the anti-vax movement cite in their opposition . None , however , are widely supported by the scientific community , and Paul 's office did not respond to a request for comment for details .

`` I 've heard of many tragic cases of walking , talking , normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines , '' Paul said . `` I 'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea . I think they 're a good thing . But I think the parents should have some input . ''

`` All I can say is that we vaccinate ours . I think it 's much more important as a parent than as a public official , and that 's what we do , '' he told reporters during his trip to England on Monday . He went on to say that 's `` part of making sure we protect their health and public health . ''

`` I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice as well . So that 's a balance the government has to decide , '' Christie added .

`` And so we have to have that conversation . -LSB- It -RSB- has to move and shift to disease type . Not every vaccine is created equal . Not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others , '' Christie said .

He went on to say that the debate over whether to vaccinate children should measure `` whatever the perceived danger by the vaccine is -- and we 've had plenty of that over a period of time -- versus what the risk to public health is . ''

Shortly after Christie 's comments were picked up by national media , his spokesman , Kevin Roberts , issued an email clarifying the governor 's position , asserting that states should have jurisdiction over the issue , as they currently do .

The Democratic National Committee knocked Christie for putting on a `` tin foil hat '' and `` bowing to junk science , '' warning him to `` sit down and shut up , before people actually get hurt '' in a release .

Another group of potential 2016ers also weighed in on the need for children to be vaccinated .

Texas ' Sen. Ted Cruz told reporters Tuesday that `` children of course should be vaccinated '' and also jumped to Christie 's defense , a potential foe for the Republican nomination .

`` This issue is largely silliness stirred up by the media , '' Cruz said . `` Nobody reasonably thinks Chris Christie is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines . ''

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , who is also weighing a presidential run , was unequivocal : children should `` absolutely '' be vaccinated and the practice should `` absolutely '' be mandatory , he said Tuesday .

Rubio added to the heap of doctors and experts who assert there is no link between vaccinations .

`` If enough people are not vaccinated you put at risk infants that are three months of age or younger that have not been vaccinated , and you put at risk immune-suppressed children that are not able to get those vaccinations , '' Rubio said . `` So absolutely , all children in America -LSB- should be vaccinated -RSB- . ''

Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement Tuesday he has `` no reservations '' about the benefits of vaccines and urged `` all parents to get their kids vaccinated . ''

President Barack Obama weighed in on the issue during a Sunday interview with NBC , urging parents to get their kids vaccinated .

`` I understand that there are families that , in some cases , are concerned about the effect of vaccinations , '' he said . `` The science is , you know , pretty indisputable . We 've looked at this again and again . There is every reason to get vaccinated , but there are n't reasons to not . ''

But despite Obama 's insistence that the science supporting the need for vaccines is `` indisputable , '' the vaccine debate has been problematic for Republicans in the past .

He eventually flipped on the mandate and supported the Texas legislature 's decision to overturn it , saying he made a mistake .

Indeed , Carly Fiorina , in explaining her position to BuzzFeed , referenced that vaccine as one worthy of `` concern . '' Paul decried it as well .

`` I certainly can understand a mother 's concerns about vaccinating a 10-year-old , '' she said . `` I think vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense . But that 's me . I do think parents have to make those choices . ''
