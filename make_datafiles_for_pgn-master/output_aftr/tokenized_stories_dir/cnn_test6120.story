Lamees Dhaif , a journalist and activist , shares her thoughts on what is happening in her home country and its future in this conversation , edited for length and clarity .

Dhaif : I think what happened to Ali Hasan is very tragic . Keeping a minor behind bars for a month is unexplainable . No judiciary system in the world keeps infants jailed for this long without a trial . ...

I think that children are being detained frequently now in order to silence protesters . The regime wants to warn protesters that it can do whatever it wants to anyone regardless of his/her age or type of activity the person performs at the time of arrest . ... Ali is not the first minor nor the last . There are still others in jail .

CNN : How is this story illustrative of what is happening in Bahrain ? Where do you see the situation in Bahrain going ?

Dhaif : The situation in Bahrain is unpredictable and chaotic just like all the arbitrary arrests and fabricated charges . The judiciary system is not independent . The charges are a reflection of what the regime wants to take place on the ground . The charges are politically biased , and in most cases , no solid evidence is present . ...

The situation is becoming more and more complicated especially now that activists and human rights defenders who were not arrested earlier are targeted now by the regime . An example is Nabeel Rajab , who is detained for bogus charges . The regime is escalating its revenge from its people amidst the silence of the international community .

Bahrain 's allies -LRB- Great Britain and the United States -RRB- do not want to interfere in what is taking place because Bahrain has been a good ally for them in the region .

The Gulf Cooperation Council countries -LRB- which besides Bahrain include Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -RRB- also can not allow Bahrain to have more democracy and freedom because it will pressure other countries to do the same , and they do not want that . So , basically Bahrain has not been forgotten ... but , in fact , it had been deliberately wiped out from the media coverage for political reasons .

CNN : What is next for Bahrain ? What steps can be taken to reach a resolution ?
