The devices are increasingly tied into our lives , and being without them can be a huge loss . They 're also not cheap , especially if you 're not eligible for a carrier-subsidized upgrade .

But between theft , water damage and our own clumsiness , accidents happen . Here are some stories of smartphone woes . Share your own in the comments .

The year 2008 was a different time -- there was not yet a Find My iPhone app to aid vigilante justice . That 's the year Jessica Jenkins , a 5-foot-1 broke grad student , splurged on and was quickly separated from an iPhone 3G .

While riding the 6 train in New York City late one night , Jenkins took out her new phone and started playing a maze game .

`` Normally I was careful to keep the phone out of sight while traveling , but it was late and I was bored and , like a little kid with a Gameboy , excited to play all these new games , '' said Jenkins .

Suddenly , a teenage boy about twice her size ran past , grabbed the phone out of her hands and dashed through the train door . Jenkins chased the thief full-speed and managed to grab him by the shoulder , but he got away with her phone .

When Jenkins called the NYPD , officers were more concerned about her physical well-being than the fate of her smartphone . Angry but unhurt , Jenkins took the subway home where she still had an old Nokia bar phone . She immediately reactivated and dropped $ 5 on Tetris for the `` dumb '' phone . -LRB- `` I am really , really good at cell phone Tetris . '' -RRB-

Drowning

Smartphones and water do not mix . But 70 % of our planet 's surface is covered with the stuff , so statistically they 're bound to meet .

Photo producer Amber saw not one but two of her iPhones die watery deaths , one glamorous and one in a toilet .

While working on a photo shoot in Bordeaux , France , she was -LRB- playfully -RRB- pushed into a pool with a smartphone still in her pocket . The phone was her primary way of communicating with everyone working on the shoot . She took it to the Apple store in Paris , but they could n't revive the phone . She ended up borrowing an older iPhone 3G to use the rest of the trip .

`` I 'm trying to pull it out before the phone is 100 % damaged , trying every tool known to man as fast as possible . The 1-year-old is jumping all excited at the show , screaming because she wants to play with me in the toilet , '' recalls Amber .

It did n't work . The phone stayed stuck until her husband came home eight hours later . Photos of the wee phone-destroyer 's first birthday party were all lost .

Amber was n't eligible for a new phone yet , so she had to pay full price for a new device . She also sprung for Apple Care and a $ 90 waterproof case .

Though it did n't work with Amber 's phones , sometimes a device can be revived after getting wet . One common remedy is to make sure the phone is off and submerge it in uncooked rice overnight , which will draw out the moisture .

Breaking

We 've all seem them , the people with cracked screens who still use their smartphones . Usually the cracks just create a little web over the screen , and the phones are still perfectly usable . But not all the time .

The damage was n't fatal . The phone still worked , but the glass was cracked and all but one section of the screen had gone black . Even black , the touch screen still worked . Amazingly , Balmer found a way to make the phone usable .

To read a text message , he would take a screenshot , go into the Photo Roll , and move the image around to read what it said . Unable to see the keyboard , he typed from memory . To make a call , he had to have a person 's number memorized . And to listen to music , he learned to navigate through his collection by memory .

While attempting to grapple with a screaming child and a car seat , Brian Buizer dropped his month-old Evo 4g smartphone , and its screen shattered . -LRB- If there is a theme here , it is that children are bad for the health of smartphones -RRB- . The company wanted to charge Buizer $ 150 to replace the screen on his $ 200 phone .

`` I am guessing this is from static build up . Whatever causes it , I now have a hazy white spot directly in the center of my screen , said Buizer . `` Needless to say , I ca n't wait for my new iPhone to arrive . ''

Tinkering

Finally , there are the people who bring on the damage themselves . The tinkerers , the geeks , the dreamers .

She decided to root her Evo phone -LRB- rooting is a way of getting total control of the operating system , bypassing pesky safeguards and limitations put in place by the company that made the phone -RRB- . She also put a custom ROM -- a standalone , customized version of the Android operating system -- onto the phone . She got the phone to work on a different carrier and was quite pleased with the results .
