New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There are days when Congress seems determined to earn its 12 % approval rating -- and that 14 Republican senators are threatening to filibuster any new gun legislation should make your blood boil if you still have a heart to pump it with .

Four months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School slaughter , the vast majority of Americans still support some sensible new gun laws , but the same legislation has been declared DOA by conservative senators .

In a democracy , the will of the people is supposed to have some sway .

And an astounding 91 % of Americans back universal background checks -- including 88 % of Republicans , according to a Quinnipiac poll . Reality check : 90 % of Americans do n't agree on the awesomeness of apple pie and vanilla ice cream . The disconnect between Congress and Main Street America has rarely been so stark .

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was hotly criticized by liberals for backing off this proposal , but he cited pragmatism -- the need to get 60 votes for passage .

The arguments would-be filibusterers such as Sens. Paul , Ted Cruz , Mike Lee , Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi are making sound as if they are principled -- if you do n't pay attention to the facts .

Here 's Enzi 's take : `` The measures proposed currently by the majority do not reduce crime , they simply restrict the American public 's constitutional right to self-defense . ... These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and proponents wo n't stop with these restrictions . ''

His statement is a combination of fictitious fear-mongering -LRB- `` These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights '' -RRB- and the dystopian slippery slope -LRB- `` and proponents wo n't stop with these restrictions . '' -RRB-

Let 's start with a reality check on the most predictable of the oppositional bumper stickers : the `` assault on Second Amendment . ''

Moreover , there exists the right to reasonable restrictions , such as the ban on machine guns that has existed in the USA since the 1930s and originally passed with NRA support . But do n't take my word for it -- listen to conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , who wrote in the landmark Heller Decision , which declared D.C. 's functional ban on handguns unconstitutional :

`` Like most rights , the Second Amendment right is not unlimited . It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose : For example , concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues .

`` The Court 's opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms . -LSB- United States v. -RSB- Miller 's holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those ` in common use at the time ' finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons . ''

Got that ? Unless gun advocates are going to start calling Scalia a RINO -LRB- Republican In Name Only -RRB- , there should be some room here for reasonable debate .

Why be afraid of an open debate and an up or down vote on this issue ?

Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani and John McCain have pointed out the counterproductive nature of this threatened filibuster , with McCain saying on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' : `` The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand . '' He added , sensibly : `` What are we afraid of ? ''

That 's a good question . And the answer is hiding in plain sight .

On Tuesday and Wednesday , parents who lost children in the Newtown massacre will be walking the halls of Congress , trying to appeal to the conscience of our legislators . It will be interesting to see whether their personal appeals will carry as much weight as the influence of gun lobbyists .

This issue is n't academic -- it is an urgent test of our elected representatives ' ability to be responsive to the public will and reason together .
