-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Tuesday , a man identified by authorities as Jimmy Lee Dykes boarded a school bus as it stopped to drop off children and demanded two students . Police say that when the bus driver , Charles Albert Poland , refused , Dykes -- who was arrested last month , accused of shooting at neighbors in a dispute over a speed bump -- shot Poland four times , killing him . As I 'm writing this , he is in a standoff with police , who say he 's holding someone 's 5-year-old boy hostage in his underground doomsday bunker .

That 's just one day in the life of America . ... I wonder what tomorrow will bring .

On Wednesday , the NFL announced that the Super Bowl pregame show will feature a performance of `` America the Beautiful '' by 26 students and faculty members from Sandy Hook Elementary School .

Even while the NFL announced its gesture , a gunman whom police identified as 70-year-old Arthur Harmon went inside a Phoenix office building and shot three people , one fatally .

And yet we continue to wait -- hoping tomorrow does n't bring more senseless shootings , more gunned-down babies , more pleas for change .

And Thomas Jefferson once said he `` never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever , in religion , in philosophy , in politics or in anything else where I was capable of thinking for myself . ''

I wonder how many more days will pass , how many more lives will be lost , before the people who claim to love our forefathers so much actually take heed of some of the words they said .

And yet we wait .
