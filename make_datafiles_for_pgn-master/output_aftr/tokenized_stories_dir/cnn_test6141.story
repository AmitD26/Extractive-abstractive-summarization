Of course , as I write this , mere moments after the blessed event , very little is known about the newest member of the House of Windsor .

Will the little prince have its mother 's good looks or its father 's good looks pre-baldness ? Where does it stand on the phone-hacking controversy ? Will he marry North West or Blue Ivy Carter ?

One thing 's for sure : The royal baby is going to have a wild life ahead of him . He 'll probably live for at least a century , if the genes are any indication . He will need to learn some valuable lessons .

Like the George R. R. Martin books that inspired it , Thrones is set in Westeros , which is basically England in the Middle Ages with more dragons and fewer magical swords .

Siblings , parents , uncles , even embarrassing cousins . Seriously , you have to spend the rest of your life with these people , and if you are n't careful , one of them might send their illegitimate magical shadow-baby to stab you in the back .

2 . When traveling , it 's always better if you can speak the local language .

Daenerys Targaryen â € '' aka Daenerys Stormborn , aka Khaleesi , aka Dragon Lady â € '' spends most of her days traveling from foreign city to foreign city .

What I 'm saying is , do n't forget about Canada , okay ?

4 . Do n't trust eunuchs .

Although they make excellent bodyguards .

5 . Do n't trust your friends .

They will betray you .

7 . Actually , do n't trust anyone .

8 . Winter is Coming .

Since you live in England , it 's pretty much always winter . Put on a coat !

Since you have no actual political power , the moral of this lesson is basically that you should carry a sword on you at all times .

Because something like this could happen .
