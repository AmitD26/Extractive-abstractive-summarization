-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Do you use a passcode to protect access to your smartphone ? And if so , do you do that consistently ? Every day , many smartphones get lost -- and found , not always by their owners . What happens with those missing devices ?

Symantec found that in the vast majority of cases -- more than 95 % -- the people who found these missing cell phones tried to access personal or sensitive information , or services such as online banking or e-mail .

Being honest does n't mean people wo n't snoop either . Even though about half of the finders made some attempt to return the lost phone -LRB- a contact e-mail and phone number for the `` owner '' was listed in the contacts app on each decoy phone -RRB- , the vast majority of these people also tried to access data on the phone .

`` We did get some nice e-mails from people who said they found the phone , sometimes expressing remorse for using it for a while , '' said Kevin Haley , Symantec 's director of security response . `` And some of them actually tried to arrange to return the phones . We were n't trying to research people 's motives and guilt -- that would be a project for a sociologist . But we did learn a lot about the kind of stuff people try to do with phones they find . ''

But even if you decide not to buy and install mobile security software , there are some basic steps you can take in advance to protect your phone .

Also , you could avoid storing passwords in your mobile apps . But that makes it tempting to use the same password for several services -- a significant security risk not just for your phone but online in general . You might try a password management service such as 1Password or KeePass -- just be aware that these services can get hacked .

If you do n't take these precautions and end up losing your phone , it 's a good idea to find a computer quickly and log on to your e-mail , online banking and other services that you access from your phone and change your passwords . Whoever has your phone could change your passwords and hijack your accounts .

If you ca n't find your phone , you might want to notify your carrier that it 's been lost , to shut down the service until you can get another phone . People who find or acquire your phone may use it to make a lot of international phone calls , running up your bill .

This happened to a friend of mine -- when she reported her lost smartphone , AT&T found that over two days it had been used to place dozens of lengthy calls to Yemen . -LRB- Fortunately it waived the bill ; she did n't have to pay for those calls . -RRB-

Losing your phone is n't the only risk to the data it contains . Some police departments are warning citizens that smartphone thefts are a growing trend . Often muggers or snatch-and-run phone thieves just try to sell stolen phones for cash -- but the people who buy them may try to access your data or services .
