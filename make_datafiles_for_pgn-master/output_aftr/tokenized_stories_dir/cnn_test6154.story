And this without still suspended forward Luis Suarez .

`` It 's about the team , not about individuals , and it 's showing on the field the dedication we 've put in on the training ground . ''

Sturridge reacted quickest to Daniel Agger 's headed flick off a corner kick in the fourth minute Sunday and Liverpool was mostly comfortable thereafter .

New keeper Simon Mignolet was indeed rarely tested despite United having most of the possession , with United striker Robin van Persie squandering his team 's top chance in the dying minutes .

While Liverpool has started the campaign strong , Manchester United fell to one win , one loss and one draw under new manager David Moyes .

`` I thought we played really well , '' Moyes was quoted as saying by the BBC . `` We had long periods of the game but could n't score . ''

The slow start will likely increase Moyes ' desire to land a new player or two ahead of Monday 's transfer deadline in England .

United has been quiet in the market in the off-season , thus far failing to lure midfielder Cesc Fabregas away from Barcelona . A bid for Everton pair Leighton Baines and Marouane Fellaini was also rejected .

`` We will keep working for what 's left of the window but I 've got to say I was really happy with the performance here , '' Moyes said . `` Maybe in the next few hours we will get a chance to do something but we could n't give you a heads-up on anything . ''

There was a minute 's applause for legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly on the eve of what would have been his 100th birthday and the atmosphere seemed to lift the home side .

Agger beat United defender Rio Ferdinand to the ball on the corner and then Sturridge poked it into the net with his head .

`` I just anticipated the header from Dan , '' said Sturridge .

Unable to create much going forward , United 's frustration grew and van Persie exchanged angry words with Steven Gerrard .

Mignolet was comfortable in keeping out Nani 's drive in the 77th minute and then van Persie shot wide -- with his right foot -- from a tight angle off Javier Hernandez 's through ball in the 87th .

Sturridge is n't the only hot striker in the Premier League .

Olivier Giroud matched him by scoring for the third straight time in the league and Arsenal blanked a Tottenham without Gareth Bale 1-0 at the Gunners ' Emirates Stadium .

Tottenham poured forward in a frantic finish , though could n't find an equalizer .

Spurs and Arsenal now have identical records in the league at two wins and a loss .

French striker Nicolas Anelka returned for West Brom after taking time off due to the death of his agent .
