-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forget policies . One thing guaranteed to get the electorate talking ahead of any vote is a steady stream of cringe-inducing moments , and on that front Australia 's federal election campaign has n't disappointed .

But he 's not the only one leaving voters squirming in their seats . Here are our top 10 moments of the Australian campaign trail , in no particular order .

1 . Abbott : Vote for me because my daughters are hot

Okay , he did n't actually say that but that 's what Coalition leader Abbott implied when he and current Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appeared on Australia 's version of reality hit `` Big Brother . '' -LRB- Yes , Big Brother still airs there and presumably has enough of an audience to convince both politicians that it was worth a shot at the youth vote . -RRB-

While Rudd reduced more than one housemate to tears with talk of love and gay marriage , Abbott shot from the hip with a comment -LRB- presumably aimed at the nation 's blokes given his views on gay marriage -RRB- : `` If you want to know who to vote for , I 'm the guy with the not bad looking daughters . ''

As commentator Nick Galvin noted : `` Adrift uneasily in the no man 's land between daggy and plain weird , Abbott looked strangely like Robert Palmer from the era when the late British singer surrounded himself with Amazonian beauties , because ... well ... he could . ''

-LRB- For the uninitiated , `` daggy '' means uncool , unfashionable , etc. -RRB-

2 . Getting hot and sweaty

`` A little body contact '' never hurt anyone , he told them after the girls apologized for being sweaty and crushing his suit during a photo call , according to national broadcaster the ABC .

Anyone with half an eye on the Australian election will have noticed a lot of debate and angst about what to do about asylum seekers who arrive in the country 's waters by boat .

When prompted to talk about the `` hot topic '' of asylum seekers , Scott said , `` Yes it 's a hot topic here because our traffic is overcrowded . How much fun is the M4 in peak hour ? It 's not fun , at all . ''

The M4 connects the inner-west with the outer suburbs of Sydney . Scott 's comment prompted a stream of tweets , including one which asked whether jams were caused by `` all those refugees towing their boats down the motorway . '' After the furor , Scott claimed her quotes had been taken out of context .

4 . Things that make you go ` ummmm '

In the days following , it seemed to become a sport for Australian journalists to track Diaz down and pitch the question to him again to see whether he 'd managed to commit them to memory . However , he was nowhere to be found .

`` I do n't oppose Islam as a country , but I do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in Australia , '' Banister told Seven News . She went on to confuse `` haram '' with the Quran and said Jews followed Jesus Christ .

A candidate for the fringe One Nation Party , 27-year-old Banister quit just 48 hours into her campaign . In a statement to the ABC , party leader Jim Savage said she 'd withdrawn `` following the disgraceful way she has been portrayed by recent media -LSB- and -RSB- ridicule over a minor gaffe . ''

6 . See ya . Candidates shown the door .

`` I was a young mayor and I got angry one night and I spoke to her in angry way , which I acknowledged then and I acknowledge now , '' Lake told local media .

Another nudged out of the race was North Queensland candidate Ken Robertson who called Abbott `` racist '' and `` a very , very bigoted person . '' It came days after Rudd called for a `` positive campaign . ''

7 . ` Be careful of Rupert '

Allegations of racism were n't the only ones flying around .

Mining magnate Clive Palmer , perhaps better known outside Australia for his ambitious plans to build a replica Titanic , shocked morning viewers by making some stunning accusations on live TV .

`` Rupert Murdoch 's wife Wendi Deng is a Chinese spy , '' Palmer said . `` She 's been spying on Rupert for years , giving money back to Chinese intelligence . ''

Palmer is standing for a Senate seat as leader of his own party , the Palmer United Party . Polls show the party could possibly win one seat .

It must be hard to entertain oneself while hiding from authorities in a foreign embassy for months on end .

That 's the only reason we can think why WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange thought it was a good idea to don a fake mullet and sing his own version of John Farnham 's classic Aussie hit `` You 're the voice . '' -LRB- For those unfamiliar with the terminology , `` mullet '' refers to a type of hairstyle , not the fish -RRB- .

Assange is attempting to win an Australian Senate seat for his WikiLeaks Party , despite the surprise resignation of his running mate Leslie Cannold -- who quit due to a lack of transparency and accountability , of all things .

9 . Slipper recycles

The former speaker could be forgiven for wanting to avoid any more cameras . He was hauled over the coals and through the courts after being accused of sexually harassing a male colleague .

A federal court judge eventually threw out the case last December , saying that he 'd come to the conclusion the claims were made to cause Slipper `` significant , public , reputational and political damage . ''
