LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week 's Champions League semi-finals are poised to offer a feast of the world 's best strikers .

The storming return to form for Chelsea 's Didier Drogba has certainly pushed his case as the best in the game .

Drogba 's Chelsea face Barcelona in their Champions League semi-final -- a match that pits him against Barcelona 's potent attacking triumvirate of Samuel Eto'o , Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi .

Eto'o makes a compelling case for himself as the best in the business this season . Having scored 27 league goals to be La Liga 's top scorer , the Cameroon striker is in great form and pushing Barca towards the league title .

Wayne Rooney will once again be crucial to United if they are to retain their European crown . The England striker has been a huge threat this season for both club and country , whether deployed as a striker or pushed out wide .

Arsenal may be out of the running for England 's domestic title , but Emmanuel Adebayor and the injured Robin van Persie have fired the Gunners into the last four in Europe 's premier club competition . Indeed Adebayor 's stunning equalizer against Villarreal in Spain is a contender for goal of the season .

Outside of this week 's matches in Europe there are still some players who are worthy of consideration .

Liverpool 's Fernando Torres is undoubtedly one of the best in the game , while it 's also tough to look past the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who has helped Jose Mourinho 's Inter Milan top Italy 's Serie A for much of the season .
