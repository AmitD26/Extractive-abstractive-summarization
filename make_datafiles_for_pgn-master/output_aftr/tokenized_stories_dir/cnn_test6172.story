Rumors of Maduro 's birthplace surfaced before he was elected in April , but in recent weeks they have gained new life .

In the Venezuelan version of the birther movement , its proponents say Maduro was born in neighboring Colombia and is either a Colombian citizen or a dual citizen , either of which would make him ineligible to be president .

The leaders of the movement have taken their complaint to Venezuela 's Supreme Court , to Colombian authorities and even to the European Union .

The claim is controversial in Venezuela .

The president has not addressed the question directly , but on several occasions said during speeches that he was born in Caracas . The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to CNN 's calls for comment .

`` This is an international problem , '' Pablo Medina , a member of the opposition Patriotic Assembly , told CNN en EspaÃ ± ol .

Medina presented a letter to the European Union asking them to scrutinize Maduro 's nationality and take a position on the matter .

This week , three lawyers asked the country 's highest court to order Maduro to reveal where he was born , and what his parents ' nationality is .

The birthers in the United States are considered a fringe group , and it 's unclear how seriously Venezuelans consider the accusations against Maduro .

`` I sincerely regret these rotten , ill-intentioned campaigns , which make us think about what would have happened if this country was in the hands of people who only act to destroy the dignity and reputation of others , '' wrote pro-Maduro columnist Casto Gil Rivera in the pro-government newspaper Correo del Orinoco .

Rivera wrote that he has known Maduro since he was a child -- in Caracas .

The fact that Maduro 's birth record has not been located in either Venezuela or Colombia allows the doubts to persist .

Medina says his group has sought Maduro 's birth record in the place where he says he was born , but found nothing .

But no birth records for Maduro have turned up in Colombia , either .

A Colombian newspaper and radio outlet investigated allegations that the president 's has Colombian roots in Cucuta , a town on the border with Venezuela , and found residents who had memories of Maduro as a child there .

However , both media investigations turned up no evidence that Maduro was born in Colombia . There is no record of anyone with that name having been born in Cucuta , RCN Radio reported .

He said he was not aware of the way the birther movement is viewed in the United States .
