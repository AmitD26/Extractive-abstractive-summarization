Should Roger Federer win the French Open his prize will be less in U.S. dollars than what Rafael Nadal won in 2008

Right across the four Grand Slam events -- the Australian Open , U.S. Open , Wimbledon and French Open -- comparative prize pools have been affected by volatile exchange rates , largely caused by the recession .

Organizers of the 2009 tournament increased the prize to $ 2 million Australian dollars -- which is today about U.S. $ 1.55 m . The value of the tournament in pounds has soared from £ 614,500 to £ 981,200 , and in Euros the winner would today receive 1.11 million -- up from 822,600 at the 2008 tournament .

The pound has taken a hammering in the last year , and as a result the French Open winner 's prize is now worth £ 135,000 more in Britain than it was in 2008 . Should Switzerland 's Roger Federer manage to win the tournament , he may be wise to take the money to Britain and hope the exchange rate improves . Of course , he would still be 60,000 euros better off in Europe , too .

`` I think there are many subtle influences of the downturn and the exchange rate is one of those . ''

Chadwick said volatile exchange rates are unlikely to cause players to turn away from tournaments like Wimbledon as it has a huge prize pool and great history , but , for smaller tournaments it is `` a real issue . ''

`` With prize money you are trying to attract the best players , and if the prize money pots are reduced ... it really does undermine the appeal of those competitions , '' he said .
