-LRB- CNN -RRB- It 's true that Bali 's beaches , rice paddies , volcanoes and temples lure the crowds .

Those seeking serenity , however , should n't be put off -- the island offers a smattering of under-the-radar destinations where life ambles along at a more sedate pace .

Balian

West Bali 's Balian beach has long been popular with intrepid surfers , with the beach offering multiple breaks .

While it 's not really swimmer-friendly , it 's great for long contemplative walks and rummaging for flotsam and jetsam .

At nearby Soka , a temple plays host to a massive cave full of bats that emerge at sunset .

Accommodation at Balian is mostly targeted toward surfers but some family-friendly as well as upper-end places are available .

Expect a mix of surfer fare and local food at the guesthouses .

Sidemen

Sidemen is a great spot to rent a pushbike or join a small group tour to coast downhill via a route with fantastic views .

Amed

Truth be told , Amed has long been on the map for tourists seeking to elude Bali 's crazy south , but the series of looping bays along the coast of east Bali retains a charming washed-out feel -- like a spot that enjoyed a long-passed heyday and now has a rather slightly sleepy European feel .

The appeal here is solid off-the-beach snorkeling and diving in several of the bays , including the Japanese wreck at Banyuning .

You can base yourself at Amed to snorkel the liberty wreck at Tulamben , too .

Or , hire a boatman to take you out to see the sunrise over Lombok 's highest peak , Gunung Rinjani .

Bali is n't all beaches , cocktails and tropical weather .

After driving through the winding scenic roads in north Bali , through forest-clad mountains , you 'll reach the little out-of-the-way village of Munduk , where the air is so crisp you can forget about air-conditioning .

Maps available at hotels highlight an array of low-key walks , including several impressive waterfalls that are easy to reach on foot .

A cluster of three islands lie about 20 kilometers to the east , easily reachable by public boat or speedboat : Nusa Lembongan , which is popular with expatriates , tiny Nusa Ceningan and the largest of them all , stunning Nusa Penida .

The island is geographically similar to Bali 's Bukit Peninsula and , thanks to its relative remoteness , was a prison during the early 18th century .

While the diving here is excellent -- manta rays and mola molas when conditions are right -- you 'll also be rewarded by renting a motorbike to go exploring on the relatively barren island , where you can skirt spectacular cliffs soaring hundreds of meters high .

Best to get here soon : a luxury Chedi hotel is slated to open at Crystal Bay in 2015 .

West Bali National Park

Northwest Bali is home to a national park with excellent snorkeling and diving at Menjangan Island , and is the last refuge of the endangered Bali starling .

Travelers can base themselves at Pemuteran , located outside the park , though those on a larger budget can try the Menjangan Resort within the park .
