-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is compelling evidence that the economic security of women and their families is more fragile today than ever .

These disparities persist for many reasons .

Too many women face financial pressures simply because of outdated policies and a `` Mad Men '' view of the world that constrain opportunities for women 's full participation in our economy . Our country 's policies simply do not reflect the way families live today , with both parents in the workforce and more single-parent households than ever . A second income is no longer a luxury ; it is a necessity .

This week , House Democrats announced an economic agenda for America 's women and families .

It recognizes a simple fact : When women succeed , America succeeds . It reflects the same spirit advanced 165 years ago at the first Women 's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls , New York , where American women began their quest for equal rights and equal opportunity .

We must enact paycheck fairness legislation to ensure women get paid what they deserve and put more money in the pockets of working women and their families . We must expand access to job training and education assistance so that working women can obtain better-paying jobs in the future . We must do more to support women-owned businesses and nurture entrepreneurship by providing more access to capital .

Given this reality , we need policies that allow a better work and family balance for all workers , not just a select few at the top of the income ladder . The Democrats ' agenda increases access to paid sick leave , expanding the Family Medical Leave Act and protecting pregnant workers and new mothers so that they ca n't be fired or demoted .

That 's why we must increase access to affordable , quality child care . One key step forward should be to provide all low - and moderate-income 4-year-olds with access to high-quality preschool , as proposed by President Barack Obama .

Congress must also take steps to support early Head Start and child care partnerships and expand existing child and child care tax credits .

Our pro-family agenda will help strengthen the middle class , grow our economy and provide a brighter future for the next generation .

Democrats have long led the way to address the health and economic security of women and families -- from the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the Lilly Ledbetter Act to our continued fight to strengthen and protect Social Security and Medicare . Our women and families economic agenda is the next step in our mission to expand opportunity for all Americans .
