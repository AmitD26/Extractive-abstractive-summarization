Caen , France -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` See what I 'll miss ? ''

Princess Haya has been ambushed . The 40-year-old leader of one of the Olympics ' biggest sports finds herself fending off British paradressage rider Lee Pearson .

Pearson wears around his neck the three gold medals he has won at the World Equestrian Games in Caen , Normandy .

This is what the princess will miss when , in December , she reaches the end of her two terms leading the FEI , which governs world horse sport .

`` She 's brought inclusion from many countries that thought equestrianism was kind of elitist , '' says the 10-time Paralympic champion .

`` She 's kept us in the Olympics by making sure London was such a success , and she 's modernized it . We 're not riders , we 're athletes . ''

Her Royal Highness Princess Haya of Jordan carried her country 's flag at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games , where she competed as a showjumper at the age of 26 .

By 2006 , he had become the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and she had been elected to lead the FEI .

Since then , much of her role has been to ensure equestrian keeps its place at sport 's top table .

Like wrestling , equestrianism claims roots extending back to the original Olympics contested by the ancient Greeks .

Hence , when wrestling had a scare last year -- being temporarily voted off the program for Tokyo 2020 , before reinstatement at a later International Olympic Committee -LRB- IOC -RRB- meeting -- there may have been grounds for concern at the FEI .

`` I believe there were very specific issues around the decision for wrestling , '' says Haya .

`` That spirit of competition , that commercially cluttered landscape really does exist . The international federations compete for their place at the Games just as much as the athletes do , and you have to guarantee that you really do have top sport . ''

Haya points to the World Equestrian Games -LRB- WEG -RRB- as evidence that the FEI is doing its job . The latest edition of the quadrennial event boasted more than a thousand horses and riders , from 74 countries . The FEI claims more than half a billion people saw at least some action from the eight competing disciplines .

All of that will be taken to the table by Haya 's successor -- six candidates have come forward -- the next time the IOC calls on its constituent sports to fight for their future .

Haya believes the IOC is most likely to look at removing one discipline from a large sport in order to accommodate a new , smaller sport in Tokyo and beyond . She thinks the FEI 's battle lies in protecting its three Olympic disciplines of dressage , showjumping and eventing .

Not that the Olympic disciplines have always dominated Haya 's eight years at the FEI 's helm .

Endurance racing , a lower-profile form of equestrian sport immensely popular in the Middle East , has provided the biggest threat to her presidency .

The sport , in which horses can race a hundred miles in a day , has been troubled by a succession of doping scandals and concerns over animal welfare given the immense distance involved .

Haya 's position was called into question when her husband -- an endurance racing champion , an influential horse breeder and also the ruler of Dubai -- received a six-month doping ban in 2009 . She has since been accused of failing to vigorously pursue perceived shortcomings in the discipline 's approach to the wellbeing of horses .

Haya , who handed oversight of endurance sport to colleagues over the conflict of interest involving her husband , says the issues are now being `` managed very well '' by the FEI .

`` The sport has mainly come under criticism -- or the FEI has -- because it has n't moved fast enough , '' she admits . `` But on the other side of that , there are processes and procedures put in place for a good reason .

`` You ca n't have a knee-jerk reaction . You have to go through a period of dialogue and examine the situation from every side . They have been strong enough to do that and I think they 've done everything they can to protect the horses , and the integrity of the sport . ''

`` For me it was easy . I had my career as an athlete , I rode in an Olympic Games , then I had interaction with the national federations . I understood how it worked , and I went through a pathway .

`` There 's a big difference between a person who merits doing the job and happens to be a woman , and one who gets the job just because she is . ''

She , however , has already promised herself more time for two other interests in her life .
