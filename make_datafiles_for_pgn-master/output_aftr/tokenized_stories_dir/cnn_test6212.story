1 . Drone strikes largely target the leaders of terrorist groups that threaten the United States .

In fact , of the thousands who have been killed in CIA drone strikes in Pakistan , only 37 were leaders of al Qaeda or affiliated organizations , according to a tally by the New America Foundation . And even if we add to that list the leaders of the Taliban who have been killed in drone strikes , only 2 % of the victims of the CIA strikes in Pakistan have been militant leaders .

Obama 's top counterterrorism adviser and now CIA Director John Brennan said in a speech last year that `` in order to prevent terrorist attacks on the United States and to save American lives -- the United States government conducts targeted strikes against specific al Qaeda terrorists . ''

That 's only partly true , because the CIA has also has occasionally conducted `` signature strikes '' against groups of men who display a particular behavioral `` signature '' that indicates they may be militants . In these cases , the targeter does not know the identity of the persons in the drone cross hairs .

3 . Drone strikes kill a lot of civilians .

In 2012 , 2 % of the drones ' victims were characterized as civilians in news reports and 9 % were described in a manner that made it ambiguous whether they were militants or civilians .

4 . The United States has no reason to worry about the legal framework governing drone strikes because it is so dominant in drone technology .

In February , a Chinese state-run newspaper reported that the Chinese government had contemplated deploying an armed drone in a remote , mountainous area to kill a drug lord , but decided instead to capture him .

Emmerson also pointed out that the rapid proliferation of drone technology means whatever legal framework the United States puts together to justify its targeted killing campaign `` has to be a framework that we can live with if it is being used by Iran when it is deploying drones against Iranian dissidents hiding inside the territory of Syria or Turkey or Iraq . '' A sobering and instructive thought .

5 . The Pakistani government gives a wink and a nod to the drone program , providing tacit approval for its continuation .

It is true that Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf quietly agreed to allow the CIA 's targeted killing campaign to begin in 2004 . But the program has become deeply controversial and unpopular in Pakistan because of the perception that it kills many civilians and that it erodes Pakistan 's national sovereignty .

In April 2012 , the Pakistani parliament voted unanimously to rescind any previous permission that had been granted by the government for the CIA to conduct the targeted killing program .

The next Pakistani prime minister , Nawaz Sharif , who was elected on May 11 with a clear mandate , has urged an end to the drone strikes , telling reporters , `` Drones indeed are challenging our sovereignty . Of course we have taken this matter up very seriously . I think this is a very serious issue , and our concern must be understood properly . ''

6 . Obama is soft on terrorists .

Even if you take the most conservative estimate of the numbers of people the Obama administration has killed in drone strikes in Pakistan , 1,600 , that is around twice the total number of prisoners that Bush sent to Guantanamo .

7 . Many of the Guantanamo detainees who have been released return to the battlefield .

The U.S. government claims that 27 % of those released from Guantanamo are suspected or confirmed to have taken up arms . For security reasons the government has n't released the names of these men since 2009 , but a review of the public record suggests that number is quite inflated .

According to a review by the New America Foundation of news articles , Pentagon reports , and other relevant documents , of the 603 detainees who have been released from the prison , only 17 individuals -LRB- 2.8 % -RRB- are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens , while 21 individuals -LRB- 3.5 % -RRB- are suspected of engaging in such activities .

Some undoubtedly are , such as the operational commander of 9/11 , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed . But contrary to the fulminations of officials such as Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina -- who said last year that Guantanamo detainees are `` crazy bastards that want to kill us all '' -- half of the men still held at the prison camp were cleared for release three years ago by a task force of Department of Justice and Pentagon officials .

To be exact , 86 of the 166 men still imprisoned at Guantanamo were either found to be guilty of nothing , or were low-level fighters who could be repatriated subject to some continued monitoring by their home country 's government .

9 . There are no benefits for the U.S. to release additional prisoners from Guantanamo .

Obama correctly said of Guantanamo in April , `` It is expensive . It is inefficient . It hurts us in terms of our international standing . It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts . It is a recruitment tool for extremists . It needs to be closed . ''

The prisoners at Guantanamo have also featured frequently in jihadist propaganda , making it a recruitment tool for would-be al Qaeda members .

The 27-year-old soldier has been in captivity since the Taliban seized him on June 30 , 2009 .
