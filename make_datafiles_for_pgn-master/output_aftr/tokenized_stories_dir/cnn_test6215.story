The Moto X is scheduled to hit the market by the end of the year . It 's the first new phone to be designed entirely under the ownership of Google , which bought Motorola Mobility last year .

Dennis Woodside , CEO of Motorola Mobility , announced the news Wednesday at the D11 tech conference being hosted by AllThingsD , the tech-news site .

The phone is packed with new features that can anticipate users ' needs such as `` when to fire up the camera , '' Woodside said . For example , sensors in the phone will let it know when it 's being pulled out of someone 's pocket , he said .

The phone will also adjust its settings if it 's traveling at high speeds in a car , he said .

`` The device will know , whether it 's on or off , it 's traveling at 60 miles per hour . It 's going to act differently so you can interact with it safely , '' Woodside said .

Woodside hinted that the Moto X would go on sale this fall and be priced below competing phones such as the IPhone 5 .
