Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China remained tight-lipped Thursday about its stance on NSA leaker Edward Snowden , who is believed to be holed up in a safe house somewhere in the semiautonomous territory of Hong Kong .

Snowden provided fresh fuel Wednesday for the controversy he has sparked , telling a Hong Kong newspaper that U.S. intelligence agents have been hacking networks around the world for years , including hundreds of computers in China .

His presence in the southern Chinese territory , which has a separate system of government from the mainland , has raised questions about how an effort by the U.S. government to extradite him would unfold and what role Beijing might play in the process .

Snowden , 29 , has rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community by providing documents to journalists revealing the existence of secret programs to collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and the Internet activity of overseas residents .

Differing reactions

U.S. security officials homed in on Snowden after Britain 's Guardian newspaper informed the Obama administration that it was planning to publish articles based on documents it had obtained , a U.S. official said . Authorities then quickly tried to determine who might have access to such information , as well as what documents were downloaded and by whom .

There are `` no signs or indications '' that Snowden had accomplices or tried to sell secrets , this official said . Investigators think the leaker is still in Hong Kong and have a general sense of where he is in that Asian metropolis .

The Snowden story has also so far failed to make big waves among China 's tens of millions of highly active social media users .

In recent years , the Global Times newspaper said in an editorial , `` the United States has always claimed itself to be a victim of Chinese hacking activities . Many speculate that it 's a cover up for hacking activities conducted by the U.S. government . Now , Snowden 's revelation proves that such activities have already been going on for a long time . ''

Among some 61,000 reported targets of the National Security Agency , Snowden told the Hong Kong newspaper , are hundreds of computers in China .

U.S. officials have increasingly accused China of being the source of thousands of attacks on U.S. military and commercial networks . Beijing has denied such attacks .

The claims came just days after U.S. President Barack Obama pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to address cyberattacks emanating from China that Obama described as `` direct theft of United States property . ''

Snowden 's allegations appear to give weight to claims by some Chinese government officials that the country has been a victim of similar hacking efforts coming from the United States .

His claims came as Gen. Keith Alexander , the National Security Agency chief , testified at a U.S. Senate hearing that the country 's cyberinfrastructure , including telephones and computer networks , is somewhat vulnerable to attack .

On a scale of one to 10 , `` our critical infrastructure 's preparedness to withstand a destructive cyberattack is about a three , based on my experience , '' he said .

In the South China Morning Post interview -- published one week after the Guardian revealed the first leaks attributed to Snowden -- he said the agency he once worked for as a contractor typically targets high-bandwidth data lines that connect Internet nodes around the world .

A `` backbone '' is part of the inner workings of a computer network that links different parts of that network . It is used to deliver data from one part of the network to another and , as such , could expose data from multiple computers if hacked .

` Trying to bully '

FBI Director Robert Mueller offered a similar assessment in testimony before Congress on Thursday .

Snowden has n't been charged , but he has told The Guardian that he expects the United States to try to prosecute him . He worked for the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton until Monday , when he was fired after outing himself as the leaker .

Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he felt U.S. officials were pressuring his family and also accused them of `` trying to bully '' Hong Kong into extraditing him to prevent the release of more damaging information .

`` My intention is to ask the courts and people of Hong Kong to decide my fate , '' the South China Morning Post quoted Snowden as saying . `` I have been given no reason to doubt your system . ''

But Hong Kong lawmaker Regina Ip , a former secretary of security for the territory , said Tuesday that while any extradition process could take months , Snowden is n't necessarily beyond the reach of the United States .

Legal experts says that Beijing can get involved in the process to extradite a person from Hong Kong if the case significantly affects defense or foreign affairs .

But some observers say that Chinese authorities are unlikely to want to rock the boat in this instance .

`` Given the somewhat fraught Hong Kong-Beijing relationship , the political impact of Beijing interference in this Hong Kong legal matter could be grave , '' the Beijing-based analyst and blogger , Bill Bishop , wrote in an article for USA Today .

`` People who think I made a mistake in picking Hong Kong as a location misunderstand my intentions , '' the newspaper quoted him as saying . `` I am not here to hide from justice ; I am here to reveal criminality . ''

Asked during a media briefing Wednesday for comment on Snowden 's latest claims , U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki declined . She said she had not seen the latest South China Morning Post report .
