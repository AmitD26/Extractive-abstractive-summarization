`` The death toll has hit 11 people , including three attackers and five security personnel , while the rest were civilians , '' said Gen. Mohamed Yusuf Omar Madale , a Somali police spokesman .

Police official Yusuf Ali said Wednesday that the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel , and the second blast came as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured .

At the time of the Mogadishu blasts , there were several senior members of the Somali government inside the hotel . It is believed the injured guards were part of the government officials ' security detail .

Somali Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed condemned the attack Wednesday night .

Last month , another bombing at a hotel in the capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded , a government spokesman said .

Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali , the Somali government 's former acting envoy to Britain better known as `` Dhub , '' said Abdirahman Omar Osman , a presidential representative .

A U.S. military drone strike in southern Somalia in late October killed two suspected Al-Shabaab members , U.S. officials said . And a recent joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces killed at least 30 people believed to be part of that group .

In September 2012 , Somalia 's new president , Hassan Sheikh Mohamud , escaped an apparent assassination attempt at the Jazeera Palace Hotel , just two days after being selected as the troubled country 's new leader .

According to a presidential media officer and several journalists at the scene , early indications are that the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers who set off explosives at the gates of the hotel , where the president was having high-level meetings .

At least four Somali government soldiers and one African Union soldier were killed in that attack , according to journalists at the scene .
