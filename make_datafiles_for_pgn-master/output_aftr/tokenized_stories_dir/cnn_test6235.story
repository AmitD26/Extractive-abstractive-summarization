Investigators of the crime reported at the time that the heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force . Marijuana was spread over the bodies in a `` symbolic gesture , '' and several thousand dollars in cash was found at the scene .

A sister of one of the victims told CNN that she has been recently contacted by investigators in the case .

`` She 's meeting with them next week , '' said CNN 's Ashleigh Banfield . `` Investigators on that case are meeting with her and have been speaking with her since Saturday . Not only that , she confirms to me that the same detectives are still on that case and that they are detectives that she has spoken with in the past . ''

But the sister said she hopes the new interest will lead to her brother 's case being solved .
