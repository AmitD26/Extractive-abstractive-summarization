`` In light of recent concerns , Trisha has decided to remove the February 22 date from her upcoming tour plans , '' the country singer 's representative told CNN Thursday . The news quickly lit up Twitter .

`` We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign , '' SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN after Cheap Trick canceled Wednesday .
