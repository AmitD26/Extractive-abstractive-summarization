-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Dominican Republic was the first country to give aid to Haiti in the aftermath of Tuesday 's devastating earthquake . Some of the first video images of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince came from a Dominican television crew .

Some tensions still exist between citizens of both countries . Dominicans recall how they were under Haitian rule for a period in the mid-1800s , and how they repeatedly fought Haitian aggressions . Today , Haitians provide cheap labor in the Dominican Republic , a trend that has caused resentment on both sides , not unlike the illegal immigration debate in the United States .

Dominican Public Works Minister Victor Diaz Rua surveyed the damage in Port-au-Prince Wednesday as his country planned the necessary logistics to provide international aid . Are you there ? Submit an iReport

`` The center of the city , where the presidential palace collapsed , is practically completely destroyed , '' Diaz Rua told CNN en Espa√±ol , noting he saw hotels , schools and hospitals that were damaged .

Diaz Rua also saw few emergency teams working .

`` We 're going to send teams from the Dominican Republic to help with the rescue . We 're going to send food , water and mobile clinics , '' he said .

Such cooperation was not historically the case .

Haiti , a former French colony , and the Dominican Republic , with roots as a Spanish colony , have tensions that go back to those days , Sagas said .

The current tragedy appears to push those tensions further into the past .

Among the aid are 10 mobile cafeterias that can produce 100,000 meals a day , and heavy equipment to remove debris , Diaz Rua said .
