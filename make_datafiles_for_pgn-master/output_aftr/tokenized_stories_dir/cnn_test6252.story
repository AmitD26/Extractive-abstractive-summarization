Culture Minister Habib al-Amin told reporters at a late-night news conference that government forces skirmished with rebels in speedboats as the ship left port Monday morning . The rebels were pushed back and government troops boarded the ship , which is loaded with what the United States said is `` illicitly obtained oil . ''

The rebels , meanwhile , told Libyan television that they still were in charge of the tanker and it was still docked at the port .

While the ship was flagged in North Korea , it is unclear who actually owns the vessel .

Tripoli had entrusted militia leader Ibrahim Jadran to safeguard some crucial oil ports . But eight months ago , he and his men seized them , blocked oil exports , and demanded more autonomy and shared revenues for his eastern region .

Meet the man holding Libya 's oil hostage

`` We used to be part of that government until the corruption became so visible , and the government started to sell oil without measuring units , and ... we became certain that such a government is not credible and unable to rebuild the state , '' Jadran , 32 , told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour in January . `` That 's why we declared independence of our province and we started to seek our fair rights . ''

The government has said the disrupted oil production , from the seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities , is costing the country $ 130 million a day .

The oil at the center of the current As-Sidra port situation belongs to Libya 's National Oil Corporation and its partners , which U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki notes includes U.S. companies . She said taking the oil amounted to theft from the Libyan people .

`` Any oil sales without authorization from these parties places purchasers at risk of exposure to civil liability , penalties and other possible sanctions , '' Psaki said .

Libya 's government has threatened force against ships that entered the rebel-controlled oil ports before on several occasions . But despite ultimatums to such ships , those deadlines came and went with no action from Libyan officials .

CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh reported from Libya and CNN 's Steve Almasy reported and wrote from Atlanta . CNN 's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .
