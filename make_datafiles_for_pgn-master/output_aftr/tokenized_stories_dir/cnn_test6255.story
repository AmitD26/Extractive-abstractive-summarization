Her body was recovered from the rubble Thursday night , police said , but identification took longer because her family had to travel from Japan to confirm her identity .

The other seven victims have been identified as Carmen Tanco , 67 ; Alexis `` Jordy '' Salas , 22 ; Griselde Camacho , 44 ; Rosaura Hernandez , 21 ; Andreas Panagopoulos , 43 ; George Ameado , 44 ; and Rosaura Barrios , 44 .

Julie Bolcer , spokeswoman for the city 's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner , said the victims died of smoke inhalation or physical trauma .

Meanwhile , a lawsuit has been filed in state Supreme Court in the name of Michelle Nelson , 46 , who said she was injured in the blast .

The complaint alleges that electric provider Con Edison was aware of potentially unsafe conditions of gas mains on the property and neglected to act .

The lawsuit also names Kaoru Murmatsu , owner and superintendent of the building .
