Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Viktor Yanukovych defended his government 's handling of the political crisis in Ukraine on Thursday , saying that it had `` fulfilled all its obligations '' and that opposition leaders were stoking people 's anger for their own gain .

The opposition `` continues to escalate the situation '' and to encourage people to maintain their protests in the icy streets , he said in an address posted on his website .

Yanukovych insisted the government had lived up to `` concrete agreements '' reached with the opposition to try to end the crisis . `` The government has fulfilled all its obligations under these agreements , including the adoption of the Law on Amnesty that guarantees freedom and liberation of persons arrested during the conflict , '' he said .

He also appealed to Ukrainians to `` do everything for peace and normal life '' and said he regrets `` the young people -LRB- who have -RRB- died in this confrontation . ''

Earlier , Yanukovych 's office said the President was out on sick leave after an `` acute respiratory disease accompanied by fever . ''

The country 's Parliament approved the amnesty bill for anti-government protesters in an extraordinary session Wednesday .

For the amnesty to come into effect , protesters must vacate seized government buildings and unblock streets and squares , `` except those where peaceful protest actions are taking place , '' the law says , according to the state-run Ukrinform news agency .

A billboard above the square , which has been at the heart of anti-government protests since November , registered -16 Celsius -LRB- 3 Fahrenheit -RRB- Thursday afternoon , with -23 Celsius -LRB- -9 Fahrenheit -RRB- forecast for the evening -- the coldest weather since the protests began .

Arseniy Yatsenyuk , head of the opposition Fatherland Party , warned late Wednesday that fresh violence could erupt if authorities try to clear out protesters .

Klitschko : People want real change

`` People took to the streets because they want to change the situation , '' Klitschko said . `` A statement , ` We will free people , if they go home ' is unacceptable . It can not be understood . ''

Klitschko has called for Yanukovych to resign and said his departure from power would be `` a logical step . ''

After a special session held Tuesday and Wednesday , Parliament wo n't reconvene until next Tuesday . The opposition has n't yet announced its next move .

Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his Cabinet resigned Tuesday , hours before Parliament annulled draconian anti-protest laws that sparked violent confrontations between police and demonstrators .

Europe 's concern

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on Thursday voiced its `` deep concern '' about the situation in Ukraine .

A resolution adopted by the body said the government 's resignation and the repeal of the protest laws were `` a first step '' toward resolving the crisis , which should be followed up `` by both authorities and opposition with further concrete steps to resolve the crisis peacefully and democratically . ''

Sanctions could be imposed against Ukraine `` if grave human rights violations continue , or if the Maidan protest were to be broken up by force , '' it said . Such sanctions could include a suspension of voting rights .

Those responsible must be held accountable , it said .

The assembly also raised concern about violence directed at police by extreme right-wing protesters .

Merkel calls Kiev , Moscow

`` Now it is a matter of following through on the agreements , including amnesty , and continue ongoing dialogue . It should not come to renewed violence . ''

Merkel also spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin , her office said . A readout of that call said she urged Putin to `` push for constructive and results-oriented dialogue between the government and the opposition . ''
