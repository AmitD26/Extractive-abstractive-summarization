A record 29,000 visitors came to check out the three-day exhibition -- the most in the fair 's 15-year global history .

Affordable Art Hong Kong , a spinoff of the original event launched in London in 1999 , attracts art enthusiasts from all walks -- and wallets -- of life , with original works on sale from unknowns and well-knowns at the more than 120 galleries represented from around the world .

A section on Hong Kong 's young artists appealed to local tastes , while an `` Under HK$ 10,000 Wall '' catered to the art collector on a tighter budget .

`` This is an area where people can come and find works that are about HK$ 1,000 to HK$ 10,000 -LRB- US$ 130 - $ 1,300 -RRB- , '' said Camilla Hewitson , fair director .

`` If there 's something that really inspires , then you can find the gallery and have a discussion about that particular artwork . ''

` The purpose is to democratize art '

So is affordable art really that affordable ?

For many Hong Kong residents , the answer is no .

But of course , it 's all relative .

Organizers of Affordable Art Fair say price is just a small part of their mission .

`` People are very intimidated by the idea of going to galleries and each city we go to we help to break down those perceived barriers and get people understanding that there 's art out there that they can afford -- and that art can be for everyone , '' he adds .

Based on the fair 's success in Asia so far , organizers say they are now looking to expand into South Korea , Japan and Taiwan in coming years .
