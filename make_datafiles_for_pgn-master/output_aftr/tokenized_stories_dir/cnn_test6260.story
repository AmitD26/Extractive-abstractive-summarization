But we have to admit , Mars rocked the house -LRB- or rather stadium -RRB- and his obvious joy at performing for what was basically almost the entire world was pretty infectious .

For those not familiar with Mars , he 's pretty awesome . Here are just a few things to love about the guy :

1 -RRB- He was a baby Elvis

2 -RRB- He 's a return to the singer-songwriter

Mars does n't just belt out the tunes , Mars also writes them . While struggling to be discovered as a singer , he got his start in the industry writing and producing hit songs for other artists , including Travie McCoy 's `` Billionaire , '' Flo Rida 's hit `` Right Round , '' and K'Naan 's `` Wavin ' Flag , '' which became the theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup .

3 -RRB- He 's really good at impressions

His turn on `` Saturday Night Live '' may not have gotten as much attention as , say , Justin Timberlake 's , but there was no denying Mars was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at Pandora who has to imitate several artists -- including Green Day , Michael Jackson , Steven Tyler and Justin Bieber -- when the power goes out .

He 's a whole lot of talent packed into a little frame . Mars is reportedly 5-foot-5 .

5 -RRB- He can always find the bright spot -- even when being arrested

6 -RRB- He really is as cute as a Monchhichi

We hooted when fans started pointing out the cropped-haired resemblance to the Monchhichi doll , made popular in the 1980s . But there is no denying either the similarity or the utter cuteness of both .

They may want to start listening .
