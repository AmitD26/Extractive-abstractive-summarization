North Korea fired the rocket Tuesday at 4:17 p.m. without giving any navigational warning , Kim Min-Seok , a spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry , said Wednesday .

Seven minutes later , a China Southern Airlines plane carrying 220 passengers from Japan 's Narita airport to Shenyang in China passed through the rocket 's trajectory , he said .

South Korea has informed Chinese authorities about what happened , the Defense Ministry said .

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman , Qin Gang , said Thursday that the plane flew through North Korean airspace `` normally on that day without incident . ''

Officials from China Southern Airlines did n't respond to calls seeking comment Thursday .

The rocket in question was one of seven fired Tuesday by North Korea into the sea off its east coast , according to South Korean authorities .

Given the speeds the plane and rocket were traveling at , the seven-minute gap means there was still `` quite a big distance '' between them , said Greg Waldron , Asia managing editor at Flightglobal , an aviation and aerospace website .

North Korea missile capabilities

`` It is justifiable self-defense behavior for us to conduct these military exercises in order to preserve peace in the region and to protect the safety of our people and our country , '' the North 's Korean People 's Army said in a statement carried by state media .

The military 's statement did n't make any mention of South Korea 's comments about the Chinese plane , but it said its recent launches had n't affected `` international navigational order . ''

The North 's launches have taken place as U.S. and South Korean troops conduct annual military exercises in the region . The large-scale drills anger North Korea , which says it views them as a rehearsal for an invasion .

South Korea has said the launches -- short-range and aimed in a northeasterly direction out to sea -- are intentional provocations .

The U.S. State Department said Monday that launches of the Scuds violate U.N. Security Council resolutions .

`` We urge North Korea to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions , and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said .

Those comments appeared to have irritated North Korea 's military .

`` The U.S. and its supporters are calling our actions provocation , but they should not talk about provocation when they do n't know what provocation is , '' the North 's military statement said . `` Provocation is when somebody has intent to hurt somebody else , but what we are doing is to protect ourselves , our country , our land , our people . ''

It threatened the possibility of the launch of a more powerful rocket .

North Korea launches missiles into sea

Calmer than last year

The North 's verbal attack Wednesday did n't reach the ominous levels of its saber rattling this time last year , which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea .

`` Unannounced missile tests are not a good thing , but their political and military significance depends on context , '' Stephan Haggard , a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , wrote in a blog post Tuesday .

North Korea conducted or threatened test launches during a similar period last year , soon after it had drawn international condemnation for launching a long-range rocket and carrying out its third nuclear test .

South Korea on Wednesday said it was proposing new talks between the two sides next week to discuss the possibility of further reunions . But North Korea rejected the proposal , the South Korean Unification Ministry said Thursday .
