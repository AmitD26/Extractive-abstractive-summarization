Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hong Kong newspaper editor Kevin Lau , who became the center of controversy last month after being sacked from his post , is fighting for his life after being stabbed multiple times by an unknown attacker in Hong Kong , police say .

Lau , who was walking to his car at the time of the attack early Wednesday , was left bleeding with life-threatening injuries to a lung , his wife told journalists . Lau was taken to the city 's Eastern Hospital .

The assailant escaped after jumping onto a motorcycle that was being driven by another man , police say .

` Outraged '

`` No journalist should be subject to violence , '' she told CNN . `` I have known Kevin for 30 years and I can not think of any reason why anyone would try to kill him . ''

The attack on Lau comes in the wake of Sunday 's demonstration by thousands of Hong Kongers protesting what they see as rapidly escalating efforts by China 's Communist Party to control Hong Kong 's media .

Wednesday 's incident is not the first example of a physical attack on Hong Kong 's media . Last June , knife-wielding arsonists threatened workers and burnt 20,000 copies of the Apple Daily , another Hong Kong newspaper critical of the government .

The Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong released a statement Wednesday . `` The growing number of attacks against members of the press in Hong Kong needs to be taken seriously by the local administration , '' the document said .

French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom in 2014 -- a far cry from its 18th place ranking in 2002 , when its surveys were first conducted .
