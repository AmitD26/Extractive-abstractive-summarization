Kathmandu , Nepal -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nepal has banned women under the age of 30 from working in Persian Gulf nations amid increasing concerns over abuse and exploitation .

Nepalese women are among thousands of Asians who travel to the Middle East in search of employment . They often arrive willingly , but subsequently face conditions that the U.S. State Department says is indicative of forced labor -- the withholding of passports , restrictions on movement , nonpayment of wages for work up to 20 hours a day , threats , deprivation of food and sleep , and physical or sexual abuse .

The age bar is aimed at preventing some of the abuse , Raj Kishore Yadav , Nepal 's minister of information and communication , said Thursday . He said the hope is that the risks are lower with more mature women .

The Nepalese government says 58,000 Nepalese women are working in these Gulf states -- Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar , United Arab Emirates and Oman . However , human rights agencies estimate that number at about 200,000 , saying that the official figure does not take into account all those who have traveled illegally , many through India .

She said the priority should be not to set limits but to work to improve working conditions and local justice systems .

`` Instead of a blanket ban on its own women that denies them important employment opportunities , Nepal 's government should work with other labor-sending governments to demand stronger protections for migrant workers in the Gulf , '' Varia said .

Migrant worker advocate Manju Gurung agreed .

`` This is a protectionist approach , '' she said . `` The government should negotiate with destination countries and have bilateral agreements . There is a demand for women workers . ''

About 2.5 million Nepalese who work abroad , other than in India , contribute 21.4 % of the Nepal 's GDP , according to the government . Remittances from the Gulf play a huge role in the Himalayan nation , where about 30 % of the people are unemployed .
