* A slight but potentially important uptick in President Barack Obama 's approval rating . Gallup 's daily tracking poll had this key midterm barometer at 45 percent on Friday , a near 2014 high and up from 39 percent in early February . -LRB- President George W. Bush had a 38 percent approval rating in November 2006 -- his second term midterm election -- and Democrats gained 30 House seats -RRB- .

Plus , Democratic-leaning SuperPACS are beginning to spend more money , and in a few notable cases testing a new strategy of punching directly back at the source of millions of dollars in conservative spending that helped turn the early 2014 climate decidedly in favor of the GOP .

Not that Democrats should be popping -- or even ordering -- champagne . To be clear , top party strategists still expect to lose seats in both the House and the Senate . The goal , though , is to keep the House losses to single digits and to deny Republicans the net gain of six seats the GOP needs to take control of the Senate .

The principal driver of midterm election seasons is the President 's approval rating ; the closer the incumbent gets to 50 percent , the better Democrats feel about avoiding a November bloodbath .

And any President benefits when people feel better about the economy , which is where the new jobs report , and the immediate debate about its meaning , comes in .

The 192,000 new jobs was a bit below the consensus estimates , so Republicans were quick to label it not good enough .

`` Our economy still is n't creating jobs for the American people at the rate they were promised , '' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement .

Democrats , however , focused on the trend line .

Turning the health care political tide is tougher , but one Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg argues must become a strategic imperative .

As noted recently in an analysis produced by the GOP polling firm Public Opinion Strategies , opponents of the health care law are more likely to cite it as a major factor in their 2014 voting decisions . That `` intensity gap '' is the major source of GOP midterm optimism .

`` When the debate is between implementing or repealing the -LRB- Affordable Care Act -RRB- , the intensity shifts towards implementing the law , '' the veteran Democratic pollster says . `` So it is possible that Democrats will be able to turn the debate . ''

It was n't all that long ago that veteran Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall was contemplating retirement . Now , though , the West Virginia congressman is in the middle of an experiment Democrats hope helps them minimize their midterm losses .

Translation : the Koch brothers , the conservative megadonors whose spending spree has Democratic candidates across the country on their heels . Now , Democratic leaning groups are fighting back by making the Koch 's an issue -- labeling them a rich special interest group trying to get the best Congress money can buy .

In addition to West Virginia , the House Majority PAC is running ads attacking the Koch brothers in Arizona 's 2nd Congressional District , where Democratic Rep. Ron Barber faces a tough reelection climate .

Already the Koch brothers were an issue in several Senate campaigns , again as Democratic-leaning groups try to improve an election climate in which the early spending by the Koch 's , primarily through an organization called Americans for Prosperity , has improved GOP prospects .

Koch Brothers target another Democratic senator

It 's a somewhat risky strategy -- using precious advertising resources to attack someone not on the ballot .

Rep. Steve Israel , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , said the Koch 's heavy spending and the frequent national media attention it receives makes them a legitimate target .

`` The Koch brothers are becoming their own brand , '' Israel said in a conversation this week .

Democratic strategist Paul Begala concurs -- and drew a parallel to his 2012 work for a pro-Obama SuperPAC .

`` Nobody had heard of Bain Capital either , until we told them about it , '' Begala said . `` Of course the Democrats are wise to tell voters about the controversial billionaires . ... What did Mama say to you when someone said something hateful ? ` Consider the source , ' '' he said .

Years ago , Castellanos says one of his favorite ad targets was George Meany , then the AFL-CIO leader .

`` Beat the hell out of him , '' Castellanos said . `` Problem is , he was n't on the ballot . Democrats won . ''

To Castellanos , the direct aim at the Koch brothers proves `` the Democrat Party today is exhausted . It 's a tactical party , trying to eke out victories on Demographics and negative assaults . ''

More broadly , the Democratic bottom line can be summed up this way : the year is still likely to be rough , but that the terrain in early April looks a bit less treacherous than it did in early March .
