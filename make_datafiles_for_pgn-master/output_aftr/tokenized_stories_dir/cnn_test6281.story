`` Well most Americans are bitter and hateful toward anyone and anything more successful than themselves , '' one commenter wrote on that story .

`` Just me or anyone else really hoping for Facebook stock to take a nose dive and never come back up ? I want to watch it drop like a rock , '' one Twitter user wrote on the eve of Facebook 's initial public offering Thursday .

Here 's a rant from one financial analyst , spotted by Time.com , which shares a parent company with CNN and authored a recent post called `` Sick of hearing about Facebook ? You 're not alone . ''

`` But do I really need to see another article about how the Ferrari dealers in Silicon Valley have brought in extra inventory in anticipation of all the new millionaires ? Or how Menlo Park and Palo Alto housing prices , which were already sky-high , are soaring even higher from all the new money ? '' the analyst , Tracey Ryniec , wrote .

`` I ca n't wait for this week to be over so we can talk about some other companies . ''

Some of the venom online was directed at the Winklevoss twins , those rowing-happy Harvard kids who repeatedly have been suing for part of Facebook .

Dubbed `` the Winklevii '' in the film `` The Social Network , '' Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are set to make millions off of Facebook 's IPO despite the fact that some courts have rejected their claims that Zuckerberg stole their idea for his blockbuster website . They could make $ 228 million for their 6 million shares in the company , according to a CNNMoney gallery on Facebook 's new billionaires .

At The New Yorker , Silvia Killingsworth writes that we all should give the Winklevii a bit of a break -- especially since they 've been good sports about their anti-fame :

`` Sure , the Winklevii may sound a little cheesy finishing each other 's sentences -- a well-enunciated mix of locker-room pep talk and well-worn entrepreneurial Web-2.0 jargon -- and they will be subject to Al Gore-style Internet-invention jokes until the end of time . But who 'd have known they 'd be such good sportsmen about it ? In the movie , Cameron gets frustrated at one point and hollers . ` Screw it ! Let 's gut the frigging nerd ! ' In real life , the twins seem to have become entirely content with chasing the nerd around the courts , and collecting their cut of the biggest tech I.P.O. in history . ''

Others are teasing CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself .

The comedian Andy Borowitz posted a fake letter from the 28-year-old to potential investors . It opens :

`` For years , you 've wasted your time on Facebook . Now here 's your chance to waste your money on it , too . ''

It ends like this :

According to The New York Times , Facebook 's new billionaires may spend their money in subtle -LRB- but still over-the-top -RRB- ways . On Thursday , the paper looked at spending culture in Silicon Valley , finding that the really rich types spend money in ways that are difficult to detect without a rich-person radar :

Others used the opportunity to gripe about Facebook 's privacy settings , which are notoriously complicated -LRB- perhaps since the company wants info to be public -RRB- :

`` Why is Facebook going public ? They could n't figure out the privacy settings either , '' wrote one Twitter user .

`` I 'm happy for Facebook , Zuck and others put in their own time efforts and own capital they deserve this reward , '' another Twitter pundit said . `` American Dream ! ''

Some people will see this post and say , `` Yeah , yeah yeah . Haters gon na hate . ''

`` Facebook 's mission is ` making the world more open and connected . ' Sometimes that means making people uncomfortable at first . You do n't have to agree with how Mark Zuckerberg does things , and you can hate if you want to . But remember , Facebook 's just the messenger . The message is the future . ''
