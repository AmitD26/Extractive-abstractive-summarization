-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jimmy Fallon left us with great memories after five years on `` Late Night , '' but the pressure was on for his first time hosting `` The Tonight Show '' on Monday .

Yet at the end of the hour , we were left with a `` Tonight Show '' that offered both surprising moments and big laughs , although it might 've included a lot more than we 'll see on an average night , since it was Fallon 's first show .

Fallon was a hit online as well , with tweet after tweet praising his performance , even from Jay Leno fans :

If you missed the premiere or want to relive some of the best moments , here are our five favorite scenes from Fallon 's first `` Tonight Show . ''

Right away , it was clear that several of Fallon 's `` Late Night '' staples were n't going anywhere , including his occasional `` Evolution of Dancing '' sketches .

Fallon 's first guest , Smith , helped him during an `` Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing '' sketch , with both performers wearing '90s - style overalls and gamely showing off a number of hip-hop moves like the `` Running Man , '' `` Kid N Play '' and -- of course -- `` the Carlton . ''

2 . A family affair

Fallon 's dad , whom he jokingly referenced in his final `` Late Night '' episode as being disappointed in him , showed up along with the 39-year-old comedian 's mom . Seeing his parents in the audience was a sweet moment for a guy who probably only dreamed he might ever host `` The Tonight Show '' as a kid . It was a nice way to start the show before getting into the typical monologue jokes .

3 . The parade of cameos

The next thing you know , Robert De Niro -LRB- Fallon 's first `` Late Night '' guest -RRB- showed up with a $ 100 bill . Then Tina Fey followed with yet another $ 100 bill .

Finally , Stephen Colbert arrived with $ 100 in pennies , took a selfie and announced `` Welcome to 11:30 , b *** h ! ''

It was a jaw-dropping moment to say the least , and we have to say we agree with this viewer :

All of these moments show how Fallon is planning to make `` The Tonight Show '' his own , but none presented his perspective quite like having U2 perform on the roof of the Rockefeller Center . The band set up came even before Smith was officially brought out as the night 's guest .

The sunset above the New York skyline during U2 's performance looked beautiful , and it made for an original and unexpected moment .

Yep , U2 was so awesome on Fallon 's `` Tonight '' that the band is taking up two moments on this list .

On Monday night , U2 did just that , performing the Oscar-nominated `` Ordinary Love '' for the audience in a memorable , fitting end to the very first `` Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon . ''
