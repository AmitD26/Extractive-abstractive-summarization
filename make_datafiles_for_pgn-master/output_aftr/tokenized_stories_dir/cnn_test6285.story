-- Additional training for communications , White House scheduling and advance staff ;

The updated procedures are expected to be adopted immediately in the hopes of avoiding another leak .

The official 's name was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan last month .

It 's common for such lists to be given to the media , but the names of intelligence officials are rarely provided . In this case , the individual 's name was listed next to the title , `` Chief of Station . ''

A station chief heads the CIA 's office in a foreign country , establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities .

The identities of station chiefs , like most CIA officers , are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly .
