From the first time you step into eastern Congo , you find yourself surrounded by the exotic and extraordinary , be it flora and fauna or the just plain incongruous -- the severed wing of a Russian aircraft stored on the side of the road , or a boy with a gun .

The place is pulsating with the heat and energy of a population of people fighting to survive just one more day . But the violence here is as intense as this intoxicating , heady mix of Africa at its best and worst .

Eastern Congo has been called the `` rape capital of the world '' by U.N. Special Representative Margot Wallstrom . Reports record that 48 women are raped every hour . I have been working in the region for 10 years and have seen a tragic development in this unpunished crime against the heart of society .

It was the height of the war and I was with a returning team from the medical NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- . They had pulled out because of the regular attacks on the town , but had decided it was safe to bring their team of three back : there was such a need for medical help here .

As the plane taxied its way precariously down the grass airstrip , we knew we were waving goodbye to the only escape route we had . I was there for a week .

A week hearing terrifying stories of torture and rape . Multiple rapes . Violent , brutal rape . Rape with sticks and guns , even bayonets .

The war continued until 2003 , when a peace treaty was signed . Officially , the fighting came to an end , but it did n't stop . Nor did the rape .

Women told me how they expected to be raped . Not once but many times . The women I met , spoke of gang rapes , three or four times . Sometimes it was `` only '' two soldiers , more often gangs of men ,10 , 20 , over and over again .

Rape has now become generational .

The nurse saw me playing with her said : `` You know she 's HIV-positive . '' She was just three years old . Her twin sister had been killed when she and her mother had been raped . This little girl had been conceived from rape .

Not least one particular woman , Masika Katsuva . She 's tiny , barely five foot tall but is a giant of a personality . Her story has inspired many of us , it is so bleak but also hopeful because she 's providing an answer to these women .

Like so many women survivors , she too was rejected when she and her two teenage daughters were raped by militia men . Her husband was murdered in front of her , chopped up and she was forced to eat his private parts .

She has created a community in an area that is not regularly attacked , providing support to anyone who wants it , and she uses a farm to bring them together .

That field is their hope , their therapy and their source of food and income . They come to this refuge as victims , punished by the violation of rape , blamed and rejected by their families and the local community .

Masika tries to dream of a better future , but she 's also realistic . She wants her women to be able to stop doing manual labor in the fields and learn skills like sewing . But for that to happen , she believes , the fighting and the rape must stop .

She looks me in the eye , and with a sigh , says : `` But I do n't see either the rape or the fighting ending today . ''
