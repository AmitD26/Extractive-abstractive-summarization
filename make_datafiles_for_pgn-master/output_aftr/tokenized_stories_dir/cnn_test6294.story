-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If a blue-eyed , chisel-cheeked mugshot can make an Internet sensation of a criminal suspect , can the law be far behind ?

San Francisco Police Officer Chris Kohrs -- the `` Hot Cop of Castro '' to his fans and friends -- became a viral sensation after a stranger created a Facebook page in his honor , nicknaming him after Castro Street , where Kohrs was posted at the time . The Facebook page has received close to 19,000 likes in about three weeks .

`` I was out there one day doing traffic control and some guys asked if they could have photos of me and I consented . It kind of went viral from there , '' the 36-year-old Kohrs said in a phone interview with CNN .

Kohrs ' Facebook page creator Nathan Tatterson told CNN it all started with his friend 's photo of Kohrs sitting on his motorcycle .

Kohrs , who has been on the police force for six years , said it was `` all a shock '' to him .

`` I 've never met the person that created the Facebook page . I 'm not even on Facebook , '' he said laughing .

In his case , Kohrs sees an unintended , broader benefit of the online publicity for one cop on the street . `` It has strengthened the bond between the community and the police , '' he says .

`` We are called upon to respond to some pretty bad situations and although we ca n't reverse what has been done , we can make a bad situation better . We can make the city a better place to live , and I think police officers have a big impact on the health and safety of the community , '' he said .

Straight , single , no kids , he said .

And for the record : Kohrs enjoys dining out , watching movies , snowboarding , riding motorcycles , traveling and water skiing .
