-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health care experts recently gathered at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta to discuss the public health crisis of hepatitis C , which is ravaging communities across America , and the budding hope that we may soon be able to eliminate it with a prescription medicine called Sovaldi .

At $ 1,000 per pill , Sovaldi costs $ 84,000 for a single course of treatment , and well over $ 100,000 when combined with other medications , as is generally the case . If every person with hepatitis C were treated with Sovaldi alone at this price , the cost would be more than $ 268 billion . For some perspective , consider that in 2012 , the United States spent $ 263 billion for all prescription drugs .

High-priced drugs are not a new phenomenon . Drug makers have long used monopolies to inflate prices . But the trend with so-called specialty drugs is a game changer . Startling as the price of Sovaldi is , it 's just the canary in the coal mine .

Until now , policymakers and stakeholders have looked the other way as specialty drug prices have gone higher and higher . In fact , any discussion of price has been quashed as an assault on innovation .

But asking for a blank check in the name of innovation wo n't work anymore . Not when it stands in the way of solving a public health crisis . Not when it threatens state Medicaid budgets and the success of Medicare Part D , and not when the pricing threatens the very innovation that is giving so many hope .

Opinion : Hepatitis drugs save money in long run

We can not have sustainable medical innovation in America without prices that the health care system can sustain . Just think , could we have eradicated polio or smallpox if the treatments were priced like hepatitis C ?

Today 's public health challenge is to find a balance that rewards research and development and brings breakthroughs to patients , without upending family budgets , employer benefit systems and crucial public programs . That 's going to require an end to the sky 's - the-limit pricing that threatens the progress we all want .
