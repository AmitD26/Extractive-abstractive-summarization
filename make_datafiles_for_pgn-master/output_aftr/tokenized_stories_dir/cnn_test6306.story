Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It might remind you of the new smash-hit James Bond movie `` Skyfall '' , in which the villains steal a device with top secret information on the identities of British agents .

Law enforcement and congressional sources tell CNN a contractor working for the U.S. Secret Service accidentally left a pouch containing two computer backup tapes on a train in Washington 's Metrorail subway system .

The tapes contained very sensitive Secret Service personnel and investigative information , and if accessed could be highly damaging , according to sources .

According to one source , the tapes have not been recovered .

The incident occurred nearly five years ago , in February 2008 . It is now the subject of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security 's Office of Inspector General , according to a congressional source .

That office would not comment on why the investigation is taking place now , or on any other aspect of the investigation .

O'Neill is the agent who took down Robert Hanssen , an FBI official who spied for the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and 1990s .

The Secret Service says no lives were put at risk , and no fraud was committed as a result of the loss .

But why would the agency put sensitive information on a removable set of tapes ?

`` Part of the reason , I think ... is that in 2008 when this occurred , some of the information might have been on removable discs because that 's how they transported information , '' O'Neill told CNN . `` We 've leapt forward in technology since then . ''

O'Neill , a partner at the security firm The Georgetown Group , says even if they were , `` this is 2008 encryption . And years later , our abilities to break encryption , our algorithms to do that , are much , much better . If those tapes were found , I 'm sure they could be cracked in moments . ''

O'Neill has his own questions about the incident .

Asked those questions by CNN , a Secret Service official did not answer directly , but instead referred to part of the agency 's statement saying , `` Subsequent to this incident the Secret Service instituted protocols to prevent this from happening again . ''
