-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As rockets and missiles fly across the Israeli-Gaza border , CNN 's Ben Wedeman describes the mood on the ground in Gaza .

Is there a mood for war in Gaza ?

Most Gazans would like to see an immediate return to peace . They 're frustrated that since 2006 when Hamas won elections and took over , Gaza has been under siege . It 's very difficult to leave here ... it 's very difficult to earn a living , therefore few people are supporting this flare-up .

Are people supportive of Hamas ?

What is the attitude towards Israel ?

There is a deep sense of loss , of dispossession which is particularly intense in times of conflict .

One man told me today `` I hope they bomb the Knesset , '' referring to the militants firing rockets . Another outside a house in Khan Yunis that had just been struck by a missile that left seven dead told me `` the Israelis have been killing us since I can remember . And they will continue to kill us after I die . ''

Are there dissenting voices critical of Hamas in Gaza ?

Obviously there are few dissenting voices in public ; privately there are many . The only real opposition to Hamas is Fatah , but that faction that is dominant only in the West Bank , not in Gaza .

Why has this flare-up happened now ? Is it about more than just the tit-for-tat killings of the Israeli and Palestinian teenagers ?

In the aftermath of the Israeli teenagers kidnapping on June 12 , Israeli officials made it clear they were operating in the West Bank and elsewhere on a two-track approach . On the one hand they wanted to find the boys and catch the kidnappers ; on the other they were cracking down on Hamas . That 's certainly set the tone .

But you have go back to April 1 when Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas announced there would be a unity or reconciliation pact between Fatah and Hamas .

The pact had much to do with Israel 's decision to stop negotiating with the Palestinians in U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry 's Middle East peace initiative . And so the rhetoric coming out of Israel against Hamas and the unity pact has been intensifying since April 1 , and redoubling since the June 12 kidnapping of the Israeli teenagers .

Is the situation affected by the unrest in Iraq , Syria and Egypt ?

Some Israeli government and military officials in government are worried that the unrest elsewhere could impact the situation in the West Bank in particular . They understand the West Bank is unstable : you 've seen clashes in Gaza , clashes in Palestinian-Israeli cities in northern Israel . They are aware that instability outside Israel could be mirrored by instability within Israel and the territories it controls .

It 's grim . Most stores are closed , and that may be a function of Ramadan , or it may be a function of the grim state of the economy since the upheaval in Egypt last year .

So the economic situation being what it is , people are absolutely exhausted by the constant hammering of problems , crises , wars , clashes , upheavals .

The situation is getting worse . There 's no sign that Israel 's siege of Gaza , as they call it , is easing . Israel continues to maintain a strict control of what enters and leaves Gaza in terms of products , medicines and people . Egypt also has a tight grip on that border , and often the border is closed for weeks on end . Air and missile strikes are getting worse .

Many people are dependent on the United Nations , which provides a lot of relief supplies , in one way or another . If you 're lucky you can get a job with the Hamas-led government , with the police or the bureaucracy . There are people engaged in farming and light industry . But jobs are few are far between .

What 's likely to happen next ?

We 've heard from the Israeli defense ministry that the operation is likely to last for several days at least , so I think we can expect more of the same .

Israel says it has two objectives in this mission , which they call `` Operation Protective Edge . '' One is to stop the rocket fire on Israel , and the second is to strike at Hamas .

But Hamas is not just a military organization : it is a political organization ; it is the government in Gaza . It runs schools , hospitals and clinics , so what does it mean to strike at Hamas . In the past Israel has talked about destroying Hamas , which no one in Gaza thinks is a reasonable or realistic goal .

It 's not altogether clear . In the past Egypt had some sway with Hamas , but this is n't necessarily still the case . The Egyptian Prime Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is extremely hostile to Hamas , which is the Palestinian off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood , which he has mercilessly cracked down on . So he wo n't be shedding any tears seeing Hamas taking a beating in Gaza .

The U.S. considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization , and to the best of my knowledge , does not talk to it . And therefore there seems to be no intermediary involved trying to defuse this situation .

The Turkish government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has good relations with Hamas , and decent relations with the U.S. , and that 's one of the powers that could become involved . But as of yet there 's no sign of this happening .
