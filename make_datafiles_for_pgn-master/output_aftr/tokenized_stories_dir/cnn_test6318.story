-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A year ago , Sony and Microsoft were kicking off their new next-generation video game consoles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo -LRB- E3 -RRB- in Los Angeles , California . This year , the event will be all about the games , as developers show what they can do with that new technology .

Some game companies have already shown glimpses of the power of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with recent releases like `` InFamous : Second Son , '' `` Titanfall , '' and `` Watch _ Dogs . '' E3 2014 promises to showcase even more creativity , flair , and dynamic gameplay with a look at upcoming titles arriving in the next year and beyond .

Even Nintendo will be making a splash with its eye toward boosting sales of its own `` next-gen '' console , the Wii U . The company chose not to hold a traditional press conference in 2013 , and has opted again for a digital event and smaller , more intimate meetings .

Sony

With Sony leading the sales pack with the introduction of its PlayStation 4 console , they will be looking to hold their lead and offer more titles to keep fans interested . They also will be showing off more about their latest hardware project , Morpheus -- a virtual reality headset that undoubtedly will be integrated into some of their own titles .

While Sony has n't pushed as much on the music and movie front as their competition , it would be a surprise if PlayStation Now , their new streaming service , did n't get prominently mentioned . With a new PS4 console/PS Vita handheld console bundle recently announced , cross-play and Vita titles will likely be part of every demonstration .

Microsoft

Unbundling the Kinect hands-free controller from the console , along with a price cut , garnered mixed reaction from the public , so expect Microsoft to explain why it was a good idea and how it will influence the user experience .

A `` Halo 5 : Guardians '' presentation will surely get everyone 's blood pumping and a new title , `` Sunset Overdrive , '' should excite fans with its colorful and quirky gameplay .

Will there be more exclusive title announcements ? Likely , but how many will move consoles is the real question . Microsoft has been aggressive in pushing the Xbox One as an all-in-one entertainment center , so do n't be surprised by more content partnerships to be showcased .

The company is banking on new games to help get more Wii U 's into homes . `` Mario Kart 8 '' and a new `` Super Smash Bros. '' game will help . There are also rumors of a new `` Zelda '' game for the Wii U and a major new title for the handheld 3DS console .

Hopefully , they will also give more details about a series of figurine-based games , similar to `` Disney Infinity '' or `` Skylanders . '' Called the Nintendo Figurine Platform , a demonstration in May showed a Mario figurine being used with different games on the same platform . Can you imagine the demand for Mario-based figurines ?

PCs

More games

Third-party game developers will also be showcasing their talent with promises for this year and next .

Warner Bros. . Entertainment just announced a new `` Mortal Kombat X '' title , which should get some play at E3 , as well as more about `` Batman : Arkham Knight . '' Both of those games are likely to be available in 2015 .

`` Civilization : Beyond Earth '' from 2KGames , `` The Evil Within '' and `` Battlecry '' from Bethesda Softworks , and `` Destiny , '' a Bungie-produced title from Activision are all expected to be shown with more video , more explosions , and more excitement for the fans . Plenty of other third-party developers will be announcing titles throughout the three-day event .
