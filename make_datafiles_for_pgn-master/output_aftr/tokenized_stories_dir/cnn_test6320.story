-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There were goals , there was choreographed dancing , there were moments of great footballing beauty , but Colombia -- one of the teams to excite most at this thrilling World Cup finals -- is going home after Friday 's quarterfinal defeat at the hands of Brazil in Fortaleza .

The home fans ' jubilation was dampened , however , by an injury to Brazil 's star striker Neymar , who was stretchered off in what seemed like considerable pain in the game 's closing moments and will miss the rest of the tournament .

The result marks the first time Brazil has reached the semifinal stage since winning the title in Japan and South Korea in 2002 , and sets up an intriguing clash against Germany on Tuesday -- a repeat of that year 's final .

`` I think Neymar wo n't be able to play , '' coach Luiz Felipe Scolari told reporters after the game , before the team 's doctor revealed the 22-year-old forward had a fractured vertebra from being kneed in the back by Colombia 's Juan Zuniga .

Germany overcame France in the day 's earlier quarterfinal in Rio de Janeiro thanks to an early goal from defender Mats Hummels .

Silva opened the scoring after seven minutes , tucking home a Neymar corner with his knee , and the Paris Saint-Germain star was then in thick of it once more at the other end moments later , blocking a shot from Juan Cuadrado .

But a yellow card midway through the second half means he will be suspended and miss the semifinal .

On at least four occasions the Monaco star was subject to the stray boot of Brazil 's midfield enforcer Fernandinho .

Still , the home team continued to have the better chances .

Hulk and Fred came close with a snap-shot that Colombia keeper David Ospina palmed away and a header that flashed over respectively .

It was a remarkable strike that dipped and swerved as it arrowed into the top corner of the net .

There seemed no way back for Colombia now . But `` Los Cafeteros '' were handed a lifeline with 12 minutes to go after goalkeeper Julio Cesar scythed down substitute Carlos Bacca .

All of a sudden , the game was back on . Colombia pressed and threw caution to the wind with Yepes playing as an auxiliary striker .

But when one final corner kick delivery drifted beyond Cesar 's goal in the 95th minute there was time left for little else .

Scolari 's side has now overcome the barrier that has proved too high at the last two World Cup tournaments .

However , Brazil has not yet looked like a team certain to become world champion for a record-extending sixth time -- as its demanding public expects -- despite having world-class talents like Neymar , Silva and Oscar .

Yet somehow they find themselves only a game away from next Sunday 's final .

Stuttering performances and the occasional stroke of good fortune against Croatia and Mexico in the group stages and once more against Chile has hardly inspired confidence in `` A Selecao . ''

Much was also made in the Brazilian media of 2002 's winning coach Scolari -- a man who prides himself on being a father figure to his players -- bringing in a psychologist to speak to his team after many broke down in tears during the national anthems and once again after the dramatic penalty kicks victory over Chile .

Was this team soft and mentally weak ? Are the expectations of 200 million football-mad Brazilians proving oppressive and too much to bear ?

`` Big Phil '' truculently replied earlier this week that journalists who did n't like his methods could `` go to hell . ''

The men in yellow were nothing if not committed , controlled and tactically astute , biting into tackles and closing down with an intensity that ruffled their opponents .

Several gestured towards the crowd throughout the contest to increase the noise and crank up the pressure .

Jose Pekerman 's team has played with a style and confidence throughout the tournament that has been a joy to watch for neutral observers .

The delight the entire squad takes in their choreographed dancing celebrations , meanwhile , speaks to the relaxed vibe created by the coach , previously a World Cup quarterfinalist with his native Argentina in 2006 .

Thankfully , those dark days are largely gone and Colombian hopes will be high when the campaign for Russia 2018 begins .
