`` Sgt. Bergdahl has had a close brush with death over a prolonged period of time . He understands that his life has been saved . He 's grateful to President Obama for doing that , '' Bergdahl 's attorney , Eugene Fidell , told CNN 's `` New Day . ''

Bergdahl , released by the Taliban six weeks ago , recently retained Fidell amid the Army 's investigation into the circumstances of his disappearance and capture in Afghanistan in June 2009 .

The 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of militants after he disappeared . He was released in late May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military .

Fidell said Bergdahl has `` gone through an extraordinary ordeal '' and `` lost five years in the most unspeakable way . ''

`` The mind boggles when thinking about spending five years in the hands of the Taliban , '' Fidell said . `` Imagine your worst nightmare . That 's all I can say on that .

`` Obviously the hope is that he can return to a normal life , and ... reintegrate properly within American society as well as the Army , and sort of get on with his life . ''

Fidell said he could n't say much more about his conversations with Bergdahl , citing attorney-client privilege .

Fidell declined to answer CNN 's question about Bergdahl 's intent .

Bergdahl spent his first day of regular duty working at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas on Monday , the Army said .

Like many soldiers at a new assignment , he spent much of his day getting paperwork straightened out , Army spokesman Don Manuszewski said .

Bergdahl lives on base , in a two-bedroom unit in noncommissioned officers ' quarters .

Two soldiers are helping him adjust to life at Fort Sam Houston .

Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured , and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while he was in captivity .
