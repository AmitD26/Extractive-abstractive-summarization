American Muslims complain of their second-class status by pointing out that their religion and houses of worship can be attacked with near impunity . When they do object , they are told that this kind of abuse is a small price to pay for living in a free society . Yet it is blatantly clear that only Islam is being attacked in such a crass fashion . It is virtually unimaginable to hear of any other ethnic or religious group being so targeted without an uproar .

The conundrum came into being on 9/11 . That day , we saw how 19 men could plunge two world civilizations into world confrontation . They succeeded in creating conflict between America and the Muslim world , and almost 10 years later , nothing but a big black hole remains where the World Trade Center once stood . Muslims have not fully understood how deeply symbolic 9/11 has become for Americans . They have neither forgotten nor have many forgiven .

Once again , we are reminded how easy it is for individuals to drag their respective civilizations into conflict . Across the land , stories are emerging of other mosques under pressure or attack .

When traveling throughout the United States for my project , `` Journey into America , '' to study the American Muslim community , we visited about 100 mosques . We saw some with windows smashed and others destroyed . The mosque in Columbia , Tennessee , had been firebombed . Graffiti with Nazi slogans appeared on the walls still standing . When told to go `` home , '' the Muslim worshippers , especially the young , were puzzled . `` We are home , '' they said .

In the midst of this crisis there was light . The heroic Rev. Bill Williamson approached Muslims and offered them the keys to his Presbyterian church , even suggesting he would remove anything they found offensive when they said their prayers there .

As if the situation around mosques was not already tense enough , the Rev. Terry Jones of `` Dove World Outreach '' in Florida has declared September 11 `` Burn a Quran Day . '' This is as provocative for ordinary Muslims as an imam promoting the burning of the Bible would be for Americans .

Gen. David Petraeus , the head of American forces in Afghanistan , has repeatedly expressed the need for winning the `` hearts and minds '' of local people by treating them with dignity and respect . This way , he hopes to marginalize or weaken support for the Taliban .

We are sitting on a tinderbox . A serious attack on a mosque in which people die could trigger a revenge attack , which would in turn create further attacks against Muslims . Because everything happening in America is seen in the Muslim world , murder and mayhem would follow globally .

Considering the seriousness of the situation , I suggest the following steps be taken seriously and urgently .

Bishops , rabbis and imams must work vigorously to bring the temperature down . Interfaith conferences in churches , synagogues and mosques should be conducted . Muslim leaders should organize iftar parties at the opening of the fast to invite non-Muslims , to create good will for the community .

The media has too often played a negative role by associating Islam with violence and terror . It is time for media to play a more responsible role . TV news shows , for example , should encourage more Muslim guests to participate , so that Americans can finally begin to see Muslims as normal people and not members of a threatening alien species .

Given the situation in America , both Muslims and non-Muslims need to be much more culturally sensitive to each other . Muslim leaders need to be more active in explaining Islam to non-Muslims , and non-Muslims need to appreciate Muslims as citizens and fellow countrymen . These steps will help resolve the Great American Conundrum .
