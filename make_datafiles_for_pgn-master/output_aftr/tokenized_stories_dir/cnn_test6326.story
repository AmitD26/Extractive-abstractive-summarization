-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Written on every page of Israel 's history , in ink and in blood , is the name Ariel Sharon . His life , which ended today after an eight-year coma , deeply influenced Israel 's past . But even in death , Sharon will influence the future , as Israelis consider their options if the two-state solution fails .

During Israel 's 1948 War of Independence , the handsome blond officer , known as `` Arik , '' was shot and left for dead . He recovered and founded Israel 's first commando unit , which conducted raids beyond Israel 's borders . In the 1956 Sinai campaign , he led Israel 's legendary paratroopers into clashes behind enemy lines .

A successful general in the 1967 Six Day War , he achieved world fame six years later by spurring Israeli troops across the Suez Canal to encircle the Egyptian army in the Yom Kippur War . The image of Sharon , still blond but now stout , his head wrapped in a bloodied bandage , became iconic . His heroism was uniquely Israeli , built by breaking rules as well as orders , and by surrounding himself with controversy and myth .

But Sharon 's real legacy was made in politics . Here , too , he ignored the norms and forged his own often-tortuous path . He traversed the political spectrum , from the labor farm in which he grew up to the rightist Likud that he established with Menachem Begin . As agriculture minister in the late 1970s , he constructed dozens of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza , gaining a reputation as an opponent of peace .

But then , as defense minister , he evicted thousands of Israelis from settlements in Sinai to fulfill Israel 's treaty with Egypt . In 1982 , Sharon masterminded the Israeli invasion of Lebanon , by some accounts deceiving Prime Minister Begin , and besieged Beirut . An Israeli investigation implicated Sharon in the massacre of 800 Palestinian civilians by Lebanese militiamen and compelled him to resign .

I saw the two sides of Sharon , the bullheaded warrior and man of the people . I saw how Israelis were alternately repelled and captivated by him . I was stationed with the Israeli paratroopers in Beirut when we learned that Sharon wanted to visit the troops . Furious over what they regarded as a reckless war , my buddies indicated that the defense minister was unwelcome . Sharon never arrived .

But weeks later , while hosting Sharon at a base inside Israel , I watched amazed as he left the table to chat with the cook , about whom he remembered every detail .

Even when comatose , Ariel Sharon was a constant presence for Israelis . Whether as the dashing commando , the farmer , the builder , the contrarian , and belated seeker of peace , he reflected them and embodied their story . And after his death , his brazen Israeli way of action lives on .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Oren .
