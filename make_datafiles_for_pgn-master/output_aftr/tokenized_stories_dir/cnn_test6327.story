To watch others cheer her insanity , and then boo the congressman who says the president is an American , shows you that we have a serious problem with mental illness in this country .

The nut jobs that continue to promote this story are wacky , right-wing radio and TV talk shows hosts and no-credibility bloggers . They have latched onto this story like bloodsucking leeches , and actually want us to believe this story has legs .

From the moment President Obama entered the race , he has had to endure the so-called flag-waving American patriots who think they are the arbiters of what 's right for the country . What cracks me up is that in order to justify their loony beliefs , they say , `` The president could just end this once and for all by producing the birth certificate . ''

Do you actually believe these wackos will stop there ? They will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of Hawaii and federal officials to create the birth certificate .

The next thing you know , one of those nut job right-wingers in Congress -- and yes , there are left-wing nut jobs as well -- will demand a federal investigation into the production of the birth certificate .

During the presidential campaign last year , the issue of whether Barack Obama was a `` natural born citizen '' legally qualified to be president was scrutinized by reporters and researchers who concluded that Obama was born in the United States .

President Obama is right to ignore these losers . They are right up there with Holocaust deniers like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , and the people who insist that the landing on the moon was done in a television studio .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin .
