-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama on Monday reiterated his call for a comprehensive package of steps against gun violence as the focus on possible Senate legislation appeared to narrow to expanded background checks and limited ammunition magazines , rather than a ban on semi-automatic rifles that mimic assault weapons .

Obama took part in a discussion with Minneapolis officials before telling police officers and others that an increase in gun violence nationwide , including the Connecticut school massacre in December , made it vital to address the issue now .

Opponents led by the influential National Rifle Association , oppose any ban on weapons , and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated that such a provision faced an uphill struggle .

Obama 's trip to Minneapolis was intended to raise attention to steps taken in the city , including a recent regional gun summit hosted by Mayor R.T. Rybak and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett .

The NRA and its leading supporters in Congress argue that steps proposed by Obama wo n't work and would fail to address the problem .

For example , they say criminals skirt background checks , so expanding the system would miss the main target of the legislation . They also contend that the semi-automatic rifles targeted by Feinstein in a proposal introduced last week are used in a fraction of the nation 's gun violence .

Gun debate : Where is the middle ground ?

Obama and other supporters of stronger gun control measures say all possible efforts must be made to address what they call a chronic and growing problem of gun violence , particularly involving vulnerable targets such as students .

However , Reid signaled that the committee version would lack the ban on assault-style weapons .

`` If Dianne Feinstein , by the time it 's through the Judiciary Committee , if she does n't have her assault weapons , at least let her have an opportunity to offer this amendment '' on the Senate floor , Reid told ABC .

Asked about backing he has received from the NRA , Reid said that `` just because they resist it does n't mean we ca n't do things . ''

Other steps under consideration include better monitoring of people with mental illness to prevent them from obtaining guns .

Obama said Monday that lawmakers in Congress from both parties were working together on plans that would expand background checks to all gun purchases and criminalize `` straw purchases '' in which legal gun owners buy weapons for people prohibited from doing so .

The faces of America 's gun debate

Guns sold through private sales currently avoid background checks -- the so-called gun show loophole .

Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said last week that he was in talks with colleagues -- including several who are ranked highly by the NRA -- on possible legislation to expand background checks on private gun sales .

Sources close to both Schumer and Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma told CNN the two were in serious discussions about co-sponsoring a bill to strengthen background checks . Schumer sits on the Judiciary Committee , while Coburn is a former member .

However , NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre told the panel that the current background check system does n't work , so expanding it would only create an unmanageable government bureaucracy instead of reducing gun crime .

During the Super Bowl on Sunday night , a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns broadcast an ad showing the NRA 's LaPierre , in 1999 , endorsing the expanded background checks his group now opposes .

Supporters of gun control argue that the constitutional right to bear arms can be limited , for example , by the existing ban on private citizens possessing grenade launchers and other military weaponry .

However , Denver University law professor David Kopel said last week that the Supreme Court made clear that gun control could not include weapons used commonly by law-abiding citizens , such as the top-selling AR-15 that Feinstein 's legislation would ban .
