Kevin Smith , a plastic surgeon from Houston , was just arriving home from a business trip on Friday when he and his daughter saw a group of apparent thieves pulling out of their driveway in a red pickup .

Kevin Smith recorded the chase on his cell phone while his daughter drove their car after the suspects .

But he captured more than just a speedy car chase down their neighborhood road . The driver of the pickup noticed the pair trailing behind , and put the truck into reverse , crashing into the father and daughter 's vehicle .

The suspects then threw their car into reverse again , smashing into the pair 's Audi sedan a second time .

In the cell phone video , Alana can be heard asking her father , `` Dad , now what do I do ? '' after the car turns off during one of the collisions . He tells her to turn the car back on .

`` It was just like in the movies , '' Kevin Smith said . `` It was really eerie . At the end of this road , you see the truck turn around and you see the red truck popped out of the dust and head right turn towards us . ''

`` I 'm proud of my daughter , '' Kevin Smith said . `` As a father , you really do n't know how you raised your kid until they get older and you see how they can handle themselves . I do n't want her to be cavalier , but I want her to know I am proud . ''

He believes the suspects may be responsible for a series of burglaries that have been plaguing his south Houston neighborhood .

As for Kara , the daughter who was left at home , she was at the gym during the incident and was n't able to answer her cellphone while she was working out .

Alana , who is going to law school in the fall , says the whole experience was unprecedented , but she feels blessed and fortunate that she and her sister are alright . `` I needed to do this for my neighborhood and my family , '' she said .

Smith suffered no injuries after the incident , and his daughter was released later from the hospital after being checked in for whiplash . Their car suffered front and back-end damage , and they were able to retrieve the television , laptops and a myriad of other possession that were stolen from their home .
