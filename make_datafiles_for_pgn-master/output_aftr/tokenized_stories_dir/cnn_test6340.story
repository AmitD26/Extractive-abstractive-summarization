`` We 're still on the quest to answer the grand question : Is there life somewhere else in the universe ? '' John Grunsfeld , NASA 's associate administrator for science , told reporters Tuesday in a teleconference .

`` We really needed to go back to the surface , and go to the next stage . ... Did Mars ever have life ? '' Grunsfeld said as he previewed a 160-page report prepared by the Mars 2020 Science Definition Team , a group assembled by NASA to outline the objectives of the mission .

Among the objectives of the 2020 rover mission will be the search for signs of life , the collection of samples to possibly be returned to Earth and testing technology that may allow for a manned mission to Mars .

`` We want to be able to seek signs of life : Had life been there , did it leave a mark ? '' said Jack Mustard , a member of the development team and a chair and professor of geological sciences at Brown University .

As part of the preparation for the mission , NASA plans to conduct an open competition . It is planned by NASA for the space technology and scientific instruments that will be carried by the rover and used in the mission , according to the report .

The European and Russian space agencies plan to launch the ExoMars rover in 2018 .
