Her friend , Gail , had died from a blood clot just a week after undergoing gastric bypass surgery to make her stomach smaller . Hill was scheduled to have the same surgery and believed it was the only way to end her lifelong struggle with obesity .

Tipping the scales at 280 pounds and standing 5 feet 5 inches tall , Hill says she was depressed , moody and always defensive . The 47-year-old mother from Weymouth , Massachusetts , was morbidly obese , and after her friend 's death , she was beginning to lose hope .

`` That was the end of the gastric bypass for me , '' remembers Hill . `` At her wake , I promised everyone that I would not go ahead with surgery . ''

Hill immediately started researching the procedure , in which an adjustable band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to restrict the amount of food the stomach will hold . According to MayoClinic.com , the band creates a small pouch opening to the stomach . The amount of food your stomach will hold is controlled by injecting or removing fluid from the band . Even though gastric banding restricts the amount of food , it does not reduce the absorption of calories or nutrients .

In the United States , where two-thirds of the population is either overweight or obese , weight-loss surgeries have increased in recent years , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . While the surgeries are successful at helping people lose weight and reduce their risk for hypertension , diabetes and other chronic illnesses -- patients have to carefully weigh the benefits of the procedure with the serious risks , side effects and even death in some cases .

Some of the more common side effects of weight-loss surgery can be difficulty digesting starchy foods and protein , which can lead to other physical conditions including hair loss , fatigue , swelling and muscle weakness . Once she did her homework on gastric banding , Hill says she knew the procedure was for her . She sought treatment at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston , Massachusetts . The program required six weeks of pre-operation behavior-modification classes and monthly support meetings .

She immediately started losing weight , dropping 20 pounds the first month , and continued to lose 10 to 15 pounds a month . Six months later , at the end of August , she had dropped 75 pounds .

As the second anniversary -- or `` Bandiversary '' -- of her surgery approached , Hill had lost 130 pounds and reached her original target weight of 150 pounds . CNN I-Reporters share their weight-loss photos ''

That 's when she began exercising and keeping track of her daily food intake via the Web site FitDay.com .

`` You do n't realize how many calories you 're taking in until you start keeping track , '' said Hill .

Ultimately , Hill surpassed her original weight loss goal and lost another 10 pounds . She currently weighs 145 pounds and , after dropping 10 dress sizes , now fits perfectly into a size 8 , she says .

Still , the surgery has restored her life , Hill says .

One of the biggest perks of losing weight is traveling with greater ease . She does n't have to ask for a seat belt extender and no longer feels like she 's spilling into her neighbor 's seat .

`` I went to Cancun last July , and I was able to go horseback riding without hurting the horse , '' jokes Hill .

`` I 'm actually petite , '' Hill says excitedly . `` I can buy stylish clothes . Before surgery , I just bought clothes that fit me . Now I can buy clothes that look good on me . ''

`` I am so happy with the way I look and feel , '' says Hill , `` I never want to go back to the way I looked before . It sounds very superficial , but it 's the truth . '' iReport.com : Have you lost weight ? Share your story , tips and photos E-mail to a friend
