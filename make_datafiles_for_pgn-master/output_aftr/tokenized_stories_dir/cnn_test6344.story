If so , how has the experience been ?

Thought so .

Flying these days -- the jammed-to-the-groaning-point cabins and torture-rack legroom ; the fees for everything from checking your bags to being handed a paltry package of food ; the endless , we 'll - X-ray-you-to-within-an-inch-of-your-dignity security lines ; the sweaty guy in the next seat with a tank top on and his shoes off -- you know how it is .

Flying is too often a dreary , joy-sapping slog . It 's difficult even to remember that it was ever any other way .

The book had a workmanlike title : `` When Hollywood Landed at Chicago 's Midway Airport . '' Because the person who recommended it to me spoke in such glowing terms , I ordered a copy through the mail .

Written by a fellow named Christopher Lynch , who grew up around Midway , it is a thin , paperbound volume that appears to be a labor of love and respect . It tells the story of one Mike Rotunno , a photographer-for-hire in the first boom years of commercial air travel in the United States .

Rotunno -- he died in 1994 -- was a newspaper photographer who decided he might be able to do better as his own boss . In the 1930s , '40s and '50s , flying was a big deal . When a family went on vacation by air , it was a major life event .

Rotunno set up a company called Metro News at Midway -- O'Hare International Airport was many years from being built -- to offer professional photo service to anyone passing through the airport who wanted a memento of the occasion .

Well , take a look at the selection of those photos atop today 's column . The next time you 're frustrated and downcast about what air travel has become , the memory of the photos may serve as a tonic .

The trains were still king in those years . The airlines wanted to convince people that flying was safe .

`` People were afraid to fly , '' Lynch said . `` And it was expensive . The airlines had to make people think it was something they should try . ''

Enter Mike Rotunno .

There is Marilyn Monroe , right there with Mike and his Speed Graphic . Katharine Hepburn , a dream incarnate . Gary Cooper , taking a photo of Rotunno , as Rotunno took a photo of him . Rock Hudson , surrounded by fans . Red Skelton . Gene Autry . Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis . Jimmy Stewart . John F. Kennedy , Jacqueline Kennedy and Richard Nixon -- together , all in a single frame , beneath a United Airlines plane .

It is a lost world -- the airborne world of everyday elegance , as available to the average ticket holder as to Bob Hope or to Abbott and Costello . Mike Rotunno , on a daily basis , captured it all .

It was an arrangement in which everyone won . The airlines , which assisted him in lining up the photos , won because the results helped convince the public to abandon the trains . The Hollywood studios won because they got a little bit of free publicity for their stars . The newspapers won because , by buying photos from Rotunno , they did n't have to send photographers to the airport themselves . And Rotunno won , because he got the money .

She 's gone now .

He 's gone now .

And you ?

Why are n't you smiling ?

Are you a window flier or an aisle seater ?
