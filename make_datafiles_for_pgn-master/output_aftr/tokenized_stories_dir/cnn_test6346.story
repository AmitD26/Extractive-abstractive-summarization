From becoming the youngest grand slam champion to having her career shattered by a traumatic stabbing attack , then battling related weight problems before losing her father and coach to cancer , the 39-year-old has plenty of life experience to draw on for her latest project .

`` I try to handle them as best I can . ''

Long retired from the top level , the former world No. 1 has followed up her autobiography by co-authoring a fictional book on life at a tennis academy .

The main character of `` The Academy : Game On '' gained her entry to an elite tennis school by virtue of a scholarship , just as the eventual winner of nine grand slams did herself as a 12-year-old .

Five years of training at Nick Bollettieri 's famous academy in Florida turned the slender young Seles into the 1990 French Open champion at the tender age of 16 years and six months , and at 17 she became the youngest No. 1 .

Those records have since been broken by Martina Hingis but the fact remains that Seles -- who then represented Yugoslavia but who has since taken American citizenship -- was a prodigy whose equal the world had never seen before .

Still the youngest winner at Roland Garros , she added the Australian and U.S. Open titles to her CV in 1991 -- and is now in no doubt as to what drove her to the top .

`` I had an absolutely great time co-writing the book -LRB- with James LaRosa -RRB- , '' Seles said .

`` The main character , Maya , had a way to get into the academies , which is the same way I did -- on a scholarship . And as I always said in the book , there are two ways to get into an academy -- money or talent -- but at the end of the day talent always wins . ''

There can be no doubt that her ability , coupled with a fierce mental dedication , propelled Seles to the very top but her career was tragically derailed in circumstances that were unimaginable until they actually happened .

The knife sunk one and a half inches into Seles ' upper left back , and though the wounds took a few months to heal the psychological impact left far deeper scars -- as the former teenage prodigy readily admits .

It would be over two years before Seles returned to the tour but with her father Karoly , who was also her coach , suffering from a cancer that would eventually take his life in 1998 , the youngster 's weight ballooned as she sought solace for her troubles in binge eating .

She was never the same player again -- and her 2009 autobiography `` Getting a Grip '' gives a fascinating into the knock-on effects of Pache 's attack .

`` According to a psychiatric evaluation ... he stated that I was not ` pretty . Women should n't be as thin as a bone , ' '' she wrote after her retirement , which came five years after her last official tour match .

`` Darkness had descended into my head . No matter how many ways I analyzed my situation , I could n't find a bright side .

`` I still do n't know why my anguish found solace in food . Maybe I was subconsciously reacting to Parche 's angry comment that ` women should n't be as thin as a bone . ' If I padded myself with extra weight , I 'd be protected from being hurt again . ''

`` Then at 19 , to get stabbed and have my career stopped for two and a half years , decide to come back and then lose my coach/best friend/dad , I 've had a lot of lows and highs -- but at the end of the day that is what life is about .

Fittingly , given the subject matter of her book , her writing began on the tennis circuit as she sought an escape from the monotony of endless traveling to tournaments .

`` On the downtime during rain delays and traveling , I wrote a lot , '' she said . `` In tennis , everything is about hitting that yellow ball and being really focused on it -- but writing ` Game On ' was just so much fun as I got to use my imagination .
