-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For a time Monday if you looked up the Wikipedia entry on John Brooks , this is what you 'd find :

If you had n't heard his name before , you certainly have now : John Brooks is the 21-year-old who came in as a substitute into the USA vs Ghana game Monday , and scored a header to keep America 's hope alive in the World Cup in Brazil .

He straddles two cultures

On the left is an outline of Berlin , with a star marking the neighborhood he grew up in . The state of Illinois covers his right , with a star representing Chicago , his father 's hometown .

And while he has relatives stateside , his main attachments are in Berlin where his mother 's from , he said in his U.S. Soccer video portrait .

`` My mom , it 's the most important person in my life . ''

His American father , a serviceman , has moved on to Switzerland .

He is bilingual

Brooks mixes it up on Twitter and Facebook with posts in English and in German , and sometimes in both -- like the one he wrote about his nomination for the U.S. team .

He made history Monday

Brooks goal was one for the record books . He 's the first substitute in U.S. soccer history to score in a World Cup match .

He seems to leave an impression

Just like Monday , he made a grand entrance during his first game with Hertha BSC , after the Berlin team he plays for ascended from the minors to the major league . Brooks scored a goal in his first game of the season in August .

When JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann , a household name in German soccer , took over as U.S. coach , he went shopping for quality talent made in Germany -- with a U.S. passport .

This will make for a particularly interesting game next week , when the United States team faces soccer powerhouse Germany in the coastal resort town of Recife .

If you hear someone on the U.S. team scream `` Tor !! '' after a score ...

... well , that 's German for `` Goal !! '' for Team USA .
