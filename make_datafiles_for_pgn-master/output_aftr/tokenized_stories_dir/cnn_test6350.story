The Polish archbishop is believed to be one of the highest-ranking Vatican officials to be dismissed from the clergy for sexual abuse .

Once the canonical process has been concluded , he will then be tried by Vatican judicial authorities , according to the Vatican statement .

If necessary , the Holy See `` should ensure such persons are criminally prosecuted or extradited for prosecution by the civil authorities '' of another state , it said . The U.N. panel asked to be informed of the outcome of the investigation into Wesolowski .

In a statement issued following the report , the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests , or SNAP , urged Polish bishops and Catholics to contact Pope Francis and `` insist that he send Wesolowski back to face secular justice in Poland . ''

Francis last month spoke out against sexual abuse by Catholic clergy and said he would meet with victims .

`` This is very serious , '' he said . `` It is like , by way of comparison , holding a black Mass. . You are supposed to lead them to sanctity and instead you lead them to a problem that will last their entire lives . ''

CNN 's Hada Messia reported from Rome , and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London .
