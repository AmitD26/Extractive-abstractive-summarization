-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Filled with regret , Kelley Fielder wishes she would have tried to stop them .

They told her they were `` going underground , '' Fielder said .

On Tuesday , Carie Stichter , Jerad Miller 's mother , released a statement .

`` We wish to express our greatest sympathies , thoughts and prayers to the families who have lost their loved ones in this horrible act of violence . We are profoundly saddened , confused and in shock over the senseless actions of our son and his wife . We ask that the media respect our family 's privacy during this ... difficult time . ''

Bystander went after Jerad Miller

He heard Miller shout , `` This is the beginning of the revolution ! Everybody get out ! You will be shot ! ''

Wilcox `` had the option to go left to exit the store to safety , '' Tanner told CNN . But he chose not to leave . Wilcox instead stayed inside and confronted Jerad Miller , Tanner said .

The couple retreated toward the back of the store , where police closed in .

Amanda Miller shot her husband and then herself , police said . They both died .

`` You never expect it , '' he said . `` It 's something you see on TV , in the movies . ... ''

`` I 'm very proud of him , '' she told CNN . `` I would have never done it . I would have never . I would have froze in place probably and the fact that he just rushed in after and tried to save those people , it was heroic . ''

Two officers slain

Their rampage began when they walked into a CiCi 's Pizza place around 11:30 a.m. in a non-glitzy part of the city where two police officers were having lunch .

The couple shot Igor Soldo , 31 , in the back of the head , and Alyn Beck , 41 , took a bullet to the neck , authorities said .

On Tuesday , Beck friend Tracy Smith remembered the officer in an opinion piece for CNN.com . Officer Beck was kind and funny , intelligent , a tireless worker and a devoted husband and father of three . He loved his dog , Marty , she wrote .

Soldo was married and had a baby .

On the other officer 's body , authorities said , a note was pinned . It read something to the effect of , `` This is the beginning of the revolution , '' Second Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters .

`` I thought he was going to get a drink , the way he walked up and walked past them , '' she said . `` And then he turned around , pulled a gun on his right and shot the bald officer in front of me . ''

The pair took the officers ' guns and ammunition , McMahill told reporters .

As the Millers walked out of the CiCi 's , they passed Alvaro Lopez .

`` They had a backpack , and I saw a gun in their hand , '' Lopez told CNN affiliate KLAS . `` He just told me to tell the cops that it was a revolution and that he 'd just killed two cops inside CiCi 's . ''

McMahill confirmed that the Millers said something about a revolution while leaving the pizzeria .

A search for why

`` What precipitated this event , we do not know , '' Sheriff Doug Gillespie said . `` My officers were simply having lunch . ''

Investigators searched an apartment late Sunday night that was thought to be where the couple lived . They were going through the couple 's social media postings , McMahill said Monday .

Police also recovered hundreds of rounds of ammunition from the couple 's backpacks at Walmart , suggesting they were prepared for a lengthy gunbattle , he added .

Who were the Millers ?

A woman who says she lived near the couple told KTNV that the married couple liked to dress up as the villainous `` Batman '' characters Joker and Harley Quinn .

Koch also told the station the couple had told her they were going to carry out an attack , but she thought they were `` crazy , '' so she dismissed what they said .

McMahill told reporters he 'd heard unconfirmed reports the pair spoke to a neighbor about the attack before it happened .

`` You know we have the ` see something , say something ' campaign , '' he said , urging people to call police when something does n't feel right .

`` We need to hear from our citizens . They 're the best eyes and ears that we have out there . ''
