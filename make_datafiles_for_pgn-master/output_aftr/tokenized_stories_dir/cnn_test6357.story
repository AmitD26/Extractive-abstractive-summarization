The majority of citizens do not trust the government , which they view as corrupt , so they could not believe the whole story about Ebola when it started being told . A friend of mine said , for example , `` Ellen Johnson Sirleaf -LRB- president of Liberia -RRB- and her minister of health want to pocket money , so they have come up with a new tactics to collect money and share . ''

As the months went by , many radio talk show hosts led discussions about Ebola . People from all walks of life in Liberia still denied the existence of Ebola , including many at the waterside , one of the biggest markets in Monrovia , the capital . When I spoke about Ebola , people accused me of working for the government , which was bad enough . But when I showed them my work ID , I made the matter even worse . They said that I work for an American non-governmental organization , and we all are supporters of Ma Ellen and ca n't see the wrong she is doing .

Now , too late , everyone is talking about the invisible enemy -- the one you can not see . I remember during the war days in Liberia , you could get news of where the enemies were coming from and take cover either in the bushes or some other hiding place .

But the Ebola virus is different . I have extended family members who have died from the virus or been quarantined for observation and testing . It is overwhelming to hear of people whom you have spoken to in the past six weeks , who are now dead from a disease that could have been prevented .

9 things to know about Ebola

Liberians are social and community-oriented . We greet people with handshakes and hugs , eat together using one bowl , sleep together in one bed and bathe dead bodies to honor them .

Some people are trying to put aside these cultural practices to save lives . I have noticed that a few people have started to wear gloves and long-sleeve shirts . Many businesses and homes have buckets with water and bleach for people entering and coming out to wash their hands .

A colleague of mine called and told me about a health administrator whose mother had contracted the Ebola virus . The administrator took his mother to the hospital in Tubmanburg , capital of Bomi County , where my colleague works as a nurse and social worker for people living with HIV/AIDS .

Another day has come , and I got a call from a friend who is a social worker in one of the closed government hospitals in western Liberia . She said families that have been quarantined in some communities do not have basic food supplies and other items they need . Even though they are not showing symptoms at the moment , they go out to fetch water and food . They go to faraway markets and hand-pump water and do not tell others that they have been quarantined for fear of stigma . Another colleague says she took food and water to an Ebola quarantine , but she was turned down and told that no food or drinks were allowed .

Tracing people who have come in contact with sick Ebola patients is a huge task for the Ministry of Health . It has become very difficult to trace people who have moved from one community to another , making it tougher to contain the spread of the virus .
