Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- America 's longest war . Much more National Security Agency surveillance . An alphabet soup of new government departments and agencies . Long security lines at airports .

Read the 9/11 Commission 's new report

`` The ` generational struggle ' against terrorism described in ` The 9/11 Commission Report ' is far from over , '' the panel said this week in reference to its assessment a decade earlier . `` Rather , it is entering a new and dangerous phase , and America can not afford to let down its guard . ''

Its bottom line assessment ? `` Strenuous counterterrorism efforts will remain a fact of our national life for the foreseeable future . ''

Here is a look at the report , analyzing what has worked , what has n't and has to happen now .

WHAT WORKED

Going after al Qaeda 's leadership

The immediate reaction to the hijack attacks that toppled the World Trade Center towers and damaged the Pentagon targeted the culprit -- the al Qaeda network of Osama bin Laden operating out of Afghanistan near the Pakistani border .

Years of war in Afghanistan ended the safe haven there for terrorists and achieved the goal of degrading al Qaeda 's core , the report said . U.S. special forces eventually killed bin Laden in Pakistan .

Air travel security

Long security lines , reinforced cockpit doors , removing laptops from carry-on bags , no liquids , checking shoes -- all followed the attacks that killed 3,000 people .

A no-fly list that had 16 names before the attacks now has more than 1,000 , the report noted .

So far , no similar foreign attack has occurred in America . The closest call came in 2009 when Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab failed to ignite an explosive in his underwear as a Northwest Airlines jet from Amsterdam approached Detroit on Christmas Day .

The Department of Homeland Security . The director of National Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center . The Transportation Security Administration . The FBI National Security Branch and the military 's Cyber Command .

`` These measures have largely succeeded , '' the report said . `` The mass-casualty attacks many feared in the wake of 9/11 did not materialize . Today , in large part because of these many reforms , the United States is a much harder target . ''

NSA surveillance

The security apparatus also expanded its ability to track telephone and computer communications after 9/11 .

`` We believe these programs are worth preserving , albeit with additional oversight , '' the report said .

The Boston Marathon went on as scheduled this spring , undeterred by the terrorist bombings at the finish line a year earlier , the 9/11 commissioners noted .

`` This year 's triumphant marathon sent an unmistakable message to the world : Americans will not bend to terrorism , '' the report said , adding that `` the country must continue to prepare for the unforeseen , but it appears to be moving in the right direction . ''

Full disclosure

The new report 's biggest takeaway ? Tell the people what they need to know .

Prior to the 9/11 attacks , `` the government did not effectively explain to the public the evil that was stalking us , '' it said . `` We fear that this is happening again . ''

`` If this gap persists , the political support for needed national security capabilities will fade , '' the report continued . `` In today 's very dangerous world , that is something we can ill afford . ''

Efforts to reduce Islamic extremism

Islamic extremism has increased in the past decade , the report said .

A State Department official warned a congressional committee on Wednesday that `` ISIS is al Qaeda . ''

`` It may have changed its name , it may have broken with senior al Qaeda leadership such as Ayman al-Zawahiri , but it is al Qaeda in its doctrine , ambition and increasingly in its threat to U.S. interests , '' said Brett McGurk , the deputy assistant secretary for Iraq and Iran . `` In fact it is worse than al Qaeda . ''

Not surprisingly , a dysfunctional Congress with some of the lowest approval ratings also gets cited by the 9/11 commissioners .

The funding process for national security is fragmented , with multiple budget categories providing the money . In addition , the Homeland Security Department reports to more than 90 congressional committees and subcommittees .

`` While the executive branch has undergone historic change and institutional reform , Congress has proved deeply resistant to needed change , '' the report said . `` It has made some minor adjustments , but not the necessary structural changes in oversight and appropriations for homeland security and intelligence . ''

WHAT NOW

Prepare better for cyber attacks

Use of military powers

The report said the authorization needs updating , calling on the administration to `` clearly explain whether it needs new legal authority to confront threats like ISIS and how far , in its view , any new authority should extend . ''

The biggest threat to America is failing to recognize the threat still exists and is growing .

The threat remains `` grave , '' it continued , warning `` we can not afford to be complacentâ € '' vigorous counterterrorism efforts are as important as ever . ''
