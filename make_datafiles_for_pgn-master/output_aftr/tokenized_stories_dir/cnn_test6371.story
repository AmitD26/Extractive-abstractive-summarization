-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An ex-judge accusing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of manipulating court rulings is a fugitive who `` sold his soul to the devil '' when he agreed to talk with U.S. investigators , the nation 's foreign minister said Thursday .

`` People like him will keep being defeated and his lies will be unveiled , '' Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said .

Eladio Aponte Aponte , who was a Supreme Court justice until the Venezuelan government accused him of connections with an alleged drug trafficker last month , told SOiTV in an interview that aired this week that he made rulings in cases based on requests from Chavez and other top officials .

Top Venezuelan authorities were aware of at least one instance in which a military lieutenant was caught transporting cocaine to an army camp -- and made personal phone calls asking the judge to look the other way , Aponte Aponte told the Miami-based TV network .

In recent years , the U.S. Treasury Department has placed several Venezuelan officials , including the nation 's current defense minister , on its drug kingpin list .

Mauricio Boraschi said U.S. Embassy officials contacted the Costa Rican government after the former judge -- who had been in Costa Rica for about two weeks -- reached out to officials in Washington .

Venezuela 's foreign minister criticized the United States for attempting to destabilize his country 's government .

The DEA has not commented on Aponte Aponte . An agency official who watched portions of the interview that aired on CNN en EspaÃ ± ol said it was `` very interesting . ''

In one instance , Aponte Aponte said , Chavez 's office called and asked for the former judge 's help after a military lieutenant was caught with cocaine . So did the nation 's defense minister and other top officials , Aponte Aponte said .

`` That is where the directives of the justice system come from . ... They decide what guidelines to follow depending on the political climate , '' he said .

Several of Aponte Aponte 's remarks contradicted previous statements by top Venezuelan officials -- including Chavez .

When asked whether there were political prisoners in Venezuela -- something Chavez has previously denied -- Aponte Aponte said yes .

Asked whether he felt that the Venezuelan government had turned against him , Aponte Aponte said , `` I think they did that a long time ago . I just did n't realize it . ''

Venezuelan officials removed Aponte Aponte from his post last month , accusing him of providing a government credential to a man authorities allege was one of the world 's top drug lords .

A government ethics commission said the judge had committed `` serious misconduct '' and a `` breach of public ethics '' when he allegedly provided a credential to suspected drug trafficker Walid Makled .

Makled is currently on trial in Venezuela , where he is accused of drug trafficking and killing a journalist who was investigating his family . He was extradited to Venezuela from Colombia last year .

Chavez has strongly denied those accusations and stood up for his government officials .

Maduro said Thursday that Aponte Aponte 's removal from office showed that `` in Venezuela the laws work . No one is privileged or protected . ''

Aponte Aponte told SOiTV that his daughter had invited Makled to her wedding , `` but we did n't have any idea of the activities of this gentleman . We only knew him as a reputable businessman . ''

The former judge claimed Venezuelan officials had unfairly used the Makled case to destroy his reputation .

`` I am not going to pay for a crime I never committed , '' Aponte Aponte told SOiTV , but he said he wants to make up for the harm his rulings have caused .

`` When I finished packing all my stuff in my office , all my books , I told myself I 'd never touch another law book . Justice is nothing , justice is a ball of putty . I say putty because it can be molded , for or against . I did n't want to have anything to do with the law anymore . I said I 'd rather have a hotdog stand , '' he said . `` But then , after all my reflection , and I had time to think it over , and after I saw that , that my friends have offered to help me , I now think you need to fight for justice . And that blindfolded lady has to be shown the way . ''

`` Knowing the system from the inside , and how it works , and how it 's handled , I do n't think I 'd have any rights at all , '' he said .
