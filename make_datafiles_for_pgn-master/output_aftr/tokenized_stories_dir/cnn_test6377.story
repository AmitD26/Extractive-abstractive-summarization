Still , many issues about North Korea 's nuclear capabilities remain unclear as U.S. officials prepare for a potential missile launch by Pyongyang that they say could come at any time . Here is a look at a few of those questions :

------

1 . Does North Korea have nuclear weapons ?

Likely . North Korea conducted its first underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 , as well as two other tests , with the most recent coming in February of this year . Others believe the communist nation is assumed to have already separated enough plutonium for up to 10 warheads . It is unclear , however , if they have developed a way to weaponize or effectively deliver them . A U.S. official who briefed reporters in Seoul said that North Korea `` has demonstrated at least three times now that they can detonate a nuclear weapon . '' Still , with fewer than 10 functional nuclear devices -- compared to the more than 7,650 warheads in the U.S. arsenal -- the tiny nation is at the dangerous infancy of becoming a nuclear state .

3 . Do they have missiles sophisticated enough to deliver a nuclear warhead ?

4 . If North Korea launches a missile , how will we know if it is carrying a nuclear warhead ?

Basically , we wo n't . While U.S. officials said there is `` nothing to indicate '' that North Korea can or will place a nuclear warhead atop a missile right now , most experts say it is very difficult to know the warhead and payload of a missile test in advance . That raises the heightened concern that , despite public U.S. proclamations that they would be hesitant to shoot down a North Korean missile launched over the ocean unless it appeared to be heading toward a known land-based target , such a shoot-down is still possible .

5 . Why is it so hard to know full details of North Korea 's nuclear program ?

The highly secretive nation -- led by the young , reclusive Kim Jung Un -- has been largely isolated from much of the rest of the world . Subject to strict United Nations sanctions , the country 's primary supporter has been China , to its north and west . Entry into the country is strictly limited and communications -- TV , radio , Internet and even cell phones -- have been tightly controlled by the communist government . And even North Korea 's nuclear capabilities are unclear . Months after North Korea 's latest underground detonation , U.S. intelligence is still unable to determine what material actually exploded -- uranium or other radioactive materials . Mike Chinoy , a former CNN correspondent who has visited North Korea 15 times , said the current confusion about Pyongyang 's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998 , when U.S. spy satellites discovered an underground complex at Kumchangri , not far from North Korea 's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon . A debate raged inside intelligence communities about whether what the satellites saw was evidence of a burgeoning nuclear reactor , a secret , underground nuclear weapons facility or something else . In the end , the underground complex turned out to be empty , Chinoy noted .
