-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last week , 19-year-old California university student Adeline Munguia was reported missing after she stopped responding to Snapchats and texts from her roommate .

There 's a growing movement that wants to make taking such a break from our electronics the rule , not the rare exception . Friday marks the start of the fifth annual National Day of Unplugging , an initiative launched by the national nonprofit group Reboot to help people take a break from their always-on lifestyles .

`` I think that people are overwhelmed . It 's physically taken a toll on people , '' said Reboot 's communications manager , Tanya Schevitz . `` If you think you have to respond to everything all the time , that 's an unrealistic expectation . ''

'' ... to focus on the faces in front of me . ''

'' ... to connect . ''

The concept has caught on since the first unplugging day in 2010 . Organizers have signed up more than 200 local and national groups as partners , including the Ad Council , Digital Detox and Google . Many will be hosting their own official events such as in-person gatherings and phone-free parties .

Although the official holiday lasts for just 24 hours , the idea is to create more awareness of how we interact with our devices and the impact this has on our work , family and mental health . Then people can take smaller steps to carve out device-free pockets of time during the day and eventually find a balance that works for them .

Concern about our dependence on our electronic devices has grown in recent years as it 's become increasingly difficult to step away from the online world . Phones beep and blink and beg for our attention with e-mail , text notifications , breaking news or updates from social media . Even when a phone is quiet , many of us still reflexively pick it up to check news and messages during moments of downtime .

Researchers are still studying the impact that smartphones and mobile technology have on our lives . In the work sphere , there 's increasing evidence that multitasking is inefficient . The brain ca n't fully focus on a task when it 's constantly jumping around to do bite-size tasks like checking e-mail .

At home , the divided attention can have a negative impact on relationships with children and partners . Schevitz recently heard stories about overly connected families firsthand when she spoke to a class of eighth-graders about unplugging . The students shared tales of their parents working at all hours or not listening because they were glued to their smartphones .

Psychologists have been researching something called attention-restoration theory . The idea is that people can better focus on tasks after taking a break to experience nature and giving part of their brains a rest . Something as simple as taking a walk or looking at photos of nature can reset people 's attention spans and reduce stress .

The more people who participate , the less unusual it will seem , according to Schevitz .

`` What we we need to do is reset society 's expectations , '' she said .
