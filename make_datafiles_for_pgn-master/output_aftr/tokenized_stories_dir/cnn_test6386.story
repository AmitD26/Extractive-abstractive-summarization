-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The news that a U.S. nurse tested positive for Ebola has heightened concerns about the virus . Health officials are moving quickly to increase monitoring of hospital workers treating Ebola and ensure the deadly virus does not spread .

The World Health Organization described it as `` unquestionably the most severe acute public health emergency in modern times . ''

`` I have never seen a health event strike such fear and terror , well beyond the affected countries , '' Dr. Margaret Chan , WHO 's director-general , said Monday .

With multiple developments under way , here 's what you need to know Monday to get caught up on the latest :

U.S. DEVELOPMENTS

Nurse who treated Duncan is infected :

The nurse had numerous contacts with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there may have been a `` breach in protocol . '' It did n't say what the possible breach was . Duncan died last week .

The nurse is `` clinically stable , '' CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said Monday . The CDC said others who cared for Duncan could have been infected , but so far no other health workers are showing symptoms .

Tom Ha , a family friend , described Pham as a devout Catholic who always `` puts other people 's interests ahead of her own . '' It 's a philosophy she shares with her family , he told CNN .

The union is asking for immediate upgrades to Ebola emergency preparations that include hands-on training and enough protective gear . The CDC said Monday it is `` doubling down '' on training and outreach to make every hospital `` think Ebola . ''

Ebola patient 's waste disposal :

A judge granted a temporary restraining order blocking the disposal in a Louisiana hazardous waste landfill of incinerated waste from the Texas apartment where Ebola patient Duncan stayed , Louisiana Attorney General Buddy Caldwell said Monday .

Caldwell had said earlier he would seek to keep the incinerated waste from crossing state lines . The company that incinerated the waste told CNN it had followed CDC guidelines and had no plans to move the waste to Louisiana .

Burning is one way to dispose of Ebola contaminated items safely , according to the CDC . The virus becomes inactive once it 's burned .

Doctors at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha are pleased with the progress NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is making . He contracted Ebola while working in Liberia and is receiving the experimental drug brincidofovir , or CMX001 .

Crew breaks its word :

A medic who 'd been working on a ship off the coast of west-central Africa came to the University of Kansas Hospital on Monday with possible Ebola symptoms .

`` He 's a suspect case . We do n't know if he has it . I think overall , given that he has n't worsened today , it would make me think that he would be low risk , '' said Dr. Lee Norman , chief medical officer at the hospital . Doctors expect to get test results Tuesday , he said .

The medic started experiencing some symptoms on the ship before flying to the United States last week , Norman said . He said he was n't sure whether the medic flew on a commercial or private flight .
