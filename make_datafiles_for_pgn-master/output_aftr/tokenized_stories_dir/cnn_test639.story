Given the cost of college , students and families need to know that they 're making a good investment . That 's why we need to move to a system where we measure learning outcomes , not just time spent in a classroom accumulating credits .

A college degree is the only sure path to middle-class security , and because young people and their parents know that , the cost of college , and the availability of loans and other aid , has become a powerful political issue . But for all the attention paid to the price of college , we have n't given enough thought to whether students and their families are getting their money 's worth . Is American higher education worth the price ? Are students and their families getting what they 're paying for ?

There 's plenty of evidence that for many of them , the answer is no . In 2006 , a government study found that nearly 70 % of college graduates could not perform basic tasks like comparing opposing editorials . In a 2011 book , `` Academically Adrift , '' researchers studied 2,000 students at two dozen universities over four years and found that 45 % of them showed no significant gains on a test of critical thinking , complex reasoning , and communication skills after two years of college . Even at the end of four years , 36 % of the students had n't gained those skills .

Employers want the skills that higher education says it provides to students : the ability to critically think , communicate , work in a team , write effectively , and adapt . Yet only about one-quarter of employers say that colleges and universities are doing a good job in preparing students effectively for the challenges of today 's global economy . A recent Gallup poll found that only 11 % of business leaders strongly agreed that college graduates have the skills necessary to succeed on the job . In addition to money , these graduates have spent hours and hours in classrooms and taking tests , but the time does n't seem to have translated into learning .

At the turn of the 20th century , Carnegie created a $ 10 million free pension fund to help professors retire . The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , which was set up to administer the fund , determined that only `` full-time '' faculty would qualify for pensions , which they defined as teaching 12 `` credit units , '' with each unit equal to one hour of faculty-student contact time per week , over a 15-week semester . While originally a narrow measure of faculty workload , the credit hour quickly morphed into much more . The Carnegie Foundation warned against using the credit hour as a proxy for student learning , but the temptation of an easy-to-understand and seemingly standardized measure was too great to resist . It just made organizing the whole higher education enterprise much easier .

If credit hours truly reflected a standardized unit of learning , they would be fully transferable across institutions . An hour in Arizona is an hour in New York . But colleges routinely reject credits earned at other colleges , suggesting that even though they use credit hours themselves , they know they are not a reliable measure of how much students have learned . Many students , however , believe the fiction that the credit hour is a standardized currency and assume that credits will transfer from one school to the next . This is an unfortunate and costly assumption , as community college students in Louisiana will tell you .

Until recently , Louisiana students with an associate degree typically lost between 21 and 24 credits when transferring to a four-year state school . That 's a year of time and money lost . Given that nearly 60 % of students in the United States attend two or more colleges , the nontransfer of credits has huge costs , not only to individuals , but also to the federal government and states that are financing this duplicative classroom time . If higher education does n't trust its own credits , why should anyone else ? And Louisiana students are n't alone ; transfer students across the country lose credits , which lengthens their time to get a degree .

State and federal governments add to the problem , because while they spend hundreds of billions on higher education each year , most of it is for time served , in the form of credit hours , rather than learning achieved .

We need to stop counting time and start counting learning .

What could that look like ? We do n't have to wonder ; some schools are experimenting with measuring learning rather than time -- some for decades . One relatively new program is Southern New Hampshire University 's College for America , or CfA , an online `` competency-based '' Associate of Arts degree aimed at working adults . The program has no courses , no credit hours and no grades . The school has broken down what students with a degree from CfA should know and be able to do , what it calls competencies . CfA worked closely with employers to identify the competencies employers were looking for , like communication , critical thinking and teamwork . Then faculty designed real-world tasks and projects to determine whether students had mastered each competency .

Unlike in credit-hour courses , CfA has no seat-time requirements . Students can move through the program as quickly as they can demonstrate mastery of the competencies . Someone who worked at a PR firm might whiz through the communications competencies and spend more time on the math competencies . And the faster students can progress , the less they will ultimately pay . Students pay $ 1,250 for all-they-can-learn in six months .

There is , however , a downside for students : Self-paced competency-based programs do not fit in neatly with the historically time-based credit hour , making it difficult for students in these types of programs to receive state and federal support . Without access to these dollars , the programs will remain one-offs and unavailable to the majority of Americans who could use them .
