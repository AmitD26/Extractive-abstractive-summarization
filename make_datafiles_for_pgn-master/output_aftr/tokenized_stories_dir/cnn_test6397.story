Editor 's note : Joseph E. Stiglitz , professor at Columbia University , was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2001 for his work on the economics of information . Stiglitz was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration before joining the World Bank as chief economist .

Economist Joseph E. Stiglitz says the strategy followed by the architects of the bank bailout was flawed .

Every day brings further evidence that the losses are greater than had been expected and more and more money will be required .

The question is at last being raised : Perhaps the entire strategy is flawed ? Perhaps what is needed is a fundamental rethinking . The Paulson-Bernanke-Geithner strategy was based on the realization that maintaining the flow of credit was essential for the economy . But it was also based on a failure to grasp some of the fundamental changes in our financial sector since the Great Depression , and even in the last two decades .

For a while , there was hope that simply lowering interest rates enough , flooding the economy with money , would suffice ; but three quarters of a century ago , Keynes explained why , in a downturn such as this , monetary policy is likely to be ineffective . It is like pushing on a string .

Then there was the hope that if the government stood ready to help the banks with enough money -- and enough was a lot -- confidence would be restored , and with the restoration of confidence , asset prices would increase and lending would be restored .

Remarkably , Bush administration Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and company simply did n't understand that the banks had made bad loans and engaged in reckless gambling . There had been a bubble , and the bubble had broken . No amount of talking would change these realities .

Some of what they had left over they used to buy other banks -- to pursue strategic goals for which they could not have found private finance . The last thing in their mind was to restart lending .

The underlying problem is simple : Even in the heyday of finance , there was a huge gap between private rewards and social returns . The bank managers have taken home huge paychecks , even though , over the past five years , the net profits of many of the banks have -LRB- in total -RRB- been negative .

And the social returns have even been less -- the financial sector is supposed to allocate capital and manage risk , and it did neither well . Our economy is paying the price for these failures -- to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars .

Leverage , or borrowing , gives big returns when things are going well , but when things turn sour , it is a recipe for disaster . It was not unusual for investment banks to `` leverage '' themselves by borrowing amounts equal to 25 or 30 times their equity .

The problem is similar to that confronting the original `` cash for trash '' initiative : How do we determine the right price for the insurance ? And almost surely , if we charge the right price , these institutions are bankrupt . They will need massive equity injections and insurance .

There is a slight variant version of this , much like the original Paulson proposal : Buy the bad assets , but this time , not on a one by one basis , but in large bundles . Again , the problem is -- how do we value the bundles of toxic waste we take off the banks ? The suspicion is that the banks have a simple answer : Do n't worry about the details . Just give us a big wad of cash .

This variant adds another twist of the kind of financial alchemy that got the country into the mess . Somehow , there is a notion that by moving the assets around , putting the bad assets in an aggregator bank run by the government , things will get better .

Besides , many of the problems that afflict the financial sector are more pervasive . General Motors and GE both got into the finance business , and both showed that banks had no monopoly on bad risk management .

Many a bank may decide that the better strategy is a conservative one : Hoard one 's cash , wait until things settle down , hope that you are among the few surviving banks and then start lending . Of course , if all the banks reason so , the recession will be longer and deeper than it otherwise would be .

It is standard practice to shut down banks failing to meet basic requirements on capital , but we almost certainly have been too gentle in enforcing these requirements . -LRB- There has been too little transparency in this and every other aspect of government intervention in the financial system . -RRB-

To be sure , shareholders and bondholders will lose out , but their gains under the current regime come at the expense of taxpayers . In the good years , they were rewarded for their risk taking . Ownership can not be a one-sided bet .

There are several other marked advantages . One of the problems today is that the banks potentially owe large amounts to each other -LRB- through complicated derivatives -RRB- . With government owning many of the banks , sorting through those obligations -LRB- `` netting them out , '' in the jargon -RRB- will be far easier .

Inevitably , American taxpayers are going to pick up much of the tab for the banks ' failures . The question facing us is , to what extent do we participate in the upside return ?

Eventually , America 's economy will recover . Eventually , our financial sector will be functioning -- and profitable -- once again , though hopefully , it will focus its attention more on doing what it is supposed to do . When things turn around , we can once again privatize the now-failed banks , and the returns we get can help write down the massive increase in the national debt that has been brought upon us by our financial markets .
