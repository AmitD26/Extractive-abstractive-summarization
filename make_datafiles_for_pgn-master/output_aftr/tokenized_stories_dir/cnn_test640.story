-LRB- CNN -RRB- NBA player Thabo Sefolosha says police caused his season-ending leg injury when he was arrested last week after leaving a nightclub in New York .

In a statement Tuesday , the guard/forward for the Atlanta Hawks described his injury as `` significant , '' and said it `` was caused by the police . ''

TMZ Sports released video last week that shows a group of police officers arresting the 6-foot-7 Sefolosha and taking him to the ground . It also shows an officer within that group getting out a baton and extending it near him , but what may have caused the injury is not clear in the video . Sefolosha appears to be limping as he is led away by officers .

`` I am extremely disappointed that I will not be able to join my teammates on the court during the playoffs and apologize to them for any distraction this incident has caused , '' Sefolosha said in his statement . `` I will be cheering for them every step of the way and will be diligent in my rehabilitation .

Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said in a statement last week , `` This is a very difficult situation for Thabo and our thoughts and support will be with him during his recovery . We know that his approach and dedication will serve him well in his rehabilitation . Our team remains focused and will be prepared as we head into the postseason . ''

Antic , a 31-year-old , 6-foot-11 center/forward , missed the April 8 game against the Brooklyn Nets , but has played since then .

In a joint statement last week , Sefolosha and Antic said they will contest the charges .

The Pacers , with one regular-season game left , are trying to secure the last spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs . If they do , their first-round opponent would be Atlanta .
