-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The San Francisco man arrested after what the FBI says are bomb-making materials were found in his home was charged Tuesday with possession of an illegal destructive device .

Chamberlain , 42 , was arrested Monday night at Crissy Field , a scenic waterfront area popular with tourists where Golden Gate Bridge spans the Pacific entrance to San Francisco Bay .

Authorities had been looking for him after searching his neighborhood Saturday on a tip that he had `` items of great concern '' at his home , FBI Special Agent in Charge David Johnson told reporters .

According to an affidavit filed Sunday by agents seeking an arrest warrant , bomb technicians found a glass jar with batteries and a powdery , green substance inside ; a model rocket motor ; ball bearings and screws ; an igniter for home-made bombs ; a conductive wire ; and a circuit board that could act as a remote-controlled receiver .

The circuit board would have allowed someone to set off the device `` for afar , '' the filing says without elaborating on how far away someone could have been and detonated a bomb .

The block was closed for some 15 hours over the weekend as investigators searched and cleared the area , CNN affiliate KTVU reported .

If convicted of the illegal destructive device possession charge , Chamberlain faces up to 10 years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine .

Johnson declined to say what , if anything , Chamberlain had planned to do or what motivated him .

According to CNN affiliate KPIX , Chamberlain had posted an apparent suicide note to friends on Facebook titled `` Goodbye . '' The letter describes a history of depression , despair over a broken relationship and career problems .

FBI spokesman Peter Lee said investigators were trying to verify the origin of the post .

`` The only one I know that he worked with after he left the party was Gavin Newsom , '' Epstein told KTVU . `` He was an organizer when Gavin ran for mayor . '' Newsom , a Democrat , is now California 's lieutenant governor .

In the letter , the writer says he 's had some positive moments in the past few months .

`` But so much was broken from this past year-and-a-half , and from moments way back before that , I guess it was insurmountable , and the time 's up , '' the writer says . `` Thank you . I 'm sorry . I love you . ''
