Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violence marked the beginning of a two-day referendum as Egyptians went to the polls Tuesday for the second time in 13 months to reshape their country 's future .

In all , 11 people died Tuesday in events relating to the referendum , Ahmed El Ansary , head of the emergency unit at the ministry of health , told CNN .

Clashes were reported in several provinces . At least four were killed in Sohag and one in Beni Seouif in clashes between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and security .

Violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for `` yes '' votes inside or near polling stations and preventing Christian voters from reaching polling stations in parts of Upper Egypt , which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of Islamist groups .

But Hisham Mukhtar , the executive director of the Higher Education Commission , told state-run Masriya TV , `` so far , there have n't been any reports of fraudulent activities and the referendum is being conducted in a very calm and fair atmosphere . ''

On Monday , Mukhtar told Al-Ahram that the nearly 53 million eligible voters were divided among more than 30,000 committees and would be supervised by more than 13,000 judges .

The violence began even before polls opened at 9 a.m. , when a bomb exploded near a Cairo courthouse . No one was hurt , security officials said .

`` This will not scare us , '' said Mohamed Moharram , a teacher who lives near the court . `` In half an hour , I will go to my poll station and cast my ballot . ''

Tuesday 's referendum -- the first national vote since the ouster of the democratically elected President Mohamed Morsy -- is about changing the constitution to ban religious parties and give more power to the military . If the draft is passed , elections should follow .

A deep political divide is evident between supporters of the interim military government and defenders of Morsy .

In an incident outside a Cairo school being used as a polling station , CNN witnessed three uniformed soldiers dragging a man into the school yard . The man was followed by about six people pointing fingers at him and accusing him of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood .

One of the soldiers slapped the man twice in the face , then struck him in his back .

As the man cowered , several police officers arrived and dragged the man toward a corner , where they set upon him .

As soon as CNN Correspondent Reza Sayah began to record cell phone video of the incident , several of the civilians attempted to block his view , and one of the plainclothes officers ordered him to show his identification -- his permanent press credential and his referendum credential -- and took them both .

As Sayah continued to work , the soldier who had slapped the man asked to see the video -- which was nothing more than a jumble of blurred images -- then asked him to delete it .

Another journalist told CNN he had asked the man if that was true , and the man said it was not . At that point , the policeman intervened and shooed the journalist away .

Egyptians voted on the last constitution in December 2012 , while Morsy was still in power . But that constitution was suspended after the military deposed him in July .

The new articles would also give parliament the right to impeach the President in the event of a breach of the provisions of the constitution , Al-Ahram said . Other new articles would criminalize torture , discrimination and arbitrary forced displacement .

What 's behind Egypt 's turmoil

Morsy 's opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values , but Morsy 's supporters say that the military has now returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak , who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011 .

In a statement issued amid the crisis , el-Sisi said , `` Egypt has room for everybody , and we are keen to save every drop of Egyptian blood . '' He added , `` The Egyptian people are free to choose whoever to govern them , while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice . ''

CNN 's Reza Sayah reported from Cairo ; Tom Watkins , Salma Abdelaziz , Holly Yan and Saad Abedine reported from Atlanta . Sarah Sirgany , Richard Allen Greene and Laura Smith-Spark also contributed to this report .
