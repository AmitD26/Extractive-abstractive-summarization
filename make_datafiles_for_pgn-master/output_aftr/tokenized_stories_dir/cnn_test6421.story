To `` visit '' a state , a person has to step outside the airport and breathe the air , according to the organization 's website . Airport layovers mean nothing .

Those who are truly passionate about making it to all 50 states often have their own criteria for crossing them off the list , from a hard-core requirement of staying in a state for more than a month to simply hopping out of the car to snap a picture at the border .

American odyssey : 50 states in 31 years

CNN asked avid 50-staters to run down their requirements . Here 's how it 's done :

Go beyond the border

Back in 1976 , Don Carswell of New Jersey , now 53 , and his friend Tom White made a bet to see who would be the first one to set foot in all 50 states . At stake was a six-pack of beer .

The bet lasted 15 years , until Carswell received a postcard from White declaring he had reached his 50th state . Carswell was still two states shy of completing his goal , making sure he followed the criteria they set when they first made the bet .

`` Being one state shy annoyed me . I needed to take matters into my own hands , '' he said .

Sent to San Francisco on business in 1998 , he extended his stay to rent a car and drive north to Oregon .

Holmes keeps track of the states they 've seen in an Excel spreadsheet , using the list to plan what stops they 'll make on future trips .

The family typically stays in each state they visit for three days , but apart from how long they stay , there 's really only one other agreed-upon criterion .

`` My husband has -LRB- visited -RRB- 46 states . He 's not allowed to get to 50 unless we 're all together . ''

Go back to fill in the blanks

Justin Clark Pollard had a deadline to meet .

He and his wife , Dana , had been taking long road trips during their summers off from teaching since 2009 . It was n't until their second big road trip in 2012 that they saw how close they were to visiting all 50 states , and they decided to go for it . But Pollard wanted to push this goal even further . The deadline : His 30th birthday .

`` I used -LRB- turning -RRB- 30 as a reason to do this , to keep traveling places I might not go otherwise , '' he said .

They even took seasonal jobs at Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska for seven weeks so they would have the opportunity to really witness its wildlife .

When they got back home to Georgia after their Alaska trip , Pollard 's deadline was fast approaching . With only three weeks until he turned 30 , the couple packed up and raced to hit the two states they had yet to see : Michigan and Wisconsin .

These road trips are `` highlight trips . '' Now that he and his wife have seen all 50 states , they 're able to stay in one place a little longer .

`` On the road trips we saw what all the states were known for , and now we can go back and explore them in depth . ''

`` We were both at points where we needed direction in our lives . We were both in ruts and needed a change to do something else , '' said Sweetman , who quit her job before leaving on this trip .

Since the two women started on their journey from their homes in Minnesota on April 28 , they have already picked up nine states . They have been staying in each state for anywhere from three to five days , devoting one full day to volunteering and staying at campsites or with other volunteers they work with .

In West Virginia , the women worked in a community garden with Conscious Harvest Cooperative , a group of West Virginia University students and Morgantown residents who grow food for local pantries . In the Adirondacks in upstate New York , they found a local farmer and helped him grow tomatoes . Next , they 're volunteering in Boston with Hope Lodge , baking snacks for the families of cancer patients .

But they 're really in no rush to finish their journey across the country . They want to live in the moment and see where it takes them , Sweetman says .

`` We want to connect with the different people we meet on this trip , '' Sweetman said . `` There are so many people who have opened their homes and their hearts to us , and that 's how we get a true idea of what a place is really like . ''
