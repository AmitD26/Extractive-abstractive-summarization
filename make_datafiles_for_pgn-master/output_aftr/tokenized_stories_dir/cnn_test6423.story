-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Despite airstrikes and international outrage against ISIS militants , the terror group is overrunning Iraqi forces and slowly marching on toward a province on Baghdad 's doorstep . And as alarming developments piled up over the weekend , Iraqi forces threatened to flee if the U.S. military does not intervene .

Here are where things stand :

On Baghdad 's doorstep

ISIS fighters are making headway against poorly equipped local forces . The Islamist extremists appear set to take Kobani , a key Syrian town along the Turkish border . Next up : a province on Baghdad 's doorstep .

The terror group came within 25 kilometers -LRB- 15.5 miles -RRB- of Baghdad 's airport , according to the leader of U.S. military efforts to fight ISIS in Iraq .

`` You 're not going to wait until they 're climbing over the wall , '' Dempsey said . `` Had -LRB- ISIS forces -RRB- overrun the Iraqi unit , it was a straight shot to the Baghdad airport . ''

Anbar province at risk

If the province falls , the Sunni extremists would take over an area from the perimeter of Iraq 's capital to Raqqa in Syria , according to Falleh al-Issawi , the provincial council 's deputy head .

The base outside Hit was one of the Shiite-led government 's few remaining military outposts in the predominantly Sunni province .

Targeting law enforcement

Iraqi army forces and Anbar tribesmen have threatened to abandon their weapons if the U.S. military does not intervene .

Iraqi officials have been adamant that they do n't want U.S. forces on the ground . President Barack Obama has not shown any intent to deploy any .

`` This is frustrating for all parties , including those who are trying to assist us . We had previously been in contact through a channel started by you , but then this stopped for reasons best known to you , '' Cantlie 's sister , Jessica Cantlie , said in a statement .

`` We strongly challenge those holding John to return to your previously opened channel , to which we continue to send messages and await your response so that in keeping with everyone 's wishes , we can restart dialogue . We implore IS to reinitiate direct contact . ''

The militants are gradually taking control of a large chunk of Kobani .

Monday was one of the most violent days since ISIS launched its assault on the city , with sounds of fierce fighting , including gunfire and explosions , CNN staff on the Syria-Turkey border said .

If they 're successful , the militants would control three official border crossings between Turkey and Syria and a stretch of the border about 60 miles -LRB- 97 kilometers -RRB- long .

The U.S. military said it and its allies had attacked ISIS on Sunday and Monday , launching four airstrikes southwest of Kobani , three northeast of the city and one northwest of Raqqa .
