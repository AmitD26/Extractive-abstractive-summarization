`` I was so happy , '' Walters remembers . `` I yelled for Matt . I said , ` Do you know what this means ? Do you know what this means ? ' ''

`` I was like , Violet 's covered now ! '' Walters remembers . `` We 're okay . We can breathe . ''

But now Violet 's parents are worried they wo n't be able to breathe easily again .

This week , the Supreme Court is hearing a debate on health care reform . The court could keep the reform intact , repeal parts of it , or get rid of the law altogether .

`` I 'm really scared , '' Walters says . `` Like , I-can ` t-sleep scared . ''

` Completely blue in her crib '

Violet McManus was born healthy , but when she was 11 months old her parents woke up in the middle of the night in their Novato , California , home to find her having a seizure .

`` She was completely blue in her crib and shaking , '' Walters remembers .

She 's now on two drugs to control the seizures and carries oxygen with her wherever she goes because she stops breathing when she has her seizures . She needs speech therapy and frequent doctor 's visits .

Health care reform made lifetime limits illegal -- which is why Violet 's family breathed easier when it passed -- but now her parents are worried the Supreme Court could restore the limits and Violet would lose her insurance . Walters has been so passionate about health care reform she contacted the office of Sen. Barbara Boxer -LRB- D-California -RRB- and MomsRising.org to advocate for the law .

Several provisions of health care reform have already gone into effect , so millions of other people , like Violet McManus , stand to lose a lot if all or part of it is reversed .

Seniors and people with disabilities have saved $ 3.2 billion on prescription drugs because of health care reform and insurance companies and 45 million women have received free mammograms and pap smears because of health care reform .

There are ripple effects , too .

After health care reform passed , Walters and McManus felt more secure about Violet 's future and decided to have another child . Violet 's little brother , Rory , was born two weeks ago .

The protesters object to being forced to pay for something they do n't want , but Walters and McManus see it differently .

At any point in time they say someone could find themselves in a difficult situation like they 're in now and would want a system that insures you no matter how sick you are .

As McManus puts it , `` I think people just sort of need to change their mindset about health care . ''
