-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The spread of polio constitutes an international public health emergency , the World Health Organization declared Monday .

`` If unchecked , this situation could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world 's most serious vaccine preventable diseases , '' the WHO said in a statement .

At the end of 2013 , 60 % of polio cases resulted from the international spread of the virus , and `` there was increasing evidence that adult travelers contributed to the spread , '' according to the statement .

Of the 10 countries currently infected with polio , three -- Pakistan , Syria and Cameroon -- have allowed the virus to spread internationally , according to an emergency committee convened by the organization , which met late last month .

Of those , 59 were in Pakistan . No other country has reported more than four cases , and the only country with four was Afghanistan , he said .

The committee 's decision to declare an international public health emergency means that Pakistan , Syria and Cameroon are urged to declare national public health emergencies regarding polio and ensure all residents and long-term visitors are vaccinated .

In addition , the WHO said , citizens of those countries traveling internationally should be vaccinated before their departure and carry proof in the form of an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis .

`` A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop this international spread of wild poliovirus and to prevent new spread with the onset of the high transmission season in May/June 2014 , '' according to the organization .

Nations infected with polio , but not spreading the disease internationally now include Afghanistan , Equatorial Guinea , Ethiopia , Iraq , Israel , Somalia and Nigeria , the WHO said . Those nations were also encouraged to take similar measures to ensure high levels of vaccination in residents and travelers .

`` These recommendations are not legally binding in the strict sense ... but they do carry substantial weight because , of course , they are in the context of a legally binding international treaty , '' Aylward said Monday .

No cases of polio have been detected in Israel , but the WHO previously reported the virus was found in sewage samples , as well as in stool samples from children who had been immunized .

In March , Southeast Asia , including India , was declared polio-free . India , the world 's second most populous country , was able to achieve the goal by deploying immunization efforts to reach those most vulnerable , according to UNICEF .
