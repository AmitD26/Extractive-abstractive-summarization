But in late 2011 , if it exists , you can bet there 's a host of mobile apps designed to help with it .

So , feeling prematurely full of holiday cheer , we 've compiled a few apps that might help make your Turkey Day a good one .

No need to thanks us ... just save us a drumstick .

-LRB- Bonus : If , despite all this digital help , things go horribly awry , do n't fret . Whether it 's a scorched bird or a visit from Bumpus 's hounds , you can still load up the family `` Christmas Story '' style , and head out for a Chinese feast or other dinner on the town , using apps like Open Table , UrbanSpoon and Foodspotting . -RRB-

While much of the app is geared toward folks actually attending the parade , there are features that can be helpful even if you 're watching from home in a tryptophan haze .

It provides a complete list of participants in the parade , along with their marching order , a history of the event and traffic camera video that shows more views than just those available on TV . If you happen to be in the crowd , it offers info like a detailed map , nearby dining spots and , perhaps most importantly , the location of public restrooms .

Platform : iOS and Android

Use : Make sure to not miss Snoopy

The Professional Chef

Yes , this is a $ 50 app . -LRB- OK , $ 49.99 , but you figure out something to do with that digital penny . -RRB-

And it 's iPad only . But if you 're serious about your kitchen pursuits , this one might just be worth it , and not just for ways to craft haute cuisine giblet gravy .

From the Culinary Institute of America , Professional Chef is designed to maximize what the tablet computer can do . Yes , there are tons of recipes . But there are also instructional videos with Culinary Institute chefs , discussion boards , nearly 750 photos and the ability to highlight and make notes on your favorites .

Downloading the app allows you access to one free chapter -LRB- we 're not sure if `` My Turkey , My Self '' is in there -RRB- , and individual chapters can be purchased for $ 2.99 .

Turkey Plucker

It 's a game called Turkey Plucker . Three guesses what you do .

If you guessed `` pluck a turkey , '' congratulations . You have at least a basic grasp on the English language , and you clearly understand the remarkable range of possibilities in the app-development world .

You can also share your score on Facebook , as the app 's description says , to `` brag how fast of a plucker you are . ''
