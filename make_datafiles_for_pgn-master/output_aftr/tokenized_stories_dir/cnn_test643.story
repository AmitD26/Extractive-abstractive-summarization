Ol Pejeta Conservancy , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- At first glance , Sudan looks like any other northern white rhino : stout and agile , with square lips .

He grazes under the hot sun , his massive head lowered to the ground , at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya .

When he 's not wallowing in his enclosure , he waddles around the sprawling savannah , stopping briefly to drink water from a concrete hole .

But Sudan is not just any rhino . He 's the last known male northern white rhino left in the entire world .

The animals are under 24-hour protection by armed guards . Rhinos are targeted by poachers , fueled by the belief in Asia that their horns cure various ailments . Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs .

In addition to round-the-clock security , the conservancy has put radio transmitters on the animals and dispatches incognito rangers into neighboring communities to gather intelligence on poaching .

Though the three northern white rhinos are physiologically healthy , age might be a factor , says George Paul , the deputy veterinarian at the conservancy .

`` Sudan is currently old and may not be able to naturally mount and mate with a female , '' he says .

In addition , he has a low sperm count , which complicates natural and scientific efforts , experts say .

Najin could conceive , but her hind legs are so weak , she may be unable to support a mounted male .

`` There has been recorded mating between different pairs over the last few years , but not conceptions , '' Paul says . `` Based on a recent health examination conducted , both animals have a regular estrus cycle , but no conception has been recorded . ''

And if one is not recorded soon , the beloved animal will go extinct .

In a race against time , international experts are resorting to science to try to sustain the subspecies .

`` In other countries , success has been achieved with embryo transfer in a different rhino species , thus that , as a technique , can be presupposed to be the most promising , '' Paul says . `` However , consultations are ongoing amongst different reproductive technique experts on the way forward .

In another incident , another male , Angalifu , died at the San Diego Zoo last year , bringing the subspecies closer to extinction .

A total of five remain in captivity worldwide : three in Kenya , and one each at zoos in San Diego and the Czech Republic .
