`` We want you to have a good time but in the same sense we want you to act respectful and if you do n't we have a tool to deal with it , '' Benke added .

That tool would be a ticket from a police officer for a maximum fine of $ 500 . And the ban is n't just for singing .

The measure reads as follows :

`` It shall be unlawful for any person to yell , shout , hoot , whistle , or sing on the public streets , particularly between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. or at any time or place so as to annoy or disturb the comfort , or repose of persons in any office , or in any dwelling , or other type of residence , or of any persons in the vicinity . ''

`` There are a lot of visitors to the beach 24 hours a day , '' he said , `` and we just need a way to maintain the quiet family atmosphere . ''

He said the welcome mat is always open for people to enjoy the town but made it clear loud , disruptive noises , including public singing during quiet hours , will not be tolerated .

`` There are probably six or seven little restaurants in the town that stay open until 2 a.m. , '' he said . `` People are leaving , -LRB- having -RRB- had a good time all night . Maybe they do n't know they are being loud and think it 's okay . But it 's not . ''
