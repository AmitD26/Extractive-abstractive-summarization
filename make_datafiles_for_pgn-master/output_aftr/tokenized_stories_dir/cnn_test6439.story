-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barenaked Ladies have nixed their plans to play at SeaWorld after viewing CNN 's `` Blackfish '' documentary .

`` This is a complicated issue , and we do n't claim to understand all of it , but we do n't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time , '' the band said on a Facebook post late Wednesday night .

A park spokesman told CNN that the show has been taken off the theme park 's concert schedule .

The decision to cancel the Canadian rock band 's performance came two days after drummer Tyler Stewart posted a tweet saying the group is `` looking at options '' after viewing the documentary .

The documentary -- which aired on CNN last month -- tells the story of the SeaWorld trainer who was killed in 2010 by an orca named Tilikum .

Fans launched an online petition last week asking the group to cancel after the Barenaked Ladies announced it would perform at SeaWorld 's Orlando park on February 15 , 2014 , during its `` Bands , Brew & BBQ '' events .

Garrett said he was `` disappointed '' when he heard the group was scheduled to play there `` in light of all the horrific information we 're learning . ''

`` I 'm hoping to grab the band 's attention on this issue and ask them , on behalf of all their animal-loving fans , to reconsider performing there , '' Garrett wrote . His petition had gained more than 9,200 signatures by Wednesday afternoon .

The park 's website does not list Barenaked Ladies on the schedule . February 15 and four other weekend dates just say `` Coming Soon . ''
