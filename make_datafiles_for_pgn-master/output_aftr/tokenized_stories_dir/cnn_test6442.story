-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In this fast-paced , dog-eat-dog , `` I got mine '' country , happiness may seem like a luxury item : something extra , not integral , to the way we measure success .

But how backward is this ? Happiness is a foundational concept in life . The Founding Fathers considered `` life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness '' important enough to go to war over it .

Some organizations , like the Happiness Institute , an Australia-based organization that provides services based on the science of happiness , is using it as a start date for a seven-day challenge aimed at boosting your level of happiness . For example , today 's challenge focuses on creating a positive vision of your future .

Talk shows and commercials regularly engage our natural happiness craving . The song `` Happy '' by Pharrell Williams has been No. 1 on the iTunes charts for a month . The artist even created a 24-hour video of people who are singing and dancing to the song .

Billboard has created a top 20 Happy songs of all time , which include the classics `` Happy Together '' by the Turtles and `` Do n't Worry Be Happy '' from Bobby McFerrin .

You get my point .

For starters , happiness is not about `` stuff . '' It appears that winning the lottery may not provide long-term satisfaction . One study found that a year after gaining that winning ticket , well , people often feel no happier and in some cases less happy . Strange , but true .

And research shows that once your basic financial needs are met , the way to increase your level of overall happiness has more to do with creating experiences .

Happiness is also about being `` present . '' Jennifer Aakers , Melanie Rudd , and Cassie Mogilner , from Stanford University , conducted a study that identified five principles that link happiness to how one spends time .

A key principle focuses on expanding your time . For example , when you are having lunch with a friend , focus on that moment . Slow down time by not thinking about future events -- such as picking up dry cleaning , grocery shopping or other errands . Instead , toss your phone , tune out the world and tune in to the person in front of you .

No , happiness is not overrated . But so what if it were ? If there is anything in life we should overdose on , it is this .

Being in a joyful place will help you smile even when times are tough . So , go ahead , pour yourself a glass of happy , because your happy hour is now .

Cheers .
