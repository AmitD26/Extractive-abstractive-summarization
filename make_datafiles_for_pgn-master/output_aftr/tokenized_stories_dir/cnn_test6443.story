-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Burkina Faso 's military chief is now the head of state of the West African nation , after unrest that led to the resignation of President Blaise Compaore .

Faced with violent protests demanding an end to his 27-year rule , Compaore initially dissolved the government but said he would stay in power until elections could be carried out .

Traore appealed for calm and called for a return to a normal constitutional process . Security forces , including the military , will continue to maintain order and safety in the country , Traore said .

Upon his resignation , Compaore appealed via Twitter for `` free elections to be held in Burkina Faso within 90 days at the most . ''

France , the former colonial ruler of what is today Burkina Faso , welcomed the President 's resignation and called for elections to happen quickly .

Unrest has gripped Burkina Faso -- a key partner for Western countries in the campaign against Islamist militants -- since protests against Compaore 's government turned violent Thursday .

Compaore had been in office since he took power after a bloody coup in 1987 .

The opposition had called for Compaore 's immediate resignation . In Bobo-Dioulasso , the country 's second-largest city , protesters reportedly tore down a statue of Compaore .

Flights in and out of Ouagadougou , the capital , have been suspended , according to the Burkina Faso Embassy in Washington . Embassy personnel told CNN that it was still issuing visas but that there were no flights at the moment .
