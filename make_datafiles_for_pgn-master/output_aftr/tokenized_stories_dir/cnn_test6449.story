-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just in time for Halloween , the new season of `` American Horror Story '' has fans checking for monsters -- actually , make that clowns -- under the bed .

`` American Horror Story 's '' previous seasons have involved a haunted house , an asylum and a coven of witches .

Several of the FX series ' usual players are back , including Jessica Lange as the show 's ringleader ; Evan Peters as Jimmy Darling , a.k.a. the housewife-pleasing `` Lobster Boy '' ; Kathy Bates as Ethel , the `` bearded lady '' ; Angela Bassett as the three-breasted Desiree Dupree ; and Sarah Paulson as conjoined twins Bette and Dot -- and yes , Paulson plays both parts .

In other words , exactly what you want to see right before you turn out the lights . It was apparently a bit much for some .

'' ` Freak Show ' ... still has the high style we 've grown to expect , '' said the New York Times ' Mike Hale . `` And it still has plenty of clever touches in word and picture ... But it 's not particularly scary , and does n't even feel that creepy or freakish , despite the sideshow setting and the obvious attempt to emulate one of the eeriest of American movies , Tod Browning 's ` Freaks , ' from 1932 . ''

Entertainment Weekly agreed that `` American Horror Story : Freak Show '' owes much to that 1932 film but adds that `` Murphy and Falchuk pay homage to that movie while skillfully mixing fresh aspects with the familiar . ` AHS ' may no longer have the element of surprise on its side , but it remains , to quote the lyrics of a certain David Bowie tune performed by -LRB- Jessica -RRB- Lange , the freakiest show .
