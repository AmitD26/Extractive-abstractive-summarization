Swat , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just over one week ago , Pakistani authorities paraded 11 children accused of terrorism in front of the local media . The boys , aged 10 to 16 , were apprehended while attempting to plant home-made explosives on behalf of local militant groups operating in and around the city of Quetta , in Balochistan .

The boys ' arrest highlights Pakistan 's worsening civil strife and underscores how Pakistani terrorist groups continue to exploit children .

A few weeks ago , my colleague Mia Bloom and I traveled to Pakistan 's Swat Valley to see firsthand how the Pakistani government is working to solve this problem .

Swat District includes the city of Mingora , part of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province which borders Afghanistan .

Renowned for its picturesque vistas , the Swat region fell victim to a brutal reign of terror by the Pakistani Taliban , or TTP in 2008 . Faced with an emboldened TTP , Pakistan 's national army launched an 18-month counterinsurgency campaign . Law and order were restored and the Taliban forced to retreat .

Some of these children were even prepared to become suicide bombers .

Sabaoon joins a growing list of similar initiatives that have cropped up around the globe since the mid-2000s . Perhaps the best-known terrorist rehabilitation program is in Saudi Arabia .

Collectively characterized as `` de-radicalization '' programs , it is more accurate to call them `` risk reduction '' initiatives . They represent a change in the way counterterrorism campaigns are waged , and share the goal of reducing the risk of re-engagement in terrorism once the program 's graduates are allowed to return to their communities .

So far , Sabaoon has had 188 ` students ' fully participate in its program of risk assessment and rehabilitation .

In Pakistan , the TTP showed no hesitation in their use of children for terrorism . In fact , `` recruitment '' is hardly the right word . It became clear from our conversations at Sabaoon that these children had little if any say in their induction .

In some cases , families faced a horrible choice -- pay an enormous financial tax -LRB- double the annual wage -RRB- or surrender a child to the movement .

Most of the children recalled overwhelmingly negative experiences at the training camps . After performing menial tasks , they were locked in a 4x5 meter room for the rest of the day . Some reported being repeatedly beaten , and in a few cases , sexually assaulted by senior figures .

One child with whom we spent some time graduated from such deplorable conditions only to be ` allowed ' to become a martyr , changing his mind literally at the last second . That boy is now one of Sabaoon 's brightest hopes for successful rehabilitation and reintegration , and a potential role model for younger children at Sabaoon . But he remains profoundly traumatized by his experiences .

Other children actually reported having had positive experiences with the TTP . Some became involved through family members already in the movement . For them , adventure , camaraderie , and a sense of purpose proved all too real . Terrorism was the family business , and even if the children did n't want to get involved , how could they refuse ?

Nobody knows exactly how old some of the children are . Many do n't have birth certificates and do n't know their own age themselves .

Abdul -LRB- not his real name -RRB- is now about 17-18 years old . He is very soft-spoken and painfully shy , but spoke English very well . He has big brown eyes and a wonderful , broad smile . He was very thin , but so shy he would n't take the food offered to him at lunch .

We were very sensitive to the trauma he had experienced at the hands of the terrorists . The staff briefed us about the abuse he endured . In our limited time with Abdul , we were careful not to ask him anything that might upset him so we focused only on speaking about his future , and how he has adapted to life after Sabaoon .

He is one of Sabaoon 's role models .

But time is not on their side .

A few years ago , research conducted by Dr. Mia Bloom highlighted the changing nature of women 's involvement in terrorism . Today a similar argument could be made for the involvement of young children . Both in Pakistan and Afghanistan , the child suicide bomber has come to represent a routine terrorist profile .

What the rising tide of child militants means for the development of counter-terrorism initiatives , or even child protection , is unclear .

Sabaoon alone will certainly not solve this problem , but it , and programs like it must continue to develop if we are to truly prevent the next generation of militants .
