So pucker up . We 'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly , along with the most flattering shades for day and night .

For foolproof application , stick with sheer , subdued shades in the morning and save deep , bold colors -LRB- which require more time and precision -RRB- for night .

Daytime equation

2 . Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube . A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color . Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose .

3 . Blot , reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain , says Bua . `` The color looks more natural and lasts longer . '' Instead of tissues , use lint-free blotting papers , like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens -LRB- $ 10 -RRB- .

3 . Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding , says Robin Fredriksz , who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip . To avoid an unnaturally dark outline , use a shade that 's lighter than your lipstick , like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum -LRB- $ 8 ; at drugstores -RRB- .

4 . Brush on color for more control . Try : Shu Uemura Kolinsky Portable Extra lipbrush -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- with Isadora Perfect Moisture lipstick in Bordeaux Red -LRB- $ 11 -RRB- .
