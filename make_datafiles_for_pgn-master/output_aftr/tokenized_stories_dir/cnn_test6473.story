From samba and carnival to food , music and religion , African culture is everywhere in Brazil .

Brazil was the last country to abolish the slave trade in 1888 . More than half of Brazilians now identify themselves as black or of mixed race , according to the latest census .

Rio de Janeiro now has the most famous carnival in the world , attracting an estimated 1.1 million visitors to the city this year and with 5.3 million people taking part in street parties , according to the English language newspaper The Rio Times .

After the abolition of slavery , the rituals of the Catholic former colonialists and their former slaves merged to form the origins of modern carnival , according to the Rio Times .

One explanation for the origins of carnival is that it began in a Catholic church , Our Lady of the Rosary , built by slaves in the 1700s whose masters wanted them to convert to Catholicism .

`` So they were able to organize a celebration where they would choose a man and a woman , and they would be the king and queen of Congo . That celebration turned out to be the beginning of carnival celebrated in Brazil . ''

St Benedict , whose name is remembered in Our Lady of the Rosary church , was a slave from North Africa , who promised to devote himself to Catholicism if he became a free man , Desales said .

Brazil 's patron saint , Our Lady of Aparecida , a black clay statue of the Virgin Mary , was -- according to some -- found by runaway slaves on their way to Quilombo , a community of runaway slaves .

Luis Sacopa , president of the association of Quilombos , runs a restaurant with his 17 members of his family in a piece of jungle in what is now an expensive suburb of Rio de Janeiro .

His grandparents found this piece of land after escaping slavery .

The family has fought a legal battle to hold on to its land against the threat of eviction , and now has official protection for their right to remain .

`` Thanks to god we have had success and we 're still here at the end of our dispute , '' said Sacopa . `` Thanks to god , the family has united , we 're fighting and we 're winning the fight against the elite in this expensive neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro . ''

Sacopa said he was able to resist eviction with the help of his Orixas , gods of the Yoruba people of Southwest Nigeria , Benin and Togo .

A new Historical Circuit of African Heritage opened in Rio de Janeiro in 2010 to help tourists and descendants of slaves reconnect with the past slavery .

The project began after workers installing a new drainage system in the central districts of Saude and Gamboa discovered hundreds of personal objects belonging to African slaves , according to the Rio Times .

Archaeologists established that this was the site of the 19th century slave trading complex , the Cais do Valongo , or Valongo Quays .

Many of the discoveries are now on display in the Valongo Gardens , the newspaper reported .

Another discovery of recent years is the remains of a squalid slave cemetery in the courtyard of a home in central Rio de Janeiro .

Ana de la Merced Guimaraes , the homeowner who discovered the bones in her courtyard , said : `` When we started a reform in our house , we found all these bones . We thought it was a family grave , but there was so much we thought maybe it had been a serial killer .

`` But then we calmed down and talked about it and called a lawyer and the police . And he said do n't worry , we are n't going to accuse you , it 's probably something very old .

`` A neighbor told us , a long time ago , your street was a slave cemetery . ''
