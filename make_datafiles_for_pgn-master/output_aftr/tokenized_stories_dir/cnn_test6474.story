British-born Samantha Lewthwaite was once seen as a kind of victim of the July 2005 London terror attacks -- the pregnant wife of one of the suicide bombers who killed 52 people , now left alone to care for her children .

She condemned the attacks but then vanished . Now , Kenyan authorities say , she is the infamous `` White Widow , '' alleged to be a supporter and financier of people linked to the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab .

Reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed Nairobi , Kenya 's , upscale Westgate Shopping Mall on Saturday -- an operation for which Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility -- have prompted a slew of media speculation that she might have been involved .

Interpol on Thursday issued a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for Lewthwaite at Kenya 's request .

A convert to Islam

Now age 29 , Lewthwaite met Lindsay , a British Muslim , when she was 17 , according to the Daily Mail . A convert to Islam , she married him in 2002 .

After the London attacks , she denied having knowledge of the plans . Later , Kenyan authorities said , she emerged in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa and became part of a terror cell linked to Al-Shabaab .

In December 2011 , Kenyan authorities raided three homes in Mombasa , including one allegedly used by Lewthwaite , and arrested some people on suspicion of planning to destroy a bridge , a ferry and hotels frequented by Western tourists .

A security guard who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity in 2012 said he saw a white woman leave the residence hours before the raid . Authorities have yet to catch up to her .

Kenyan authorities also suspect Lewthwaite of hatching a plot to break fellow Briton Jermaine Grant out of jail after he was arrested in connection with the alleged Mombasa plot .

` An innocent young person '

But in the English town of Aylesbury , in Buckinghamshire , where Lewthwaite lived with Lindsay for a time , she is remembered by local councilor Raj Khan as a good , helpful woman .

`` She was an innocent young person , '' said Khan , who said he knew Lewthwaite as a `` family friend '' before the July 2005 bombings .

A family friend , local councilor Joan Baird , said Monday that Allen was elderly and ill , and had been `` in and out of hospital . ''

`` This is very distressing for all the family , a decent family . And it got worse with the news -LRB- from Kenya -RRB- . It 's also very distressing for the people of Banbridge , on behalf of the family , '' she said .

According to the Belfast Telegraph , Lewthwaite 's father was a British soldier posted to the area who married a local woman .

Kenyan officials have given differing accounts of the involvement of a white woman in the Westgate Mall attack .

Kenyan State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu told CNN that `` multiple witnesses '' have said they saw a woman among the attackers .

But he cautioned , `` We do n't know for sure that we had a woman . And secondly , because of the bodies trapped under the rubble , we do n't know if she is who everyone says she might be . ''

Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku previously told reporters that all the attackers were men . Some of them apparently had dressed as women , he said .

But on Wednesday , he revisited the speculation that a woman was involved , saying that authorities were `` hearing possibilities and information , '' including from the public . `` We want to again request you to allow the forensic experts to determine whether that is true , '' he said .

Female involvement in such an attack would be `` very unusual , '' said CNN security analyst Peter Bergen .

`` Typically these groups are misogynist , '' he said . `` Their view is the woman should be in a home and shrouded in a body veil . ''
