He is lauded as one of Africa 's most unique voices , with a fanbase stretching across the world , but South African singing sensation Vusi Mahlasela remains faithful to his roots .

For more than 20 years , the legendary singer has been celebrated globally for his powerful vocals and universal messages of freedom and human kindness . He has toured the world extensively and collaborated with major music stars such as Sting , Paul Simon and Dave Matthews .

He says it all started for him here .

Perhaps his most famous song , `` When You Come Back , '' has become an anthem in the country , celebrating the return of those who escaped apartheid and lived in exile .

Mahlasela says the song 's hopeful lyrics , written years before South Africa始s democratic change , were also for those arrested , like former South African president Nelson Mandela -- not surprisingly , Mahlasela was asked in 1994 to perform at Mandela始s inauguration .

Passionate about spreading the traditional African philosophy , Ubuntu , many of Mahlasela始s global tours throughout his career have been benefit concerts . He has also become an ambassador to the 46664 foundation -- named after Mandela始s prison number and dedicated to raising awareness about HIV/AIDS .

`` That spirit of collective good , it 's still in the principle of ubuntu , '' he says . `` Everyday kindness , love , forgiveness , reconciliation , so everything about us that makes us human . ''

Honoring a career that spans 20 years and 10 albums , Mahlasela was recently given a lifetime achievement award in South Africa .

`` It is to give music lessons , but also to develop even those who are playing already and we do have outreach programs for primary schools , '' says Mahlasela .

`` My music is sort of more accessible to every listener , young and old , they love my music , '' he says .

`` And I 've seen it also happen that I have also gotten that energy back from the people -- performing and after that when I 'm going out there to sign CDs people will come to me with quite a lot of different great compliments , so it gives me the pleasurable feeling that I can really give something to the people and that will really change their lives to the better .
