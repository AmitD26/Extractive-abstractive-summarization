About three years ago , he deep-froze the body of his mother , Faye Whiteford , law officers said .

They do n't think he killed her . She appears to have died of natural causes at the age of 96 in spring of 2011 , Pulaski County Sheriff 's Office said in a statement Thursday .

Since Jon Whiteford is dead , there are no charges against him .

Behind the 8-ball

He took care of her but was also dependent upon her Social Security and retirement benefits .

When she died , he did n't want to lose that income , the sheriff 's office said . So he concealed her death and postponed her funeral .

`` I guess he was afraid to report that his mom died because of what I said about the funds disappearing , '' Fried said .

Whiteford found a house to rent in another county , but was in disrepair , not fit to live in without some work .

In the meantime , Whiteford moved next door to his mother 's former home , into the house owned by a friend who did not live in it .

Inquisitive law officers

Eventually , authorities wondered why there were no signs of life from his mother , and a fraud investigation into the Social Security benefits began .

On March 29 this year , a deputy decided to go question Jon Whiteford .

Some three weeks after his suicide , police brought in dogs trained to sniff out human remains , but they caught no scent of Faye Whiteford 's body .

During the investigation , detectives came across the property Jon Whiteford had rented and decided to check it out .

The sheriff 's office is looking for witnesses to answer many of the questions about what happened to her that her son would not .
