Just days before the Nobel committee announces the winner of this year 's Nobel Peace Prize , the world found out who stands at the opposite extreme on the quest for peace and justice . We have discovered who the biggest cowards on the planet are today .

The competition for the mark of shame is hard fought , but the title goes to the men who approached a van carrying girls home from school in Pakistan on Tuesday and asked for one very special 14-year-old . Then shot her in the head .

And why are they so afraid of Malala ? Mostly , because she is not afraid of them .

And because Malala is a relentless advocate of education for girls , something the Taliban find very threatening .

The cravenness that has come to define the group -- also known as the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan , or TTP -- is easily matched by Malala 's stunning bravery . The fearless activist for girls ' education now lies in a hospital bed trying to recover from serious injuries to her head and neck . Overnight doctors performed emergency surgery to remove a bullet near her spinal cord and to relieve swelling in her brain .

Shortly after Tuesday 's assassination attempt , which also left two of Malala 's school friends wounded , TTP spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan acknowledged the group tried to kill her and vowed they will try to do it again if she survives . As is common , he couched the threats in extreme interpretations of Islam and on repression and intimidation of women . `` Any female that , by any means , plays a role in the war against the mujahedeen , '' Ehsan declared , `` should be killed . ''

Malala started to become a problem for the TTP when she was just 11 . The Pakistani Taliban , who hold the same ideology but are not directly affiliated with the Afghan Taliban , had taken over Pakistan 's Swat Valley . Pakistani politicians were turning a blind eye to what had become an increasingly brutal regime . They executed their critics , ordered all men to grow beards and whipped women in public as punishment for real , imagined or fabricated offenses .

The Taliban reportedly had destroyed more than 200 schools and ordered all girls ' schools shut down when Malala slowly emerged from obscurity . In 2009 , she started writing a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym , talking about her dreams for the future and how the Taliban were pushing those aspirations further and further out of reach .

Her story helped bring attention to the disaster befalling the population of the storied Swat Valley . At about the same time , the videotaped beating of a 17-year-old girl by a group of Taliban went viral in Pakistan , adding chilling images to a girl 's lament .

Rural areas of Pakistan and the districts near the Afghanistan border include deeply traditional regions from where the Taliban took much of their social views . Many practices , particularly regarding women , are horrifying to more modern Pakistanis living in places such as the capital , Islamabad .

The country has become a dangerous incubator of fanatically enforced prejudice . A prominent politician who opposed Pakistan 's controversial blasphemy laws was killed last year . Just last month a Christian girl was sent to prison after her neighbors concocted blasphemy charges against her .

The country has become one of the front lines of the struggle between modernity and the deeply intolerant , misogynistic practices dating back centuries . Malala , despite her young age , stands at the battle line of the push for equality .

In 2002 , just after the regime was toppled , a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of mental health in the country found a vast majority of Afghan women suffering from depression , anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder .

A decade later , in bordering Pakistan , in the aftermath of the assassination attempt against Malala , many question if the threat has receded to the extent the authorities claim .

By trying to kill a bright and admired young girl in cold blood , the Taliban have revealed not only their own moral makeup . They have also reawakened the Pakistani people to the threat posed by extremists and the choices the country faces .
