`` He was very charismatic , '' Leslie Wagner-Wilson , a Jonestown survivor , says of the Rev. Jim Jones .

With the cadence and fervor of a Baptist preacher , the charm and folksiness of a country storyteller and the zeal and fury of a maniacal dictator , Jones exhorted his followers to a fever pitch , audiotapes recovered from Jonestown reveal .

As he spoke , they applauded , shouted , cheered . One follower who survived the `` revolutionary suicide '' at Jonestown on November 18 , 1978 , said that Jones was the most dynamic speaker he had ever heard .

Like all powerful speakers , Jones ' greatest asset was his ability to determine what listeners wanted to hear and give it to them in simple language that appealed to them on an almost instinctual level .

`` He was very charismatic , very charismatic , '' said Leslie Wilson , who survived that fateful day in Jonestown by walking away from the settlement before the cyanide that killed more than 900 Peoples Temple members was distributed . She was one of 33 people who began the day in Jonestown and lived to tell the tale .

Jones further enraptured crowds with faith healings -- laying hands on disabled or sick people who would miraculously be cured of any ailments . Though insiders later revealed that these healings were staged , Jones ' mastery of word and presentation left few in attendance with any doubts about his abilities .

`` The only ethic by which we can lift mankind today is some form of socialism , '' he said in another 1972 sermon . `` There 's a smattering of it in the , in the New Testament . It 's very evidently clear on the day of Pentecost that they that believed were together and had all things common . ''

Socialism , he said , is `` older than the Bible by far . ''

`` I been tired for 25 years , '' the 47-year-old Jones preached in 1978 , his voice rising steadily in pitched anger . `` I 'm tired of looking at people 's faces that do n't give a f -- for 25 years , I watch and they do n't give a g ------ . You can lay it out in front of them , and they will not listen . They will not read . They will not do anything , and that 's why I have to suffer every day and all night and all through the hours , because I will have nobody but a few that will carry the burden with me . Because you hide yourself away in ignorance . ''

`` What Jones did was try to break all ties that were not to him , '' said former believer Vernon Gosney . `` Transfer all that loyalty , all that bonding to him . And so families were broken apart . Relationships were divided . ''

Such divisions caused family members to spy and report on one another , or friends to turn in friends for various transgressions .

Jones ' mastery of the spoken word also enabled his many sexual exploits with both female and male followers . Jones deftly justified his actions to his followers by saying that what he did to them was actually for their own benefit , or the benefit of making the church a stronger , tighter-knit organization .

He preached that many of his male followers were in denial about their homosexuality , conditioning those followers to accept him if he approached with a sexual advance .

`` And if the leader is attracted to you , then somehow that cultivates , '' Jones said during a temple meeting in 1978 . `` Well , you ought to know I 'm attracted to you , I 'm ready to die for every one of you , so that means I 'm attracted to you . You follow what I 'm saying ? I 'm attracted to all of you . How much more attraction can you have than to be ready to have your eyes plucked out ? ''

By the end at Jonestown , Jones was more rock star than preacher . His sermons and remarks at meetings were littered with obscenities . He regularly had sex with his followers and he abused drugs . By the last month of Jonestown 's existence , Jones was so intoxicated at times that he had great difficulty even reading the news aloud to his followers .

As the end drew near , Jones ' tone as a speaker took darker turns . He constantly fed his followers in Guyana a steady diet of fatalism .

Spurred on by their leader 's talk , Peoples Temple members were ready to follow Jones even into death . At his request , they even wrote personal notes to him expressing their willingness to die for their cause . Some followers willing to die ''
