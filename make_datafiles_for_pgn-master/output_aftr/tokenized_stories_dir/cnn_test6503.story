The container ship Maersk Alabama has seen a lot of drama .

It was attacked in 2009 by four armed Somali pirates , who took the ship 's captain , Richard Phillips , hostage on a lifeboat . That gripping tale came to Hollywood in the form of the 2013 film `` Captain Phillips . ''

The ship survived another pirate attack in 2009 and yet another attempt to board the vessel in 2011 .

More than a week after their bodies were discovered , many questions surround the deaths of Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy , both 44 years old . Why did they die together ? How did the drugs and syringe get into their cabin ? What series of events contributed to their deaths ?

`` The two -LRB- former -RRB- Navy SEALs ended up closing that -LRB- second -RRB- casino and were politely asked to go at the end of the evening , '' Urbina said .

Surveillance images indicate that they met two women in the hall in front of the second casino and `` walked down a dark corridor '' with them , Urbina said .

`` It 's bizarre . Of course , it 's a shock . They 're all great guys , '' said Tom Rothrauff , president of Trident Group , a Virginia-based maritime security services firm that employed them . `` I 'm absolutely clueless as to what happened . ''

Although substance abuse is a known problem among veterans , acquaintances of Reynolds ' and Kennedy 's told the New York Times they were shocked at the idea that either man had used heroin .

`` The description of the two men from friends and family was in stark contrast to what sounded like a pretty hard partying night , '' Urbina said .

A neighbor of Reynolds ' , Monika Connelly , told the Times that the Reynoldses did not drink alcohol . Another neighbor , Paul Bell , called them `` church people . ''

Both Reynolds and Kennedy had children and `` seemed to be family men , '' Urbina said .

The Seychelles , an archipelago in the Indian Ocean , has one of the highest rates of injection drug use in the world , according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime -LRB- PDF -RRB- , with 2.3 % of the population engaging in this behavior .

Kevin N. Speers , a senior director for Maersk Line , said in a statement that the security contractors boarded the vessel January 29 and that their deaths were `` not related to vessel operations or their duties as security personnel . ''

The Maersk Alabama is `` persistently in high-risk areas since she provides feeder service to the east coast of Africa , '' Speers said in a statement .

`` Contracted security is part of anti-piracy protection plans to safeguard crews and vessels , '' Speers said .
