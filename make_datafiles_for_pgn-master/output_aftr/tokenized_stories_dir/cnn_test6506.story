William and Kate arrived Sunday for a three-day trip , their first to the Big Apple .

Excitement in the street

`` They were very excited even to see the motorcade , and there is a real buzz around the city today , '' Foster said . `` I think that association with Diana -LRB- Prince William 's late mother -RRB- , who used to come to New York a lot -- the biggest star in the world -- and Kate seems to be the closest replacement they have to Diana in this day and age . ''

Inside , Kate looked over some girls making crafts when an adult asked , `` Do you know who 's coming to visit you today ? ''

William jetted down to Washington for a quick visit with President Obama at the White House . The two men sat in chairs and tried to chat during a photo op while a swarm of reporters and photographers crowded around them .

The visit underscored `` the special relationship '' between the United States and the United Kingdom , the White House said .

William addresses World Bank

William next spoke at a session of the World Bank about the need for an international effort to stop illegal wildlife trading .

`` Cooperation is our greatest weapon against the poachers and traffickers who rely on evading individual national initiatives , '' he said . `` Our collective goal must be to reduce the wildlife trade by making it harder : denying traffickers access to transportation , putting up barriers to their illegal activities and holding people accountable for their actions . ''

William flew back to New York on a U.S. Airways shuttle , first class . One passenger tweeted a photo of the prince looking as if he were searching for a place to stash his carry-on luggage .

Another passenger , CNN 's Anderson Cooper , tweeted , `` Prince William just got on my DC shuttle flight '' and `` I 'm hoping this means an on time departure . '' It did .
