Three numbers to keep in mind Tuesday night as President Barack Obama delivers his State of the Union address : six , 30 and 43 .

30 : The historical average of House seats gained by the other party -- in this case the Republicans -- in a two-term president 's `` six-year itch '' midterm election .

And 43 % , of course , is Obama 's job approval rating -- a reminder that his political standing is weak , though up slightly from its recent low point , as he stands before a closely divided Congress -- and country -- to lay out his agenda for year six of his presidency .

`` One of the greatest powers a president has is the power to set the agenda , '' said veteran Democratic strategist and wordsmith Paul Begala , a close adviser to former President Bill Clinton . `` He -LRB- Obama -RRB- will use that power to great effect in the State of the Union address . ''

Another Clinton White House veteran disagreed , arguing this president is too weakened and the 2014 campaign landscape too troublesome to seize the initiative .

`` State of the Union means nothing , '' this Democrat said , speaking only on condition of anonymity . `` Re-read last year 's address . How relevant was it last year in terms of how 2013 turned out ? ''

Because of that , the 2014 speech is viewed by strategists in both parties as part of a defining test : Can Obama rebuild his standing enough to force action on some of his priorities , or will 2014 instead be remembered as another frustrating year of gridlock and the gateway to `` lame duck '' status ? To that end , many see this speech -- this wish list -- as potentially his last chance for significant action .

Despite all the attention , McInturff called the speech `` an ephemeral event that is perhaps a short-term focus of the ultimate D.C. policy insiders . ''

This year , even as he asks Congress to act on economic and other initiatives , President Obama will distance himself from an unpopular Congress and promise to use executive powers to implement some of his priorities .

The stakes are enormous : As the President delivers his speech , the odds -- and the early election year data -- suggest Republicans will not only keep their House majority but also have a good chance to capture control of the Senate .

How would complete Republican control of Congress alter the final two years of the Obama presidency ? It is a debate worth having , yet one that can wait a bit , as we first test whether the President has better luck with Congress in 2014 than he did in 2013 , and whether he can bend the political climate back more in his favor .

Which is where those numbers come in .

Several of the most vulnerable Senate Democratic incumbents are from states Obama lost badly in 2012 : Arkansas , Alaska and Louisiana to name three . Those and other Democrats are opposed to some things the President wants -- like new gun controls -- and in favor of ideas the White House is against , including modifications to the President 's health care law .

Begala acknowledges the tough political environment facing the President . But he says he can navigate it with a smartly crafted 2014 State of the Union wish list .

The House Republican majority opposes most of the President 's ideas , though there have been some discussions testing whether compromises can be reached on the minimum wage , unemployment insurance and , from time to time , even immigration policy .

The historical average for a two-term president 's party in this sixth year midterm is a loss of 30 House seats . Even the most optimistic Republicans view that as unlikely , given the shrinking number of competitive House districts .

`` They will oppose his popular economic agenda at their own political peril , '' Begala said , holding out hope the President would have an opportunity either to score policy successes or bend the political momentum back in his favor .

If Obama can climb closer to 50 % , Democratic chances improve significantly . If he slips closer to 40 % or below , then a GOP takeover of the Senate becomes more and more likely .

In 2006 , President George W. Bush had an identical 43 % job approval rating at the time of his State of the Union address .

There was little fear of the President in Congress then , in either party , and as a result little of his agenda was enacted -- immigration and Social Security changes were among the goals Bush laid out . Come November 2006 , Republicans lost 30 House seats , and their majority .

Bill Clinton , on the other hand , had a 59 % approval rating to begin his sixth year in office , and Ronald Reagan was at 64 % around his 1986 State of the Union .

Outside of Washington , observers like New Hampshire GOP activist Thomas Rath see an opportunity if the President `` acknowledge -LRB- d -RRB- at the outset that overwhelmingly Americans share a common belief -- Washington does not work . He should acknowledge that both parties share that blame ; both are responsible . ''
