As I stood in the sweltering heat outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta earlier this week , President Barack Obama whispered in my ear .

Obama 's speech was being piped into my earpiece , and I was about to go on CNN when I picked up my phone and emailed my friend Jake Tapper , the host of the show .

`` World knows how to fight this disease , '' I wrote in the subject line , quoting the words I had just heard Obama speak .

In the body of the email , I wrote to Jake , `` Does it ? ''

And that 's why I took an airplane to Liberia . I want to answer my own question .

The world knew how to fight Ebola outbreaks of the past , using a tried and true method I learned about in public health school : isolate sick people , trace their close contacts to see if they get sick , and if they do , isolate them and start the whole process over until the disease burns itself out .

That 's what Ebola has become . It has spread exponentially , not linearly . There have been nearly 5,000 cases and 2,500 deaths in this outbreak -- that 's more than all other outbreaks combined .

What you need to know about Ebola

But even with these resources , do we know how to stop an outbreak that 's gotten so out of hand ? That 's unlike any other we 've ever seen ?

So what do you pack to cover an Ebola outbreak ? Thermometers -- because at CNN it 's safety first , and we have to take our temperature twice every day and report it back .

Here 's what else you pack : tortillas , because they do n't get squished and they 're slow to grow mold , and peanut butter and jelly tortillas are very handy when you do n't have easy access to reliable food .

To prepare emotionally for this trip , I hugged everyone I knew at CNN -LRB- and a few I do n't know so well -- sorry -RRB- . I 'm a hugger , and I wanted to get my hugs out , because there are no hugs on what is in public health parlance a `` no-contact deployment . ''

As we boarded the plane from Brussels to Monrovia , I introduced a public health worker I 'd just met to my producer , John Bonifield . As she stretched her hand out to him she said , `` This is our last handshake for this trip . No handshakes . No hugs . No kisses . And certainly no European kisses ! ''

Who says public health folks do n't have a sense of humor ?
