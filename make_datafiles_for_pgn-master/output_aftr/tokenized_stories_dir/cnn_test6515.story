One of the world 's oldest civilizations took a major step toward democracy Wednesday as polls closed in Egypt 's historic vote for president , even as many worried the armed forces would quash the results if the top brass does n't like the country 's choice .

It is the first time the country has had a presidential election where no one knows what the result will be before the ballots are cast .

`` Finally , Egypt is born , '' one weeping 80-year-old man told Rep. David Dreier , a California Republican who is in Cairo as an election observer .

`` I am here to vote for the first time in my life , '' said Fahmy . `` I want to see a new generation for my country . I want everything to change . ''

`` Egypt has always set trends in the Arab world and for Arab political thought . Trends spread through the Arab world and eventually affect even non-Arab , Muslim-majority countries , '' said Maajid Nawaz , the chairman of Quilliam , a London-based think tank .

Results of the first round are not expected before the weekend .

Some 30,000 volunteers have fanned out to make sure the voting is fair , said organizers with the April 6 youth movement , which has long campaigned for greater democracy and rule of law in Egypt .

There is a pervasive fear that the powerful military , which has run the country since the fall of Mubarak , could try to hijack the election .

Egypt 's revolution : ` We fell in love , but it was a trick '

The concern persists despite the insistence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government . The military put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power , but that did not convince doubters .

Instead , he anticipated , there will be an `` unhappy settlement '' where the military remains `` ever-present , in the shadows , '' influencing the civilian government without controlling it .

`` Egypt is going along similar lines to Turkey or Pakistan , '' he said , naming two other countries that have formal democracies in place but where a powerful military can affect events .

The degree to which the military continues to exercise control in Egypt will depend on who wins the election , Nawaz anticipated -- but he laughed aloud when asked to predict who that would be .

`` They are inheriting a failed economy , an abysmal bureaucracy , a frustrated people , and a deep distrust on behalf of the people towards their military and any policing , '' Nawaz said .

And Egypt has an elaborate political mosaic where alliances shift quickly , he added .

Secular democrats oppose military rule , for example , but if an Islamist candidate wins the presidency , `` Some of the democrats would switch because they would rather have military rule than the Islamists , '' Nawaz said .

On top of that , the country does not yet have a new constitution defining the powers of the president or the parliament , after a court last month suspended the committee charged with writing it . The court ruled that the members of the committee did not reflect the national population well enough .

Among the candidates vying for the presidency are Mohamed Morsi , of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Freedom and Justice Party ; Amre Moussa , who served as foreign minister under Mubarak and headed the Arab League ; Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh , a moderate Islamist running as a respected independent ; Ahmed Shafik , who was Mubarak 's last prime minister ; and Hamdeen Sabahy , a leftist dark-horse contender .

Shafik was mobbed by opponents who threw things at him when he went to vote Wednesday , his spokesman , Ahmed Serhan , told CNN .

`` People chanted against him upon his entrance to cast his vote , '' Serhan said . That prompted soldiers guarding the polling station to shut the doors while Shafik voted , he said .

Many Egyptians seem uncertain of their loyalties to any particular candidate , and even the weakest of arguments or the strangest of rumors can shift public opinion overnight .

Despite the high-profile trial of the man who ruled the country for 30 years , popular distrust and anger , particularly against the military 's power in Egyptian governmental affairs , still inspire protests , some of which have been marked by deadly clashes .

Protesters are upset at what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak 's ouster . Some are also concerned that the country 's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule .

In January , two Islamist parties won about 70 % of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era .
