Democrats maintained control of the Senate for the new 112th Congress , but with a reduced majority .

The change likely presages a stark ideological conflict with President Barack Obama , who is preparing to defend his legislative accomplishments of the past two years and position himself for a re-election campaign in 2012 .

Ninety-four new House members were sworn in Wednesday , along with 13 new senators . The new House has the largest freshman class with no previous experience in elective office since 1948 .

Boehner , first elected to the House in 1990 , inherited the speaker 's gavel from Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D-California . Boehner 's rise to the top position caps a remarkable political comeback . He was voted out of the House leadership in 1998 after Republicans unexpectedly lost seats to Democrats that year .

Ten of Boehner 's 11 siblings were present when he was formally sworn in by Michigan Rep. John Dingell , the longest-serving member of the House .

`` There 's a great deal of scar tissue that 's been built up on both sides of the aisle , '' he said . But `` we can disagree without being disagreeable . ''

Pelosi , before handing over the gavel , reiterated that House Democrats are prepared to work with the Republicans on proposals to help the middle class , create jobs , and cut the deficit .

She also appeared to predict a quick Democratic resurgence , promising that `` two years from now when we come together , things will be different . ''

The Constitution will be read aloud on the House floor on Thursday .
