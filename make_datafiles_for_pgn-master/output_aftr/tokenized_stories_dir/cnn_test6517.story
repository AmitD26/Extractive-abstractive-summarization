Marino , 52 , said he did n't realize his name would be attached to the lawsuit .

`` Within the last year I authorized a claim to be filed on my behalf just in case I needed future medical coverage to protect me and my family in the event I later suffered from the effects of head trauma , '' the former Miami Dolphins star wrote in a statement published in the Sun Sentinel and on Sports Illustrated 's website .

Marino said his name was `` automatically '' attached to the suit , which asks for a jury to decide monetary damages and seeks medical monitoring for the former players .

Each player submitted a brief complaint with standard language saying they suffer from brain injuries and exhibit symptoms that have developed over time .

`` I am sympathetic to other players who are seeking relief who may have suffered head injuries . I also disclaim any references in the form complaint of current head injuries , '' he said .

Marino was considered one of the most durable quarterbacks in the NFL and once started 99 games in a row . Known for a quick release and not getting sacked , he still holds several NFL records . He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005 .

He did not return CNN 's repeated calls for comment .

Other former players involved in the suit are Richard Bishop , Ethan Johnson , Chris Dugan , Anthony Grant , Mark Green , LaCurtis Jones , John Huddleston , Erik Affholter , Toddrick McIntosh , Dwight Wheeler , Jackie Wallace , Moses Moreno , Peter Manning and Bruce Clark .

In the biggest concussion case , the NFL and at least 4,500 players proposed a $ 765 million settlement but a federal judge declined in January to approve the figure , saying she did n't think it was enough money .
