In the modest-looking `` Atelier Amaro '' restaurant in central Warsaw , Amaro serves up his unique brand of gastronomic excellence .

His inventive style saw him awarded with the prestigious Chef de l'Avenir award from the International Academy of Gastronomy in 2008 while Atelier Amaro was given a Michelin Star in April 2013 .

Yet despite his passion for all things Polish and contentment with his Warsaw studio , Amaro has spent much of his working life abroad learning from some of Europe 's most famous chefs .

His previously nomadic life enabled Amaro to hone his skills in high-pressure kitchens across London . He also spent time in Catalonia , Spain , at the El Bulli restaurant of Ferran Adria , the man often referred to as the world 's greatest chef .

Amaro says his time overseas was professionally formative .

As with Britain 's Heston Blumenthal or Ren√© Redzepi , who heads the Danish restaurant Noma , Amaro is highly regarded for his scientific approach to food . He spends much of his time tinkering with conventional ideas and refining ingredients down to their elemental forms , many of which are sourced from all over Poland .

Prior to opening the restaurant , Amaro spent a year searching his home country to locate the best ingredients and gain inspiration from Poland 's forgotten culinary traditions .

When CNN visited , Amaro was busy in his kitchen compressing pumpkin , beetroot , and sweet potato -LRB- all sourced in Poland , of course -RRB- into a vacuum machine which he says brings out their hidden flavors .

`` We actually pay respect to the tradition because we use the ingredients that could be at some point forgotten , '' Amaro said . `` We bring them back to life and we create new dishes out of them . ''

`` You can really feel that . You have this sense of , you know , living in this country that -LRB- there -RRB- is something booming , '' he enthused .
