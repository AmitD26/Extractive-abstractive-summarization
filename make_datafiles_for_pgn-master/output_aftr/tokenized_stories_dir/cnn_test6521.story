-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the cut throat world of big-time ocean racing , giant maxis are the undoubted leaders of the pack .

Slicing through the water at 30 knots and more , vast distances can be covered in a few short days .

`` This is a very aggressive world . It 's banging , really noisy and with each wave you have the feeling you could break a bone , '' sailing legend Loick Peyron told CNN 's Mainsail .

And 54-year-old Frenchman Peyron should know .

Set in 2012 and landing the coveted Jules Verne Trophy -- Peyron 's elder brother Bruno was a twice former holder of award -- the time slashed over two days off the former record and set an incredible average speed of 26.51 knots for the entire trip .

Taking part in solo efforts at the helm of such imposing yachts requires a different level of intestinal fortitude , fitness and raw courage altogether .

In fact , in six previous attempts dating back 32 years , Peyron 's best finish was fifth and he had given up hope of landing one of the only prizes to elude him in his illustrious career .

And then there was his age to consider , given the physical demands .

Admittedly , he 's no `` spring chicken , '' so when Ronan Lucas , the boss of the Banque Populaire team , asked him the question , Peyron 's first response was an emphatic `` Non . ''

`` I was not dreaming any more about doing another transatlantic -LRB- race -RRB- alone on a boat able to win it , '' he said .

Peyron , who is a key member of the Swedish America 's Cup team Artemis , had intended to compete in the Route du Rhum on a `` little yellow trimaran '' -- content to let Le Cleac ' h bid for line honors with the favored Banque Populaire VII .

But all that changed when Le Cleac ' h injured his hand two months ahead of the challenge .

Lucas had total faith in the record breaking Peyron to be the perfect substitute , given his vast experience , but there was another factor which left the coveted skipper with so much doubt .

The prospect of the lack of sleep for several days and fear of losing control of the 103-foot trimaran .

`` Falling asleep it 's really hard , '' he said .

`` I 'm supposed to be able to have a rest , you close your eyes , you keep the main sheet in your hand like that and you pray ! ''

Lucas implored him to think again about his decision , but it was Peyron 's wife Christine who urged him to put aside his fears .

`` I never imagined that I would win a Route du Rhum on a boat like this , '' Peyron said at the finish .

`` I was able to sail the boat well but was scared , '' he told the official Artemis Racing website .

It was his 49th Atlantic crossing -- 18 of them solo -- accomplished at an average speed of over 22 knots -- and given his doubts , very special .

`` This is a great victory ; possibly one of the nicest and breaking the record is the cherry on top of the cake , '' he added .

The team is based in San Francisco -- preparing for the racing in Bermuda where it will compete with others in the Louis Vuitton Cup , with the winner of that series facing holders Oracle for the biggest prize in yachting .

He was at the helm with the Swiss challenge Alinghi in 2010 and joined up with Artemis just before the 2013 edition , which ended with defeat to the Italian Luna Rossa Challenge .

With that experience behind it , Artemis will be hoping to up its game in 2017 , but the syndicate was hit by tragedy last year when former British Olympic gold medalist Andrew Simpson died while training with the team in San Francisco Bay .

He had paired with Percy to win the Star Class at the 2008 Beijing Games and silver on home waters at the London Olympics of 2012 .

Peyron was among a number of sailing greats to support Bart 's Bash , which saw over 700 sailing clubs from 68 different countries stage their own race over a standard distance to set a new Guinness World Record for mass participation .

Peyron had been totally focused on the America 's Cup bid before being handed an unexpected opportunity to resume his solo career and he proved he is not a man to let a challenge pass , however daunting .
