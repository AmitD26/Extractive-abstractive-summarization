Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Conservative commentator Glenn Beck says his weekend revival-style rally at the Lincoln Memorial was meant to reclaim the U.S. civil rights movement `` from politics , '' arguing that the movement was about `` people of faith . ''

Beck has come under fire from civil rights leaders and other critics because of the timing of the rally and some of his previous statements , such as his 2009 that President Barack Obama `` has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture . '' And earlier this year , he urged viewers to quit churches that preached `` social justice , '' a term he equated with socialism .

In his Fox interview , taped after Saturday 's rally , he said he regretted his remarks about Obama , but said the first African-American president 's worldview was shaped by `` Marxism disguised as religion . ''

Beck 's address to his `` Restoring Honor '' rally , nominally held in support of U.S. troops , resembled more a revival than a political rally . In it , he urged those attending to return America to the religious values on which he said it was founded .

`` Something beyond imagination is happening , '' he told participants who packed the National Mall in Washington . `` America today begins to turn back to God . For too long , this country has wandered in darkness . ''

Park Service officials have stopped giving crowd counts after previous controversies . But an estimate commissioned by CBS News , using aerial photography , put attendance at between 78,000 and 96,000 . ABC News reported more than 100,000 , while Fox -- and Beck -- estimated it at above half a million .

The Rev. Al Sharpton , who led a commemoration of the King rally 's anniversary Saturday at a Washington high school , dismissed Beck 's address as a `` motivational speech '' that ignored the policies King promoted .

Beck also has tried to organize viewers into a `` 9/12 '' movement , aimed at restoring a spirit he said Americans shared after the September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York and Washington . He told Fox that Americans `` should be looking for people with the right ideas , '' but dismissed any ambition for elected office himself .

`` So let 's take them as people who knew what they were talking about , '' he added . `` What do you say we give the whole ` let 's turn back to God ' thing a try and see what happens ? ''
