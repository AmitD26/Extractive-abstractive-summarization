The 32-year-old son of actor and kung fu star Jackie Chan has been charged with a drug offense and could face up to three years in jail .

The Supreme People 's Procuratorate said in a brief statement on Sina Weibo , a Chinese microblogging site , that it had begun legal proceedings against actor Jaycee Chan for `` the crime of sheltering others to take drugs . ''

Both men tested positive for marijuana and police later found more than 100 grams of the drug after searching Chan 's apartment .

Ko was released after 14 days in administrative detention , while Chan has remained in police custody since his arrest .

`` I very much regret about what happened . I 'm very sorry to those who support me , like me or even know me personally , '' he said . `` I just want to tell them I 'm really sorry . I 've set the worst example , which had the most terrible influence . And this is a huge mistake . ''

The two actors are being seen as the targets of the capital 's latest anti-drugs campaign , which has seen more than 7,000 people detained for using drugs , a 72 % year-on-year increase , according to the China Daily .

Earlier this month , dozens of management agencies representing performers in the entertainment industry signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the industry and pledging to sack artists who break the law .

Jackie Chan publicly addressed the incident immediately after his son was arrested in August on Sina Weibo .

He said he was `` extremely furious '' and `` extremely shocked '' at the news of his son 's arrest .

`` I failed to teach my son and I should also bear responsibility . Jaycee and I deeply bow in apology to society . ''
