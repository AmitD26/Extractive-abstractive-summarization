What really happened to Michael Brown ?

We know a police officer in Ferguson , Missouri , fatally shot the 18-year-old , but police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting . The confusion has fueled protests in Ferguson and , strong police response in the streets of the St. Louis suburb .

Brown and Dorian Johnson , 22 , were walking in the middle of the street , en route to either Brown 's grandmother 's house -LRB- according to Brown 's mother and grandmother -RRB- or to Johnson 's house -LRB- according to Johnson -RRB- , when a Ferguson police officer confronted them .

The officer told the young men either `` Get the f *** on the sidewalk '' or `` Get the f *** out of the street , '' according to Johnson 's accounts to CNN and other news outlets .

The young men replied that they were `` not but a minute away from our destination , and we would shortly be out of the street , '' Johnson told CNN .

The officer drove away but stopped and backed up , almost hitting the pair , Johnson said . He said he was n't sure what prompted the officer to return . Johnson told MSNBC the officer said something to the effect of `` What 'd you say ? ''

Was there a struggle ?

Yes . Everyone agrees on this point , and it 's one of the few aspects of the shooting that police have attempted to detail , though the official explanation has spurred many questions they have yet to answer .

Johnson claims the officer grabbed Brown by his neck , and Brown tried to pull away , but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him , he said .

Was Brown armed ?

No . Again , this is undisputed .

`` I saw the officer proceeding after my friend , Big Mike , with his gun drawn , and he fired a second shot , and that struck my friend , Big Mike , '' Johnson said . `` And at that time , he turned around with his hands up , beginning to tell the officer that he was unarmed and to tell him to stop shooting . But at that time , the officer was firing several more shots into my friend , and he hit the ground and died . ''

This matches Crenshaw 's and Mitchell 's story . Crenshaw told CNN that Brown got about 20 feet away from the police cruiser before the officer shot him again .

`` The cop gets out of his vehicle shooting , '' Mitchell said . '' -LRB- Brown 's -RRB- body jerked as if he was hit from behind , and he turned around , and he put his hands up . ... The cop continued to fire until he just dropped down to the ground , and his face just smacked the concrete . ''

All parties agree Brown was shot multiple times .

What were Brown and Johnson doing before the incident ?

On Friday , six days after the shooting , Ferguson police revealed that Brown was the `` primary suspect '' in the strong-arm robbery of a convenience store moments before he encountered police and was killed .

A store surveillance video shows a man pushing a clerk before walking out the front door with a box of Swisher Sweets cigars worth $ 48.99 , according to information released by police .

Read the police reports

Johnson , who was with Brown when he was shot , will not face any criminal charges in connection with the store robbery because `` we have determined he committed no crime , '' Jackson said .

Has the officer been identified ?

Yes , but it took police six days .

On Friday , police revealed the officer as Darren Wilson , 28 , who is white and a six-year veteran of the department without any history of disciplinary action .

No further details were immediately available Friday .

Brown 's family and their attorneys were infuriated at how police released Wilson 's identity and allegations of Brown 's role in the robbery on the same day .
