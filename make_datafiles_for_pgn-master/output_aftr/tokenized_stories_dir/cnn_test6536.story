Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- Detentions , the kidnapping of bishops , tearing down churches -- these are the actions against Christians China has been guilty of .

Even the pope has not been welcome in Chinese airspace in the last few decades .

The state-run Global Times calls it a sign of `` possible d√©tente . ''

Around half of more than 100 students who had planned to travel from China to South Korea to attend the Asian Youth Day event and catch a glimpse of the Pope have not made it .

Heo Young-yeop , spokesman for the Committee for the Papal Visit to Korea , told the media that it was due to `` a complicated situation inside China . ''

This apparent U-turn in attitude towards the papacy , within a matter of days , has Vatican-watchers confused , hinting at an increasingly opaque Chinese government that is struggling to manage its religious groups .

`` I do n't believe that the Vatican and the Communist Party will come to any agreement in the manner that some might hope , '' he said , adding that he has heard from a source , which he does not wish to name for security reasons , that the students who did not make it to the event in Korea are currently unaccounted for . CNN is not able to independently confirm this .

Woes of worship

Officially an atheist country , China does not recognize the authority of the Vatican over its millions of Catholics . Instead , it has set up its own Catholic governing body , known as the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association that answers to the Party .

This association is similar to other state organizations that manage followers of major faiths , including the Three-Self Patriotic Movement for Protestants and the Chinese Patriotic Islamic Association .

Jin Tianming is a priest and member of Beijing Shouwang Church , an underground Protestant community . His group of worshipers has had trouble finding a permanent location to hold church gatherings , frequently suffering harassment from police , with members of the church arrested or detained on occasion .

`` We put our beliefs above society . I do n't think the two are compatible in any way , '' says Jin .

Religious bloom

Sino-Christianity

In the latest move by the central authorities to control the spread of Christianity , the governing body for religious affairs has said that it will develop `` Chinese Christian theology . ''

`` The construction of Chinese Christian theology should adapt to China 's national condition and integrate with Chinese culture , '' said Wang Zuoan , director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs . The announcement was made at a seminar on the Sinicization of Christianity in Shanghai last week .

Just how will a Chinese-style Christian theology look like ?

`` It will attempt to tie together values of socialist culture and the practice of faith . The criteria will probably be vague , they will leave it open so authorities can determine who is violating the rules or not , '' says Jensen .

He points out that a Chinese theology is `` startling '' because it suggests that the long standing framework of constraints of religious practice may not be working out anymore . `` It is an effort to gain an upper hand within the wilderness of immense Christian expansion . ''
