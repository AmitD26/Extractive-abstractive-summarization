Yolanda might have been the most powerful land-falling tropical cyclone -- this being the generic scientific term as they are called typhoons , hurricanes or simply cyclones in different parts of the world -- ever recorded by meteorologists . More analysis will be needed to finalize that ruling . But it really does n't matter now to the millions of people in the rubble of Yolanda 's wake .

In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis likely killed more than 100,000 in Myanmar . And the Philippines , right in the world 's worst cyclone highway , are hit very often . In December , Typhoon Bopha , nearly as strong as Yolanda , hit the southern island of Mindanao and killed more than a thousand .

Does it seem , in fact , that these weather disasters are happening more often ? Well , they are .

The damage caused by tropical cyclones has risen dramatically in the past century everywhere it has been assessed . But essentially all of that is attributable to development of vulnerable coastlines , rather than changes in the storms themselves .

Improvements are starting to take hold in the developing world as well . When Cyclone Phailin hit India 's west coast last month , there was reason to fear a repeat of the 1999 cyclone that hit nearby Orissa , killing 10,000 .

Instead , good advance warning and evacuations -LRB- with help from a storm weaker than some anticipated -RRB- kept Phailin 's casualty count low . In the Philippines , many hundreds of thousands were reported to have been evacuated ahead of Yolanda . As awful as the death toll will surely be , it could just as surely have been much higher .

But are population growth , development and emergency management the whole story ? Or is this disaster also related to global warming ?

Well , it is .

Global warming may already , in fact , have contributed to Yolanda 's power . We ca n't see that in the data ; the numbers and intensities of tropical cyclones naturally fluctuate too much from year to year for us to clearly identify a rising trend underneath that would show warming 's influence with certainty .

But that does n't mean it 's not there . If the time comes that we can detect the warming signal in cyclone activity well enough to make definitive statements , it will be because the storms have intensified to a frightening degree -- and irreversibly so , for all practical purposes .

Today , as the Philippines reels from Yolanda , climate is not the main story .

Our thoughts should be with the survivors and those rushing in to help them . The way to save people and property from tropical cyclones , in the near and medium-term , is to get them out of harm 's way -- in the days before landfall to the extent that 's possible ; and , even better , by not putting them there in the first place . But the changes we are making to the climate are not likely to help .
