The Obama administration plans to seek more than $ 6 billion from Congress to fight Ebola , an official told CNN Wednesday , hours after the World Health Organization said an outbreak of the deadly virus had claimed more than 4,800 lives .

New funding to fight deadly virus ?

That includes $ 4.5 billion for immediate response and $ 1.5 billion for a contingency fund , the official said .

The goal ? `` To strengthen our domestic public health systems , contain and mitigate the outbreak in West Africa , speed efforts to obtain and test vaccines and therapeutics , and further reduce risks to Americans by helping vulnerable countries enhance their capacity to prevent disease outbreaks , detect them early , and swiftly respond before they become epidemics that threaten our national security , '' the official said .

`` These activities are critical to combat the spread of Ebola and reduce the potential for future outbreaks of infectious diseases that could follow a similarly devastating , costly , and destabilizing trajectory , '' the official said .

As of November 2 , 546 health care workers are known to be infected with Ebola and 310 have died , according to WHO .
