California Sen. Barbara Boxer has said the EPA is becoming a `` secretive , dangerous ally of polluters . ''

`` Please do not respond to questions or make any statements , '' the June 16 e-mail said , advising staff to direct questioners to senior staff members cleared to answer questions from outside the agency .

Robbi Farrell , chief of staff of the EPA 's compliance assurance division , sent the e-mail to 11 managers in the department .

The e-mail was posted on a Web site of the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility . The group , an alliance of state and federal environmental professionals , labeled the communication a `` gag order . ''

`` The order reinforces a growing bunker mentality within an EPA that is the subject of a growing number of probes into political interference with agency operations , '' the group said .

`` A senior staffer in the enforcement office sent out an e-mail to simply help her office efficiently respond to requests from the press , GAO and EPA 's inspector general , '' Smith told CNN .

Smith is one of the people to whom recipients of the memo were told to direct journalists ' questions .

In a written statement , the EPA 's Office of Inspector General said it did not approve the language of Robbi 's warning and advised , `` All EPA officials and employees are required to cooperate '' with the office .

`` This cooperation includes providing the OIG full and unrestricted access to EPA documents , records , and personnel , '' the statement read . `` We are currently engaged in discussions with OECA -LSB- Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance -RSB- to assure that OIG and OECA interpretations are consistent in this matter . ''

The committee 's chairman , Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , has asked the inspector general 's office to assess the administration 's claims of executive privilege as it tries to keep documents related to EPA decisions from Congress .
