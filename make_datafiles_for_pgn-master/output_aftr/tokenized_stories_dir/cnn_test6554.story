Police found April Jace , 40 , shot to death in her south Los Angeles home Monday night , Los Angeles Police Det. Lyman Doster said .

Michael Jace , 51 , called 911 to report that his wife had been shot , Det. Dean Vinluan said , adding that he `` was on the phone with the operator . '' Neighbors who heard gunshots also called 911 , he said .

Two children were in the home when their mother was shot , Vinluan said . The children , whose ages he would not reveal , were taken to a police station and then handed over to a representative of California 's Department of Children and Family Services , he said .

Investigators have found no reports of domestic violence between the husband and wife at their south Los Angeles residence , LAPD Det. Iasparro said .

A woman described as a close friend of his first wife said in a sworn statement that she witnessed Jace physically abusing his wife in 1997 . The declaration was in court records from Jace 's 2005 custody case concerning his son with Jennifer Bitterman .

Jace `` choked and hit '' his wife and `` slammed her against the wall while -LRB- their infant son -RRB- screamed in his crib next to her , '' Maria De Le Vegas said in the sworn declaration obtained by CNN .

Jace `` was raging and out of control , and seeing the extent of his anger was one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen , '' she said .

He acted on several episodes of `` Southland , '' another TV drama about Los Angeles police , between 2009 and 2012 .

Jace often played a law enforcement or military officer on television shows . He is credited with roles in `` CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , '' `` Private Practice , '' `` The Mentalist , '' `` Burn Notice '' and `` NYPD Blue . ''

He had the title role of Michael Jordan in the 1999 TV movie about the NBA star , `` Michael Jordan : An American Hero . ''

Jace played Officer Brown in Russell Crowe 's 2009 film `` State of Play , '' and he portrayed a Black Panther member in the 1994 blockbuster movie `` Forrest Gump . ''

April Jace had worked for the past year as a financial aid counselor at Biola University , a private school in La Mirada , California , according to the school .

`` April 's radiant personality brought great energy to the financial aid office , '' financial aid director Geoff Marsh said . `` Her love for helping students and families and her great work ethic earned the respect and love of her coworkers . Her smiling face and helpful spirit will be missed by all . ''
