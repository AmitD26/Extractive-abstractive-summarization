Moscow -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian investigators said Wednesday they had found narcotics on a Greenpeace ship whose crew was detained in the Arctic last month -- an allegation quickly disputed by Greenpeace as a smear .

The Investigative Committee said Russian experts were looking into the `` origin and purpose '' of the drugs seized , which it described as `` presumably opium straw and morphine . ''

Greenpeace said the claim that Russian authorities had found drugs on the vessel `` is a smear , it 's a fabrication , pure and simple . ''

The environmental campaign group has repeatedly condemned the detention of its activists , saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest against the `` slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic . ''

Russian authorities made the arrests after two of the activists left the Arctic Sunrise and tried to climb the side of an oil platform owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom in the Barents Sea .

The government in the Netherlands -- where the Arctic Sunrise is registered -- wrote to the Dutch parliament Friday to say it has launched legal action aimed at freeing the 30 under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea . Two of those detained are Dutch citizens .
