Cairo , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For more than a week , opponents of Egypt 's President Hosni Mubarak had the upper hand in Cairo , protesting with near impunity in the face of police and an army that did little to stop them .

That all changed on Wednesday .

There were immediate suspicions that the pro-Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded .

`` There are usually a line of thugs outside a protest who are waiting there , '' he said . `` They 're dressed in plain clothes , and then they 'll usually go and attack the protesters . Egyptians have seen this for quite some time , and that 's why they were able to recognize what was going on fairly quickly . ''

The global rights group Amnesty International said it has documented the use of unsavory forces by Egyptian authorities to disperse political gatherings in election years .

An Interior Ministry spokesman denied on state-run television that police identification cards had been confiscated from demonstrators . He said if they had been , they were were stolen or fake . But state television reporting Wednesday did not always match CNN 's own observations of what was happening in Tahrir Square .

Amnesty International researchers said witnesses told them of `` lorry loads '' of pro-Mubarak supporters leaving Wednesday morning from Mahalla , north of Cairo .

`` These -LRB- pro-Mubarak -RRB- protests were organized by the government and the ruling National Democratic Party , '' analyst Kamal Zakher told CNN . The government mustered government workers and lawmakers whose seats are threatened , he said .

In Washington , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed concerns about the outbreak of violence .

`` The president and this administration strongly condemn the outrageous and deplorable violence that 's taking place on the streets of Cairo , '' Gibbs said .

`` Obviously , if any of the violence is instigated by the government , it should stop immediately , '' Gibbs added .

Zakher also said it was suspicious that security forces did not intervene to break up the violence .

`` There were no police or military to separate the two crowds at the beginning and that 's also suspicious enough to implicate the security agencies , '' Zakher said .

State TV interviewed several people at the demonstration who said they backed the president because he had provided stability and independence .

And a female demonstrator said : `` Mubarak is our father . No one can insult and ridicule their elders . If we do that , we belittle ourselves . This is how we destroy our country . ''

CNN 's Amir Ahmed , Frederik Pleitgen , Saad Abedine and Journalist Ian Lee in Cairo contributed to this report .
