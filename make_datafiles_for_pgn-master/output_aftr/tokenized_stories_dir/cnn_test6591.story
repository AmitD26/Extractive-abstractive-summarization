Nervous anticipation extends far beyond the racially charged powder keg of Ferguson , Missouri , over a grand jury decision on whether to indict a white police officer for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager .

With the grand jury expected to deliver its decision any day , people worry that tensions could boil over -- not only in Ferguson , but at demonstrations in more than 30 cities from Boston to Los Angeles organized by a group called the Ferguson National Response Network , mostly for the day after the decision is announced .

While most protests in Ferguson have been peaceful , some devolved into violence , especially in the nights immediately after the shooting . The imminent decision has renewed concerns over clashes between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers , especially if Wilson is not indicted .

Though Herring expects to be in Ferguson after the announcement , he said members of the network 's 3,000 multidenominational congregations around the country plan to participate in vigils and protests .

Police departments prepare

Throughout the country , law enforcement agencies have been busy with Ferguson .

`` Many of my colleagues I 've had an opportunity over the last few days to talk to around the country ... are preparing for whatever the outcome may happen to be , '' said Cedric Alexander , president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and public safety director for DeKalb County , Georgia .

Alexander said law enforcement agencies in the Atlanta area , for instance , have `` working relationships with our community members and leaders '' and are preparing to mobilize should tensions erupt .

`` We have met with , and are in discussion with , numerous law enforcement agencies throughout the metro Atlanta area to ensure our efforts are coordinated , and that we are maintaining the same level of readiness and vigilance , '' she said .

Police officials would not reveal specific preparations .

Unresolved tensions

Conference spokeswoman Elena Temple said the group has had internal discussions on how to react to the grand jury decision but will not make a statement on the case until the announcement .

Outgoing U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told the gathering of mayors and police chiefs that law enforcement had a responsibility to address tensions within communities .

`` The events in Ferguson reminded us that we can not and we must not allow tensions , which are present in so many neighborhoods across America , to go unresolved , '' Holder said .

The Ferguson case , Holder said , underscored divisions between police and residents in many U.S. cities .

`` When I traveled to Ferguson in the days after that incident , my pledge to the people of that community was that our nation 's Department of Justice would remain focused on the challenges they faced , and the deep-seated issues and difficult conversations that the shooting brought to the surface , long after national headlines had faded , '' he said .

Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations , one into Brown 's killing and the other into the local police department 's overall track record with minorities .

Free speech , worries about violence

Police will be on hand at protests to ensure freedom of expression -- without any criminal activity .

Nixon made clear last week he 's not anticipating violence , but wants to be ready for anything .

`` This is America . People have a right to express their views and grievances , but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk , '' he said .

But through its attorney , the family asked authorities to use `` reasonable restraints '' in dealing with protesters . The attorney blamed assault rifles , manhandling , tear gas , rubber bullets and false arrests for agitating the protesters who took to the streets .

Fuentes said people on both sides of the issue have all but telegraphed what 's to come after the grand jury decision is announced .

What happens in Ferguson , he said , can influence what happens in the rest of the country .

`` When you have demonstrations , emotions are high , '' Fuentes said . `` When you have high emotions , a mob can get out of control . ... When emotions are high , all it takes is one or two people to incite the crowd into doing something else . And one bad cop can incite things if shots are fired or if the police do something too aggressive . It can work both ways . ''
