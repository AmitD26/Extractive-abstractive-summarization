With Mitt Romney now officially out of the 2016 GOP nomination chase , New Hampshire becomes a more wide-open race , and the Jeb Bush camp is hoping to make fast inroads .

Jonathan Martin of The New York Times notes with a crowded field , Iowa 's vote likely will be splintered and the state is known for its strong evangelical base . South Carolina , stop three on the calendar , could be influenced by the possible candidacy of home state senator Lindsey Graham .

Romney would have been the early New Hampshire favorite . But now ?

2 . COMING SOON : A PARADE OF LONGER THAN LONG SHOTS

Watch New Hampshire over the next couple weeks and you might come to the conclusion it is easier to count the Republicans NOT considering a 2016 presidential run .

On tap to visit soon : former GOP Govs. George Pataki of New York , Jim Gilmore of Virginia and Bob Ehrlich of Maryland . Also , former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton and former high tech CEO Carly Fiorina have New Hampshire travel plans .

All of them are longer than long shots , should they run . But former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is due back , and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , too .

In New Hampshire , independents can vote in either primary , and Team Christie thinks more of them might be inclined to cast their votes for a GOP candidate .

Rand Paul was the most active GOP contender early on , and Politico 's Mike Allen reports the freshman Kentucky senator has a busy travel schedule ahead as he tries to build his support -- and not always in predictable ways .

But Paul is also including some GOP stops that are a bit more predictable : `` He 's back to red meat next weekend in Iowa , '' said Allen . `` He 's doing a liberty event and his big rally is audit the Fed . That 's about the reddest meat that you can get . ''

4 . GROUNDHOG DAY : BUT FOR SOME IN GOP , THIS OBAMACARE VOTE IS DIFFERENT

But for some GOPers , NPR 's Juana Summers says , the calculations are a little different because the law has been in effect for a few years now -- and access to health care is expanding even in Red America .

`` This could put some Republicans , who in two more years will have to run again , in really , really tricky place , especially if they have core constituents who are benefiting . ''

Republicans won big in 2014 , and came to Washington full of energy to start 2015 .

Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast laid out the calculations : `` And whether that means letting it go off the cliff or what -- whether it means letting it go off the cliff and then coming back ... They all kind of think they 're going to cave , they just have to find the best way to do it . ''
