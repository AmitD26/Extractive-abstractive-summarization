Turkey joined the coalition late last week as the militants continued to fight Kurdish and Iraqi forces on the ground . In September , the United States promised broad cooperation in the effort against the terror group . So far , Great Britain , France , the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Australia , Germany , the Netherlands and other nations are participating .

Here 's a closer look at their roles .

In late September , Saudi Arabia joined the coalition in airstrikes in Syria , attacks that hit ISIS vehicles and logistics bases , Centcom said . And last month , U.S. officials said that Saudi Arabia had offered to train on its soil moderate Syrian rebels who would fight ISIS .

United Arab Emirates : The UAE helped launch airstrikes in Syria . The country 's first female fighter pilot led one of the missions .

Turkey : Though the NATO member initially offered only tacit support for the coalition , Turkey 's government recently authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations , including ISIS , as the militant group 's fighters took towns just south of Turkey 's border . Foreign troops have also been allowed to launch attacks against ISIS from Turkey . U.S. officials said it had earlier taken steps to cut the flow of money to ISIS and denied entry to or deported several thousand foreign fighters heading to Syria to join the extremists .

The nation 's role in the fight against ISIS has stirred controversy , particularly last week when U.S. Vice President Joe Biden apologized to Turkey and UAE leaders for comments in a speech at Harvard , when he said the Middle East allies had inadvertently strengthened ISIS by helping opposition groups fight Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .

Jordan : The kingdom participated in airstrikes in Syria . In mid-September , former Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher said on CNN that he doubted Jordan will commit ground troops in the fight against ISIS . `` The U.S. will have to take the lead in providing military strikes , '' he said .

One of Jordan 's key roles would be providing intelligence to the West , Muasher said . Speaking from Amman , he stressed that Jordan 's intelligence on ISIS is `` second to none . ''

But signaling a major cultural push against ISIS , Egypt 's grand mufti condemned the terror group last month , saying that its actions are not in line with Islam , Al-Arabiya reported .

Of the coalition , he said , `` We 've been asked by our American friends if we can join , and we did . ''

Leaders of the semiautonomous region of Iraq are willing to send their Peshmerga forces to fight beyond their borders if there 's a comprehensive international strategy put in place , President Masoud Barzani told CNN 's Anna Coren .

Three Americans are fighting alongside Kurdish forces against in northern Syria , a spokesman for the Kurdish group told CNN .

Live CNN coverage has captured some of the bloodiest battles between the Kurds and ISIS .

Bahrain : The oil-wealthy Gulf nation east of Saudi Arabia has participated in airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria . Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al Khalifa , speaking on CNN in September , called ISIS a `` deviated cult '' that must be fought .

Bahrain has had close relations with the United States for years , and the U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet in based in Bahrain .

United Kingdom : Last week , the UK launched its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq , striking targets four days after its Parliament approved the country 's involvement . British planes helped Kurdish troops who were fighting ISIS in northwestern Iraq , dropping a bomb on an ISIS heavy weapon position and shooting a missile at an armed pickup truck , the UK 's Defence Ministry said . British planes had been involved in reconnaissance missions over Iraq .

Prime Minister David Cameron has called ISIS `` a menace '' and said the UK would help arm Kurdish forces , support the Iraqi government , keep supplying humanitarian help and coordinate with the United Nations to battle ISIS .

The Australian mission consists of inflight refueling and electronic surveillance in support of the U.S. and other allies . The country also authorized the deployment of Australian special forces into Iraq to `` advise and assist '' Iraqi forces , Abbott said , calling it a `` combat deployment '' but an `` essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of Iraq and ultimately the people of Australia from the murderous rage of the ISIL death cult . '' ISIL is another acronym for ISIS .

Germany : Geared toward curbing ISIS propaganda and recruitment , Germany has banned activities that support ISIS , including making it illegal to fly the trademark black flag of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .
