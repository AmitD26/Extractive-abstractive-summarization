The cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder are considered to be vital elements in figuring out the causes of commercial aviation disasters .

Indonesia 's top search and rescue official says searchers are now `` striving '' to find the black boxes -LRB- which are actually orange -RRB- .

Here 's the lowdown on the devices , the information they are likely to hold and how investigators will go about extracting it .

What do black boxes contain ?

The two devices hold different kinds of information .

The cockpit voice recorder contains `` every audio sound that occurs on the flight deck , '' said Desmond Ross , an aviation safety expert .

The flight data recorder is a different beast . It stores a huge amount of information about the plane 's performance .

In the Airbus A320-200 , the aircraft in question , the two flight recorders are housed in the tail . That has led to hopes that they could be within the grasp of the divers who took pictures of the tail section at the bottom of the Java Sea on Wednesday .

Ross suggested that getting them out of the wreckage should n't be too tricky .

`` If they have the tail and they have a few tools with them , they should be able to take those recorders out of the tail section without even having to raise the tail section to the surface , '' he said . `` It 's not that hard . It 's done all the time for maintenance on the ground . ''

But the divers have to contend with murky waters and strong currents as they search the wreckage .

And AirAsia Chief Executive Tony Fernandes raised the issue of whether the piece of wreckage found by the search teams is the exact part of the tail containing the black boxes .

`` I am led to believe the tail section has been found , '' he tweeted . `` If right part of tail section then the black box should be there . ''

What if they 're not in the tail ?

Peter Goelz , a former managing director of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board -LRB- NTSB -RRB- , said flight recorders can be difficult to pinpoint , even if they have locator beacons .

`` The black boxes often become covered with silt and covered with metal . You have got to be directly over them , '' he said . `` It is hard to find something in the ocean . It took us days to find the black boxes at TWA 800 . We were right over it . The pingers , we never picked up . ''

Will the black boxes have all the answers ?

Experts seem optimistic that they will .

`` We 're talking almost 100 % certainty that we will get all the answers from those two boxes , '' Ross said .

`` If the two pilots have been discussing the issue and they 're talking about the problem they 've got , that will tell a lot almost immediately , '' he told CNN . `` The flight data recorder will tell all the speeds , the rate of descent , the cabin pressure -- everything that has basically gone wrong in the final moments of that flight will be evident . ''

`` So you might go down 50 feet or so , to see if there 's any floating debris there , '' said Soucie , an aviation analyst for CNN . `` And you keep going down and mapping it as it goes . You see how the drift went and how the pieces of the plane moved . ''

It was important to `` mosaic them together '' to give investigators a comprehensive view of the wreckage site , said David Gallo , who co-led that search after the French jet crashed in 2009 .

If they are recovered , the black boxes will be taken to a lab in Jakarta to be analyzed , according to Indonesia 's National Committee for Transportation Safety -LRB- NTSC -RRB- , which is leading the investigation into the disaster .

`` There will be a very careful , methodical process by which these things are opened up and by which the data is extracted , '' Waldron said . `` This process is filmed , there 'll be officials on hand . So it 's kind of a long process . ''

The flight data recorder requires special software to retrieve the reams of data it contains .

The NTSC 's final report into Adam Air Flight 574 -- which crashed in Indonesian waters on New Year 's Day , 2007 , killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after the disaster .

The report on Flight QZ8501 is likely to take at least year to cover all the different angles , according to Ross .
