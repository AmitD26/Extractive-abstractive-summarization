Beirut , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hezbollah 's chief on Monday announced the group 's new `` manifesto , '' which calls on all countries to `` liberate Jerusalem '' and declares the United States a threat to the world .

`` American terrorism is the source of every terrorism in the world , '' Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech from an undisclosed location .

`` We invite and call on all Arabs and Muslims and all countries keen on peace and stability in the world to intensify efforts and resources to liberate Jerusalem from Zionist occupation and to maintain its true identity and its Islamic and Christian sanctities , '' Nasrallah said .

Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks . It has been linked to attacks against against American , Israeli and other Western targets .

In his remarks , which included about 80 minutes of reading the manifesto followed by answering questions from reporters , Nasrallah sought to reject the `` terrorist '' label , repeatedly saying Hezbollah is a `` resistance '' force .

`` Iran plays a central role in the Muslim world '' and `` stood with courage and determination with Arab and Islamic issues , especially the Palestinian issue , '' Nasrallah said .

A battle to end Syria 's occupation of Lebanon led to protests and confrontations in the streets in 2005 , which was labeled the Cedar Revolution . Syria eventually withdrew its troops from the country .

In his `` manifesto '' Monday , Nasrallah also touched on domestic issues .

`` We want a government that works to strengthen the role of women in society and enhance their participation in all fields , '' he added .

Nasrallah also called for Palestinians in Lebanon to `` be given basic human rights which at the same time protect their identity and their cause . ''

`` The majority rely entirely on UNRWA as the sole provider of education , health and relief and social services , '' the agency says on its Web site . `` Considered as foreigners , Palestine refugees are prohibited by law from working in more than 70 trades and professions . This has led to a very high rate of unemployment amongst the refugee population . ''
