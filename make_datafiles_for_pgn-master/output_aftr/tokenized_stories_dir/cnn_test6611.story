You think that every couple you see is lucky in love , even though it 's not true . If you drill down on your blossoming blues , you will feel like you are destined to be alone forever and then work yourself up into a pretty yucky pity-party .

It 's important to try and do an end run around any deepening sadness . There are a number of ways to avoid a noxious slump . You can remind yourself how lucky you are in other ways -LRB- mildly effective -RRB- , how artificial the day is -LRB- so what ? -RRB- , how many of those couples will actually break up -LRB- mean-spirited -RRB- or you can make Valentine 's Day a blast and actually enjoy yourself .

Do n't turn Valentine 's Day into a Cry Day , a Moping Day or a Drinking Day . Here are some of my favorite remedies for lonely Valentine 's Days :

Distract yourself with something fabulous

Sometimes , that 's the only way to get out of a really bad mood . In other words , simply be so engaged in something that you ca n't even remember it is Valentine 's Day .

The point of all this is to keep yourself in the moment as opposed to being alone with your refrigerator , giving in to its siren call to open the door and eat every carton of ice

There is basically nothing better for you than hanging out with people you love or like a lot . A raucous dinner party of your favorite peeps is going to make you happy , feel fortunate and know that your life is on the right track , whether or not you have that special someone . Better yet , make it a pajama party so you are not alone at 2 a.m. wondering why you ever got a king-sized mattress .

Yes , your heart beats faster when you are in love . But it also beats faster when you are in the mountains hiking , snowshoeing , skiing or maybe on dirt bikes exploring back woods trails . Mother Nature fills your heart with wonder , even adoration , and those endorphins pulsing through your body create contentment and sometimes , bliss .

There 's nothing like going to help someone less fortunate than you that makes you kick yourself in the butt for even momentarily feeling sorry for yourself .

Bring Valentines to a children 's hospital , a homeless shelter or maybe just your shut-in great aunt . Give joy to others . You will like yourself better and you might continue this custom even after you have found a loving partner . Maybe get a group of other single friends to go with you and go out afterward together so that you can share that fulfilled feeling of having given love to people who badly need it .

There are other things you can do , but the point is that single people can find a way to celebrate this day that will not feel like a compromise .

But who knows ? You might like all the things you did this Valentine 's Day so much that you 'll do the same thing next year -- just adding , the love of your life .

Being single on Valentine 's Day can be painful when it 's marketed everywhere as the romantic day of the year
