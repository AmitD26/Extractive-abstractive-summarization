-LRB- CNN -RRB- One icy Sunday afternoon in January , 17-year-old Molly Bair 's father drove her to the local indoor tennis courts in suburban Philadelphia to hit a few balls with a high school friend .

That night , she would be on a train to New York for a photo shoot ; and a week later , on a plane to Paris for the haute couture catwalks .

The unlikely itinerary sums up Bair 's budding fashion career : a whirlwind trip from the mundane life of an American teenager to the rarefied heights of international style and back again -- accompanied by no small amount of adolescent bewilderment .

But she said the features that earned her teasing nicknames like `` praying mantis '' and `` alien '' growing up have set her apart with a coveted allure in the fashion industry .

`` I still kind of resemble a 13-year-old boy , '' she joked .

She equated modeling with commercial beauties like Victoria 's Secret models with their long locks and tan , svelte forms .

But on the editorial side of the spectrum , it 's often the quirk that works -- and it has helped her forge an unusual bond with fellow models .

`` I think it 's because we 're kind of a community of people who have always been the strange , tall , skinny people , '' Bair said . `` It 's crazy how I 've instantly found so many people who are so similar to me . It 's really weird . I 've never been able to make friends so quickly . ''

After realizing that the agency was not only legitimate but one of the top agencies in the country through a quick online search , she and her mother traveled back up to New York a week later -- and `` everything started to happen . ''

In less than a year , she 's walked for major-league designers like Chanel , Alexander Wang , Proenza Schouler , Prada and Giambattista Valli , as well as appeared in Vogue Italia , W Magazine and a campaign for American brand Coach .

But there 's still a learning curve , especially for someone who three months ago was filling out college applications and thinking about majoring in computer science or a career in environmental lobbying .

`` I wore heels one time before fashion . And it was at my eighth grade graduation , and they were platforms ... and I actually fell down the stairs . So I 've always had a kind of very unhealthy relationship with heels , '' Bair said .
