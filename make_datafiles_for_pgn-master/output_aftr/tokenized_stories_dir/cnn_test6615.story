The former soldiers ' controversial accusations come days after Bergdahl was released after almost five years of enemy captivity .

A U.S. official told CNN that Pentagon and Army officials have looked at the claims , and `` right now there is no evidence to back that up . ''

Asked about the debate , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers allegedly dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl .

Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow , Bergdahl 's former team leader , elaborated on the accusations . `` I ca n't say for a fact and I do n't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find Bergdahl . However , every mission , especially in the following two or more months -- those were directed missions , '' he told CNN 's Jake Tapper . `` Everything after that , they were still missions that were in search of Bergdahl . ''
