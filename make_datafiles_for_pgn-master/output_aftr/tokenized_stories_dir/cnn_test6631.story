-LRB- CNN -RRB- Scene : A warm beach in the Caribbean -LRB- because as long as I 'm setting a scene ... -RRB- , March of 2015

Two women , both , curiously , named `` Sally Kohn , '' recline and sip their drinks at they stare at the blue-green water , occasionally checking their addictive mobile devices for new emails , conversing about the third season of `` House of Cards '' and the political mess in Washington . They 're both bold progressives and Democrats more by default than enthusiasm .

Sally `` Idealistic '' Kohn desperately and impatiently wants the world to be a fairer and more just place and thinks progress toward that goal could immeasurably be helped by a bold leader articulating and pushing for big ideas at the top of the national and global political hierarchy . This Sally is wearing a skimpy bikini .

Sally -LRB- Idealistic -RRB- Kohn : Elizabeth Warren is like the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics today -- she 's our only hope . There 's no one else speaking as sharply and powerfully about inequality and economic populism . Plus she has solutions . -LSB- She takes a sip of her piña colada . -RSB-

Sally P. Kohn : Yeah , but in the latest CNN Democratic primary poll , Warren trails Hillary Clinton by 52 points . Even Joe Biden fared better .

Sally I. Kohn : Those are national polls . Primaries are run state-by-state . And in a different poll , Democratic primary voters in Iowa and in New Hampshire favored Warren over Clinton , so ... .

Sally I. Kohn : Because 63 % do n't know her yet . That 's why she needs to run .

Sally P. Kohn : But be honest , the path to her winning is hard to see . Sure , Barack Obama did it once , but do you really think the Clinton machine will allow itself to be defeated twice ?

Sally I. Kohn : Ah , and that 's reason two why Warren should run -- because even if she ca n't win , she will help shape the political debate and push Hillary Clinton to the left , especially around economic justice issues .

Sally P. Kohn : Maybe , but then in four or eight years when Warren would really have a shot at the presidency , she 'll be a Mitt Romney-esque already-ran , not a bright shiny new candidate . That never helps .

Sally I. Kohn : Maybe Elizabeth Warren can be the candidate to change all that , the candidate for the people , not the political process -- who even appeals to and unites independent and conservative voters who know the economy is ridiculously rigged for the rich and want government to stop aiding and abetting injustice .

Sally I. Kohn : But no , that 's exactly why she has to run -- to make the party stronger , to make Hillary less economically centrist and quick on the military trigger . We need a bold progressive candidate we can rally behind in the primaries . And if Warren wins , great . Her vision also appeals to the broad majority of working people . And if she does n't win the primaries , still great -- we 've sent a clear message to Hillary and forced her to be more populist .

Sally P. Kohn : Maybe ... Or maybe Warren runs and wastes all her political capital , making too many compromises to be a viable candidate and losing her pedestal as an irreverent outsider and then being defeated anyway , so she 's diminished in some of the power and leverage she had before , too . She 's a great leader now , right now , as is . The magnifying glass of a national campaign could expose her imperfections or even burn her up in the sun ... -LSB- She reaches for the suntan lotion . -RSB-

Sally P. Kohn : Maybe we just see things too differently .

-LSB- They both stare down at their drinks and take another sip . -RSB-

Sally I. Kohn : Oh , my piña colada is half-full .
