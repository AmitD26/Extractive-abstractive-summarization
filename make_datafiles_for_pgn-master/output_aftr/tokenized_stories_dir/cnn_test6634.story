The stakes are higher , too . In 2010 , hackers slipped a `` digital bomb '' into the Nasdaq that nearly sabotaged the stock market . In 2012 , Iran ruined 30,000 computers at Saudi oil producer Aramco .

And think of the immense -LRB- and yet undisclosed -RRB- damage from North Korea 's cyberattack on Sony Pictures last year . Computers were destroyed , executives ' embarrassing emails were exposed , and the entire movie studio was thrown into chaos .

In that sense , the first generation of true hackers were `` phreakers , '' a bunch of American punks who toyed with the nation 's telephone system . In 1971 , they discovered that if you whistle at a certain high-pitched tone , 2600-hertz , you could access AT&T 's long-distance switching system .

They would make international phone calls , just for the fun of it , to explore how the telephone network was set up .

This was low-fi stuff . The most famous phreaker , John Draper -LRB- aka `` Cap'n Crunch -RRB- earned his nickname because he realized the toy whistle given away in cereal boxes emitted just the right tone . This trained engineer took that concept to the next level by building a custom `` blue box '' to make those free calls .

This surreptitious little box was such a novel idea that young engineers Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs started building and selling it themselves . These are the guys who would later go on to start Apple .

Wire fraud spiked , and the FBI cracked down on phreakers and their blue boxes . The laws did n't quite fit , though . Kids were charged with making harassing phone calls and the like . But federal agents could n't halt this phenomenon .

A tech-savvy , inquisitive and slightly anti-authoritarian community had been born .

The next generation came in the early 1980s , as people bought personal computers for their homes and hooked them up to the telephone network . The Web was n't yet alive , but computers could still talk to one another .

The 1983 movie `` War Games '' depicted this very thing , only the implications were disastrous . In it , a teenager in Washington state accidentally taps into a military computer and nearly brings the world to nuclear war . It 's no surprise , then , that the FBI was on high alert that year , and arrested six teenagers in Milwaukee -- who called themselves the 414s , after their area code -- when they tapped into the Los Alamos National Laboratory , a nuclear weapon research facility .

Nationwide fears led the U.S. Congress to pass the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in 1986 . Breaking into computer systems was now a crime of its own .

The next year , a few German hackers working for the Russian KGB were caught breaking into the Pentagon . In 1990 , hacker Kevin Poulsen rigged a Los Angeles radio station 's phone system to win a Porsche , only to be arrested afterward .

The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and hackers continued throughout the 1990s . Some hacked for money . Russian mathematician Vladimir Levin was caught stealing $ 10 million from Citibank . Others did it for revenge . Tim Lloyd wiped the computers at Omega Engineering in New Jersey after he was fired .

But hacks were still more of an annoyance than anything devastating , though it was quickly becoming apparent that the potential was there . The stock market , hospitals , credit card transactions -- everything was running on computers now . There was a bone-chilling moment when a ragtag group of hackers calling themselves L0pht testified before Congress in 1998 and said they could shut down the Internet in 30 minutes .

The danger was suddenly more real than ever .

An unpatched bug in Windows could let a hacker enter a bank , or a foreign government office . Mafias and governments were willing to pay top dollar for this entry point . A totally different kind of black market started to grow .

`` It 's no longer a quest for information and knowledge by exploring networks . It 's about dollars , '' Thomas said . `` Researchers are no longer motivated to get stuff fixed . Now , they say , ` I 'm going to go looking for bugs to get a paycheck - and sell this bug to a government . ' ''

Loosely affiliated amateurs were replaced by well-paid , trained professionals . By the mid-2000s , hacking belonged to organized crime , governments and hacktivists .

Hacking payment systems turned out to be insanely lucrative , too . Albert Gonzalez 's theft of 94 million credit cards from the company TJX in 2007 proved to be a precursor to later retailer data breaches , like Target , Home Depot and many more .

Then there 's government . When the United States wanted to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program in 2009 , it hacked a development facility and unleashed the most dangerous computer virus the world has ever seen . Stuxnet caused the Iranian lab computers to spin centrifuges out of control .

This was unprecedented : a digital strike with extreme physical consequences .

Meanwhile , it 's easier than ever to become a hacker . Digital weapons go for mere dollars on easily accessible black markets online . Anonymity is a few clicks away with the right software . And there are high-paying jobs in defending companies like Google or JPMorgan Chase -- or attacking them .
