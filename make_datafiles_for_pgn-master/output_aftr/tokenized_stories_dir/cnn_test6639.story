Police say Robert -LRB- Bob -RRB- Bates , 73 , thought he pulled out his Taser during an arrest , but instead shot the suspect , who later died at a local hospital .

The shooting happened after an apparent drug and gun selling operation by the Tulsa Violent Crimes task force Thursday . Bates , a member of the task force , was part of a group of deputies trying to arrest Eric Courtney Harris , 44 , in the parking lot of a Dollar General store .

After a brief pursuit , police say Harris was forced to the ground , where he continued to resist arrest and `` refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband . ''

It was during this portion of the arrest that police say `` the reserve deputy was attempting to use less lethal force , believing he was utilizing a Taser , when he inadvertently discharged his service weapon , firing one round which struck Harris . ''

Harris died at a local hospital and his cause of death is under investigation . Police say Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of Phencyclidine , a street drug commonly known as PCP .

When asked by CNN affiliate KTUL whether age may have played a factor in the `` inadvertent '' shooting , Clark says `` did an accident happen ? Sure . But is it accredited to his age ? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation ? I guess that will be determined in the investigation . ''
