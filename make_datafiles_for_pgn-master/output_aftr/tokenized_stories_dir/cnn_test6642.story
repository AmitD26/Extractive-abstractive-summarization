-LRB- CNN -RRB- The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client `` completely unsubstantiated . ''

Appearing Saturday morning on CNN 's `` New Day , '' Randy Zelin defended his client , Dr. Anthony Moschetto , who faces criminal solicitation , conspiracy , burglary , arson , criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island .

`` He 's got patients to see . This man , while he was in a detention cell , the only thing that he cared about were his patients . And amazingly , his patients were flooding the office with calls , making sure that he was OK , '' Zelin said .

Two other men -- identified as James Chmela , 43 , and James Kalamaras , 41 -- were named as accomplices , according to prosecutors .

Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto 's home , including hand grenades , high-capacity magazines and knives . Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf , according to prosecutors .

Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to `` blow up a building . '' He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead . Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson , according to prosecutors .

`` The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute , '' according to the statement from the district attorney 's office .

Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist , according to prosecutors . He also requested that the rival 's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present , authorities said .

`` He was willing to pay $ 5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months , and then he said he would pay $ 20,000 to have him killed , '' said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly , according to CNN affiliate WCBS .
