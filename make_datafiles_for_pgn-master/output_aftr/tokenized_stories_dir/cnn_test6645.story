Then came the inevitable cry : That 's it ? What happens next ?

Sarah Jessica Parker , who played Carrie , wanted to find out as well . But the situation had to be right , she said , which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together , fell apart and came together again .

Now that the movie is out , Parker -- who 's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big-screen `` Sex and the City '' with `` Showbiz Tonight '' anchor A.J. Hammer . The following is an edited version of that interview .

CNN : I think a lot of fans , maybe a lot of people , and those of you among the cast , did n't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are . So how are you feeling deep inside , Sarah ?

Sarah Jessica Parker : I feel extraordinarily privileged . I 've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together . ... It 's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of professional experience and one really should n't be greedy enough to ask for it twice . Watch the cast talk about the thrill of `` Sex '' ''

I have to say that , this last six , eight months , was better than those seven years -LSB- the show aired -RSB- and I think it 's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you do n't get to tell twice . It has been , I must say , worth every obstacle and dead end , and fit and start , and every moment that was seemingly impossible . It has been a dream .

CNN : And I imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read , which was , from my understanding , the first time you all actually were in the same room -LSB- together -RSB- regardless of how much you kept in touch . Tell me a little bit about that moment .

Parker : I started putting -LSB- the -RSB- script back together in April of 2006 ... and that -LSB- table read -RSB- was a really extraordinary day , because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated .

It was a kind of reunion that is very , very special , because you really want to be there . It 's not the reunion where you 're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely . It 's the reunion that you want .

CNN : I think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on `` Oprah , '' because the energy was ... palpable . ...

Parker : I find it slightly -- it 's not that I 'm mad . I expect better from people . I think it 's really beneath me , to keep defending myself . I have a 35-year career . I have an impeccable character , I really pride myself in my work ethic and the way I treat people . And I think Kim would say the same and Cynthia would say the same . And I love Kim , and I wanted her to be in this movie . We could n't have done it without her , we could n't have done it without Kristin , we could n't have done it without Cynthia -LSB- Nixon -RSB- , nor could we have done it without Chris . Watch Cattrall address the rumors ''

CNN : You seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to , being at the game as long as you 've been . To that end , one of the things that I 've always admired about you and -LSB- husband -RSB- Matthew -LSB- Broderick -RSB- and I think a lot of people do , is how you 've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight . ...

Now I know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you do n't talk about your private lives , which is great and I applaud that . That said , is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that ?

We run to the market on our own , we take the subway , and we integrate into our city , and we become a part of the fabric and I think it 's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son .

CNN : Is it the end of `` Sex and the City '' ? What does your gut tell you ?
