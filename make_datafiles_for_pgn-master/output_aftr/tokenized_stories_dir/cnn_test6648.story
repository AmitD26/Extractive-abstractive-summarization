`` Although Texas law clearly prohibits profiteering during declared disasters , these defendants are charged with increasing room rates for evacuees during Hurricane Ike , '' Abbott said in a news release . `` The law imposes strict penalties on vendors that attempt to increase their profits after the governor issues a disaster declaration .

`` Despite today 's price-gouging charges , the vast majority of Texas businesses complied with the law and are to be commended for working with authorities to provide crucial assistance to hurricane victims . ''

An estimated 1.2 million Gulf Coast residents heeded officials ' recommendations that they move inland until the storm had passed .

Hotel Nacogdoches , located north of Houston along a major evacuation route , charged evacuees more than double its usual rate , the statement said , citing complaints from guests whose receipts showed the hotel charged $ 99.99 for a room that had cost $ 49.99 two days before Ike .

The office of the attorney general is seeking civil penalties of up to $ 20,000 per violation and up to $ 250,000 per violation for victims over the age of 65 .

Managers from neither hotel immediately returned calls seeking comment .
