Some Premier League fans will save on season tickets after five clubs cut prices .

Price cuts have been announced at five English Premier League clubs . Manchester City , Sunderland , Everton , Portsmouth and Newcastle United have cut prices , while five further clubs announced price freezes on their season tickets .

Bolton dropped their season ticket prices last season .

The move comes amid a slight decline in Premiership football crowds this season . The average attendance at Premier League matches is down about 800 per match compared to the 2007/2008 season -- however , on average the stadiums are still at almost 92 percent capacity .

In the U.S. Major League Soccer side Kansas City Wizards recently announced they would drop ticket prices for the coming season .

Wizards president Robb Heinemann was quoted in the Kansas City Star saying ; `` We understand these are tough economic times . ''

Other countries in Europe have maintained lower prices in recent years , with single tickets available for about 10 Euros in club games in Italy and Germany . Tickets in Australia 's A-League tended to be cheaper yet , while South America and Africa/Middle East remained the cheapest .

Dan Johnson of the Premier League told CNN the clubs cutting ticket prices were simply responding to the financial climate .

Johnson said the drop in crowds this season was not significant and may be made up towards the end of the season when attendances are traditionally higher .

However , Chadwick said English football fans should n't hope for significant price reductions .

`` Some Premier League clubs are running at nearly 100 % capacity and there 's excess demand ... so in the short-to-medium term they should be able to continue at premium prices , '' Chadwick said .
