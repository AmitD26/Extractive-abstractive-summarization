-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British-owned cargo ship on Monday became the latest vessel to be seized by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden .

International naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks .

The 32,000-tonne Malaspina Castle was taken early on Monday and was believed to be heading towards Somalia 's pirate-infested coast , the European Union 's Horn of Africa maritime security center said .

The vessel , which is operated by an Italian company , carried a crew of 24 , from Bulgaria , Ukraine , Russia and the Philippines , Britain 's Telegraph newspaper reported .

He added : `` It is likely to be taken towards the Somali coast and negotiations will begin soon . ''

Meanwhile , the BBC reported that a Taiwanese fishing boat , with a crew of 29 , was also hijacked Monday approximately 260 km -LRB- 160 miles -RRB- from the Seychelles .

The latest attacks follow a string of incidents in the pirate-plagued waterway off Somalia at the weekend , with a French yacht , a Yemeni tugboat and a German ship also reported to have been seized .

He added : `` I 'm not sure that this is going to be a long-term thing and I 'm also worried that the pirates will start seizing ships well away from the areas being patrolled .

`` In Somalia , piracy is like a big , successful industry and the authorities there need to act . The pirates are treated like local heroes . People look up to them and girls want to marry them . They are seen by some locals as good people but they are ruthless . ''
