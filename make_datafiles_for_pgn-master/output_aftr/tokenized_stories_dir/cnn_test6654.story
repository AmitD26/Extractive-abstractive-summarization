MORRISTOWN , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Since the beginning of the year the family clinic at the Children 's Hospital of New Jersey has seen an influx of young children coming in for flu shots .

New Jersey requires children from 6 months to 5 years old to get the flu vaccine to attend daycare or pre-school .

Some parents are upset about the requirement . John General and Alnisa Bernabela brought their 4-year-old twins Jahmein and Jameir to the clinic last week for the flu shots .

`` I 'm really not okay with it because I think it should have been my choice , '' said Bernabela .

`` By them forcing this , I feel like our rights have been violated , '' said General , holding his crying son Jameir being vaccinated .

Last fall , hundreds of parents with the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccination Choice challenged the flu shot requirement at a rally in Trenton , New Jersey . The NJCVC and parents interviewed by CNN , expressed concern about the safety of influenza vaccines and possible long-term effects on young children .

But the New Jersey Department of Health says the new law is for the public good citing Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention numbers showing an average of 20,000 children under age 5 are hospitalized nationwide each year because of influenza complications .

`` Parents are certainly concerned about the health and safety of their children , '' says Dr. Christina Tan , state epidemiologist for the New Jersey Department of Health . `` But it 's equally important to understand that the flu vaccine is safe and effective in preventing illness , not only in children , but also among the community as a whole . ''

`` Kids under the age of 5 are targeted by this recommendation because when they get the disease they get sicker than adults do . They also are the ones who are more likely to transmit the flu because they are in closed quarters , '' said Dr. Nwando Anyaoku , who heads the clinic at the Children 's Hospital of New Jersey . She says influenza tends to peak in New Jersey towards the end of January through early February .

Caleb 's doctors were stumped and could n't make a diagnosis for his condition . Since then , the Franks with their pediatrician 's approval , have Caleb on a delayed vaccination schedule . As a result , they did n't meet the state 's December 31 flu shot deadline and now their local board of health has banned Caleb from pre-school .

`` By allowing broader exemptions this could potentially erode the very core of protection , '' says Tan .

New Jersey Republican Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk has been working on legislation to allow parents to decide which vaccines they want their child to receive .

For now , though , Caleb must remain out of school . He 's confused as to why he ca n't return .

`` He does n't understand what 's going on , '' says Jennifer Frank . `` It 's been hard to explain it to him . ''

`` As far as trying to identify whether there 's actually a drop in disease incidence in the community , that 's going to be a longer term type of evaluation that we 're starting to look at , '' says Tan .
