VERO BEACH , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Rev. Michael Massaro says he has a few aches and pains , but a good night 's sleep has done him some good as he recovers from being attacked Saturday with a knife in a confessional at his church .

The Rev. Michael Massaro is recovering from two stab wounds that required 14 staples to close .

Massaro had just finished hearing confessions in his Florida church when he was stabbed twice in the back by a woman who later told police Massaro is the Antichrist .

Gatchell is scheduled to be arraigned on June 12 . She has not yet been appointed a lawyer , prosecutors and the public defender said .

`` She believed -LSB- Massaro -RSB- was the Antichrist and it was her duty to go there and injure him , '' police spokesman John Morrison said .

Massaro said his alleged attacker stared at him but never said a word .

`` I ran and got to the car and hoped I could make it to the hospital before I passed out . I was worried about becoming unconscious . Thanks be to God that I did n't hurt anyone driving , '' he said .

An emergency room doctor told police that the knife `` went through muscle , a few veins and chipped a rib , '' according to an arrest affidavit . The blade missed vital organs by two to three centimeters , the affidavit said .

Massaro underwent surgery to repair the damage . Doctors used 14 staples to close the `` T '' - shaped wounds .

`` We have to continue to pray to do the church 's work . To love , and most of all to forgive , '' he said . `` To be sure she does n't do this again , she needs proper medical care . No one in their right mind would do this . ''

`` As I was running away from her , I realized who she was , '' he said . `` She did n't make any efforts to come after me . I was still in a state of shock . ''

At the hospital , Massaro was able to pick Gatchell out of a photo lineup , police said . She was not at home when police went to question her , according to the arrest affidavit .

Later , police received an anonymous tip that she was staying elsewhere . When police arrived , Gatchell answered the door and allegedly stated , `` You know who I am , and I know why you 're here . ''

When asked what she stabbed him with , the suspect replied , `` It was a big knife , '' the affidavit said . Police say she told them that the knife was in three different places , but it was never located .

Vero Beach Police say that Gatchell appears to be a troubled woman .

`` When you go back a second time , that raises more concerns . Her violence escalated the second time , '' said police spokesman Morrison .

And just for the record , `` I am not the Antichrist , that I know of , '' Massaro said with a laugh .
