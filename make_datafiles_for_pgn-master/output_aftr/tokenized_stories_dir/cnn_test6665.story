Samantha Orobator became pregnant in prison , according to a spokeswoman for rights group Reprieve .

Samantha Orobator `` is facing death by firing squad for drug trafficking , '' said Clare Algar , executive director of Reprieve , a London-based human rights group .

Orobator 's mother Jane found out in January her daughter was pregnant -- more than four months after she was arrested , her mother said .

Jane Orobator heard the news from the British Foreign Office , which has been monitoring the case , the mother told CNN by phone from Dublin , where she lives .

She can not believe her daughter was involved in drug trafficking , and was surprised to learn she was in Laos , she said .

`` She is not the type of person who would be involved in drugs , '' she added .

She is due to give birth in September , the lawyer added .

`` Reprieve heard about her case two weeks ago . We had thought yesterday the trial was going to start today , '' Algar said Monday . `` We have now heard from Anna that it is not going to . ''

`` I am the first British lawyer who has asked for access to her , '' Morris said . `` She needs to have a local lawyer appointed to her . We are pressing very hard for the local authorities to appoint one . ''

She said it was normal in the Laotian justice system for a defendant to get a lawyer only days before a trial .

British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell issued a statement about Orobator on Saturday .

`` We are paying close attention to her welfare and are in regular contact with the Laotian authorities about her case . British Embassy officials , including the Ambassador , have visited her six times since her arrest , '' he said .

`` In addition , Britain 's consular representatives in Laos , the Australian Embassy , including the Australian Embassy doctor , have visited Samantha 10 times on our behalf , '' he said .

There is no British Embassy in Laos . A British vice-consul arrived in the country this weekend , the Foreign Office said Monday .

Rammell plans to raise the Orobator case with the Laotian deputy prime minister this week , he said .

Samantha Orobator was born in Nigeria and moved to London with her family when she was 8 , her mother said .
