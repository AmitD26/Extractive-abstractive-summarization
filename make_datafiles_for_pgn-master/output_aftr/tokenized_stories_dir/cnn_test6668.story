Miguel Tejada , a shortstop for the Houston Astros , has been charged with lying to Congress .

In a document filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia , Tejada is charged in a criminal `` information , '' a document that routinely signals a plea bargain agreement . The document does not directly accuse Tejada of using steroids or other substances .

However , the court document says that in 2003 Tejada gave another player more than $ 5,000 in checks `` for substances which he believed to be HGH -LSB- human growth hormone -RSB- . ''

The document says Tejada lied to congressional investigators when he told them on August 26 , 2005 , that he had never heard discussions about steroids by other players , and that he never knew of any other player using steroids .

`` Defendant Tejada unlawfully withheld pertinent information from the committee because defendant Tejada before and during his interview with the committee staff , then and there well knew that Player # 1 -LSB- unidentified -RSB- , one of his teammates on the Oakland Athletics , had used steroids and HGH , '' the document says .

Tejada played for the Athletics from 1997 to 2003 .

He is scheduled to appear at 11 a.m. Wednesday before a magistrate judge , indicating the charge against him will be a misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of a year in jail . However , a government official familiar with the case said that under sentencing guidelines , Tejada could get from zero to 6 months , which means he may receive probation without jail time .
