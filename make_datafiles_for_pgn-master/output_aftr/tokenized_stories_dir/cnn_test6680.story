Editor 's note : Daria Roithmayr is a law professor at the University of Southern California , Gould School of Law , where she teaches on race and law . She worked for Sen. Edward Kennedy as special counsel on the Clarence Thomas and David Souter confirmation hearings . Guy-Uriel Charles is a law professor at Duke Law School where he is the founding director of the Center on Law , Race , and Politics .

No one was surprised when the subject of race dominated the public conversation during Sonia Sotomayor 's confirmation hearings . What was surprising was how unwilling both sides of the aisle were to talk about race openly .

Republicans tried to argue that race should be completely separated from judicial decision-making .

For their part , Democrats tried to minimize the importance of her race to her decision-making by focusing on her record , to show that her race had played no role in her decisions .

Judge Sotomayor herself suggested that life experiences are an important part of the process of judging , but then sought to minimize the difference that those experiences might have made to a particular result .

Most people understand that life experiences and racial identity do affect the decision-making process . But is this something to be lamented or celebrated ? We think the latter .

In this , the not quite post-racial era of Obama , scholars are developing new understandings of the connection between race , life experience and decisions . Researchers such as Scott Page and James Surowiecki are telling us that varied life experiences and ethnicity can improve the result when a group makes decisions together .

The Constitution itself recognizes the importance of life experiences to legal decision-making . Defendants in the criminal process are entitled to a jury of their peers precisely because jurors bring to the process a collection of life experiences that will shape their understanding of the facts and the law .

All-white juries are problematic in large part because we believe that the life experiences of jurors are an integral part of their collective judgment of innocence or guilt .

These days , the best thinking on race focuses less on racial symbolism and more on understanding how race affects a person 's life experiences and life chances -- her access to education , health care , economic and physical security , her experience with the criminal justice system , whether she grew up wealthy or in a public housing project .

Although we have not yet figured out the meaning of race in this supposedly post-racial era , we know that race still matters , even as we know that it does not matter in the same way that it used to .

Democrats and Republicans should acknowledge that having a Latina on the bench will make a difference because it will improve the court 's collective decision-making .
