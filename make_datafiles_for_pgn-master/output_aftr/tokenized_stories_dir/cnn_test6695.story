CNN affiliate KHOU of Houston , Texas , said calls poured in from as far away as Connecticut after the station aired its story on Mable Randon , a stage 4 cancer patient who received a cutoff notice after she fell behind on her bills .

`` I 'm on a set income , '' she told KHOU . `` My husband lost his job . He finds a little work every now and then , but it 's hard . ''

`` I 'm fighting for my life , and I thought people at the power company would help me , '' said Randon , who uses a wheelchair . `` I just thought they 'd make some kind of exception for me . ''

Randon 's power will stay on until the commission examines the facts in the case , said Terry Hadley , spokesman for the commission .

CenterPoint told Randon she failed to meet the criteria . Spokeswoman Alicia Dixon told KHOU that Randon could have bought a battery-powered oxygen machine . The critical care program has thousands of applicants , and only 300 of them have been accepted , she said .

`` This program is a communication program , not a guarantee of uninterrupted power , even to customers who are on the list , '' she said .

Since the rejection , Randon said she is `` up and down all night , '' partly because she is worried about whether the power will be on when she wakes up .

`` They have no consideration for life , '' she said . `` It 's just like they do n't care . ''

CenterPoint spokeswoman Leticia Lowe said the company does not send electric bills ; it merely owns the wires and poles and is directed to disconnect power by retail electric providers .
