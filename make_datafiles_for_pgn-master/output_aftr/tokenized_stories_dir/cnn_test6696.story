-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To offset carbon dioxide , a Japanese airline is asking its passengers to go to the toilet before boarding .

All Nippon Airways is asking passengers to use the restroom before flying to reduce weight .

The unusual request by All Nippon Airways -LRB- ANA -RRB- is part of its `` e-Flight '' promotional program to reduce the amount of carbon expelled on 38 domestic routes and its twice daily international flights to Singapore .

`` Asking passengers to go to the toilet -LRB- before boarding -RRB- is just a small part of the program , '' said spokeswoman Megumi Tezuka , which includes using recycled paper cups and plastic bottles instead of glass .

Flights will also show educational films on the environment .

The program comes as the airline industry in Japan is struggling . The nation 's largest carrier , Japan Airlines , is seeking a government bailout and forecasts $ 700 million in losses this year . This week , ANA 's stock price hit a 52-week low in trading Wednesday .
