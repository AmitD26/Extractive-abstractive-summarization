Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Pentagon is blocking public release of photos apparently depicting abuse of suspected terrorists and foreign troops in U.S. custody , and urging the Supreme Court to dismiss a lower court ruling ordering the photos to be publicly disclosed , according to court documents .

Defense Secretary Robert Gates notified the high court late Friday that he was issuing an order to block the release .

The Pentagon initially was set to release the images of Iraqi and Afghan prisoners in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the ACLU .

But Obama and the Justice Department objected to the court-ordered release , reversing an earlier executive decision . Obama had initially agreed to the release , but changed his mind after military leaders privately and intensely urged him to block it .

The ACLU criticized the administration 's about-face , saying it `` makes a mockery '' of Obama 's campaign promise of greater transparency and accountability , and damages efforts to hold accountable those responsible for abusing prisoners .

According to the government legal brief filed with the high court , several of the photos show `` soldiers pointing pistols or rifles at the heads of hooded and handcuffed detainees . '' Other images described by military reports show prisoners in restrained and humiliating positions . Military investigations led to criminal charges against some of the soldiers shown in the images .

The photos currently at issue are separate from those first publicly released in 2006 showing abuse of Muslim men held at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib prison .

The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 2008 that the photos must be released . The president later said that doing so `` would pose an unacceptable risk of danger to U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq . ''

Newest Justice Sonia Sotomayor had served on that appeals court until August , but was not involved in that particular case .

The high court has delayed for weeks a decision on whether it would accept the ACLU appeal on the broader issues associated with government authority to block release of potentially embarrassing and inflammatory material by the military . The justices will now probably wait to hear from the ACLU over Gates ' order before deciding whether to take the case .

A brief was filed by the Justice Department late Friday , the same time as the separate photograph disclosure case .

Four British men , all Muslims and former detainees at the military prison at the Navy base in Cuba , had sued onetime Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other top Pentagon officials , saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law .

The case is Rasul v. Myers -LRB- 09-227 -RRB- .
