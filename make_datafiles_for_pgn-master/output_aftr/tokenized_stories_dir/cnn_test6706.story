Patch died peacefully at his care home in the southwestern English city of Wells , the ministry announced .

Patch was the last surviving soldier to have witnessed the horrors of trench warfare in the first World War

He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres , Belgium , in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele , in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends .

The unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres , where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand .

He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic .

After the war , Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer . He married Ada Billington , a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle . They married in 1919 and had two sons .

At one point , he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil , where he became friendly with some of the men . Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted , with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten , on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France , the Ministry of Defence said .

Patch did n't speak about the war until he turned 100 , the Ministry of Defence said .

`` He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible ; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life , '' a Ministry of Defence biography says .

`` That suited Harry ; he could ` forget ' his demons , the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends . ''

It was n't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation , speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions , the Ministry of Defence said .

`` In speaking about his experiences , Harry began at last to come to terms with his war , and was at peace with himself and his memories , '' the Defence Ministry said . `` His thoughts then turned to reconciliation , to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering . ''

On his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor , and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer .

Last year , King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold .

`` While the country may remember Harry as a soldier , we will remember him as a dear friend , '' said Jim Ross , a close friend . `` He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages : Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides , -LRB- and -RRB- settle disputes by discussion , not war . ''

Gen. Richard Dannatt , the chief of the general staff , issued a statement expressing his sadness about Patch 's death .
