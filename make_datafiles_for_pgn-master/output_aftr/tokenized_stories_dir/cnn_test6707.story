-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Africa pace bowler Dale Steyn ripped through India 's batsmen on the third day of the first cricket Test in Nagpur , taking eight wickets as the hosts were forced to follow on .

Steyn took a career-best 7-51 as India , resuming on 25-0 overnight , were skittled for just 233 to concede a massive first-innings deficit of 325 runs .

The haul took Steyn to 193 wickets in his 37th Test and gave South Africa a great chance of winning the two-match series against a side who usurped their No. 1 ranking in the five-day format late last year .

He claimed five wickets in less than four overs after tea as India collapsed from 221-4 .

`` We actually had the ball changed when we came out after tea because the seam had popped open on the old one , '' Steyn told reporters . `` We hoped to get a bit of reverse swing -- it worked in our favor . ''

Steyn 's strike partner Morne Morkel set the tone when he had Gautam Gambhir caught by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher with his first delivery of the day , with the opener not adding to his overnight score of 12 .

Proteas captain Graeme Smith made the Indians bat again , despite Boucher not being able to take the field due to a back injury .

Morkel again accounted for Gambhir as the opener misjudged an inswinger and had his castle wrecked after shouldering arms , and Steyn had Sehwag caught by Smith at slip for 16 .

Meanwhile , New Zealand took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the one-day series against visiting Bangladesh , winning the second match by five wickets in Dunedin on Monday .
