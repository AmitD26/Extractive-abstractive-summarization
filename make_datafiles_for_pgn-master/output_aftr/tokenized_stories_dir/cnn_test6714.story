A 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit at 11:39 a.m. local time -LRB- 9:39 a.m. ET -RRB- , followed by a 6.7-magnitude quake 16 minutes later , the U.S. Geological Survey reported . A third , measured at magnitude 6.0 , came 27 minutes later .

They were the strongest aftershocks to rattle Chile since a February 27 earthquake on the country 's west coast that toppled buildings and spawned a tsunami , killing several hundred people .

Thursday 's quakes shook the ground near Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins near the coast just as Chile prepared to inaugurate a new president , Sebastian Pinera .

The central Chilean city of Rancagua was affected , Pinera said .

Rancagua Mayor Eduardo Soto said that no fatalities were immediately reported and that the biggest worry was damage to homes , CNN Chile reported .

After his inauguration Thursday , Pinera visited Rancagua , where he confirmed there were no initial reports of fatalities .

He said that no curfew would be imposed for now and reiterated his call for calm . A priority is for the school year to start as scheduled next week , he said .

He also said Thursday afternoon that he would declare the area a catastrophe zone .

The country 's national emergency authorities also put in place a tsunami alert for the coastal area near where the earthquakes hit , and authorities ordered evacuations of some coastal areas .

`` I do n't want to alarm anyone , -LSB- the alert -RSB- is solely precautionary , but we have to take precautions when there are human lives at risk , '' Pinera said .

A second earthquake -- with an initial magnitude of 6.9 -- struck moments later . It was about 89 miles -LRB- 143 km -RRB- southwest of Santiago , the USGS said . The third was about 86 miles -LRB- 138 km -RRB- southwest of Santiago .

Rolando Santos , senior vice president and general manager of CNN Chile , said he and his colleagues felt one of the quakes .

`` I can tell you within our newsroom in Santiago , which is state of the art in terms of seismic construction , it shook for more than 45 seconds , '' he said .

Authorities this week released the names of 279 people whose bodies had been identified in the quake , but officials said the new tally does not include hundreds of unidentified victims .

The February 27 earthquake was violent enough to move the Chilean city of Concepcion at least 10 feet to the west and Santiago about 11 inches to the west-southwest , researchers said .
