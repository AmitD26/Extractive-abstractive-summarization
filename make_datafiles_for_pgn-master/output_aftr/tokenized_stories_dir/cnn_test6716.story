TOKYO , Japan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Even in the midst of Japan 's deepest economic recession since World War II , the country 's love hotel industry is thriving .

`` It 's a natural human desire . Even these days , on the weekend , every love hotel is full of people -- it 's hard to get in . You can never stop sexual desire , '' said a woman with her boyfriend in Tokyo , who laughed in embarrassment when asked for her name .

Love hotels fill a need for privacy in a country where high population density often means couples have little time alone .

Rooms offer a broad assortment of features , including karaoke machines , PlayStation game consoles , DVD players , a variety of cosmetics , customized condoms and indoor-outdoor Jacuzzis . Watch Morgan Neill 's report from inside a love hotel ''

Though required by law to have a front desk , most can be rented and entered without talking to a clerk .

The days of Japanese being ashamed to enter love hotels are coming to an end , though , Mansfield said .

`` The bad image that love hotels had has faded over time . Also , customers started to raise their voices and became more selective about choosing hotels . In response , management has improved . ''

The flashiest love hotels are found in Osaka , including a Hello Kitty-themed hotel and one with a room featuring a merry-go-round .

Tokyo hotels tend to be tamer , focused on winning customers with amenities . The Style A Hotel , for example , offers a suite for $ 190 that includes a full-size Jacuzzi and a private sauna .

Whatever the reasons , the hotels have been doing well enough that Mansfield recently went to London , seeking investors to expand .

That fragmentation is a structural inefficiency in the market , he said , one he would like to help correct .
