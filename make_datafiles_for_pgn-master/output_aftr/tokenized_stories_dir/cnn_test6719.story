Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of a humanitarian aid group and a few of his colleagues survived 50 hours beneath the rubble of a hotel , with the help of a few things he keeps in his bag for his two young children .

`` We had one Tootsie Pop and we did share that , '' said Rick Santos , president and CEO of IMA World Health .

He also had a bit of gum .

While the supplies helped , Santos said , `` I think we made it because we talked to each other , we helped each other , and we had this hope that we would be rescued at some point . ''

Two of his colleagues did not survive .

Santos and five colleagues had been walking through the lobby of the Hotel Montana last Tuesday when he saw one of the chandeliers swing . `` And before it even made its way down , just everything crashed and collapsed on top of us , '' he told CNN 's `` American Morning '' on Monday .

Santos had some over-the-counter pain medicine and gave it to them .

`` My biggest fear initially was that there was n't going to be enough air for the six of us , '' he said . Then , when it became clear there was enough air , `` We started talking about what we need to do . And , you know , from the size of the earthquake , from what we heard and what we felt and how fast the building fell , we knew it was a big quake . ''

The next morning , they could hear sledgehammers pounding as rescuers were checking to see if there were survivors . The trapped group screamed and banged on the walls , and rescuers heard them . The rescuers asked how many there were ; Santos answered eight -- six in his group , and two other men trapped in an elevator shaft .

Then , on Thursday , came a voice . `` We all started to scream and shout at the top of our lungs . And we heard a voice come back to us saying , you know , ` Hello , we 're here . We 're going to rescue you . ' ''

While Santos is relieved to be reunited with his family in the United States , his thoughts are with the people of Haiti .
