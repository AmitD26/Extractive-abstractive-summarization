Under U.S. law , and in all 50 states , the herbal product is legal , and also unregulated . People who have tried K2 often report psychoactive effects that are comparable to marijuana , but notably less pleasurable .

Government-funded media campaigns have sought to scare children and adults away from marijuana with grossly exaggerated claims that using the drug will lead to death and mayhem .

Despite all of these efforts , the public has largely dismissed the myths and hysteria around marijuana and recognized that the drug has important medicinal benefits . Moreover , public opinion is leaning in favor of a regulated and taxed market for marijuana .

What 's notable about these synthetic chemicals is that very little is known about them , and this legal alternative designed to deliver an experience like marijuana may actually carry more risk . Thus we have a supreme irony of drug prohibition : The government continues to criminalize marijuana -- a drug with established medical value that has undergone exhaustive study -- and entrepreneurs introduce a legal alternative to marijuana with ingredients scientists know little about .

Lawmakers in Kansas , Kentucky and Missouri have already written legislation to ban the herbal mix . It seems that a reporter need only write an article about an obscure bag of twigs to spur a lawmaker to criminalize more chemicals and the people who use them .

Time and time again , elected officials have dropped the ball when it comes to regulating drugs . Lawmakers have preferred to lazily pass the responsibility of controlling a drug on to law enforcement and the criminal justice system .

The problem is , we know from marijuana prohibition that law enforcement has no control over the drug market and the criminals who run it . Criminalizing K2 will only worsen the devastating harm our society already suffers under drug prohibition . Rather than regulation of the supply and ingredients of K2 , criminalization leaves the question of what goes into the product up to drug dealers .

By choosing to ban K2 outright , lawmakers will also forfeit badly needed state revenue from K2 sales and instead commit millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate , prosecute and jail K2 users . Plus , researchers point out that hundreds of other known synthetic chemicals will easily reach store shelves once K2 is banned .

The sensible legislative response to K2 is to create effective regulatory controls on sale and possession . California and Maine have passed model legislation that formally regulates and taxes adult sales of salvia divinorium -- another product with psychoactive properties -- and criminalizes salvia sales to minors .
