Anthony Sowell , 50 , was arrested in October after authorities serving a search warrant in a rape case discovered six bodies in and around his current home . Subsequent searches turned up five more bodies , all African-American women .

Authorities have said they are looking at the unsolved murders of three women in East Cleveland to determine whether they share any similarities with the remains found at Sowell 's home .

Wednesday 's search comes a day after Sowell was indicted on 85 counts -- including aggravated murder , rape and kidnapping -- in the killings . In addition , Sowell is charged with `` brutalizing '' three other women and raping two of them , Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Mason said Tuesday .

Sowell is now charged with 11 counts of aggravated murder with a `` mass murder specification , '' meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion , Mason said . He also is charged with abuse of a corpse , kidnapping and tampering with evidence .

Sowell already faced charges in the September 22 rape and has pleaded not guilty .

On October 20 , neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of his house . Firefighters responded and later notified police .

But the woman told officers that she fell off the roof while she was at the home `` partying , '' police said earlier . No charges were filed at the time .

Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police , Mason said . It 's possible there are other victims , he added , and urged anyone who has not come forward to do so .

Sowell `` knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he was doing it , '' the prosecutor said .

After the 11 victims were found , police used thermal imaging in mid-November in an attempt to see whether any additional human remains were on the property , and they dug certain areas by hand . No more were found .
