MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed murder charges against two men suspected in the deaths of a charter boat crew , authorities said .

The Joe Cool charter boat was found abandoned last month in the Florida Straits .

The men are being held without bail on suspicion of killing the four-member crew of the Joe Cool fishing boat last month .

Missing are the boat 's captain , Jake Branam ; his wife , Kelly ; and crew members Scott Gamble and Samuel Kairy .

Zarabozo , a licensed security guard , said the hijackers shot the crew members and forced him to throw their bodies overboard .

But , according to court documents filed in the case , Zarabozo and Archer gave inconsistent stories during interviews with authorities regarding what occurred .

Statements given by the pair were not consistent with physical evidence , according to an affidavit supporting the murder charges .

`` Now you have four casings and four people -LSB- presumed -RSB- dead , '' said Jeffrey Branam , the uncle of the boat 's captain .

Last week , a judge said he believes circumstantial evidence shows four homicides took place .

`` Your theory is -LSB- Archer and Zarabozo -RSB- killed the four ? '' the judge asked the assistant U.S. attorney at the bond hearing . `` Yes , your honor , '' the prosecutor replied .

The Coast Guard spent five days searching for the crew before giving up .

Acosta said it is unlikely their bodies will ever be found . Jake Branam and his wife leave behind two small children , he said .

`` It 's difficult , '' Jeffrey Branam said last week . `` Some relatives still think the four are alive and are still searching for them . ''

He said the name of the boat has been removed from the stern , and the name will be retired from the charter fishing business . The boat probably will be retired , too .

Referring to Archer and Zarabozo , Branam said : `` I 'd like to use them as shark bait . '' E-mail to a friend
