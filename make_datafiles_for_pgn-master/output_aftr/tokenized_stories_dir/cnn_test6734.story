The romaine lettuce , sold under the Freshway and Imperial Sysco brands , was recalled in connection with an E. coli outbreak that has sickened at least 19 people in Michigan , Ohio and New York .

Most E. coli strains are harmless , but some cause severe illness . Diarrhea , urinary tract infections , pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses are just some of the consequences of ingesting certain kinds of the bacteria .

Freshway Foods also advised consumers not to eat `` grab and go '' salads sold at in-store salad bars and delis at Kroger , Giant Eagle , Ingles Markets and Marsh stores in 23 states and the District of Columbia .

`` It is important to note that bulk and prepackaged romaine or bagged salad mixes containing romaine that were purchased in supermarkets are not included in this recall ; Freshway Foods does not produce these products , '' Freshway said in a statement .
