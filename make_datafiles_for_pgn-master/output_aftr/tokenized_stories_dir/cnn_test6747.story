Indigenous people from El Alto , Bolivia , take part in an anti-U.S. demonstration in La Paz on Monday .

She read a nine-point statement on Chilean TV that calls for the support of human rights and democracy and the preservation of Bolivia 's territorial integrity . The statement condemns any attempts to overthrow the government .

Morales attended the emergency meeting of the union , which is modeled on the European Union and aims to politically and economically integrate South American countries .

The president is poised to approve the start of negotiations between his leftist government and opposition leaders of five provinces who demand greater autonomy and the cancellation of a constitutional referendum that would give the president more power . The opposition also is angry over tax money that Morales is diverting from the provinces to fund elderly programs .

Morales said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government .

Opposition leaders say they merely want their demands met .

Police kept order Monday during a march by about 2,000 pro-government groups opposed to the violence in the provinces . The demonstrators marched past the U.S. Embassy in La Paz .

Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia last week , blaming the American government for inciting the violence . The United States called the accusations `` false and baseless '' and said Bolivia was making a `` grave mistake . ''

The protests started 21 days ago in Pando , Beni , Santa Cruz , Tarija and Chuquisaca provinces . The opposition groups have blockaded major roads and threaten to disrupt the nation 's natural gas shipments , particularly to Brazil and Argentina .

Much of the violence has taken place in Pando -- Morales declared martial law there Friday .

On Monday , supporters of Morales , or his so-called militias , were gathering in Santa Cruz , and threatening to encircle the city , stoking fears that blood could be shed there . In Pando , it was reported that arbitrary arrests were taking place as the military took to the streets . Houses had been broken into and shot up , and civic leaders were fleeing to Brazil .

The opposition has offered to lift the blockades as a goodwill gesture , but the government demanded that the protesters also relinquish the buildings and other property they have seized .

Morales , Bolivia 's first indigenous president , was elected in December 2005 .
