In Oaxaca state , Mayor Nicolas Garcia Ambrosio and Council Member Angel Perez Garcia were assassinated Wednesday evening in the city of Santo Domingo de Morelos , the government-run Notimex news agency reported .

La Linea , the armed wing of the Juarez Cartel , claimed responsibility for killing prosecutor Sandra Ivonne Salas Garcia , said Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz .

Oaxaca is in southwestern Mexico and Chihuahua is in northern Mexico , on the border with Texas .

Front-running Tamaulipas state gubernatorial candidate Rodolfo Torre Cantu and a state legislator were gunned down Monday morning near Ciudad Victoria .

In Chihuahua , criminals shot and killed Guadalupe Mayor Jesus Manuel Lara Rodriguez on June 19 as his wife and child watched . He was a vocal opponent of the drug cartels .

Some observers say there 's little doubt the assassinations are linked to the run-up to elections Sunday for 12 state governorships and municipal and state posts .

`` Yes , at least some of this clearly is related to the elections , '' said Andrew Selee , director of the Woodrow Wilson Mexico Institute . `` If you shoot somebody , it 's because you do n't want that person to arrive -LSB- in office -RSB- . ''

Samuel Logan , an expert on Latin American gangs and founding editor of the Southern Pulse intelligence report , said criminals are choosing which candidates they can not tolerate .

`` You have to settle the scores one way or another , '' he said . `` If you do n't work for us , we 're going to kill you . ''

John Mill Ackerman , an author and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico 's Institute of Legal Research , said he sees two possible scenarios .

`` What the cartels need is government protection , '' Ackerman said . `` They are ready to knock off anybody who refuses to reach an agreement with them or who agrees with the other group . ''

Selee said he believes the fighting may have taken a toll on the cartels .

Analysts and politicians say each case must be viewed independently .

`` I do n't know if you can connect all the dots to each other , '' Selee said .

`` They are different criminal groups -LSB- who have committed the assassinations -RSB- , '' said Reyes , the Juarez mayor . `` We ca n't say that they have reached an agreement in doing this . ''

Reyes knows better than most the dangers of serving as a public official in Mexico . In March , authorities discovered a decapitated pig 's head wrapped in a blanket . In the macabre package , they found a death threat against Reyes .

The mayor said he is `` taking all necessary precautions '' and has offered protection to all the candidates in the city .

The Mexican federal government said in April that 22,700 people have died in the country since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006 .

Calderon 's offensive was a major departure from the way Mexico dealt with drug cartels .

`` There 's no more wink wink , nod nod . Sell your drugs but make sure there 's no blood on the streets , '' Logan said .

Nowhere in Mexico are the streets bloodier than in Ciudad Juarez , where there have been more than 4,300 slayings in less than four years . Juarez is the largest city in Chihuahua state , where the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels have been killing each other at a record pace .

Even the police in Chihuahua do n't feel safe . Juarez Police Chief Robert Orduna resigned in February 2009 after receiving death threats .

`` I do n't really care who claims responsibility for it , '' Logan said . `` The bottom line is that this guy was killed . ''
