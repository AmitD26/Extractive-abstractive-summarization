But with portions of Arizona 's controversial immigration enforcement law set to take effect Thursday , the business is in limbo .

To stay afloat even as their clients disappear or reduce inventory orders , the business has reduced employees ' hours and cut back operations in the industrial warehouse , home to several large freezers and forklifts and an office sparsely decorated with posters of illustrated fish and cuts of meat .

`` We ca n't really offer credit anymore because we do n't know if next week they 're going to close the business , '' Cisneros said . `` But it 's also a downside because some customers need that credit to operate . ''

Firm numbers illuminating the economic fallout of SB 1070 are hard to come by as the bill has yet to take effect . Also , summer tends to be slow for business and tourism in Arizona because it 's so hot .

The state 's unemployment rate in June rose for the third month in a row , to 9.7 percent . Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill in April .

Traditionally , community groups look to indicators such as the housing market , school enrollment and data from utility companies to track economic fluctuations within a certain group , said Edmundo Hidalgo , president and CEO of Chicanos Por La Causa , a community outreach program in Phoenix .

Based on feedback from clients and preliminary data , Hidalgo said his group estimates that rental vacancies in predominantly Latino neighborhoods will be 10 to 15 percent higher than the normal rate of 12 percent .

Reactions to the Arizona immigration law injunction

The Arizona housing market , which was already suffering from one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , has also taken an extra hit since the passage of the law , according to real estate agents who spoke with CNN .

Some homeowners who purchased property in the past year are looking to unload , according to Saul Pua , a real estate agent who sells residential properties in neighborhoods in Phoenix 's Latino communities .

Even during the recession , Pua said business was good because property was cheap , and that in better times , he closed an average of five transactions a month . Since the beginning of the year , however , he has been lucky to sell two properties in a month , and in July , he has n't closed a single deal .

`` I had investors buying properties , but now 's who gon na rent them ? '' he said .

Commercial real estate developer Michael Pollack was in the same situation leading up to Wednesday 's ruling . Since April , clients in predominantly Latino neighborhoods across the state had been pulling out of properties or calling to relay concerns over whether they should stay if the law goes into effect .

Today , Pollack said he received several calls from clients expressing relief and letting him know they intended to stay .

`` This gives the federal government to get to work implementing an immigration policy that the American people will support unanimously and deals with the situation at the border , which is where the real problem is . ''

Phoenix 's sprawling concrete landscape bears testimony to the abundance of vacant residential and commercial property .

`` For sale '' signs in English and Spanish adorn brown , sun-scorched lawns and dilapidated parking lots alike , from the heart of downtown Phoenix to as far as Chandler and Mesa -- the district of SB 1070 's sponsor , Republican Sen. Russell Pearce . Boarded-up big-box stores loom large in their vast emptiness , and rows of abandoned strip mall storefronts outnumber those that are occupied in some parts .

Not only businesses targeting the Latino community are suffering . Economic boycotts adopted by other states and cities have hit Arizona 's meeting and convention business .

Summer is typically the low season , she noted , and pointed out that tourism was up 8 percent statewide in June 2010 compared with June 2009 , which was one of the `` worst summers ever '' because of the recession .

`` What we 're hearing from meeting planners now is they wo n't and ca n't consider Arizona for 2011 , 2012 meetings not necessarily because of their own stance on SB 1070 or the boycott but just because they want to avoid the controversy and do n't want to risk losing attendance , '' she said .

As the four Tellez children stood with their parents in their office Wednesday , recounting tales of friends and relatives who have left town or seen families torn apart , daughter Nikki noted her surprise at seeing a shuttered Burger King .

`` I was driving down Camelback with my dad and Burger King was closed , and I was like , when have you seen that ? Like Burger King -- everybody goes to Burger King , and that was closed down . ''
