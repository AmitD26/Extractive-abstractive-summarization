Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Husam Zaki confirmed that Egypt has approved a request from the vessel to dock there . Israeli officials -- who said the military had been making plans to stop the ship from going to Gaza -- had been saying since Tuesday the ship would go to Egypt and not Gaza .

The foundation said that its `` purpose '' was about `` peace , not confrontation or provocation . ''

Israel has asked entities carrying Gaza-bound cargo to dock in the Israeli city of Ashdod , where material would be unloaded and then transported to the Gaza border . But the ship organizers said that the Israeli port `` was never an option . ''

However , the group said it secured concessions for letting more aid and help into Gaza and termed the effort a `` breakthrough . ''

The ship , which sailed from Greece on Saturday carrying 2,000 tons of aid , is the latest Gaza-bound aid ship attempting to breach an Israeli naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza .

The Israeli assault on the Turkish ship reverberated internationally and shined light on the Gaza blockade .

Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident , but an Israeli military investigation was conducted into the boarding of the Mavi Marmara and it criticized some aspects of the operation .

The operation prepared only one course of action and had no backup plan , military commanders were not presented with options other than boarding the ship , and different branches of military intelligence did not coordinate well enough , the report found .

But the report said the commando team that boarded the ship operated properly , with bravery and professionalism , and that the use of live fire was justified .

CNN 's Izzy Lemberg , Talal Abu-Rahma , Zain Verjee , Ben Wedeman and Paul Colsey contributed to this report .
