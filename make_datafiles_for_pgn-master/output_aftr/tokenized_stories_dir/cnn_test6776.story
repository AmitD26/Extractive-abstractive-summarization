British newspaper The Sun claimed it had proof that bookmakers knew details of scoring patterns in Pakistan 's innings before the match at The Oval in London began .

Butt later withdrew his comments after the England team threatened to take legal action against him .

A statement on the ICC 's official website read : `` The ACSU has verified all the available information and concluded that there was no compelling evidence to suspect individual players or support staff .

`` The investigation is now complete but if new and corroborating evidence comes to light then clearly the ACSU will re-open the matter . ''

ICC President Sharad Pawar said : `` We have stressed that we will not tolerate any form of corruption in cricket and that we will work tirelessly to root out those who have acted in a way which brings cricket into disrepute .

The ICC also confirmed their intention to pave the way for a world Test championship starting in 2013 . It would mean a playoff between the top four ranked Test teams every four years .

`` We have agreed in principle to exciting and far-reaching proposals to tackle this most important issue , '' said ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat .

`` The proposals , especially introducing more meaningful context , means we now have the potential to follow international cricket that is even more exciting . ''
