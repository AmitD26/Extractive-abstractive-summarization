-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Inter Milan 's new coach Leonardo has revealed how he consulted with former Nerazzurri boss Jose Mourinho before deciding to take on the job .

The Brazilian has spent much of his playing and coaching career at city rivals AC Milan but after his chat with Mourinho was convinced he was ready to take over from the sacked Rafael Benitez .

`` I called him because I do n't think you could come to Inter without going through him , '' Leonardo told the Italian club 's official website .

`` We exchanged ideas on lots of things and I now share his opinions on lots of things .

`` He knows everything about this place , because he 's still here in spirit -- he left everything here . I 'm very happy about what he told me . I rate Mourinho as a true world-beater , '' he added .

Mourinho left in late May for Real Madrid after leading Inter to the Champions League , Serie A , Italian Cup treble .

`` Inter are a ready-made team , there 's no need to start over . This side has won everything , but in its own way , '' the 41-year-old former World Cup winner said .

`` It has its own identity and the players know what to do , when to play and how to play . My job is to create the right conditions for them to be able to do that well . ''

`` I 've noticed that all the players here , and not only the players , are hugely motivated , '' he said .
