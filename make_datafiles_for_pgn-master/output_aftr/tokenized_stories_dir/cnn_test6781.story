HONG KONG , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China , local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry . A trend of fewer films being produced each year in Hong Kong at the time of the handover has continued into the 21st century .

At the same time , local film-makers have had to refocus their cameras for a new audience : mainland China .

The box office numbers are sobering . In the early 1990s , Hong Kong released around 200 local features a year . By 1997 , that number dropped to 85 films grossing $ 69 million , according to the Hong Kong , Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association -LRB- MPIA -RRB- .

By 2006 , those figures slumped to 51 films grossing $ 37 million . Ten years ago , the top 10 grossing films accounted for 47 percent of the total box-office return ; today , the portion is 58 percent .

`` 1997 , unfortunately , coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact , '' says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai . `` On the other hand , it also commenced the opening up of the mainland market .

The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films , says film archivist Cheng .

`` Today production is down , with many majors like Chinastar and Golden Harvest scaling back , '' he says . `` Most films are high-end productions with big stars , or low-end made with a shoestring budget for an easier return .

`` Audiences have become increasingly dismissive of local movies , often referring to them as poor quality , and there are much fewer paying cinemagoers these days .

`` So the hometown audience shows less support for local movies , whether by not seeing local films or opting for piracy , while the declining number of films means less opportunities for film-makers , fewer chances to try out new things , and damage to confidence . ''

Elizabeth Kerr , film critic and curator formerly based in Seoul , South Korea , agrees with Youngs ' assessment .

Still , Kerr sees reason for optimism . Films that best retain a Hong Kong style , Kerr maintains , likely carry `` Category III '' -LRB- under 18 not allowed -RRB- ratings : Movies that are `` grown up and smart , '' she says .

`` Even if the films do n't work , someone tried . ''

In the end , it may be culture that poses one of the greatest challenges for Hong Kong 's movie industry .

Chan 's own first feature in 2005 , `` A Side , B Side , Sea Side , '' includes a scene with a gaggle of girls on Hong Kong 's Cheung Chau island who are unable to communicate in Chinese with an Australian man speaking fluent Mandarin . The two parties end up conversing in English .

`` That 's me , '' says Chan , referring to the girls . `` I speak English better than Putonghua -LSB- China 's official common language , also known as Mandarin -RSB- . Many Chinese say that now that Hong Kong is part of China , Hong Kong people must learn Putonghua . I disagree . In Hong Kong we all speak Cantonese . Hong Kong already has a bad reputation for Putonghua , but I do n't feel ashamed . I 'm proud to have grown up during the transition between 1997 and SAR .

`` Why do we have so many problems with China ? Because our language , our culture , our values , our way of thinking are different . So we are not good at speaking Putonghua . Even in the cinema , we see Western movies , Japanese movies , Korean movies ... but not many Chinese movies . ''

Adds independent director Yan-yan Mak : `` We are monsters . China says : ` You are not Chinese . ' Gweilos -LSB- Hong Kong slang for Caucasians -RSB- say : ` You are Chinese . ' After 1997 , we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people . '' E-mail to a friend
