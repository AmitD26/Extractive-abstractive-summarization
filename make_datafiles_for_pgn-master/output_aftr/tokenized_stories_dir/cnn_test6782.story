New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two African runners won the 2010 New York City Marathon Sunday , marathon officials announced .

Having just won first prize in the 2010 Los Angeles marathon , Kiplagat was the first woman to finish the race coming first in 2 hours and 28 minutes .

Gebremarian , the fastest man in the race , crossed the finish line in 2 hours and 8 minutes .

Much of the celebrity limelight in the usually star-studded race was focused on a man whose fame derived from his sprints inside the gloomy pit of a Chilean mine .

Chilean miner Edison Pena -- one of 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months before they were rescued -- completed the New York Marathon Sunday , taking five hours and 40 minutes to cover the 26.2-mile course .

During a press conference after the race , Pena said running the marathon was a way to cope with the trauma of being trapped and fearing for his life .

`` The experience was wonderful , '' said Pena . `` I am not from this country but I kept seeing signs that said ` Go Edison ' ... and people would say ` Let 's go Pena ' ... the warmth of the north American people is amazing , '' said Pena .

`` When I ran , I thought I was going to beat destiny , '' he said . `` I told the mine , ` I 'm gon na outrun you . I 'm gon na run till you 're tired and bored of me . ' ''

Star-gazing part of the experience of watching some 45,000 runners in the marathon . Actress Katie Holmes , rapper entrepreneur P-Diddy , rocker Alanis Morissette , former Gov. Mike Huckabee and TV chef Bobby Flay have all competed in the marathon .
