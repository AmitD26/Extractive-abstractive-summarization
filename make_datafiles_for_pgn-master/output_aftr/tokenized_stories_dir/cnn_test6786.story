The magazine has ranked the top 20 top-paid footballers in the world -- a list that includes many of today 's top players and some ageing heroes who are still rolling in cash .

The 33-year-old Beckham , currently on loan with Italian club AC Milan as part of an extended deal from LA Galaxy , earned an estimated $ 46 million last year , according to Forbes . It calculates that the Briton has earned $ 95m in the past two years -- $ 66m of which has come from endorsement contracts .

Although his long-running deal with Pepsi ended in December last year , his currently resurgent career is likely to provide a boost for the coming few seasons .

Ronaldo 's earnings of $ 21 million came primarily from his Manchester United wages -LRB- $ 12m -RRB- , while endorsements from companies such as Nike and Coca-Cola made up the remaining $ 9m .

The Portugal player 's namesake -- Brazilian Ronaldo -- is still on the list at number 12 , having earned $ 15m despite being sidelined for much of the year with a serious knee injury and returning to his homeland to play club football .

Partner in the Sports Business group at Deloitte , Dan Jones , told CNN that only a `` tiny percentage '' of footballers earned more from product endorsements than they do from their player wages .

`` It 's only the very , very top . For the vast majority of footballers , the wages they earn from their clubs will be their greatest source of income . ''

Jones said Beckham 's continuing popularity beyond the world of football in both the U.S. and in Europe would likely ensure he remains around the top of the rich list for a few years to come .

`` He is now a grand icon that in some sense transcends what he does on the football field , '' Jones said .
