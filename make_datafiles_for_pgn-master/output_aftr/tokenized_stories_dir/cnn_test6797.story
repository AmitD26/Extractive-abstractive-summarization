The highly anticipated address at the State Department will touch on all the Middle East-North Africa flash points -- the Israeli-Palestinian peace process , Libya , Syria , Iran and the recent killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- with a focus on Obama 's plan for how the United States can help the region develop through political and economic reforms , according to administration officials .

The speech comes nearly two years after a 2009 address in Cairo , the Egyptian capital , by Obama that called for `` a new beginning '' between the United States and the Muslim world .

Now many in the Middle East and North Africa consider the Cairo speech a collection of lofty ideals that lacked sufficient follow-through , and they want Obama to signal substantive and concrete policies that support the aspirations of the region 's people .

Marwan Muasher , a former Jordanian foreign minister and longtime advocate of Arab reform , said the Middle East is a new environment now , where young men and women are laying their lives on the line for democracy throughout the region . They need to be told their cause is just and how the United States will support them .

Obama 's do-over on the Middle East

Gigi Ibrahim , a 24-year-old Egyptian activist and blogger , said that Obama 's words will have little impact in her country .

`` At this point , whatever President Obama will address will really be irrelevant to what the situation is now because we 're really building democracy from the bottom up , '' Ibrahim said , adding that `` America is not the model of democracy that we are striving for . ''

She called U.S. policy on the Middle East `` hypocritical '' because , she said , the United States `` will support a dictatorship if it 's aligned with its interests . ''

With Egypt facing economic crisis , the Libyan conflict at a stalemate , an ongoing harsh crackdown on demonstrators in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process at a standstill , there is little belief in the region that Obama or the United States can do much to help , Gergen said .

`` I think it 's going to be very difficult in the near term to generate excitement about his policies in the Middle East , '' Gergen said .

What 's next for the Arab Spring

Obama will emphasize U.S. principles such as freedom of assembly , the right to self-determination and respect for human rights while promoting economic development as a significant contributor to helping people of the region realize their aspirations , the officials said .

`` It 's important to note that some of the protests in the region are deeply rooted in a lack of individual opportunity and economic growth , as well as a suppression of political rights , '' one of the senior administration officials said . `` We also know from our study of the past that successful transitions to democracy depend in part on strong foundations for prosperity , and that reinforcing economic growth is an important way of reinforcing a democratic transition . ''

Specific programs include relieving Egypt of up to $ 1 billion in debt over the next two to three years so the money can be invested by the Egyptian government in economic development plans , and providing $ 1 billion in loan guarantees to finance infrastructure development and job creation , the senior administration officials said .

In addition , programs through international banking and funding organizations such as the World Bank , the African Development Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be worth a few billion dollars , the officials said .

The United States also will work with international groups and allies to help Middle East-North African countries modernize and integrate trade policies , according to the senior administration officials . Currently , nations in the region of 400 million people export about the same amount of goods as Switzerland , a country of 8 million people , if oil is removed from the equation , said a White House background document on the speech .

Obama 's speech comes in a week when the White House has focused on Middle East issues . He met Tuesday with Jordan 's King Abdullah II at the White House and will meet Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

After his talks with King Abdullah , Obama said it was `` more vital than ever that both Israelis and Palestinians find a way to get back to the table and begin negotiating a process whereby they can create ... two states that are living side by side in peace and security . ''

However , former Sen. George Mitchell unexpectedly submitted his resignation as the president 's Mideast envoy Friday , and deadly clashes broke out Sunday between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli forces .

Ongoing Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and Palestinian steps toward a unilateral declaration of statehood have driven the two sides further apart since Obama took office . They have also placed new obstacles in the path of the administration 's push for a mutually acceptable two-state solution .

The Obama administration has `` made it clear that Hamas must stop its outrageous use of terrorism and must recognize Israel 's right to exist , '' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday . `` Any participation in a Palestinian government would require that it abides by those standards in our view . ''

In other engagement in the region , Obama helped push Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from office in February and subsequently committed U.S. forces to a NATO air campaign in support of the rebel movement in Libya . The administration has repeatedly called for an end to strongman Moammar Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule .
