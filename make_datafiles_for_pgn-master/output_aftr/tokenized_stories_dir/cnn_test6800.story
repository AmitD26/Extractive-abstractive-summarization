New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Levi Aron was arraigned in a New York court Thursday on charges of murder and kidnapping in the first degree in the killing of an 8-year-old boy and remanded under suicide watch until a mental evaluation is completed .

Aron , 35 , showed no emotion as he entered the court handcuffed and did not enter a plea . He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused , said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly .

Defense attorneys Pierre Bazile and Gerard Marrone told the court that Aron hears voices and requested an exam to determine whether he understands the charges . Aron 's next court date is July 28 .

Police found human remains in Aron 's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy , who went missing Monday afternoon .

Kelly called the case `` heartbreaking . ''

`` Obviously in this business you see a lot of violence , but there 's usually some sort of irrational twisted logic that 's given to why a violent event took place , '' Kelly said .

`` Here , I mean it 's just , it defies all logic and I think that 's what 's really so , so terribly disturbing about this case . There 's absolutely no reason . There 's nothing more innocent than an 8-year-old child and to be , you know , killed in this manner it 's just ... heartbreaking . ''

Police said Aron , 35 , made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky . Both are members of the close-knit Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn .

Kelly said detectives found the remains in a freezer in Aron 's third-floor attic apartment and in a trash bin more than two miles away , wrapped in a black plastic garbage bag inside a suitcase .

Kletzky was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from his summer day camp , but became lost and asked the suspect for directions , Kelly said .

Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey , New York , and then brought him back , Kelly said . Police said Aron went to the wedding , but have not been able to confirm that Kletzky actually went with him , as no one has said they 've seen him .

`` We 're all in shock , '' said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind of the people in his district . `` What kind of people are out there that are capable of creating these dastardly acts ? ''

Aron 's ex-wife , Debbie Aron of Memphis , Tennessee , said she has been in `` total shock '' since she heard the news .

She said her children from an earlier marriage lived with her when she was married to Levi Aron and that he helped take care of them . He also enjoyed karaoke .
