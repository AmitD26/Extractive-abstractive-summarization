THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : It is the very last day of January , but the very first day of a new week of CNN Student News ! I 'm Carl Azuz . If you took a look at the news at all this weekend , you probably know what our top story today is .

First Up : Egypt in Crisis

AZUZ : Egypt . The world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north African nation . Protesters have been marching through the streets for days . They 're speaking out against the Egyptian government , and specifically against long-time President Hosni Mubarak . The protesters say they have two demands . One : They want President Mubarak to leave office and to be put on trial . Two : They want to change the country 's constitution . The government has been trying different ways to get these protests under control . It 's established a curfew ; it 's sent out fighter jets and thousands of security troops . As you can see , it does n't seem to be making any difference . The protests lasted through Sunday night and looked like they could keep going for a while .

Egypt Breakdown

AZUZ : All right , we 're gon na talk about some of the major players in all of this in today 's Breakdown . First off , Egypt 's leader , Hosni Mubarak . He 's been the country 's president since 1981 . Egypt 's president serves six-year terms with no term limits , which is why he 's been in power so long . The country is a republic , with the president chosen by popular vote . But here 's the kicker : Until 2005 , Mubarak was the only candidate on the ballot ! In 2005 , Mubarak beat out a couple other candidates when he got almost 90 percent of the vote . Another election is scheduled for later this year .

The country Mubarak leads has 80 million people ; it is the largest population in the Arab world . And that 's put a strain on the government because many of the people feel it 's unable to meet their demands . 20 percent of Egypt 's population lives below the poverty line .

And one more point , here : the Muslim Brotherhood . This is a group that 's been very vocal in encouraging people to protest . And it 's technically illegal ! Egypt 's constitution does not allow religion-based political parties . But the Muslim Brotherhood has been somewhat tolerated by President Mubarak . I say `` somewhat '' because members are allowed to run in local elections , but they 're not allowed to have seats in the country 's government .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-

LOTHIAN : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in too , voicing concerns over the violence directed at protestors by police and security forces .

PROTESTERS : Hey Hey ! Ho Ho ! Mubarak has to go !

LOTHIAN : Even so , outside the White House , pressure from protesters looking for change . Egypt has been a key U.S. ally for years , working to bring Israelis and Palestinians together , being a stable partner in the region , and supporting the international effort to reign in Iran 's nuclear ambitions .

LOTHIAN : Officials here at the White House are also discussing the assistance that the U.S. gives to Egypt , including more than a billion dollars each year . They 'll be reviewing over the next few days how the government deals with unrest on the ground and how that might impact that aid . Dan Lothian , CNN , the White House .

Shoutout

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Barnes ' and Mrs. Rumbarger 's STEM classes at Petal High School in Petal , Mississippi ! What U.S. government program provides money to retired workers ? Is it : A -RRB- HUD , B -RRB- Social Security , C -RRB- CDC or D -RRB- Peace Corps ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! The Social Security program gives money to Americans who are retired , disabled or in need . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

But there 's a lot of debate around Social Security and concerns that this fund might run out some day , and maybe in the not-too-distant future . People are living longer than they used to , so they 're getting more money from Social Security . And by the time people who are currently putting money into the system are old enough to take money out , there might not be anything left for them .

AZUZ : And something else that might disappear ? This : cursive writing . It 's pretty , but is it useful ? There are 41 states that use English standards that do n't require students to learn cursive . Georgia , in fact , is getting ready to debate this issue soon . And some people are worried that the writing may be on the wall for cursive . The argument against learning cursive is that it takes up time and is n't as useful as learning how to type . But some parents and teachers say script should stay . They feel that learning proper handwriting helps students learn better in general . And that without it , you wo n't be able to understand some historic documents that are written in cursive . The Constitution is one example that comes to my mind .

Blog Promo

AZUZ : Now personally , I write in cursive when I 'm taking notes , because that 's what I learned in school . But I also know how to type , too , and I learned that as well . What we 're asking on today 's blog is : Do you think it 's important to preserve the old-school cursive , or should schools focus on skills you 'll need later in life , like typing ? You know where to go to talk to us : CNNStudentNews.com !

AZUZ : And finally , we 're right on time for today 's Before We Go segment . It may look like a normal cuckoo clock , until you realize that the cuckoo coming out 's a person ! This thing actually is the world 's largest cuckoo clock . At least , that 's what the creators were aiming for . They unveiled this 66-foot tall , 28-foot wide clock this weekend . Every hour , the bells brought out an actor who gave a performance .
