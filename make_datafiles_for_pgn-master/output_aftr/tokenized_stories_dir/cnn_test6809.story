-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Photographers are honoring one of their own with an online benefit sale Monday aimed at helping the children of South African photojournalist Anton Hammerl , who was reportedly killed in Libya in early April .

The sale marks the 5-month anniversary of the death of Hammerl , who was last seen by fellow journalists on April 5 , 2011 , after being shot in the stomach by forces loyal to Moammar Gadhafi .

The online benefit precedes a memorial service for Hammerl on Thursday in London , said Bronwyn Friedlander , a family spokesman . Hammerl 's remains have not been located , he said .

Hammerl , who holds South African and Austrian citizenship , was initially believed to have been detained along with Brabo and journalists Clare Morgana Gillis , a freelancer for the Christian Science Monitor , the Atlantic and USA Today ; and James Foley of GlobalPost .

Gillis and Foley said in the interviews they were traveling with Hammerl , following then-rebel forces toward the frontlines near al-Brega , when they were attacked by Gadhafi 's forces .

Since February , the Committee to Protect Journalists has tallied dozens of attacks on journalists in Libya , including five deaths .

Among those also killed were Oscar nominee Tim Hetherington and acclaimed photojournalist Chris Hondros , who were struck by a rocket-propelled grenade while chronicling the violence in the besieged port city of Misrata .

`` The only way to capture the truth is to get close to it , and sometimes journalists like Anton Hammerl end up paying the ultimate price , '' said Maria Salazar-Ferro , CPJ 's Impunity Campaign and Journalist Assistance Program coordinator .

The photos donated for the online benefit are a diverse mix that include a haunting black and white image of children fleeing fighting , a picture of an American soldier dragging a wounded comrade in Afghanistan and a candid photo of Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan with their interpreters at a summit in 1985 .

The money from the sale will be used for the education of Hammerl 's three children , Friedlander said .
