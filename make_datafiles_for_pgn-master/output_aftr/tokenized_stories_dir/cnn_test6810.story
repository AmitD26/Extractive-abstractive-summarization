`` Less than a week after signing yet another agreement , the Sudanese regime appears to be ignoring its commitment , holding to form , and positioning military assets for intensified offensive operations , '' said John Prendergast , co-founder of the Enough Project , which aims to end genocide and war crimes .

Southerners voted for independence in a January referendum , and with the scheduled July 9 date of separation looming , many fear an escalation of bloodshed could bring both sides back to the brink of full scale war .

Violence erupted two months ago along the contested border area of Abyei and subsequently in South Kordofan , a state that lies north of the border but where many people , especially in the Nuba Mountains , are allied with the south .

Thousands of people were displaced from their homes , and many fear that after strict borders go into place with independence , they will not be able to return home .

`` South Sudan will be born into crisis , '' said Susan Purdin , who oversees International Rescue Committee aid programs in South Sudan .

`` Widening violence is triggering more displacement , threatening the lives of vulnerable civilians and hampering access to communities in need while an existing humanitarian emergency grows worse , '' she said .

Critical issues -- including oil and the final status of Abyei -- remain unresolved just days ahead of independence .

`` The United States also calls on the parties to end the fighting in Southern Kordofan , and to facilitate unfettered access for aid workers to deliver humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians affected by the conflict , '' Nuland said .

Discussions are under way on how to shape the new post-independence U.N. mission in South Sudan , created in 2005 with a peacekeeping mandate .

And the United Nations Security Council will meet next week to discuss whether to recommend a new member state 's entry into the global body .

Peter Wittig , the U.N. ambassador of Germany , which holds the rotating Security Council presidency this month , said Council members will meet July 13 , four days after South Sudan 's independence ceremony , to talk about U.N. admission . If granted , South Sudan would become the first state since Montenegro in 2006 to become a U.N. member .
