Honolulu , Hawaii -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In her own right , Ann Dunham , the mother of U.S. President Barack Obama , lived an accomplished , international life that began in white-bread Kansas , weaved through Asia-light Hawaii and wound up in Indonesia .

Now an exhibition celebrating her life in the world 's most populous Muslim nation is opening in Hawaii featuring her personal art and artifact collection .

Across the east-west palette , Dunham 's family and friends paint her as an ardent anthropologist , early maven of microfinance and a cultured , curious explorer .

Her daughter , Maya Soetoro-Ng , proudly wrote of her mother 's anthropological work in Surviving Against the Odds : Village Industry in Indonesia , a book based on Dunham 's original dissertation from the early 1990s .

In a testament to her topical thirst , Dunham pitched Dewey a very broad research plan .

`` When she submitted her research proposal to me she wanted to focus on not just one -- but five -- areas of Indonesian trade : batik , bamboo , ceramics , shadow puppetry and blacksmithing . ''

Dewey forced her to choose one . Dunham settled on blacksmithing , the craft of firing and bending hot iron into such things as knives and cooking utensils .

`` But she got us back with a 1,000-page dissertation . The norm was about 300 to 500 . ''

`` We had this common , strong interest . Ann saw blacksmithing from an economic aspect -- in how people made a non-agrarian living . And she built up this body of knowledge that was really remarkable . ''

Solyom recounted the story of when the two were working in Bali in the early 1990s . After checking in to one hotel , Dunham `` was gone for ages '' while Solyom waited in the lobby .

`` She was just calm about things -- and forever curious , '' remembered Solyom .

That insatiable curiosity also led to copious note-taking -- some of which is just being found .

`` I do think about her delight . In one photo , her eyes are shut and she 's just really letting go with some of her staff and colleagues . That was overlooked at times and in the years since she passed away I 've been burdened with the sadness of missing her -- and she died so young . And even though she did n't succeed in marriage and longevity there are many ways her life is a model of success that we can aspire to . ''

In 1995 , just before her 53rd birthday , Ann Dunham died after a short battle with ovarian cancer . In traditional Hawaiian fashion , her ashes were scattered into the waters of the islands . A pre-presidential Obama and his sister Maya Soetoro-Ng performed the honors .

Through Her Eyes : S. Ann Dunham 's Fieldwork in Indonesia runs through January 8 , 2012 at the East-West Center Gallery , University of Hawaii Manoa . It includes photographs taken during Ann Dunham 's years of field research in Indonesia as well as personal artifacts which include examples of metal smithing , jewelry and basketry made in the villages of Indonesia . Dunham 's personal art and artifact collection has been augmented by recent purchases to give wider context to her work in Indonesia .
