In your mind , is Tara dead ?

Well I mean half my head is missing . I 'm just gon na keep saying that . You know , it 's `` True Blood . '' I feel like anything is possible . If anything , it is the golden hour though . If she is able to be saved , it 's like she 's got 20 seconds . It 's not a lot of time . I 'm curious to see what they 're going to do with all of it . I hope I 'm back . But again half my head is missing -LSB- laughs -RSB- .

Maybe Tara will just wear a lot of hats ?

Yeah I mean yeah she can wear a lot of hats . Put some gauze on it . But people are going crazy ! -LSB- Laughs -RSB-
