San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Executing a successful remake of a video game can be like shooting blindfolded , and that 's especially true when you 're dealing with the fervent following behind Microsoft 's `` Halo '' series .

Longtime fans look for any reason to balk at attempts to repackage their beloved games , and for `` Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary , '' people who follow its development closely have reasons to be skeptical . It 's the first game wholly developed without intervention from Bungie , the company that created `` Halo '' but which has since severed ties with Microsoft .

`` Halo Anniversary '' is available only for the Xbox 360 starting Tuesday , the 10th anniversary of the original `` Halo , '' which launched alongside Microsoft 's first home gaming console .

Producers often look at remakes as a way to add their signature to a well-regarded work , but the team shepherding `` Halo '' went to extraordinary lengths to preserve the feel of its decade-old model .

With several bestselling books and more products in the works , this is a fragile process .

Designing a familiar but unique ` Halo 4 '

The team within 343 Industries that 's working on `` Halo 4 , '' the major new game scheduled to be released late next year , has been given more creative freedom than the external group that 's programming `` Halo Anniversary . ''

`` There are times when we 're thinking about all of the different interconnected storylines , '' Holmes said . `` That 's really important to us , because we believe in the universe and want to keep the universe consistent . ''

They declined to talk much about `` Halo 4 , '' but they said it will strike a delicate balance between keeping up with innovations in other first-person-shooter games and keeping the mechanics familiar to fans of the series .

The game will have a familiar control scheme , using two analog sticks for movement , rather than doing a drastic departure with , say , Kinect camera navigation , 343 Industries executives said . It may incorporate limited Kinect functions for throwing grenades or toggling settings using voice commands , like those in `` Halo Anniversary , '' they said .

Staying true to ` Halo ' in ` Anniversary ' edition

That same criteria are not what 's driving `` Halo Anniversary . '' The primary concern for developers was that it feel almost identical to the original `` Halo . ''

The game just felt smoother and speedier , he said .

`` They just wanted to put their own stamp on it , '' O'Connor said . `` But we said , ` This is n't about putting your stamp or our stamp . ' ''

New features for ` Halo Anniversary '

While the characters and scenes from the first `` Halo '' have been re-created with an attention to detail that takes advantage of the Xbox 360 's processor , `` Halo Anniversary '' players can switch to the vintage look at any time , except during video sequences . This results in a brief pause , but it can be a welcome distraction throughout the game .

Perhaps more controversial , the developers made some significant alterations to a particular character and added video terminals throughout the game . Both were done for the purpose of broadening the plot and for relating it to games and books that have come out since the first game , O'Connor said .

The floating blue-and-metallic orb named 343 Guilty Spark , which Microsoft 's 343 Industries took its name from , has received a sort of makeover . The wisecracking robot , which guides players through certain levels but was known to stray , has been made more visible and talkative . His lines have been updated to hint at story elements from books and future games , O'Connor said . Likewise , the terminals placed throughout the levels , another element not found in the original , let players watch short clips that hint at events in `` Halo 4 '' and other `` Halo '' media , O'Connor said .

The online multiplayer component in `` Halo Anniversary '' has more in common with `` Halo : Reach '' than it does with the original . It uses the same `` Reach '' game engine that was designed by Bungie . Certain Affinity , an Austin , Texas , game developer , rebuilt versions of a few maps and weapons from the first `` Halo '' to be played with friends . `` Halo : Reach '' owners will be able to access the modes for free .

The true test : Fan appraisals

Remember when George Lucas remastered `` Star Wars '' in the late 1990s ? `` Han shot first , '' a reference to a particular scene from the original movie that was changed , remains the bane of many geeks .

As `` Star Wars '' fans nervously await the three-dimensional remakes that are in the works , `` Halo Anniversary '' players with television sets that support the feature will get to play in 3-D glory .
