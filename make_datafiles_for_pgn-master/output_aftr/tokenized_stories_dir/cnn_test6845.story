London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Woody Allen famously said in `` Annie Hall '' that the only cultural advantage to Los Angeles was that you can turn right on a red light , but in truth the `` City of Angels '' is bursting with culture .

SEE : Commercial galleries have sprung up all over the city in the last decade , boasting impressive exhibitions of local and international contemporary art . Artists such as Ed Ruscha , John Baldessari , Chris Burden and the late Dennis Hopper have put the city firmly on the map but it was established as an important hub in the 1960s , when the Ferus Gallery famously showed Andy Warhol 's Campbell 's Soup Cans .

Today , galleries are concentrated on La Cienega , Wilshire and Washington Boulevards and spaces to visit include Blum and Poe , credited with bringing the work of Japanese artist Takashi Murakami to the US , and David Kordansky . Also on any art-lover 's itinerary is Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills -- in January the gallery is showing work by UK artist Damien Hirst .

Meanwhile , take a tour of the city 's major museums ; head to the Museum of Contemporary Art and enjoy its current exhibition of work by photographer and fashion designer Hedi Slimane .

VISIT : If you are feeling foot-sore from your travels around the city 's art institutions , rent a car and drive to the Watts Towers , a weird and wonderful labor of love built by Italian immigrant Simon Rodia between the 1920s the 1950s .

These strange spiral towers , made of scrap , steel and cement and decorated with bits of bottle and seashells , have been an inspiration to artists ever since they were built . The site is now managed by the Watts Towers Art Center , which also stages an annual jazz festival .

TOUR : No trip to LA would be complete without a tour of Hollywood 's key hot-spots : Grauman 's Chinese Theater , the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Beverly Hills . Alternatively , take a spin around famous movie locations such as Mulholland Drive , Sunset Boulevard and Chinatown on your own tour .

Los Angeles also has a rich literary history , and the city features as a sometimes glittering , often shady , backdrop to classic noir fictions by Raymond Chandler and John Fante . Even F. Scott Fitzgerald penned his own eulogy to the city in the unfinished `` The Last Tycoon , '' which he wrote while working as a script-writer there in the 1930s .

STAY : A perennial favorite among celebrities and visitors to the city is the Chateau Marmont , which featured as the real set for Sofia Coppola 's recent film `` Somewhere . '' Modeled on a castle in France 's Loire Valley , the Chateau Marmont has for years been a hideaway for celebrities behaving badly and a haven for Europhiles , and its popularity continues to grow . Even if you 're not staying , you can sip a languid cocktail in the beautifully-designed Bar Marmont .
