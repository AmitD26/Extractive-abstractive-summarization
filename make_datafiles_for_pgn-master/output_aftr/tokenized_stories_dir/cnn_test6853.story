LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Heather Mills presented `` less than candid '' testimony about her life with former Beatle Paul McCartney during her divorce case and made more money during their marriage than before , according to a ruling released Tuesday .

Mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a `` less than impressive witness '' on her own behalf , Judge Hugh Bennett wrote in awarding her £ 24.3 million -LRB- $ 48.6 million -RRB- -- far less than the £ 125 million she had sought from McCartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage .

`` Having given in her favor every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under and in conducting her own case , I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence , both written and oral , was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid , '' Bennett wrote .

Mills emerged from the court Monday angry about the judge 's treatment of her . She said the judge and attorneys acted like they were part of a `` club . '' Blog : Did Mills pour water on McCartney 's lawyer ?

`` She as a mother has strived to protect her child and felt there were certain issues and matters in the judgment which affected that , '' Rosen said .

But he discounted many of the arguments the former model made about her personal wealth before and after her 2002 marriage to McCartney . He ruled that Mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed , and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision , he wrote that Mills ' ideas about their marriage were `` make-belief . ''

`` He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation , if not anger , '' the judge wrote in a glimpse of the emotions aired behind closed doors . Read the full ruling -LRB- . pdf file -- Adobe Acrobat required -RRB-

Bennett found Mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage , which she said amounted to more than £ 2 million . In one instance , the judge pointed out McCartney 's company loaned Mills money to buy a home in Hove , England -- money that she would not have needed had she had such an amount in the bank .

And Bennett found that Mills ' income actually improved during the marriage . In one year , she earned £ 1 million -LRB- $ 2 million -RRB- from a single modeling contract , he wrote . And he quoted Mills ' 2002 book , `` A Single Step , '' in which she wrote that her charity work and public speaking roles had expanded `` to such an extent that it has left little time for anything else . ''

`` She is a kindly person and is devoted to her charitable causes , '' the judge wrote . `` She has conducted her own case before me with a steely , yet courteous , determination . ''

`` The wife for her part must have felt rather swept off her feet by a man as famous as the husband , '' he wrote . `` I think this may well have warped her perception leading her to indulge in make-belief . The objective facts simply do not support her case . ''

Mills and McCartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in February , leaving the judge to decide the terms .

Bennett 's 58-page decision concluded that £ 24.3 million was enough for Mills to live comfortably and take care of their daughter 's needs . McCartney had proposed a £ 15.8 million settlement .
