WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There is an increasing threat of homegrown terror stemming from segments of a deeply isolated and alienated Somali-American community , a U.S. Senate committee hearing concluded Wednesday .

`` Over the last two years , individuals from the Somali community in the United States , including American citizens , have left for Somalia to support and in some cases fight on behalf of al-Shabaab , '' noted the committee 's chairman , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , I-Connecticut .

Al-Shabaab -- also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement -- was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008 .

The hearing highlighted the case of Shirwa Ahmed , a 27-year-old Somali-American who had been radicalized by al-Shabaab in his adopted home state of Minnesota before traveling to Somalia and blowing up himself and 29 others in October .

`` Despite significant efforts to facilitate their settlement into American communities , many Somali immigrants face isolation , '' Liepman said .

`` The -LRB- tough -RRB- adjustment to American society has reinforced their greater insularity compared to other more integrated recent immigrant communities and has aggravated the challenges of assimilation for their children , '' he said .

Somalis began arriving in the United States in significant numbers following the U.S. intervention in Somalia 's humanitarian crisis in 1992 , Liepman said . The Somali-American population is now concentrated in clusters primarily in Minneapolis , Minnesota ; Columbus , Ohio ; Seattle , Washington ; and San Diego , California .

The potential recruitment of young Somali-American men has been made possible by `` a number of factors that come together when a dynamic , influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men , '' Liepman said .

Many refugees , he said , `` lack structure and definition in their lives '' and are `` torn between their parents ' traditional tribal and clan identities and the new cultures and traditions offered by American society . ''

The potential terrorist indoctrination and recruitment was a consequence of these clusters , Liepman said , and is the product of `` the refugee experience of fleeing a war-torn country combined with isolation , perceived discrimination , marginalization and frustrated expectations .

`` Local criminal familial and clan dynamics make some members of this community more susceptible to -LRB- this -RRB- sort of extremist influence '' of groups such as al-Shabaab , he said .

Liepman said there is a serious concern about individuals being indoctrinated by al Qaeda and al-Shabaab while in Somalia and then returning to the United States `` with the intention to conduct attacks . ''
