-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly two centuries ago Wednesday , Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry signed an obscure redistricting law that helped his party stay in office and , more importantly , codified one of the most enduring legacies in U.S. politics : gerrymandering .

Elected governor in 1810 , Gerry signed the redistricting bill two years later , enabling greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature .

The controversial move has become a favorite across the country among incumbent parties , which pack opposition voters into districts already lost in an effort to minimize the opposition 's influence over the state 's broader electorate .

`` In the end , democracy comes out the big loser , '' former federal prosecutor Edward Lazarus wrote in a 2004 column for CNN .

`` The effect of such partisan gerrymandering is to block new entrants into high political office and to make the result of almost every congressional election a foregone conclusion . This , in turn , effectively disenfranchises all those voters who do n't support the preordained winner , '' he wrote .

The court ruled that the redistricting plan , promoted by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts .

The court ordered that District 23 be redrawn .

States are constitutionally required to redraw congressional districts every 10 years in line with population shifts documented by the U.S. Census Bureau , a part of the Department of Commerce .

The White House promised to work directly with bureau 's director to assuage those concerns , but that response drew further criticism from House Republicans concerned about greater executive influence in the Census Bureau .

In a letter to the president , House Republicans Patrick McHenry and Darrell Issa described the White House as `` circumventing the secretary of commerce '' and called it `` both outrageous and unprecedented , '' suggesting the Obama administration could affect U.S. census results and congressional districting due out in 2010 .

The move , they say , could insulate Democratic congressional power .

The White House said it recognizes the importance of an accurate census count `` free from politicization '' and added it `` has not proposed removing the census from the Department of Commerce . ''

`` From the first days of the transition , the census has been a priority for the president , and a process he wanted to re-evaluate , '' it said in an earlier statement .

Democrats commonly prefer a statistical sampling method meant to fill in `` population gaps '' they say occur because some members of minority groups and homeless populations are missed by the door-to-door approach .

A 1999 Supreme Court ruling said statistical sampling could not be applied to the redistribution of congressional seats , but it did not put gerrymandering of the political landscape entirely off limits .

CNN 's Bill Mears and Keating Holland contributed to this report .
