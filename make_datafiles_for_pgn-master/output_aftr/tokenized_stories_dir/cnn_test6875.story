Editor 's note : Campbell Brown anchors CNN 's `` Campbell Brown : No Bias , No Bull '' at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays . She delivered this commentary during the `` Cutting through the Bull '' segment of Monday night 's broadcast .

CNN 's Campbell Brown says nonemergency legislation needs time to be read by the public and Congress .

`` As president , Obama will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days . ''

Well , the president broke that promise barely a week after taking office when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Bill dealing with equal pay for men and women .

That 's less than a minute and a half per page , with no time for bathroom breaks . No wonder so many of our lawmakers did n't seem to notice that last-minute exemption clearing the way for bailed-out companies like AIG to pay out big bonuses .

So , the House tried to clean up the mess last week by rushing through another bill -- a tax on AIG bonuses . That bill was just 11 hours old before it went on the floor to be argued and then quickly approved .

And the list goes on well before the president took office .

The bank bailout got all of 29 hours , the rescue of Fannie and Freddie was only available for 19 hours . This is how bills could literally become , to borrow a phrase , too big to fail -- and too fast to stop .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown .
