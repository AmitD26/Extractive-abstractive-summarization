Their action has prompted similar `` wildcat '' strikes , unsanctioned by national unions , at other sites across the country .

`` If you ca n't be happy with that , you ca n't be happy with anything , '' a local union official said at a demonstration televised by Britain 's Sky News . The union leader did not identify himself .

`` Union officials will present details of the agreement to the workforce at 7:30 a.m. -LRB- 2:30 a.m. ET Thursday -RRB- and recommend a return to work , '' Total said in a release .

Union leaders have been meeting over three days with Total , Jacobs , the main site contractor , and IREM , the Italian firm hired to carry out the project , in talks moderated by ACAS . They had already rejected one proposal , a union official told CNN .

Union leaders accuse Total of discriminating against British workers by subcontracting with IREM , which has hired workers from Italy and Portugal . Total rejects the allegation .

Overall , the construction project has employed , directly or indirectly , 600 to 1,000 workers for about 18 months , Total said .

`` It has never been , and never will be , the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers . We have been a major local employer for 40 years and the majority of our 500 permanent staff are local , '' the company said in a statement released Monday .

It said IREM had won the sub-contract through a fair and legal bidding process .

Hundreds of workers at British power plants and refineries have been walking off the job in unofficial `` wildcat '' strikes since the Lindsey workers put down their tools last Wednesday .

Spontaneous strikes took place Tuesday in every corner of the country : at the Stanlow oil refinery in western England , Drax power station in the northeast , Petroplus Coryton Refinery in the southeast and Longannet power station in Scotland .

A total of nearly 1,000 workers were off the job at the three English locations . Scottish Power did not specify how many workers were on strike .

But resolving the Lindsey strike may not be the end of the matter . Union leaders say the strike there is only a reflection of problems with the way Britain implements European Union employment directives .

`` The government is failing to grasp the fundamental issues . The problem is not workers from other European countries working in the UK , nor is it about foreign contractors winning contracts in the UK . The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from even applying for work on these contracts , '' Unite General Secretary Derek Simpson said Tuesday .

`` No European worker should be barred from applying for a British job and absolutely no British worker should be barred from applying for a British job . ''

Brown also rejected accusations by Conservative leader David Cameron that his use of the slogan `` British jobs for British workers '' in a 2007 speech had pandered to `` protectionist fears . ''

`` Can anybody here say that they do n't want British workers to get jobs in our country ? '' Brown retorted in the House of Commons .
