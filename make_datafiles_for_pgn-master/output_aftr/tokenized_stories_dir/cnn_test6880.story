Bangladeshi firefighters continued to uncover bodies Friday of Bangladesh Rifles officers from a mass grave .

More than 160 army officers were inside the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles -LRB- BDR -RRB- when the mutiny broke out on Wednesday morning , local reports said .

So far , 88 bodies have been recovered from mass graves in the outskirts of Dhaka , the newspaper reported .

The mutiny began Wednesday when BDR members took dozens of their superiors hostage .

It was the second day of BDR Week , when army officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations .

The rebellion was spurred by years of discontent among the ranks of the BDR troops .

Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors contribute the most troops to U.N. operations and the pay is far greater than the meager salary the jawans -- as the BDR troops are called -- make .
