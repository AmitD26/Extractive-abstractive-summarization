HO CHI MINH CITY , Vietnam -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To feel the vibrancy of Ho Chi Minh City , all you have to do is step out onto a bustling city street .

Step to it : Walking through the city 's streets is the best way to see it .

You should n't have to do too much motorbike dodging down Lei Loi and after just a 15 minute stroll from City Hall is the famed Cho Ben Thanh Market . However give yourself more time to stop into galleries or buy a classic piece of communist propaganda along the way .

It 's also worth a return trip later on in the evening when the market closes and street side restaurants spring up , offering great meals at cheap prices .

If you 're looking to get away from the strip of Western hotels in the city center , hail a cab and head over to Cholon , or Ho Chi Minh City 's Chinatown . In the late 18th century , this enclave was actually a separate city from old Saigon but the two were united in the early 1930 's .

Today Cholon is home to the Binh Tay Market , which the locals call `` Cho Lon . '' Just do n't confuse it with Ben Thanh , or you 'll be right back where you started . The area is filled with plenty of local color and is a photographer 's dream .

Despite mass consumption of bottled water and the finest sunscreen , you 'll need to find a way to beat the heat in Ho Chi Minh City . One of the best ways is to make regular stops at any restaurant or caf√© for a refreshing lime soda . A bowl of the traditional Pho -LRB- pronounced `` fuh '' -RRB- is also a must .

If you 're keen to try to play foreign correspondent -- or at least see where they gathered during the days of the Vietnam War - look no further than the Rex Hotel on Nguyen Hue Boulevard . The drinks are wildly overpriced and the crowd seems to be on the `` 5 Asian Cities in 7 Days '' tour , but its large rooftop does offer a great bird 's eye view of the lively streets below .

The nearby Temple Club on Ton That Thiep Street offers a quieter setting for a cocktail . Diners also give great reviews for the food . Afterwards , stroll over to Vasco 's on Hai Ba Trung Street . The French colonial style building features bands playing away upstairs with large lounges on the veranda , while downstairs you can settle in for a more mellow night .

If your 24 hours in Ho Chi Minh City happens to turn into 36 or 48 , arrange a day trip to the Cu Chi Tunnels , about 70 kilometers Northwest of the city . The Viet Cong built this maze of passageways , which served as supply lines , during the Vietnam War . The narrow tunnels snake underground for a staggering 200 kilometers . Not only can you take a stroll , or crawl , through a few parts of it , you 'll also be served a unique dose of communist propaganda .
