TALLAHASSEE , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Florida Gov. Charlie Crist announced Tuesday he would not run for re-election next year and instead will seek the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Mel Martinez .

`` Our country is facing the most profound public policy questions in our lifetime -- questions relating to the economy , taxes , healthcare , the environment and national security , '' Crist said in a statement released by his campaign . `` The answers to these questions will have a lasting impact on the country we love and the nation we will leave to our children and grandchildren . ''

A Quinnipiac Poll released last month showed Crist with a commanding 54 percent to 8 percent lead over Rubio in the Republican primary . But the poll also found that more people overall , and Republicans specifically , would rather see Crist run for re-election as governor than seek the Senate seat .

Should Crist backers persuade Rubio to abandon his bid , it would help national Republicans focus money and resources on other races in 2010 . The GOP needs to win back seats they lost in 2008 to help weaken the Democratic hold on the Senate .

Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter 's decision to change his political affiliation from Republican to Democrat and the increasing likelihood that Democrat Al Franken will eventually be named the next senator from Minnesota means that President Obama will have enough Democratic votes -- in theory -- for a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate .

Last week , the Senate GOP was dealt a setback when former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge , a popular Republican , decided not to challenge Specter . But news that Crist would enter a Senate race was welcomed by Texas Sen. John Cornyn , who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee .

`` While I believe Marco Rubio has a very bright future within the Republican Party , Charlie Crist is the best candidate in 2010 to ensure that we maintain the checks and balances that Floridians deserve in the United States Senate , '' Cornyn said in a statement . `` Governor Crist is a dedicated public servant and a dynamic leader , and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will provide our full support to ensure that he is elected the next United States Senator from Florida . ''

GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan , who had been considering a Senate bid , instead said he would run for another term in the House and endorsed Crist .

Anticipating his entry into the Senate race , the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last month aired its first television ad of the 2010 elections -- a small buy in the Tallahassee TV market -- that accused Crist of running away from the state 's economic problems .

Florida Democrats echoed that line of criticism Tuesday shortly after Crist declared his candidacy .

While it had been speculated for weeks that Crist would run for the Senate , the governor told reporters Tuesday that he made his final decision this past weekend to run for Martinez 's seat .

Rep. Kendrick Meek , North Miami Mayor Kevin Burns and state Sen. Dan Gelber are all seeking the Democratic Senate nomination .
