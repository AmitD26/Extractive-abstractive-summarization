The 28-year-old Brazilian is currently in intensive care at the AEK military hospital in Budapest after suffering a fractured skull in a freak accident in qualifying for Saturday 's Hungarian Grand Prix .

Massa 's condition has improved in the past 24 hours with doctors taking him out of a medically-induced coma on Monday night .

`` He 's spending more and more time awake , talking to family and friends . I would like to point out that , although he is recovering , this is not the end of the story , he is still in a life-threatening condition . Of course , the danger is decreasing by the day . ''

Doctors have said Massa will be out for at least six weeks , although there are still fears he may never return as a result of his injuries .

He will certainly miss the European and Belgian Grands Prix at the end of August , although the current four-week break before the next race in Valencia gives the Italian team time to assess their options .

`` We have said before that it is possible that Michael Schumacher could return to help us out , '' said Colajanni . `` However , we have two test drivers at Ferrari -LRB- Luca Badoer and Marc Gene -RRB- at the moment and Michael is an advisor .

Does safety need to be improved in Formula One ?

`` We have not spoken to him and we will have to wait and see what happens . It is something for -LRB- Ferrari team principal -RRB- Stefano Domenicali to consider over the coming weeks .

`` We need to see how Felipe is and the situation will evolve from there . We are not in any hurry , the first and foremost thing is Felipe 's recovery . ''

Massa was hurt when a spring that had fallen from the back of Rubens Barrichello 's Brawn GP car struck him on the helmet at high-speed , causing him to lose control of his car and crash into a tire barrier .

On Monday , Professor Robert Veres , the surgeon who operated on Massa over the weekend , told reporters that Massa had suffered some damage to his left eye , which could threaten his future in the sport .

`` It 's too early to say about his future as we do n't know the extent of the damage . Without an operation it 's very hard to evaluate the eye 's function , '' said Vares .

Massa 's crash came less than a week after Formula Two driver Henry Surtees , the son of former world champion John Surtees , was killed in similar circumstances , knocked unconscious by a tire which flew off another car in a race at Brands Hatch in England , before crashing .

Formula One 's safety record has improved dramatically in recent years , with the last fatality in 1994 when the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna crashed at Imola .
