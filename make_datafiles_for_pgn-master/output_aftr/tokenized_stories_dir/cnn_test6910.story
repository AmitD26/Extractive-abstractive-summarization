LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the economy gets tough , the tough come out fighting . For some businesses , that means bringing out a fighter brand -- a cut-price version of a flagship product , marketed under a new name , and intended to fight back against budget competitors .

When it 's done right it can destroy cut-price competition , but done badly it can drive a business to the brink of bankruptcy .

Mark Ritson , associate professor at Melbourne Business School , has written an article for the October issue of Harvard Business Review discussing the benefits and pitfalls of launching a fighter brand .

He says that over the next six months a number of new fighter brands are likely to appear in response to the recession .

Ritson gives the example of Intel , which launched its budget `` Celeron '' chip in the late 1990s to in response to AMD 's low-priced chips , which were threatening Intel 's premium `` Pentium '' brand . Read more business features With `` Celeron , '' Intel came up with a budget alternative to `` Pentium '' for the lower end of the market and cemented its position as market leader .

But Intel 's success is the exception rather than the rule . `` The majority of fighter brands not only have n't worked , but have gone on to do significant damage to the companies that launched them , '' said Ritson .

General Motors ' -LRB- GM -RRB- `` Saturn , '' United Airlines ' `` Ted , '' and Kodak 's `` Funtime '' film range are all high-profile fighter brands that failed . Despite the appeal of taking on the competition in a fist fight , launching a successful fighter brand is easier said than done .

`` The problem is that fighter brands are almost always a knee-jerk reaction to a problem and are not always well thought out , '' Neil Saunders , consulting director with Verdict Research , told CNN .

Ritson says one element in building a fighter brand is to avoid creating a low-price product that is so attractive that it steals customers who would otherwise be buying that company 's premium-brand product .

He gives the example of GM 's `` Saturn , '' a car designed to take on fuel-efficient , affordable Japanese cars . `` Saturn '' sold plenty of cars , at least at first , but its high operating costs meant it lost millions of dollars , playing a huge part in bankrupting GM .

So given the huge risks involved , should companies even consider launching a fighter brand ?

Ritson cautions , `` The minute you add a new brand to your portfolio it 's hundreds of thousands of hours of management time , and millions of dollars in development , advertising and distraction .

`` Ask the question , ` do I need a fighter brand or is this a real seismic change in the market , which means I need to change my existing strategy with existing brands ? ' Otherwise you will lose five years and $ 50 million . ''
