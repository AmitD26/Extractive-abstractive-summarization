Ed Manzke , an attorney who represents the student , Marshawn Pitts , 15 , told CNN Wednesday the officer beat Pitts for not adhering to the school 's dress code .

The incident occurred in May at the Academy for Learning , a Dolton high school for special-needs students . Pitts was admitted to the school in May after moving from Iowa , Manzke said . He suffered brain injuries as a child when he was hit by a car .

A video , released to Pitts ' parents by the school several weeks after the incident , showed Pitts talking to the officer and a faculty member grabbing Pitts ' arm . Pitts pulls away and walks down the hall , with the officer and faculty member close behind . But the officer then slams him against the lockers and pins him on the floor -- breaking his nose , according to Manzke .

The officer was taken to a hospital and treated for an eye scratch , Manzke said . But , he said , the officer was never charged with anything and an explanation for the incident was never provided .

In a written statement , Guy Lindsay , internal information officer for Dolton police , said the department was made aware of the incident and the tape on May 20 . After review of the tape , the officer was removed from the school and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation , Lindsay said .

While on administrative leave , the police officer returned to the department and voluntarily resigned , Lindsay said . The investigation continues , he said .

But , the school said , `` Unfortunately , the physical restraint of a student sometimes becomes necessary . In such instances , AFL and its staff are committed to employing techniques that are safe , effective and which conform to best practice standards .

Pitts ' parents are considering litigation against the city of Dolton , the school and Dolton police , Manzke said . He added he is in talks with Dolton police to settle the case . If those talks are not fruitful , Manzke said , a lawsuit could be filed within a few weeks .
