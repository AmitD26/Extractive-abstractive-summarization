-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities in Colorado say criminal charges are expected to be filed against Richard Heene , a storm-chasing father whose giant Mylar balloon ascended into the sky earlier this week , sparking fears that his 6-year-old was aboard .

Earlier Saturday , in an impromptu press conference outside his home , Heene told reporters the runaway balloon incident was `` absolutely no hoax . ''

It ended when Falcon climbed down from the attic above the garage at the family 's Fort Collins , Colorado , home .

However , a misdemeanor `` hardly seems serious enough given the circumstances , '' the sheriff said .

He said further details would be disclosed Sunday morning , and that neither Richard nor Mayumi Heene , who came in voluntarily Saturday , was under arrest .

The couple emerged Saturday evening from the sheriff 's office after several hours of interviews with investigators .

`` I was talking to the sheriff 's department just now to further things along , '' Richard Heene told reporters outside the building . `` We 're doing well . ''

Earlier Saturday , Heene emerged from his house and offered a cardboard box for the media to submit questions . Watch Heene reveal question box ''

`` I got people e-mailing me , calling me ; they 've got a lot of questions , and I do n't know how to quite frankly answer any of them other than I 've got a box , '' Heene said around 10 a.m. .

He said he 'd answer the questions later Saturday night .

`` I 'm going to place the box up front . Please write your questions down , '' he said . `` I have no idea what the news are saying . I do n't have cable . ''

Speculation began to mount over whether the incident was staged after the family appeared on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' on Thursday night .

`` You guys said we did this for the show , '' the boy said .

Alderden said Friday that -- based on reports that the parents `` took these children into potentially dangerous situations '' with tornado chases , the experimental balloons and other activities -- it would be `` appropriate to involve child protection -LSB- services -RSB- to at least see what the family situation is and whether the children are in a safe condition . ''

Earlier , the sheriff told reporters his department contacted child protection officials but asked them not to contact the family until investigators had a chance to re-interview them .
