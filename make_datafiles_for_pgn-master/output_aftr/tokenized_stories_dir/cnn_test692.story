WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Questions surrounding Judge Sonia Sotomayor 's past speeches generated more controversy in the final day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Thursday , as Democrats again called her a mainstream jurist and Republicans portrayed her as a liberal activist likely to legislate from the bench .

Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor greets Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , Thursday .

In a potential sign of Sotomayor 's strong political momentum , however , Senate Republicans indicated they do not intend to filibuster her nomination on the Senate floor . They also indicated their belief that the full Senate would vote on her nomination before breaking for its August recess .

Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said he plans to put a confirmation vote for Sotomayor on the committee 's calendar for next Tuesday .

`` I think you 're a walking , talking example of the best part of the United States of America , '' Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , told Sotomayor . `` It is my belief that you are going to be a great Supreme Court justice . ''

South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham was less complimentary , telling Sotomayor that she has `` said some things that have bugged the hell out of me , '' but he quickly conceded that her judicial record has `` been generally in the mainstream . ''

`` Your speeches are disturbing , particularly to conservatives , '' Graham said . `` Those speeches to me suggested gender and racial affiliations in a way that a lot of us wonder , will you take that line of thinking to the Supreme Court in these cases of first precedent . ''

Graham defended the importance of probing Sotomayor 's political beliefs by highlighting the high court 's 1955 landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education , which mandated the desegregation of schools . The ruling was `` instructive in the sense that the court pushed the country to do something politicians were not brave enough to do , '' he said . Watch Graham talk about Sotomayor 's record ''

The personal views of Supreme Court justices matter , he argued , because `` you 're not going to find a law book that tells you '' how to rule on contentious social issues such as same-sex marriage or whether there is a `` fundamental '' right to bear arms .

`` Would you want a judge or nominee who came in here and said , ` I agree with you , this is unconstitutional , ' before I had a case before me ? '' Sotomayor said , adding : `` I do n't think that 's a justice I can be . ''

Sotomayor refused to say , however , whether she believed the right is `` fundamental , '' which in legal terms refers to whether a federal statute applies to the states .

The highly charged issue of affirmative action surfaced most prominently later in the day , when Frank Ricci testified before the committee .

Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after the city threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions .

The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals -- including Sotomayor -- backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano . The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court .

Ricci also criticized the 2nd Circuit for disposing `` of our case in an unsigned , unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph . ''

The Supreme Court applied a new standard , she claimed , based on a different area of law . If she were ruling on that case today , she said , she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court .

Ricci was one of a long list of witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor .

Linda Chavez , head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity , which opposes affirmative action , argued that `` it is clear '' from Sotomayor 's record `` that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics . '' It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge , Chavez claimed , when she has `` shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her . ''

Committee Republicans , unswayed by such assertions , once again examined Sotomayor 's controversial statement that a `` wise Latina '' could reach a better decision than a white man .

Sotomayor was also asked to explain her remarks from a 2001 speech in which she said she agreed that `` there is no objective stance but only a series of perspectives -- no neutrality , no escape from choice in judging . ''

She told the committee that , in every case , the two opposing parties view the facts from vastly different perspectives . `` You ca n't just throw up your hands and say I 'm not going to rule , '' she said . There is a choice in judging , which means `` you have to rule . ''
