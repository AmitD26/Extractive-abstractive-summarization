WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In 1994 , universal health care was a key policy plan for then-President Bill Clinton . It eventually failed .

Now , 15 years later , another Democratic president is taking on the challenge , but facing an uphill battle from not only from Republicans , but from members of his own party .

Will failing to reform health care have the same consequences for Obama 's administration as it did for Clinton 's ?

A senior White House official adds that while there is a `` long way to go '' in coming up with legislation , there is a true effort being made to devise a bipartisan plan . See how the plans compare ''

Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Oklahoma , says in order for health care reform to get passed , it will take a well-coordinated bipartisan effort .

`` I think the president is right . He really does want a bipartisan effort . And that 's what it 's going to take for it to be for the American people . But the approach to it is kind of like a doctor practicing bad medicine where you fix only symptoms and do n't treat the disease . ... the disease is only going to get worse . ''

But the battle over health care reform is weighed down by complex problems , competing interests , a $ 1 trillion price tag , conservative Democrats in sticker shock and Republicans sensing an opportunity to regain some of the power they lost in the 2006 congressional elections .

Conservative Bill Kristol wrote in his blog that there is an opportunity to inflict political damage to the president and that opponents should n't compromise :

`` My advice , for what it 's worth : Resist the temptation , '' Kristol wrote . `` This is no time to pull punches . Go for the kill . ''

The White House has so far resisted another idea for raising revenue -- creating a tax on the medical benefits provided by employers . Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus said he likes the idea , but Obama said it could be too disruptive to a system in which 180 million Americans have health coverage provided by their employers .

But while Obama has remained mostly popular in national polls so far , support for his health care plan has begun to wane .

A CNN Poll of Polls released Wednesday indicates that less than half the country approves of how he 's handling the issue .

Forty-seven percent in the poll approve of how the president is dealing with health care reform , with 44 percent disapproving .

The poll averaged the three most recent national surveys that asked about Obama 's performance on health care : USA Today/Gallup -LRB- July 17-19 -RRB- ; ABC/Washington Post -LRB- July 15-18 -RRB- and CBS News -LRB- July 9-12 -RRB- .

`` And they -LSB- Americans -RSB- do n't have a lot of confidence in the past effort in the stimulus plan to put together something comprehensive and -- ` here we go again ' ... something that looks like it 's being thrown together to many people in the public . So they 're not confident that they want it .

And Coburn 's argument -- along with nearly all congressional Republicans ' -- could pose a risk to Obama 's political capital with Americans .

Gergen agrees .

`` I think he 's got two other problems : One is that he does n't have a firm plan to sell . ... Second thing is , from his point of view , there are many in the public that 'd like to hear from him and also like to see just how he 's negotiating the plan , '' he said . `` What they look for is a leadership that says , ` Here 's where we 're going to go , ' not a leadership that says , ` I 'm urging Congress to make more progress ' ''

`` Because he 's made it such an issue , and because he has invested so much personal time and effort , this will , more than stimulus and more than anything he has done so far , be a measure of his clout and of his success early on , '' Daschle was quoted in the New York Times . `` And because it is early on , it will define his subsequent years .
