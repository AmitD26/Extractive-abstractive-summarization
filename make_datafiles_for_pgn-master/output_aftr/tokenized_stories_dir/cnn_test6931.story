-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hurricane Ida moved into the southern Gulf of Mexico Sunday , prompting a declaration of emergency in Louisiana and concern along the U.S. Gulf Coast .

In anticipation of the storm 's arrival , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon .

Alabama 's Baldwin County commission urged that residents living in mobile homes , coastal communities or low-lying , flood-prone areas voluntarily evacuate . The county is under a local state of emergency and opened a shelter , according to a Sunday night statement from the county commission .

As of 10 p.m. ET Sunday , Ida had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph -LRB- 165 km/hr -RRB- with higher gusts . But the storm was expected to weaken on Monday and possibly begin losing tropical characteristics on Tuesday , the hurricane center said .

The center of Ida was located about 400 miles -LRB- 645 km -RRB- south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River , forecasters said . It was moving north-northwest at nearly 14 mph -LRB- 22 km/hr -RRB- and was expected to increase in speed . The storm was expected to be near coastal areas of the northern Gulf by Monday night or early Tuesday , the hurricane center said .

But Ida is forecast to remain a hurricane as it moves in the northern Gulf toward the U.S. coast , the center said .

Florida 's Division of Emergency Management asked residents to have disaster plans in place .

`` Whether Ida maintains a storm or loses tropical characteristics , the Florida Gulf Coast region has the potential to see several inches of rain , strong winds , isolated tornadoes and dangerous surf and coastal flooding beginning Monday evening and continuing into Wednesday , '' the office said in a statement .

Ida could drop between 1 and 3 inches of rain on portions of western Cuba , with isolated amounts of 8 inches possible in some spots , forecasters said . The central and eastern areas of the Gulf Coast northward to eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachian Mountains could see 3 to 5 inches of rain with some areas getting as much as 8 inches , the center said .

Ida is the Atlantic region 's ninth named storm . The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30 .

CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras and journalist Merlin Delcid in El Salvador contributed to this report .
