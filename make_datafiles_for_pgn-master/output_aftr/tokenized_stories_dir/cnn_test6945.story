Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Flights transporting critically injured Haitians into the United States will resume within a few hours , the White House announced Sunday afternoon .

`` Having received assurances that additional capacity exists both here and among our international partners , we determined that we can resume these critical flights , '' he said in a statement Sunday .

The statement , released Sunday afternoon , said flights would resume `` in the next 12 hours . ''

The evacuated patients are those whose medical needs could not be met by doctors working in Haiti . Nearly 23,000 people have been seen by U.S. personnel since the January 12 earthquake , Vietor said .

Airlifts stopped after there were `` concerns about the strain on domestic health capacity , '' Vietor said . But officials have increased the ability to care for patients through a network of nonprofits and U.S. hospitals , he said .

But earlier reports also cited questions over who would pay for patients ' care .
