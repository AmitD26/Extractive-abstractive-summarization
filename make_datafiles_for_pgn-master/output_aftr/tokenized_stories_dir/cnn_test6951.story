The country 's 800-year-old Jewish community -- an estimated 40,000 strong at its peak -- is now a party of one .

But Simintov , for his part , is n't going anywhere soon . For more than a decade , he has refused to join his wife and two teenage daughters in Israel .

`` My family call me all the time and say , ` Come here , you 're the last Jew in Afghanistan , what are you doing there ? ' '' he says .

Simintov , a former carpet dealer , refuses to answer that question . `` I do n't know why I 'm still living here , '' he says . `` It 's God 's will . ''

He has n't seen his daughters -- now ages 14 and 16 -- since his one trip to Israel 12 years ago .

Afghanistan 's Jewish population reached 40,000 in the mid-19th century , the group says , and began declining around 1870 with the passage of anti-Jewish measures .

Simintov 's synagogue -- the last in Afghanistan 's capital -- sits inconspicuously in a courtyard behind busy city streets , though a close inspection reveals Stars of David in second-story metal railings . The interior is adorned only by broken light fixtures and ceiling fans .

That was n't the case under Taliban rule , which ended with the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 , though Taliban forces have been resurgent in parts of the country .

Simintov says he was arrested four times under Taliban rule and that he was beaten while in custody .
