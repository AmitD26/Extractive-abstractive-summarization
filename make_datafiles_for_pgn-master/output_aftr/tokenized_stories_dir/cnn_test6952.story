`` Hi , I 'm Jaycee . I want to thank you for your support , and I 'm doing well , '' Dugard says in the video released exclusively to ABC News , which posted excerpts of the video on its Web site Friday .

The full statement and video , which show Dugard baking cookies with her mother and playing with her dogs , were scheduled to air on ABC News ' `` 20/20 '' at 9 p.m. Friday .

It 's the first public statement from Dugard since the arrests of her suspected captors -- Phillip Garrido , 58 , and his wife , Nancy , 54 .

The Garridos are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard , who was 11 when she was snatched from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe , California .

She was 29 when found in August at the Garridos ' home in Antioch , California , about 120 miles from her home . Garrido , a registered sex offender on parole at the time of his arrest , is accused of fathering two daughters with Dugard during her captivity .

`` We released this video so that you can see that we are happy and well -- when we have more to share , we will , '' Probyn says in the home video . `` As a mother I am pleading for our privacy in this very public story . ''
