First Up : Gulf Coast Oil Spill

DAN ROWE , PANAMA CITY BEACH VISITORS BUREAU : This airport is a great opportunity for us to showcase the region . And you know , we will get through the oil spill . There 's no oil on Panama City beach or any of the beaches in northwest Florida now , but we do need to continue to get the word out that this is a great place to come to visit and the airport is a means to get there .

AZUZ : Last week , we told you about something called a `` top kill . '' This animation shows how it would work . Engineers would pump this special mud into the leaking well . They hope that would stop the flow of oil . Then , they can seal the whole thing with cement . Officials had hoped to try that yesterday . Did n't happen . They 're now looking at giving it a shot tomorrow or Wednesday . Recently , some CNN iReporters sent in their ideas about how to deal with this spill . CNN asked Bill Nye the Science Guy to take a look at their suggestions . He 's is , as we said , the science expert . He actually used to deal with oil spills . Check out his reaction to the iReports .

NYE : As soon as somebody says drill through here , you 're really in trouble . The stuff is unbelievably hard and it 's broken . It 's brittle . I mean , when you start to drill through it , it will just crack and you 'll have this crack propagate up and down the pipe . And the leak will actually get even more difficult to deal with .

UNIDENTIFIED MALE , CNN IREPORTER : As you can see , this is simulating an oil spill in the water . And you just sprinkle some sand on it . As you can see , immediately the sand is absorbing the oil and bringing the oil down to the bottom , which makes the top very clear .

UNIDENTIFIED MALE , CNN IREPORTER : It does n't take the sand for it to absorb .

Intelligence Director Resigns

Clinton in China

AZUZ : Some other big names in the Obama administration are over in China . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading a group of more than 200 officials to Beijing for talks with the Chinese government . They 're going to be going over a lot of topics , the biggest one is trade . It 's something that Secretary Clinton talked about yesterday when she met with Chinese business leaders in Shanghai . That city is hosting the World Expo . It 's kind of like the Olympics for economics , science and technology . Secretary Clinton is urging China to allow American companies more freedom to compete with Chinese companies in China . She says that when there 's a level playing field , both countries win .

Spoken Word

AZUZ : Another milestone to tell you about now . Jordan Romero , the guy you see over my shoulder , is on top of the world ! He made it the top of Mount Everest on Saturday -- you do n't get any higher than that -- and he 's just 13 years old ! That is the kicker . Jordan has already climbed six of the so-called `` Seven Summits , '' the tallest mountains on every continent . During his climb up Everest , he stopped to talk about the experience .

Before We Go

AZUZ : Including how to wear incredibly heavy coats . Now before we go , a lot of world championships are decided out on the field . This one is played out in a barn . Still , the competition is fierce at the World Pinball Championships . Every contestant has a different approach . Some are smooth and steady . Some like this guy turned the whole thing into a dance recital . The guy 's been playing this for 35 years , so who are we to question the pinball wizard . When it comes to the player with the best technique ...

AZUZ : ... we could n't really pin it down . Time for us to stop flapper-ing our gums and tilt on out of here . If you do n't get those pinball references , your teachers might . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz . We 'll see ya tomorrow .
