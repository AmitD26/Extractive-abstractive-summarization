LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The number of stray and abandoned dogs in the United Kingdom jumped by 11 percent in the past year -- the biggest surge in a decade -- possibly because of the financial crisis , a British dog charity said Wednesday .

Dogs Trust said local authorities picked up 107,228 stray and abandoned dogs from British streets in the past year .

`` The latest stray dog survey is very disappointing , '' said Clarissa Baldwin , chief executive of Dogs Trust . `` Even more tragically is the number of dogs that are being put down , which has gone up from 7,000 to just below 10,000 , a very worrying trend .

The 11 percent rise is the highest yearly increase since recordkeeping began in 1997 , Dogs Trust said .

Cash-strapped councils might lack resources to pick up or temporarily shelter dogs .

Local authorities handle an average of 12 dogs each hour , Dogs Trust said . Only five are reunited with their owners -- a number that could increase if more dogs were microchipped , Dogs Trust said .

A microchip is an electronic device , coated in plastic , that is the size of a grain of rice . It is implanted just under a dog 's skin , beneath its shoulder blades , which causes no harm to the animal and can not be felt , veterinarians and campaigners say .
