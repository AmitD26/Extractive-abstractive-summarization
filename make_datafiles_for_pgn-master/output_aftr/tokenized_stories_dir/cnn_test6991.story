President Seretse Khama Ian Khama has discussed the visit with Ouattara , the ministry said in a statement , and the two leaders `` agreed that the visit should take place at a mutually convenient time . ''

While an independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner , the country 's Constitutional Council invalidated the results in some provinces and proclaimed that Gbagbo , the incumbent president , had won . Gbagbo is refusing to step down

`` Botswana continues to support all efforts aimed at ensuring that Ouattara assumes the presidency in Cote d'Ivore , '' the ministry statement said , using the French name for the country .

Immediately after the election in Ivory Coast , Botswana joined the African Union , the United Nations , the European Union and the United States in endorsing Ouattara as the winner of the disputed presidential elections .

At the time , Khama 's government called upon all political entities , including the Constitutional Council of Ivory Coast , to respect the decision of the Independent Electoral Commission in declaring Ouattara the rightful winner of the elections .

`` The government of Botswana is deeply concerned about African leaders who reject elections results that are not in their favour .

However , the government of Botswana softened its stance after Mugabe and his rival , Morgan Tsvangirai , formed a national unity government to ease Zimbabwe 's economic and political predicament .
