Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` I 'm going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the -LRB- Supreme -RRB- Court . ''

This monumental , unexpected bombshell from President Lyndon Johnson -- spoken in private in the summer of 1965 -- set in motion a history-making drama , revealed for the first time in newly public audio tapes .

In secret recordings and transcripts made exclusive to CNN , Johnson laid out a politically crafty plan that was years in the making to groom Marshall as the first African-American on the high court . It was part of a broader White House strategy to implement the president 's civil rights agenda , something he openly hoped would cement his legacy and strengthen the Democrats ' base .

Marshall was unaware of all this when Johnson first called him on July 7 , 1965 . Marshall , then a federal appeals court judge in New York , had been summoned from lunch . The president , a master persuader , wastes little time making his point :

`` I have a rather big problem that I wanted to talk to you about , '' he says . `` I want you to give it some real thought because it 's something that I have thought about for weeks , and I think that we ca n't think of how it affects us personally . We 've got to think about the world , and our country . ''

Johnson then makes the pitch : `` I want you to be my solicitor general . ''

`` Wow , '' is all Marshall can say , clearly in disbelief .

`` I want the top lawyer in the United States representing me before the Supreme Court to be a negro . And be a damn good lawyer that 's done it before . So you have those peculiar qualifications . '' He adds , `` I want to do this job that -LSB- Abraham -RSB- Lincoln started , and I want to do it the right way . ''

Leaving the security of a lifetime job on the bench for an uncertain political post -- where he could be fired at any time -- at first concerns Marshall , who asks for a day or two to think about the offer . But minutes later , he is sold . `` The answer 's ` yes . ' ''

Then the president offers a tantalizing hint of bigger things to come .

That `` something , '' as later conversations that Johnson has with top aides reveals , is a Supreme Court appointment . It would come two years later in 1967 . The solicitor general spot would be a mere prelude to a bigger stage .

The tapes are being released by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia , which is analyzing and transcribing secret White House tapes from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Richard Nixon years .

Building on an already strong legacy

`` I 'm going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the -LRB- Supreme -RRB- Court , '' LBJ says flatly . `` Not to succeed him -LRB- current Justice Arthur Goldberg -RRB- , but after he 's solicitor -LRB- general -RRB- for a year . After he 's solicitor -LRB- general -RRB- for a year or two , the first vacancy I have . I have n't told anybody that , and I do n't want you to , but I brought him here . ''

`` At the end of a year or two , '' in his new job , Johnson predicts , `` no one can say that he 's not one of the best-qualified men that has ever -LSB- been -RSB- appointed . And then I 'm going to appoint him '' to the high court .

Going to Marshall for advice

But it is clear from this conversation that LBJ is using Marshall 's grooming for the Supreme Court as the model he will use to boost other outstanding African American candidates to senior government positions .

By October 1966 , some in the Johnson circle had begun quietly offering trial balloons in the press over whether Marshall might be a suitable justice . One U.S. News & World Report writer suggested he would not .

`` Did you see the column today by David Lawrence ? '' Johnson asks Nicholas Katzenbach , his former attorney general . `` He 's got a mean -- saying that Thurgood 's not the best-qualified man . That 's the net of it . ''

`` I want to build him up where he 's impenetrable when he becomes a Supreme Court justice , '' says the president . But he adds the future nominee knows nothing of this . `` I 've never told him I 'm going to appoint him , and do n't know that I am . But he 's damn sure going to be qualified . ''

Opportunity knocks for Johnson

When Justice Tom Clark announced his retirement , the president was ready to make his move .

On June 13 , 1967 , just moments before he separately calls Marshall to be his nominee , Johnson tells Attorney General Ramsey Clark -- whose father Marshall was about to replace -- of his plans . He dismisses whispers from some in Washington that Marshall is not ready to sit on the nation 's highest court .

The day after the historic 69-11 Senate vote , Marshall 's wife , Cecilia , known as Cissy to her friends , calls the president personally to thank him .

Marshall served on the Supreme Court until 1991 . He died in early 1993 .
