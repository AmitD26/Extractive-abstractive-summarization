Atlanta , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Secret Service is looking into a controversial column by an Atlanta Jewish newspaper publisher that mulled the assassination of an American president .

One of them called for a `` hit on a president in order to preserve Israel 's existence . ''

`` Give the go-ahead for U.S. based Mossad agents to take out a president deemed unfriendly to Israel in order for the current vice president to take his place and forcefully dictate that the United States ' policy includes its helping the Jewish state obliterate its enemies . ''

U.S. Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie told CNN Saturday , `` We are aware of it . We are taking the appropriate investigative steps . ''

The column , titled `` What would you do ? '' does n't mention President Barack Obama 's name , but U.S. Jewish groups that strongly denounced the column read the words as a reference to Obama himself . The column also refers to the administration 's `` never ending ` Alice in Wonderland ' belief that diplomacy is the answer , '' an apparent dig at the Obama White House 's foreign policy efforts at dialogue with such countries as Iran .

`` The suggestion by anyone , in this case a Jewish newspaper publisher , that Israel should consider assassinating President Obama is shocking beyond belief , '' said Dov Wilker , director of the American Jewish Committee in Atlanta .

Abraham H. Foxman , the national director of the Anti-Defamation League , said Adler 's `` lack of judgment as a publisher , editor and columnist raises serious questions as to whether he 's fit to run a newspaper . ''

`` There is absolutely no excuse , no justification , no rationalization for this kind of rhetoric . It does n't even belong in fiction . These are irresponsible and extremist words . It is outrageous and beyond the pale . An apology can not possibly repair the damage .

`` Irresponsible rhetoric metastasizes into more dangerous rhetoric . The ideas expressed in Mr. Adler 's column reflect some of the extremist rhetoric that unfortunately exists -- even in some segments of our community -- that maliciously labels President Obama as an ` enemy of the Jewish people , ' '' Foxman said .

Simon Wiesenthal Center associate dean Rabbi Abraham Cooper called the remarks `` irresponsible and reprehensible '' and said they `` must be publicly condemned by Jewish leaders across the ideological and political spectrum . ''
