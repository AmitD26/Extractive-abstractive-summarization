Israeli police removed three illegal shacks Monday in the Jewish outpost of Havat Gilad . Police and civil administration representatives were stoned by the settlers on the scene . Eight people were arrested in the incident , Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said .

Monday night , Israeli settlers blocked roads in Jerusalem , demonstrating against the outpost 's removal . The demonstrators burned tires and clashed with police . Twenty-three demonstrators were arrested , Rosenfeld said . Three other settlers were arrested in the West Bank , he said .

There were also several incidents of torching cars in villages around Hebron on Monday night . On Tuesday , people tried to burn down a house in the village Hiwara , south of Nablus .

The incidents are under investigation , Rosenfeld said .

The Palestinian owner of the burned house , Rami Edmaidi , told CNN that a group of Israeli settlers broke the window with an iron club , threw a Molotov cocktail into the bedroom and fled . Due to the thick smoke , his brother and sister-in-law had to be taken to the hospital for breathing problems , he said .

Douglass told CNN the situation has worsened since February 18 , when the United States vetoed a U.N. resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank . `` This Thursday the -LRB- Israeli -RRB- right wing are calling for the day of rage . There is n't any international party able to stop them either . ''

American-sponsored talks between Israelis and Palestinians fell apart in September when Israel resumed settlement construction in the occupied West Bank after a 10-month freeze .
