As the co-hosts prepare to square off against rivals India in the Cricket World Cup final on Saturday , the batsman said the terror attack unleashed on his team in Pakistan two years ago is never far from their minds .

Though the events of 2009 will never be forgotten , the 33-year-old says the team have moved on as they eye their second World Cup triumph .

Jayawardene told CNN : `` Once you go through an episode like Lahore , I think you always do think about it .

`` I mean I wish that is something no one has to go through but I think the Sri Lankan team has moved on after that and playing cricket has helped us to do that as well . ''

The final is to be held in Mumbai which has also been blighted by terror . A co-coordinated shooting and bomb attack in 2008 killed 164 and injured over 300 . But Jayawardene says Sri Lanka will be focused firmly on cricket on Saturday .

He said : `` Security is always important and there are experts to handle that so we let them do their job and we accommodate that and we try to focus on the game and what we can control -- that 's the only thing we can do . ''

Jayawardene says India and Sri Lanka were destined to meet each other . `` I do n't think anyone scripted it better than this , it 's absolutely fantastic , '' he said .

Jayawardene and his teammates will have to brave a fierce atmosphere inside the stadium but he says Sri Lanka want to repay their own fans for `` brilliant '' support throughout the tournament .

`` We wanted them to enjoy the moment as well because these kinds of moments do n't come our way very often but at the same time , especially playing in India , there will be a lot of distractions , a lot of people want to know how you 're doing and at the same time , there 's a lot of things happening in India .
