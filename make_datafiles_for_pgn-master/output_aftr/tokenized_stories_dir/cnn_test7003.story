-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Iowa community was shut down much of Sunday afternoon while emergency crews remained hard at work , sifting through wreckage caused by a wave of powerful tornadoes that swept across the state overnight .

It was all part of a violent storm system that struck overnight , originating in eastern Nebraska and following a warm front across northern Iowa , according to National Weather Service meteorologist Frank Boksa .

Mapleton was among the hardest-hit areas . Initially , concerns about a gas leak had prompted all nonresidents to be barred from the community , which is about 45 miles southeast of Sioux City . By 5 p.m. , people were being allowed back in , though authorities remained on the scene , according to the sheriff 's department .

The high winds tossed cars and tractors , tore off roofs , caused a car wash to collapse , uprooted trees and downed power lines . Yet Pratt said there had been only minor injuries , giving credit to advance warning as well as an emergency response effort that included authorities both local and from elsewhere .

`` There was major devastation to the southwest portion of town , but no fatalities , '' the sheriff said .

Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Monona County , according to a statement from his office . The proclamation allows officials to use state funds to help . He later issued a similar proclamation for Pocahontas County , which also suffered severe damage .

`` The whole town is without power . Main Street is a disaster , '' he told CNN . `` They 've shut down the town . As we speak , I 'm looking down one of the residential streets . There 's debris all over , trees are down .

The National Weather Service in Des Moines , Iowa , reported tornado sightings by storm chasers and trained spotters in as many as 11 towns and cities in northern and west-central Iowa over a four-hour period Saturday night .

At least three of the twisters , including the Mapleton tornado , caused significant damage , according to Boksa .

In Early , a town of 1,600 residents , a tornado ripped roofs off buildings and homes and uprooted large trees , authorities said . There were no reports of injuries in that town . In Schaller , a twister knocked down a dozen trees and felled multiple power poles , the weather service reported .

Tammie Pech , a Red Cross spokeswoman , said the agency was opening shelters in Mapleton and Early to take in storm victims . Only four people slept in the Mapleton shelter overnight Sunday , Spence said . Most displaced residents opted to stay with family and friends , he said .

The National Weather Service also reported major damage in Nemaha , possibly from a tornado .

Bond noted that strong winds also tore through hog pens in Pocohontas Country , in central Iowa , and Kossuth County , in the east along the Illinois border .

Randy Frank , Fayette County 's homeland security and emergency management coordinator , said that the challenges continued well after the tornadoes came through , with sustained winds blowing at least 50 mph into Sunday evening .

`` Our biggest problem right now is fuel fires out of control , '' said Frank , whose county is about 255 miles from Monona County . `` And it 's that way across the state , with the wind , which -LRB- can -RRB- be very dangerous in -LRB- fanning -RRB- the fire . ''
