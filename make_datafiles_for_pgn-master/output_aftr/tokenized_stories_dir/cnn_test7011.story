CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Your school probably has fire drills , tornado drills . But how should you prepare for zombies ?! Believe it or not , the government has an answer . I 'm Carl Azuz . This is CNN Student News !

AZUZ : First up today , deadly violence in Baghdad , as a string of bombings hits the Iraqi capital . Fifteen explosions went off within hours of each other on Sunday . Iraqi authorities said the mix of car bombs and roadside bombs killed at least 18 people and wounded at least 80 others . There 's been an increase recently of violence in Iraq . That includes yesterday 's attacks . It 's raising some concerns about whether or not Iraqi security forces will be able to protect their own country . Britain pulled the last of its combat troops out of Iraq yesterday , and U.S. troops are scheduled to leave Iraq by the start of next year , though Iraqi leaders might ask them to stay longer .

STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Just the Facts ! There is a history of conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people . The areas at the center of that conflict are Gaza and the West Bank . Israel took control of these areas in 1967 during the six-day Arab-Israeli War . Right now , around 4 million Palestinians live in Gaza and the West Bank .

Leadership Differences

Part of the reason the U.S. is so involved in what 's going on in Israel is that the two countries are very close allies . The U.S. has supported Israel since it was founded in 1948 . But as Brianna Keilar explains , that friendship was pretty tense late last week .

BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines wiith mutually agreed swaps .

KEILAR : At the White House Friday , Netanyahu panned the proposal .

KEILER : After the initial war of words , the White House hoped the meeting would be a time to kiss and make up .

OBAMA : Obviously , there are some differences between us , the precise formulations and language . And that 's going to happen between friends .

NETANYAHU : We have an enduring bond of friendship between our two countries .

NETANYAHU : That 's not going to happen . Everybody knows it 's not going to happen , and I think it 's time to tell the Palestinians forthrightly that it 's not going to happen .

AZUZ : President Obama is working on some other alliances this week . He 's heading to Europe to visit four countries there . Today , he lands in Dublin , Ireland to meet with that nation 's leaders . Tomorrow , the president travels to London , where he 'll talk with British Prime Minister David Cameron and address the British Parliament . Then it 's off to France for the G-8 . That 's a meeting of world economic powers . And the last stop : Warsaw , Poland . President Obama will meet with the Polish president and visit some of Poland 's historic sites . Today , the president plans to take a side trip to visit some of his personal history : an Irish village where President Obama 's great-great-great-grandfather lived .

AZUZ : From Ireland , we 're hopping across the Northern Atlantic Ocean to Iceland . Something happening there might not affect President Obama 's travel plans , but it was certainly having an impact on Iceland yesterday . A volcano erupted over the weekend ; it sent a cloud of ash up into the sky . No flights were allowed in or out of the country 's four international airports . This is one of the most active volcanoes in Iceland . Local media said it last erupted in 2004 . Last year , another Icelandic volcano eruption -- you might remember this -- caused air travel problems across all of Europe . One official said she does n't think this new eruption will have that kind of impact , although she said it 's hard to predict how the ash cloud might move .

Endeavour Spacewalk

AZUZ : Ed White 's spacewalk in 1965 lasted 23 minutes . He said it was n't nearly long enough . He might have preferred yesterday 's spacewalk at the international space station . That one lasted more than eight hours ! It was the sixth-longest spacewalk ever and the second one on this mission for the crew of the space shuttle Endeavour .

The living dead might be taking over pop culture , but the government agency does n't think there 's any real threat from zombies . So we can all breathe easier . The reason it posted the survival plan was to raise awareness about preparing for disasters . The CDC says preparing for zombies would pretty much be the same as preparing for hurricanes or widespread disease . That includes stocking up on food , water , medicine ; and having a battery-powered radio , plus some changes of clothes .

AZUZ : Well , what 's more fun than exams ? Anything ! But here are some tips that students have for getting through them . Gretchen tries to write everything down on paper and put a little drawing next to it , making it colorful . The color helps her absorb information better . Erik suggests this : record yourself reading the material , then listen to it every day in the morning and evening . It 's like your own personal teacher . N'kayla 's method : `` I use flash cards because they help me memorize things better . '' Chia-sheng says , `` I review what I 've learned right after class to have impressions of what 's covered and what 's important . Before tests , I just skim through the materials . '' Keagan likes things quiet . `` It seems I can fit more into my head when I 'm not distracted . '' Reading the textbook and making a song throughout the chapter works for Calista . Jake goes to a certain room in his house and picks out something in that room to remember the information when he 's taking the test . And Chelsea connects different types of music to different subjects and then breaks it into songs that fit the genre .

Before We Go

AZUZ : Before we go , a new museum invites visitors to dive in , 'cause that 's the only way they can get there . It claims to be the world 's largest underwater museum . It 's located off the coast of Cancun , Mexico . The sculptures are made out of a special kind of cement that encourages coral reefs and marine life to grow . So if you visit several times , it 'll actually look different each time . Of course , if you do n't know to expect the changes , it might throw you for a loop .
