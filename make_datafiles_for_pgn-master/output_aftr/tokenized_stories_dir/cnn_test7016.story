-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two leading tobacco companies fired a pre-emptive legal strike against federal authorities Friday , challenging the objectivity and thus validity of a 12-member advisory panel charged with making recommendations on the safety of menthol cigarettes and other matters .

Just over a month before that report comes out , R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard filed their lawsuit Friday in U.S. District Court in Washington , naming the Food and Drug Administration , Department of Health and Human Services and those agencies ' respective leaders as defendants , as well as the director of the federal Center for Tobacco Products .

The complaint attempts to prevent federal authorities from `` taking any action based on or influenced by '' or otherwise using information from the advisory committee `` as it is currently constructed . ''

The tobacco firms allege that the three , plus two members of a subcommittee , have been paid expert witnesses in litigation against tobacco companies and/or consultants for pharmaceutical companies that create nicotine-replacement-therapy products .

Jeff Ventura , a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration , did not address specific claims in the suit .

Before the report 's release late next month , the panel has two scheduled upcoming meetings . It has met approximately once a month since June 2010 , with transcripts , webcasts and documents germane to the sessions posted on the FDA website .

The tobacco companies in their complaint noted the panel 's mission to probe menthol cigarettes , including their use among young people , African-Americans , Hispanics and other minorities , as well as smokeless tobacco products .

Menthol cigarettes , which account for one-quarter of the cigarettes sold in the United States , have been under scrutiny by public health officials and public health watchdog groups . Critics claim the flavor makes them more addictive and they denounce the marketing campaigns that they say target menthol cigarettes specifically at minority smokers .

`` We do n't collect or retain information on ethnicity in our marketing data base , '' he said .

R.J. Reynolds , the nation 's second-largest tobacco company , is based in North Carolina and sells Camel , Winston , Kool , Pall Mall and other cigarettes . Delaware-based Lorillard , which ranks as the third biggest in the United States , is behind the Newport , Maverick , True , Old Gold and other brands .
