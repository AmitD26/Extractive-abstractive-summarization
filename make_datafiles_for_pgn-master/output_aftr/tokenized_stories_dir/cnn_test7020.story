Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Supporters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi continued Thursday to put up stiff resistance in pockets across the country , despite growing international pressure and persistent attacks from domestic forces .

His father is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands on charges of crimes against humanity perpetrated since the Libyan uprising erupted in February . Saif al-Islam , Moammar 's son and Saadi 's brother , as well as intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi are also wanted by the court .

In Tripoli , Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril said Thursday that $ 16 billion in Libyan funds have been unfrozen by international banks , though not all of it has been made available to the country 's new leaders . Still , the funds have eased the new country 's financial situation , he said .

Noting the continuing fighting in Sirte and Bani Walid , he said a new government would not be formed `` until Libya is fully liberated . ''

And Libya will import 750,000 lambs to be sacrificed in the upcoming Eid festival , he said .

Weeks after he lost his hold on power , Moammar Gadhafi 's whereabouts are unknown , though the National Transitional Council reported Wednesday that he was somewhere near the western border town of Ghadamis .

U.S. Sen. John McCain said Thursday during a visit to the North African nation that Libyans would like to see Moammar Gadhafi captured and tried .

`` There is no doubt this guy was hated by the people of Libya , '' McCain said .

He and Republican senators Marco Rubio of Florida , Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mark Kirk of Illinois traveled to Tripoli to see the nation 's post-dictatorship progress . Among other stops , they visited a prison .

While saying that Libya 's interim council `` still has a lot of work to do , '' McCain called Libya a showcase of the Arab Spring : the movement in North Africa and the Middle East against a number of long-serving rulers .

`` The Libyan people have inspired the world , '' McCain said . `` They have turned cynics into supporters . ''

But Gadhafi loyalists were still putting up stiff resistance in Bani Walid , Sabha and Sirte , the birthplace of the strongman .

The accuracy of attacks on forces in and around Bani Walid -- home to a powerful tribe loyal to Gadhafi -- has prompted allegations by at least one military field commander that Gadhafi supporters may have infiltrated into the ranks of anti-Gadhafi units .

Thousands of people have fled the fighting in Sirte , where the ousted leader retains a following . The National Transitional Council said that about 100 families left the city Wednesday , and agencies like the Red Cross have described dire conditions for those caught in the fighting .

The council also said Sirte was surrounded by revolutionary fighters but estimated that about 5,000 pro-Gadhafi fighters remained within the city .
