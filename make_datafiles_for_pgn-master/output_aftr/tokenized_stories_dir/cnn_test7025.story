-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For a good part of her career , Martina McBride 's success has largely been due to relying on Nashville songwriters and approaching arrangements in a pop-country fashion .

As the 45-year-old singer soldiers on , what about this moment inspired change , and how 's her own songwriting coming along ? CNN spoke with McBride recently as she was prepping for a concert in Minot , North Dakota .

CNN : `` Eleven '' comes with a lot of professional changes . Why is this ?

Martina McBride : You know , sometimes it 's just time to shake things up a little bit . When you 've been at a certain place and management for 18 years , I just felt like I really need someone around me with some fresh ideas , some new passion and energy .

CNN : As female country musicians age these days , are there pressures to stay youthful ? How does one age gracefully in Nashville ?

McBride : Oh , I think the same way you age gracefully anywhere else . Females have always had more of a focus on the way they look . No matter what business your in , if you 're in the public eye -- whether you 're an actor or a rock musician or even head of a corporation , it 's always been that way . You just try ... I do n't know , I try not to focus on it . I 'm still the same voice I had before , and I still have a lot to say .

CNN : `` Eleven '' was largely written by you -- something you 've taken on recently . What 's your writing process like ?

CNN : And sometimes songwriters who start out at 20 , by 30 they feel like they 're all tapped out .

CNN : On `` Eleven '' the first single 's called `` Teenage Daughters , '' which is about the trouble they can cause . Did you give your parents any heart attacks growing up ?

CNN : It seems harder these days to be a teenager .

CNN : You were associated with the pop-country movement of the '90s , but listening to `` Eleven '' and looking at your recent output , it does n't seem like you 're interested in that anymore .

McBride : It 's interesting that you say that . I do n't know if I ever stood out to make a particular type of record . Before , I was so dependent on the songs I found and the songs that came in . I was drawn to certain types of songs but I did n't have the luxury of waiting around for years and years . I had a vision of `` Eleven '' being more organic , more retro , like a '70s rock record . It is less pop .

CNN : On the Grammys , you performed a tribute to Aretha Franklin with Christina Aguilera , Florence Welch , Jennifer Hudson and Yolanda Adams . Are there aspects of pop and rock these days you find intriguing ?
