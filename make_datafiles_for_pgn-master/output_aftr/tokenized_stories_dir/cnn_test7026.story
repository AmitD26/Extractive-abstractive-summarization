Luckily for them , Whedon is a comic-book fan .

In 2005 's `` Serenity : Those Left Behind '' and 2008 's `` Serenity : Better Days '' -- both produced by Whedon for Dark Horse Comics -- we get to see Captain Mal and friends in action .

`` Float Out , '' released Thursday by Dark Horse , is written by actor , comedian and `` Firefly '' devotee Patton Oswalt based on an idea he floated to Whedon .

The one-off book opens with three friends of Wash -LRB- full name : Hoban Washburne -RRB- pausing to remember him before christening a new ship -- The Jetwash -- in his honor . That setup serves as an excuse to flash back to three stories from Wash 's past , each showing a different side of his endearing personality .

Diehard fans wo n't learn a whole lot about Wash that they did n't already know . And anyone hoping to see the entire Serenity crew back together will be disappointed .

But Wash and surprise endings apparently go together .

The next visit is scheduled for November , when `` Serenity : The Shepherd 's Tale , '' a look at the backstory of Shepherd Book , is due to be released .
