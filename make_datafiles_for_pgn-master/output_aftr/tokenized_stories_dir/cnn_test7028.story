-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Europe 's financial crisis claimed its second scalp in three days when Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi announced he will step down after parliament approves new austerity measures in an effort to stave off economic collapse .

Italy has failed to implement austerity measures designed to reduce its mammoth â ` ¬ 1.9 trillion debt load -- nearly six times that of Greece -- and the cost to the country of borrowing more money to pay off that debt is spiraling out of control .

While no one knows yet whether Italy will default , analysts say that the country is vastly too big to bail out -- and that the consequences for the world economy of a default would be a disaster .

After the parliamentary votes Berlusconi will tender his resignation to President Giorgio Napolitano , who will then begin consultations with lawmakers to decide whether to form a government or call for elections .

Business figures tapped to lead a potential technocratic interim government include Luca Cordero di Montezemolo , chairman of Ferrari , and Alessandro Profumo , former CEO of Italy 's largest bank UniCredit .

Political options that have been floated include Angelino Alfano , known to be Berlusconi 's hand-picked successor , Gianni Letta , Berlusconi 's chief of staff , or Mario Monti , a former commissioner with the European Union .

No one is a fan of uncertainty , and no one is going to invest in a debt-ridden country without a plan for recovery -- much less one without a functioning government -- so Italy 's short-term plan will be to get these austerity measures passed , see Berlusconi off , and hold new elections so at least international lenders will know who they 're dealing with .

What 's wrong with Italy ?

The basic problem is that it 's becoming prohibitively expensive for Italy to borrow money to finance its debt -- a problem rooted in investor confidence in the debt-laden country .

With a defunct government and a shrinking economy , Italy is finding it increasingly difficult to find people willing to lend it money in order to reduce its mammoth â ` ¬ 1.9 trillion debt load , which is nearly six times that of Greece .

The less confidence there is in a country , the higher the bond yields , or rate , that country will have to pay in order to secure more money . Right now confidence in Italy is at a euro-era low , which means Italy is paying more than ever to finance its debt .

A government raises money to pay its bills by selling these bonds -- so the higher the yield or rate , the more it costs Italy to borrow money in order to pay its debts .

Bond yields are driven by confidence and based on supply and demand .

The more confident investors are in the health of the Italian economy , the more government bonds , or sovereign debt , the investors will buy .

The more bonds that are being bought , the lower the rates will be on the bonds -- meaning Italy can borrow money to pay its bills at relatively cheap rates .

When confidence in an economy drops , however , fewer investors are willing to invest money in that country 's bonds , which is precisely what has happened in Italy .

Why is a 7 % yield considered the point of no return ?

The recent high yields are particularly concerning because the European Central Bank has been buying Italian bonds since the start of August in an effort to create a sort of false demand , which would then drive the rate down to a manageable level . That has not worked , but it could be a lot worse had the ECB not taken the action at all .

How can Italy get out of this mess ?

The yields wo n't budge until Italian lawmakers take concrete steps to reassure international lenders that the country is a safe bet .

The ECB should also increase its purchasing of Italian bonds in order to make it cheaper for Italy to raise money , according to Barry Eichengreen , an economist at the University of California , Berkeley .

`` Unless yields on those bonds fall to German levels , there is no way that Italy 's debt arithmetic can be made to add up , '' he wrote .

How would an Italian default affect the world ?

A default by Italy , the world 's eight-largest economy with the world 's fourth-largest stock of outstanding government bonds , could have a disastrous effect on many European banks and global markets , experts say .

A default would also wreak havoc on already-shaky global markets and could dash any hopes of economic growth in Europe for the foreseeable future .

As concerns continue to grow around Italy , the head of the International Monetary Fund painted a stark picture of the challenges facing the world 's economic stability .

`` The global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase , '' Christine Lagarde said in remarks prepared for a speech at the International Finance Forum in Beijing .
