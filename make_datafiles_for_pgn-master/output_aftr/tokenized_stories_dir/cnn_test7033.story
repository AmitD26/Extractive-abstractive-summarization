It was the heaviest home defeat for reigning champions United in the English Premier League and left them five points adrift of City at the top of the table .

The 21-year-old Italian 's strength took him clear of United defender Jonny Evans , who could only pull him back as he closed on goal .

Referee Mark Clattenburg was left with no option than to show Evans the red card and the floodgates opened .

But that was the signal for City to really rub in their dominance as substitute Edin Dzeko grabbed a fourth in the 90th minute .

With United in total disarray , Silva tapped in from close range and Dzeko added his second and the sixth in injury time .

City manager Roberto Mancini hailed the result as proof of the strength of their title challenge .

`` I 'm satisfied because we beat United away and I do n't think there are a lot of teams that could win here , '' he told Sky Sports .

`` It was our worst ever day , '' he conceded `` It 's the worst result in my history , ever . Even as a player I do n't think I ever lost 6-1 . I ca n't believe the scoreline . The first goal was a blow for sure but it was retrievable at 1-0 .

`` The sending off was a killer for us . We kept attacking when we went 4-1 down and we should have just said , ` We 've had our day ' . ''

Chelsea were reduced to nine-men after first half red cards for Jose Bosingwa and Didier Drogba .

Heidar Helguson had put QPR ahead from the spot after being fouled by David Luiz before referee Chris Foy sent off Boswinga for pulling back Shaun Wright-Phillips and Drogba for a studs-up challenge .

Arsenal 's north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur also took closer order in the battle for Champions League spots with a 2-1 win at struggling Blackburn .

Two goals by Rafael van der Vaart secured the Spurs victory , their fifth of the season , while at Craven Cottage , Everton scored twice in injury time to clinch a 3-1 victory over Fulham .
