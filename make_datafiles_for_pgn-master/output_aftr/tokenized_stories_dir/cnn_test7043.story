Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords joined about 50 dignitaries and family members Thursday in Washington to mark the retirement of her husband , Capt. Mark Kelly , from the U.S. Navy .

Kelly , 47 , enlisted the military in 1987 and served as a combat and test pilot before joining the U.S. space program . He was part of space shuttle flights in 2001 and 2006 , and then commanded ones in 2008 and again in May .

She attended Thursday 's event inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building , located next to the West Wing of the White House , along with her congressional chief of staff , Pia Carusone , plus her and Kelly 's mothers and his two teenage daughters from a previous marriage .

Sporting glasses , black pants , running shoes and a brace on her right hand , Giffords smiled as she entered to prolonged applause and sat in the front row .

At one point , Giffords helped present her husband with the Legion of Merit and Distinguishing Flying Cross medals , in honor of his fourth space shuttle mission .

Vice President Joe Biden presided over the ceremony , attaching a Legion of Merit pin to Kelly 's jacket and later offering remarks .

Kelly also spoke , extending thanks to those who have offered their `` boundless friendship and optimism '' over the past eight , trying months . And he made a plea for NASA to `` remain a permanent part of the fabric of this great country . ''

`` Gabby , you remind me every day to deny the acceptance of failure , '' he said . `` I look forward to the next phase of our life together and watching all of your future achievements . ''

`` This was not an easy decision . Public service has been more than a job for me and for my family , '' he wrote .
