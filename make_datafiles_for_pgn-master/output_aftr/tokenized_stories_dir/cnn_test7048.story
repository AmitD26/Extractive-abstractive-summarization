`` I lost the car on the entrance to turn one , '' Vettel , who clinched the 2011 championship with third place in Japan last month , told the sport 's official website .

`` I think I was too wide and too far on to the kerb , so I lost the rear and could n't catch the car anymore . I was lucky to get out again at the end of P2 ; there was n't much damage apart from the front wing . ''

British racer Hamilton was pleased with his form and was confident ahead of this season 's penultimate race .

`` The tires are behaving well -- at the last race I had degradation and did n't have the pace , so it feels much better this weekend . That 's a real positive for me .

`` I was playing around with overtaking on my long run , '' the 31-year-old said . `` But I still reckon it 'll be difficult to overtake people in the DRS zones .

Vettel 's fellow Red Bull driver Mark Webber was fifth fastest , with seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher seventh for Mercedes .

The 2011 campaign will finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Sao Paulo on November 27 .
