-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Holy moly , America .

`` The Vow , '' starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum , led the way with a hearty $ 41.7 million -- the strongest opening so far this year . That also marks the best debut ever for the Sony-owned label Screen Gems -LRB- beating `` Dear John 's '' $ 30.5 million -RRB- , which produced the film with Spyglass Entertainment .

With Valentine 's Day around the corner , audiences were clearly in the mood for love , especially considering that `` The Vow '' was the first major romantic drama to hit theaters since November 's `` The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 . '' According to Sony , 72 percent of `` The Vow 's '' audience was female . The PG-13 movie , which cost $ 30 million to produce , received an okay `` B '' rating from CinemaScore graders .

The R-rated movie , which cost $ 85 million and also stars Ryan Reynolds and Vera Farmiga , attracted a diverse crowd . African Americans made up 38 percent of the audience , followed by Caucasians -LRB- 31 percent -RRB- and Hispanics -LRB- 23 percent -RRB- . The film 's audience was evenly split fifty-fifty between men and women , and CinemaScore participants gave it an `` A - '' rating .

The only new movie that did n't overperform this weekend was the 3-D re-release of `` Star Wars : Episode I -- The Phantom Menace , '' which collected $ 23 million . The film was front-loaded , dropping 1 percent from Friday to Saturday as `` Star Wars '' enthusiasts rushed out to see it opening day . But family audiences clearly opted for `` Journey 2 '' over Jar Jar and company .

Among holdovers , `` Chronicle '' dropped only 44 percent for $ 12.3 million . That 's an impressive hold for a `` found-footage '' film ; by comparison , `` The Devil Inside '' plummeted 76 percent and `` Paranormal Activity 3 '' slid 66 percent . The PG-13 movie has so far earned $ 40.2 million on a $ 12 million budget . And `` The Woman in Black , '' starring Daniel Radcliffe , fell 51 percent for $ 10.3 million -- a respectable decline for a horror film .

1 . `` The Vow '' -- $ 41.7 mil

2 . `` Safe House '' -- $ 39.3 mil

5 . `` Chronicle '' -- $ 12.3 mil
