-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates about 1 percent of children ages 3 to 17 have autism or a related disorder , an increase over previous estimates .

Children at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta , Georgia , receive instruction on March 5 , 2009 .

`` This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention , '' Dr. Ileana Arias , deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday . `` A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted . ''

The results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com : How has autism affected your family ?

The investigators also asked a follow-up question : Were the children considered to have ASD now ? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no .

That finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed , since the disorders are not considered curable .

Still , based on the findings , lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA 's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent .

Boys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD , and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children .

He estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States .

`` We do n't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition , in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently , '' Arias said .

`` This is a behavioral diagnosis , and it 's difficult to make , and it 's difficult to make at young ages , '' said Dr. Peter van Dyck , HRSA 's associate administrator for maternal and child health .

Half of the cases were considered mild by their parents , the study reported .

Insel said the federal government is beefing up the resources it is mobilizing to address autism and related disorders , with $ 85 million being appropriated by the National Institutes of Health and $ 48 million for next year by the HRSA .
