-LRB- LifeWire -RRB- -- Practicing the clarinet may be beyond tedious for teenagers forced into music lessons by their parents but for 70-year-old Joe Pedlosky it 's a labor of love .

Saxophonist Jerry Hendricks from Olympia , Washington , practices in Cambria , California , in March 2006

`` It was widely believed that the window of opportunity for learning music was childhood , '' Ernst says . `` If you did n't learn then , you missed your chance . ''

The senior bands prove otherwise . As a matter of fact , these novice musicians give new meaning to the conductor 's command , `` Once more , with feeling . ''

`` I remember conducting at a senior band camp in California , and we played an arioso by Bach , '' recalls Ernst . `` The second time through , two people were crying , they were so touched by the music .

`` High school kids could never do what we do , because they have n't lived enough , they have n't seen enough joy or sorrow . We have a special ability to play music expressively and with feeling . ''

Ernst , who sometimes refers to himself as the Johnny Appleseed of senior bands , made it his goal to bring seniors to music . From just one band in Rochester , New Horizons has grown to more than a hundred bands , plus offshoots from brass quintets to swing ensembles .

Music for body and soul

If you 're interested in getting involved with instrumental music , look for a band in your area on the New Horizons Web site .

If there 's no senior band available , or if you 're interested in learning on your own , most teachers are willing to take on an older student . Pedlosky advises searching for the right kind of person so you 're not quickly turned off .

`` It 's important , if you 're going to start cold , to really find a good teacher -- someone who sets standards for you but is also mature enough to understand that it 's unusual for an older person to take up something about which they know nothing . ''

There are real differences between younger and older learners .

Who knows ? You might even become a bit of a hero to yourself .

`` Music is so demanding and compelling that once you start playing , everything else flies out the window , '' Pedlosky says . `` It gives you a deeper appreciation of music and musicians . And sometimes my music sounds really good to me , and that 's wonderful . ''
