I joined in happily , although somewhat bemused , at each increasingly beery celebration of our host , the worldly Captain Jau . My company , a gathering from four regions of China , was engaging me in Chinese drinking etiquette , in the city of Qingdao .

A few drinks in the People 's Republic of China led me to discover European delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city .

You 'd be forgiven for not knowing where Qingdao -LRB- pronounced Chingdao -RRB- is . The Chinese city in Shandong province does n't roll off the tongue as easily as Beijing , Shanghai , or even Xi'an .

Qingdao could pass itself off as a miniature Seattle if it were n't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five-star hotels speaks English , and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches , stoically named Number One to Number Six .

`` In mainland China , Qingdao 's history is uniquely international ; in fact , more of the city 's cultural identity is wrapped up in its German colonial past than even its prominent role in the emergence of Daoism '' said Eric Blocher , editor of the English-language magazine Red Star .

Following this key advice , I visited Qingdao during the International Beer Festival in late August , an event aimed largely at a domestic Chinese market . The West knows beer . China does not . The annual Beer Festival aims to change this . While the bright lights and myriad beers flowed , one thing was obvious : this was for the tourists .

If I was the guest of honor at Captain Jau 's table , I certainly was n't living up to expectations . Particularly not for my self-appointed etiquette guardian and `` pure Qingdao boy , '' Loukas . As I raised my glass for a sip and Loukas jumped to toast the good weather for the nth time , it all became clear . In Qingdao , a beer glass is never raised without a toast .

Alcohol is enjoyed throughout China . Microbreweries are yet to catch on here like they have in Japan and Singapore . For now Tsingtao holds the monopoly , and Qingdao 's people are n't complaining .

Residents are the first to introduce you to their biggest export . Outside every shop is a barrel or two of Tsingtao , with a ream of clean plastic bags ready to be filled with cheap 3.5 percent beer . Tsingtao beer tastes crisp and sweet -LRB- most likely from rice mixed in to cut down on the cost of barley . It is bought by the pound and weighed to prevent gaseous volume manipulation . A pint , when sold in this method , costs around 1.5 renminbi , or 22 U.S. cents .

Beer is a way of life here and has been ever since the Germans arrived and erected tree-lined avenues , red-roofed houses and a brewery . The Germans are gone but the beer stayed . And with it , three hajiu-loving generations tell you about their happy memories .

`` When I was little , buying beer was one special job I did for my dad every summer day , '' explained Irene Cheung over a fresh bag of beer . `` I was the little girl proudly and carefully carrying the plastic bag home . ''

Following Olympic-based investment , more than 3,000 factories have sprung up in the airport suburbs . You can source anything from shoes to jewels to Durex condoms among the largely Korean-owned industries . If these things are n't up your street , head elsewhere ; like functionally named Beer Street , Bar Street , or my personal favorite , Coffee and Tea Craft Street .

`` We used to have to put on parties so that there would be material to justify an English-oriented lifestyle magazine , '' editor Blocher said . `` Now we have trouble keeping track ! ''
