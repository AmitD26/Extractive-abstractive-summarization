The occupation of Kerr Hall is just one of several demonstrations across University of California campuses this week after the regent 's board approved a 32 percent increase in tuition Thursday .

Protesting students said the increase will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education .

On the Santa Cruz campus , where building occupations began last week with a library sit-in , about 100 students staged a sit-in in the second-floor lobby of Kerr Hall soon after hearing that the tuition increase had been approved , according to UC Santa Cruz Provost David Kliger .

School officials hope the students realize that their demonstration is `` not accomplishing anything '' and is `` just a disruption '' to administrative duties on campus , he said .

At UC Berkeley on Friday night , 41 protesters occupying a building were arrested . Authorities decided to cite them for trespassing and release them rather than take them to jail , per an agreement with student leaders , school spokeswoman Claire Holmes said . Three students were arrested there Friday morning .

Fifty-two students were arrested at UC Davis late Thursday after they refused to vacate the school 's administration building .

And UCLA 's Campbell Hall was occupied for several hours Thursday evening .

Students who live on campus could pay an estimated $ 17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing , according to the system 's July 2008 finance guide .

The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition increase last year .

Students eligible for financial aid and whose families make less than $ 70,000 will have their tuition covered , the university said .
