Shin Fujiyama 's organization , Students Helping Honduras , has raised more than $ 750,000 .

Born in a fishing village in Japan , Fujiyama , 25 , recalls a childhood dominated by health concerns . Doctors told his parents that he had a hole in his heart and `` they did n't think I had lot longer to live . '' But during a later visit to the doctor , Fujiyama says , his family learned the hole had closed .

`` Somehow I was cured and I became a normal kid , '' Fujiyama says . `` And I had a second chance . ''

`` Seeing the country and being able to make a difference really opened my eyes to a lot of things , '' he says . `` I saw such a great need . I wanted to keep helping . ''

`` When I had my very first meeting , I got all dressed up . And only two people showed up , '' he says . `` I knew I had to keep fighting . ''

`` She 's dynamite , '' he says . `` When she talks in front of a crowd , she can move mountains . Knowing that she was behind it , I knew I could do anything . ''

Since 2006 , the siblings ' grass-roots campaign to help Honduras has grown to 25 campuses and raised more than $ 750,000 to fund projects , including the construction of two schools and the establishment of scholarships to help young women attend college .

`` We make friends with all the kids , all the families -- no matter where we 're from . We 've had people from all over the world come to Honduras with us . And it 's a great network we 've made , '' he says . Watch Fujiyama and his group in action ''

While Fujiyama spends his summers in Honduras working alongside volunteers , he spends a large portion of the year on the road visiting colleges to organize chapters and raise funds . Cosmo Fujiyama , 23 , lives in Honduras full time to coordinate the group 's building efforts on the ground .

Students Helping Honduras is working with community members of Siete de Abril to build a new village . Many of the families lost their belongings to Hurricane Mitch in 1998 .

`` I feel like we 're making a huge impact . Some people might think that you have to be somebody famous or a millionaire or a doctor to do something , '' he says . `` But we 're just everyday students -- people in their 20s . We can do so much . We 've got so many things going for us . ... It 's just about leveraging what we have . And we have done a great job at that . ''
