Cable News Network founder Ted Turner remembered Reinhardt , who stayed away from the limelight , as an influential , if taciturn , executive .

`` We both wanted to run a great news organization , '' Turner said . `` He just did a masterful job . He got the stories covered , but he did it within the budget . ''

Former CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour said Reinhardt was a leader who made the trains run on time .

`` He had a steely demeanor , but had a heart of gold , '' said Amanpour , who said Reinhardt hired her as a producer-reporter in New York after she pleaded her case .

`` I 'm not sure CNN would be here without him , '' said Turner , who launched CNN in 1980 . His colleague was an `` integral part of getting the whole operation going and keeping it going . He ran it close to 20 years . ''

A native of New York , Reinhardt filmed U.S. Army Signal Corps combat footage during World War II , including Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's historic return to the Philippines . Reinhardt later served as news editor for Fox Movietone News , according to his daughter . He also was vice president for United Press International Television News and executive vice president at Paramount Pictures , where he nurtured the development of home video .

`` I tell people that in my opinion , he 's probably the most important and powerful news executive you 've never heard of , '' said nephew Harlan Reinhardt .

Amanpour said Reinhardt 's past as a World War II photographer helped .

`` I realized there and then that this was n't just an executive in a suit . It 's a man who 's been there . This is a man who 's one of us . This is a man who was in the field who covered the wars and so he knew what it took to run a news operation like CNN and keep it afloat when everybody was digging its grave . ''

Tom Johnson , who replaced Reinhardt as CNN 's third president , said he developed an unusual relationship with him over the years .

`` I 'm sure a lot of people will talk about Burt 's fiscal responsibility . but I think what set Burt apart from everyone else who has been at CNN was that he was quietly strong , '' said Jim Walton , president of CNN Worldwide . `` And behind the scenes , this man has integrity and he 's very competitive , but he wants to do things the right way . He 's fair , but firm and he treated everyone with respect . ''

Reinhardt helped solidify the CNN logo as a strong symbol .
