-LRB- The Frisky -RRB- -- I know you are really , really upset -- but can you stop crying for a second so we can talk about the fact that Katherine Heigl is finally leaving `` Grey 's Anatomy ? ''

At least we can have some fun imagining how they might get rid of her . Drug overdose ? Amnesia ? Doctors Without Borders ? Sex tape ? Fun ! Anyway , considering her last few movies were ludicrous rom-coms and she has a rep for biting the hand that feeds her , I 'm thinking she may not be too popular in Hollywood after this . Plenty of other celebs have left cushy TV jobs for bigger and better things . Let 's see how nine of them fared .

1 . Amanda Seyfried thinks she 's too big for the filming schedule of `` Big Love . '' That 's why she 's leaving the show -- to move back to New York City , pursue her film career , and live life to the fullest by eating spinach and seeds and popping pills . Mazel Tov , Amanda ! But we 're not sure how this is going to go for you .

3 . She 's never confirmed it , but when `` The O.C. '' killed off Marissa Cooper in the season finale of season three , most people assumed it was because Mischa Barton wanted to move on . The show trucked on without her -- for a season . Mischa 's career , on the other hand : as dead as Marissa after the car wreck .

5 . Never thought I 'd say this , but I 'm actually glad that Tina Fey left `` SNL '' to go on to write , produce , and star in `` 30 Rock . '' Yeah , she 's pretty much taking over the industry and making money with much more than her looks .

6 . Hunky George Clooney left `` ER '' in its fifth season to become the A-list movie star in the front row at the Oscars . A winning move ? I 'd say yes .

7 . Nicollette Sheridan was so desperate to be polished like the jewel that she believed she was that she left `` Desperate Housewives . '' She called the show `` complacent , '' but creator Mark Cherry said her time was up because she had already slept with everyone on the show . Rumor has it that she has a new TV show coming out . Let 's see if that jewel shines .

8 . Viewers cried and stuff when Kal Penn 's character on `` House '' committed suicide only to stop crying when they found out he 'd accepted a position at the White House . Because it 's nobler to actually help people than to play someone who does it on TV .

9 . While Kal Penn joined the real White House , Rob Lowe left the fictional one on `` The West Wing '' because he did n't think there was a place for his character , Democrat Sam Seaborn , anymore . And then he went on to play Republican politico Robert McCallister on `` Brothers & Sisters . '' Politics will eat you alive , man .
