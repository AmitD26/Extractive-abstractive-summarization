-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- Last October , more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones , with a knife and fork in place of the bones , to a secluded Bavarian-style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of St. Louis .

Welcome to the world of underground supper clubs . Getting a reservation requires a little detective work , but once in , you may never go back to eating out the old-school way again . The idea behind these dinners is to let talented chefs work their whisks in an affordable , relaxed setting .

And since they 're often operating out of their own kitchens , without a license to serve the public , these cooks have to keep the locales , and their own identities , under wraps . Budget Travel : The utterly random dinner party

`` The trend started in food-centric cities like San Francisco , but in the last year , groups have been popping up across the country , '' says Jenn Garbee , author of `` Secret Suppers , '' which spotlights some of the more than 80 clubs now up and running in the U.S. .

One such is Guerrilla Cuisine , founded by an incognito cook in Charleston , South Carolina , who uses the alias Jimihatt and wears a ninja mask at his gatherings . As at many clubs , diners must submit their reservations weeks in advance on Jimihatt 's Web site and then wait for an e-mail with directions to the hush-hush locale .

Jimihatt now has a little friendly competition from an Atlanta cook named Lady Rogue . Her RogueApron shindigs each have a different theme . At a recent event , a Great Depression-style repast in Lang-Carson Park , guests stood in a soup line for pancetta minestrone with porcini mushrooms , and lemongrass-spiked corn broth . Then they divided into teams for an impromptu game of Wiffle ball .

But as Chef Todd will attest , these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places , whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room .
