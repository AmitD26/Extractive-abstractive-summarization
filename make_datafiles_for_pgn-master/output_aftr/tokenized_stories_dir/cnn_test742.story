YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site 's terms of use .

The black-and-white puppy makes a yelping sound as it flies through the air .

It 's not clear where the video was shot , although the man who appears to throw the puppy and another Marine are in full combat gear with helmets .

YouTube.com had taken down the video by 12:30 p.m. ET Tuesday `` due to terms of use violation , '' according to a banner on the Web site .

`` We will investigate this and take appropriate actions , '' Perrine said . Watch other Marines and civilians react to the video ''

He said the Marine is being kept safe in view of the anger over the alleged incident .

`` There are many examples of Marines who adopt pets and bring them back from Iraq and demonstrate their compassion on a daily basis , '' he said .

If the video is deemed legitimate , the lance corporal could face a charge of conduct unbecoming a Marine , Perrine said . There could be administrative action , nonjudicial punishment or a court-martial , he added .

`` Certainly , there 's a lot of outrage , and a lot of people are upset about it . I think every Marine is upset about this video , '' he said . `` We hope that it turns out not to be what it looks like . '' E-mail to a friend
