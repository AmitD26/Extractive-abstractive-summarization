-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least five people were killed in Oklahoma on Monday after a severe storm system spawned multiple tornadoes across the state , the state emergency management department said .

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management reported seven injuries .

Video out of Norman showed overturned cars , snapped utility poles , downed trees and severely damaged homes . Several mobile homes were blown to pieces in one neighborhood where debris littered yards and streets alongside large trees ripped straight from the ground .

A truck stop east of Oklahoma City was demolished , taking a direct hit from one of the tornadoes , according to a spokeswoman for Love 's Travel Stops and Country Stores .

`` The three of us were kind of trapped in there , holding the door shut , praying to God that we do n't die and that everybody else was safe , '' Greenway told CNN affiliate KWTV , adding , `` it was really scary -- the wind was like trying to pull the door off the latch . ''

`` It started hailing and then it quit hailing and then all of a sudden the wind hit and it just went dark and here went everything , '' Ward told KWTV . `` Trucks went to rocking ... and next thing we know the whole roof and everything was gone . ''

Ward , who said he felt `` very lucky , '' said the event lasted two to three minutes .

Ashwood said crews were working to assess the damages in at least 13 counties , adding `` numerous '' homes had been affected .

More than 31,000 homes were without power in the metro Oklahoma City area -- nearly 15,000 in Norman alone , according to Oklahoma Gas & Electric .

Ashwood said preliminary reports out of Norman indicate the damages are `` similar to what you would see with an EF3 '' tornado , referring to the Enhanced Fujita Scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes . An EF3 is capable of producing winds up to 165 mph .

CNN iReporter Rebecca Barbato said tornado sirens were going off in her neighborhood in Moore , just north of Norman , when tennis-ball-sized hail began raining down on her roof .

Other tornadoes were reported in Yukon , Medford and Shawnee in Oklahoma , and in Wichita , Kansas .

The storms struck around 5 p.m. CT -LRB- 6 p.m. ET -RRB- .

CNN 's Devon Sayers and Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report .
