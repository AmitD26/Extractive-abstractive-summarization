-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States .

COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is often , but not always , caused by smoking .

While the risk reduction is relatively small , 10 percent , COPD is a common and life-threatening condition in which a decline in lung function can be slowed down but not reversed . COPD symptoms include shortness of breath , coughing , and fatigue .

`` The effect appears to be modest . But for something for which there is n't really any effective therapy and tends to be a degenerative condition , anything that would reduce the risk even somewhat is not an insubstantial benefit , '' says Jeffrey B. Blumberg , Ph.D. , a professor of nutrition at Tufts University in Boston who was not involved in the study .

The researchers took into account factors such as cigarette smoking and age , which can affect COPD risk . The study , conducted by Cornell University and Brigham and Women 's Hospital researchers , is to be presented this week at the annual American Thoracic Society meeting in New Orleans .

The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is `` biologically plausible , '' says Yvonne Kelly , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London . Experts believe vitamins A , C , and E -- the so-called ACE antioxidants -- combat oxidative stress in the lungs that can lead to COPD .

Several studies have shown that these vitamins , as well as vitamin D , may help improve lung health . In a 2003 study , Kelly and her collaborators found that men and women with diets high in vitamins C and E had greater lung capacity and produced less phlegm , respectively . Phlegm production and wheezing are also COPD symptoms .

One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of COPD , says Michael Sims , M.D. , an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center . He points out that people with asthma may think they have COPD , or vice versa , since the symptoms are similar . In addition , early diagnoses can be inconclusive or due to lung problems that do n't turn out to be COPD .

In future studies , Sims says that the researchers should diagnose COPD using a breathing test called spirometry . `` If you showed in a similar study with a gold standard outcome -LSB- like spirometry -RSB- , among smokers and nonsmokers , that you could affect the incidence of COPD , I would imagine the committees that meet on this would take a serious look at increasing daily recommended intake -LSB- of vitamin E -RSB- for the general population , '' he says .

Currently , no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD . The best way to prevent the disease is to quit smoking , says Dr. Sims . About 24 million people in the U.S. have COPD -- 12 million who 've been diagnosed with the disease and another 12 million who have COPD but do n't know they have it . In the study , women who smoked were four times more likely than nonsmokers to develop COPD .

The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher , at 300 IU per day . However , Blumberg says this is within the range of most over-the-counter vitamin supplements , which deliver 100 or 400 IU daily . `` This study is still five times below the highest dose at which no adverse effect has been found , '' he says .

Vitamin E intake is generally a concern only at very high doses , above 1500 IU per day . Several studies have suggested that these levels promote hemorrhaging and interfere with normal blood clotting . For this reason , high doses of vitamin E are not recommended for people taking blood-thinners such as warfarin -LRB- Coumadin -RRB- and aspirin .

According to Sims , the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD . `` If it could be done with something like vitamin E , that 's a relatively low-risk intervention , that would be the Holy Grail . ''
