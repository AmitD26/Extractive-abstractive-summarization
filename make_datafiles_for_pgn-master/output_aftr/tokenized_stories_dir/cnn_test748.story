Tuwaitha , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The shell of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein 's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the Tigris River , but its radioactive legacy lingers on .

The Tuwaitha research complex , about 18 kilometers -LRB- 11 miles -RRB- southeast of Baghdad , was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq 's Tammuz 1 research reactor . It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991 , and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein .

Now , engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site , but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work .

Iraq 's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s , when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor . It built another , French-designed reactor in the 1970s . Israel 's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid , in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility .

After the 2003 invasion , which was launched after the United States incorrectly accused Iraq of having restarted its nuclear , chemical and biological weapons programs , nearby Iraqis inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility . Villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness , particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water .

The Iraq Survey Group found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings , and the U.S. military later spent $ 70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as `` yellowcake '' -- to Canada .

Some Iraqi scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future . But for now , Iraq is still grappling with the shadow of its past .
