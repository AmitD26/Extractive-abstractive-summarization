New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama has given a lot of speeches . He 's given hundreds since he became president . He 's given six in the last two days on his trip to the Gulf .

But last night 's was the first speech he has given from the Oval Office . It will not be his last . But it was important , and he gave it well . It took him five paragraphs to say the serious words we have all known for weeks , but he needed to say : `` This oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced . ''

He went on to say what every American and every victim of this disaster wanted to hear : `` We will fight this spill with everything we 've got for as long it takes . We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused . And we will do whatever 's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy . ''

The rest of the speech did n't matter nearly as much . There were other things he wanted to say , and some of them were important . But the reality is that those 44 words quoted above are action items : We will fight with everything ; we will make BP pay ; and we will help our citizens recover . Now the president has to make it happen . As our nation 's leader , he made commitments and they must be kept .

We all know the president can give a great speech . In fact , he 's president because he first got noticed giving a speech . He gave many more inspiring campaign speeches and raised the expectations of millions of Americans that things would be different .

Whether they are or not is up to each individual to judge . But why there was such a buildup to his giving his first Oval Office speech baffled me . The president sits at his own desk in the office he works in every day ; he looks into the camera and reads the teleprompter . It 's symbolic , but that 's about it .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins .
