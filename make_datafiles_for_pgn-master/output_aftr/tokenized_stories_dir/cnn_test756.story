Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It has long been the dream of many a liberal advocate : to have an unabashedly outspoken , cleverly articulate justice who can take on the conservative majority and inspire young progressives for decades to come -- a `` Scalia for the Left , '' as many have called it .

Kagan 's funny asides during 10 hours of questioning appeared spontaneous , and colleagues say that is her style : someone who is serious about the law but who enjoys a good laugh , often at her expense .

`` It means I 'd have to get my hair done more often , Sen. Specter , '' Kagan replied .

The senator paused and appeared not to immediately get the joke . But he quickly recovered .

`` Let me commend you on that last comment and I say that seriously , '' he said to laughter in the room . `` You have shown a real admirable sense of humor and I think that 's really important . ... We are looking for somebody who could moderate the court , and a little humor would do a lot of good . ''

`` Let 's try to go back in time and say you 're watching these hearings and you were critical of the way the Senate conducted these hearings , '' said Graham , drawing chuckles in the hearing room . `` Are we improving or going backwards ? And are you doing your part ? ''

On another occasion , Kagan was left giggling by an exchange between Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , and committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont .

Grassley had asked the nominee about a paper she wrote as a college student that took a critical look at how judges decide cases .

Her careful answer brought laughs , and Grassley joked it caught him by surprise .

`` Chuck , go ahead and accept it , '' Leahy cut in , to laughs .

Late in the day , conservative Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Oklahoma , said he would ask Kagan a `` softball '' question .

`` Promise ? '' Kagan replied , looking skeptical at first , and then grinning softly .

The biggest laugh of the day came from another exchange between Kagan and Graham . The subject was the not so-funny topic of terrorism and the 2009 attempted Christmas day bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner .

`` Sen. Graham , that is an undecided legal issue , which well , I suppose I should ask exactly what you mean by that , '' Kagan began . `` I 'm assuming that the question you mean is whether a person who was apprehended in the United States is ... ''

Graham interrupted , saying , `` No , I just asked you where you were at on Christmas . ''

On the conservative side , friends of Justice Clarence Thomas -- who almost never speaks at arguments -- note he has a great wit and a hearty laugh . Colleagues call him the funniest justice you never hear about .

If confirmed as expected , the 50-year-old Kagan could have years of humorous highlights ahead of her on the bench . With Roberts , Scalia , and Breyer , she could help make the traditionally sober court a little more light-hearted .

Schumer paid Kagan a high compliment Tuesday , noting Scalia gets the most laughs during high court oral arguments .

`` If you get there , and I believe you will , '' Schumer said , `` you 're going to give him a run for his money . ''
