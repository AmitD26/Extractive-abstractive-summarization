Although employers decide which positions in their organizations are entry-level , they usually define them as jobs requiring two years of experience or less . These positions can come with various education requirements , ranging from some schooling up to completion of a bachelor 's degree , depending on the industry .

In their book `` 200 Best Jobs for College Graduates , 4th Edition , '' Laurence Shatkin and Michael Farr list some of the best entry-level jobs available . Shatkin and Farr looked for jobs with a high concentration of workers between 20 and 24 years old . They looked beyond what the starting salaries are and sought careers that have potential for growth and higher salaries in the future .

Of course , entry-level jobs are n't merely for the early 20-somethings , so do n't think the list ca n't apply to you if you 're outside of that age range . For example , many workers are switching careers in this economy because their industry is n't thriving . Many veteran workers realize that they 've spent years in the wrong field , return to school , get a degree and find themselves starting over again .

Some say companies discriminate against laid-off workers

Here are eight entry-level jobs with high earning potential , their average beginning salaries and the areas that offer the best long-term pay .

Computer hardware engineers - $ 48,750 Missouri New York California Washington , D.C. Massachusetts

Sales agents , securities and commodities - $ 30,890 Connecticut New York Tennessee Massachusetts Washington , D.C.

Agents and business managers of artists , performers and athletes - $ 30,780 New York Massachusetts Tennessee California Nevada
