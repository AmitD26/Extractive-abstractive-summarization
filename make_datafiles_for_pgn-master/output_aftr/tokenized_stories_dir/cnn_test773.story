Gaza City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Take a soccer-crazy crowd and a traditional Palestinian opening ceremony . Add a splash of corporate sponsorship , and sprinkle in some black-clad , gun-toting security .

What you 're left with is the World Cup of soccer -- Gaza style .

The 16-team , two-week tournament culminated Saturday with the field narrowed down to France and Jordan .

`` So we chose to try and come up with something special . And in this case , a Gaza World Cup . If the rest of the world gets a World Cup , we thought Gaza should get one too . ''

While the teams wore the colors of France and Jordan , almost all of the players were Palestinian . Foreign nationals working for the United Nations and other aid organizations rounded out the teams to give it its international flavor .

American player Corey Pattison played for the French team . He said they found a way to work past the language barrier .

A crowd of several thousand men , along with a few women , watched the two teams battle in a game played down to the proverbial wire .

One jumped up on the rail separating the field from the spectators , took off his jersey and led the crowd in a raucous chant .

But this was a day for Gazans to put aside politics and their many problems , at least for a while , and bask in the glory of hosting -- and winning -- the World Cup .
