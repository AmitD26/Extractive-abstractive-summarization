-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Carlos Acosta is the ballet dancer who breaks all the rules . Perhaps the most famous dancer of his generation , his is a career that was n't meant to be -- a tough kid from the backstreets of Havana who was forced to study ballet and became a reluctant star .

But success has its price . His career has taken him away from his beloved Cuba and Acosta 's story is one of displacement and a sense of longing for his family and homeland . `` My heart is in Havana , '' he told CNN . `` When I 'm there I can get close to the life that I do n't have anymore because of my career . ''

Acosta was born in Havana , Cuba , in 1973 . The youngest of 11 children , his early passions were football and breakdancing , but in a country with a proud ballet tradition , his lorry-driver father decided that the discipline of ballet school would keep young Carlos out of trouble , hoping that dance might one day provide his son with a way out of poverty .

Aged nine , Acosta was enrolled in the National Ballet School of Cuba , and he hated it . He found the repetitive exercises boring and longed to play football with his friends instead .

While Acosta was struggling to fit in , his father was jailed over a traffic accident and his mother suffered a stroke . Acosta played truant once too often . He was expelled and sent to a boarding school in Pinar del Rio , his first taste of life parted from his loved ones .

It was n't until he was 13 that Acosta saw his first real ballet . Watching the Cuban National Ballet perform he began to see the possibilities of the vocation that had been thrust upon him .

He turned out to be a natural at it and began to apply himself to his dance classes . At the age of 16 , he won a scholarship with the Turin Ballet , winning the Gold Medal at the Prix de Lausanne .

`` I found that ballet was my best friend . It was everything I had , the opportunity to become something else completely and to be fulfilled , '' he told CNN . `` It took me a while to understand that and once I did , there was no turning back . I was determined to be the best I could . ''

After it received a rapturous reception in London , he took `` Tocororo '' to Cuba in 2003 , where he performed it in front of Fidel Castro . Acosta has described that triumphant homecoming as the highlight of his career .

Not just a virtuoso performer , it is Acosta 's ability to connect with his audience that has made him an international star . Conversely , Acosta says his audience is what inspires him .

He once told an interviewer , `` I had to leave Cuba to be the best I could be . I now have a very high status , but my family has never been able to share it with me . ''
