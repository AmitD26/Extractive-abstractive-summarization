-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor has labeled as `` outrageous '' the controversial decision to ban his side from the next two Africa Cup of Nations .

He told L'Equipe : `` Mr Hayatou has served Africa extensively , but now he must escape . This decision is outrageous . ''

Adebayor , who was not injured in the attack and has now returned to his club side , went on :

Togo 's French coach , Hubert Velud , called on FIFA president and UEFA chief Michel Platini to intervene .

`` I am curious to know if Blatter and Platini will endorse this decision , '' he said .

`` If they let this go , it is the gateway to completely dysfunctional football . I officially launched an appeal to international bodies to see their reaction . ''

Communications chief Stanislas Ocloo and assistant coach Abalo Amnalete were shot dead and goalkeeper , Kodjovi Obilale , was among the injured .

CAF has decided the decision to recall the team was political interference , leading to Saturday 's suspension for the tournaments in 2012 and 2014 .

CAF said in a statement : `` The executive committee and its president renewed their sincere condolences to the families of victims involved in this tragic terrorist attack which happened January 8 , 2010 .

`` The attack was condemned by CAF and also a total support was given to the Togolese team .

`` At that time , CAF said they have understood perfectly the decision of players not to participate in the competition .

`` The decision taken by the political authorities is infringing CAF and CAN -LRB- African Nations Cup -RRB- regulations .

`` Therefore , a decision has been taken to suspend the Togo national team for the next two editions of Africa Cup of Nations , with a fine of U.S. dollars 50,000 handed to the Togolese national football association , in conformity with article 78 of Africa Cup of Nations Angola 2010 . ''

Two men arrested over the attack were said to be members of the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda , an armed wing of a separatist group that has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again .

Cabinda is a disputed oil-rich enclave in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was the site of eight matches in the African Cup of Nations tournament .
