`` It 's not a new chassis per se , it 's a chassis we used in testing , '' Brawn was quoted as saying on the official F1 Web site .

`` The one he had got damaged during the first few races , and we repaired it as best we could at the races . But now we are back at base we are going to re-introduce the test chassis , and he will be using that in Barcelona .

`` It has taken Michael a little time to settle into these cars and particularly the tires . These tires are very different to what he had last time he was racing . ''

Schumacher is being outperformed by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg , who has battled his way to second in the standings .

But Brawn is confident the 41-year-old will be pushing the front runners soon .

`` It 's odd places where he 's losing time and that 's why we think he 'll sort it out and we 'll sort it out . ''

The Spanish Grand Prix gets underway in Barcelona on May 9 .
