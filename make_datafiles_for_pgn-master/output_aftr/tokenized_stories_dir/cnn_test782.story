Rarely does it happen , though , so when flight attendant Steven Slater lived the dream on JetBlue Flight 1052 at JFK on Monday -- yelling `` it 's been great ! , '' grabbing a beer and jumping out the emergency slide into airline history -- I sort of had to sit back and applaud .

Tension between airline companies , airline staff and air passengers seems to dip to new lows every year . Passengers whine about an increase of fees on such things as checked baggage , meals and use of blankets -LRB- the industry makes nearly $ 8 billion a year in such fees , says the U.S. Department of Transportation -RRB- .

They also have to surrender harmless toothpaste and disclose sock styles at airport security checks . They get cranky .

And flight attendants ? They endure long hours -LRB- on average about 80 flying hours monthly , Keagle says -RRB- and low pay -LRB- starting at $ 14 per hour and topping at about $ 40 -RRB- . Some can join unions , but at JetBlue , Slater was n't in a union . All too often , they deal with self-righteous passengers who treat them as assistants , or -- in the case of Slater -- allegedly become abusive .

But considering that there are about 50,000 commercial flights daily , our record of getting along peacefully is pretty good . That more flight attendants do n't flip out at obnoxious passenger behavior is what 's really surprising here . -LRB- The worst such behavior I 've seen is a drunk trio refusing to stop singing on a flight from Zurich , Switzerland , to Moscow , Russia ; I nearly made it a quartet . -RRB- Perhaps more scenarios ought to end like this recent pillow fight on Lufthansa ?

Still , maybe Slater had a point , if a tad overstated .

Be nice . The folks in the terminal taking your ticket -- or repelling your delusional pleas for free upgrades -- are frequently those serving you on the flight . So be nice right away . `` Hey , good ticket skills '' is one charmer .

Make them laugh . Before crouching to enter the bathroom , good-naturedly ask `` will I get a hernia in there ? '' If they get it , they 'll love you ; if not , they 're sort of lame .

Do n't talk business . Flight attendants do n't need to be reminded their airline is struggling -- and face it , nearly all of them are -- so do n't throw out the ol' `` no wonder your airline is on the ropes '' if they 're out of cranberry juice . Certainly wo n't get you a bonus cookie .

Do n't dump trash in the seat pouch . Treat the airline like a friend 's home -- do n't trash it . The pouch in front of you is not a place to put dirty diapers or your sandwich wrappers . `` I put my hand in puke one time , '' Keagle said . `` Not fun at all . ''

Do n't ogle . Some folks , OK mostly guys , treat the aisle as a walkway of delights and visually grope attendants as they saunter down it . That 's rude .

Do n't defy attendants . C'mon . If an attendant says `` snooze the toilet break , '' snooze it . If you 're not yet at the gate , do n't get up to sneak a first grab at the overhead storage . The bag will be there . You deserve no bonus privileges above your fellow passengers .
