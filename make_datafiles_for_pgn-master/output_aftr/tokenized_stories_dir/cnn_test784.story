LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She is one of the world 's most likeable and photogenic leaders , has her own YouTube channel , and is determined to change the face of learning in the Middle East .

Queen Rania 's down-to-earth personality has won hearts and minds all over the world .

She is also , according to you , the most inspirational leader featured on CNN 's `` The Spirit of ... '' in 2008 .

Thousands of CNN Web site users voted to award her the honor for her matchless energy working with Jordan 's young people , ahead of luminaries such as peace advocate Kofi Annan , activist Wangari Maathai and environmentalist James Lovelock .

She delighted viewers with a lighthearted top-ten list of reasons for registering her own YouTube channel , which included , `` Because I did n't have enough friends on Facebook , '' and `` Because anything Queen Elizabeth can do I can do better . ''

The experimental venture gained her a faithful online following , and since then the channel has become a platform for entertaining , non-hostile debate .

It is exactly this willingness to set aside her royal image and interact with the public that her fans say has shown Queen Rania 's dedication to bringing about change .

Queen Rania certainly has a challenge on her hands . Earlier this year , the Arab League Educational Cultural and Scientific Organisation revealed that nearly one in three between the ages of 15 and 45 is illiterate .

Alongside promoting equal rights for men and women and the importance of literacy , Queen Rania has strived to convince both the education and private sectors that existing education systems need reinvigoration . She has repeatedly called for creative instruction and explorative learning to be embraced in the classroom .

In April of this year , Queen Rania launched the Madrasati -LRB- `` My School '' -RRB- project , which encourages Jordanians to get their neediest schools back on their feet .

Under the program , communities are working with the public and private sectors to raise funds and recruit volunteers to renovate school facilities and provide school supplies and equipment . This is expected to improve the learning environment for children , and ultimately have a ripple effect on the neighborhoods where the schools are located .
