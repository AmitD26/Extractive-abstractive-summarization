`` I was trying to bring up the obvious , ludicrous TSA-type of security , '' the pilot said , referring to the cell phone videos he posted , and later removed , from the popular video-sharing website YouTube .

He said he did n't think much about posting his videos online in late November , but that within a matter of days , his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove the videos because they were `` stirring a commotion . ''

A few days after that , the pilot was informed by the TSA that he was being suspended from a program in which he participated , the Federal Flight Deck Officer program . As an officer in the program , he was deputized by TSA to carry a handgun in the cockpit .

`` Basically , an air marshal in the sky , '' the pilot said of the volunteer program . After his suspension , four air marshals and two local deputies showed up at his home near Sacramento , California , to personally confiscate his weapon .

The only answer he could get from the TSA as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation , he said .

Horowitz also defended security measures at the San Francisco airport , saying that there are `` measures in place that are both seen and unseen . ''

In the aftermath of the incident , the pilot said he resigned from the program .

`` This is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security , '' Don Werno , the pilot 's attorney , said . `` No state secrets are being shown here . What 's being shown here is a lack of security . ''

However , when the sheriff 's deputies showed up at his house with the air marshals , they also took his California concealed weapons permit . The pilot said this permit was unrelated to his work for the TSA .
