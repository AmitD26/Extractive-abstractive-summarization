Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11 , 2001 .

`` Wow . My God . ... It makes you weak in the knees to see these pictures , '' Leech said .

Leech , 54 , recently took CNN into an office not far from the conference room where he was that morning . He has avoided touring the building since the attack but finally decided he was ready to `` re-engage '' with the past .

In 2001 , Leech was working as a Defense Department liaison officer to the White House Drug Policy office . He worked primarily out of the White House but attended meetings at the Pentagon every Tuesday and Thursday morning . Watch as he returns to the crash site ''

The shock , he said , was indescribable .

`` It hit with such force . I had never experienced anything like it in my life . It rattled you right down to the bone , '' Leech said .

Flight 77 slammed into the west wall of the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m. ET . Among the 184 people killed in the building and on the plane were a 3-year-old girl and a 71-year-old retired Navy captain , the youngest and oldest victims , who were both passengers on Flight 77 . A closer look at the new Pentagon memorial ''

`` I was so lucky . ... It was almost like we were in a protective cocoon , '' Leech recalled . `` I mean , I inhaled a lot of jet fuel vapors , and I got dusted up , but that was the extent of my injuries . ''

The married father of a 26-year-old woman remembers snaking his way outside the burning building , where in a stupor he noticed a comb that appeared to belong to a small child .

Leech served 28 years in the military and now works for the Department of Homeland Security but hopes to return one day to the Defense Department .

Seven years after that horrible day , Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial , a two-acre park , which opens to the public Thursday . It was built at the spot where Flight 77 plowed into the Pentagon and will be open 24 hours a day , seven days a week .

Thumbing through a condolence book in the chapel , he found the friend whom he was with that day , Navy Capt. Jack Punches . He wrote , `` Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation -- John Leech . ''
