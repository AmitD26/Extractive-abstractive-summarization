-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A female sports reporter blasted the all-male Augusta National Golf Club on Monday , a day after a security guard would n't let her in to interview one of the stars of the recent Masters tournament .

Tara Sullivan , a reporter with The Bergen -LRB- New Jersey -RRB- Record , tried to join other reporters Sunday evening in the club 's locker room to interview Rory McElroy , a 21-year-old from Northern Ireland who gave up a big lead at the close of the four-day competition . But a security guard said she could n't come in because she was a woman . Read more about the Masters winner on Golf.com .

On Monday , an official with the Augusta , Georgia , golf club explained that the guard had acted in error -- saying that , even though there are no female members in the club , female reporters have been and should be given the same access as men to do their jobs .

The security guard , who was also female , `` was very apologetic '' in denying her access to the locker room in the clubhouse , according to Sullivan .

Sullivan responded by citing federal law that mandates equal access for reporters to get into such locker rooms , whatever their gender .

'' -LRB- The guard -RRB- said it 's sort of this open bathroom area , '' the reporter said . `` I said , ` Yeah , like every professional locker room I go into . ' ''

In 2002 , women 's rights activist Martha Burk began a movement aimed at forcing the prestigious club , which includes many titans of finance and industry as members , to open its ranks to women .

But the club 's then-chairman , Hootie Johnson , resisted these efforts , including saying in a statement that no policy changes would come `` at the point of a bayonet . ''

`` It 's -LRB- the club 's -RRB- responsibility that the tournament security week personnel ... are informed of what the policies are , '' said Sullivan , who vowed to be back at Augusta National to cover her fifth Masters next spring . `` It was just such a complete lack of awareness , which is inexcusable on the part of the people who run the tournament .
