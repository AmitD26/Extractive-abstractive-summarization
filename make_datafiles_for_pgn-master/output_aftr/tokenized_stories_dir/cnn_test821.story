CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Fridays are awesome ! Thank you for rounding out your week with CNN Student News . I 'm Carl Azuz , here to pilot you through 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines .

First Up : Libya Civil War

AZUZ : First up , United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says there are no signs of a cease-fire in Libya . That announcement came yesterday , one week after the U.N. Security Council voted to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya . That 's part of the military operation that 's been firing missiles and running airstrikes . It 's been led by the U.S. Yesterday , there was talk of a deal that would make NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , the leader of the operation . But that was n't set in stone , and there was some doubt about it .

One interesting point about the conflict in Libya is how it could affect gas prices in the U.S. Libya produces about 2 percent of the world 's crude oil ; it 's not very much . But some stock traders are afraid that the trouble there could happen in other countries that produce more oil . That fear is one reason why oil prices are rising in the stock market . And that means gas prices are more likely to increase too , since crude oil accounts for about 65 percent of what we spend on gas .

Now , getting back to the military operation . Diana Magnay is on the ship that some of those airstrikes are launching from . She gives an idea of what life is like there .

CAPTAIN MIKE WYRSCH , HARRIER FIGHTER PILOT : It was pretty neat the next day after the first attacks , to see that the rebel forces , their morale once they saw that they had people coming to help them out . But it 's breaking their supply chains as well as slowing down their advance onto Benghazi by taking out their tanks and artillery .

The pilot 's back in the medical facilities here on board . His other crew member , the weapons officer , also had to eject , but landed in a completely different location . So , he was rescued first by rebel forces and is now back on a U.S. Air Force base in northern Italy .

There are around 700 Marines on board , but this is n't a war which involves coalition ground forces . The Kearsarge 's six Harrier jets taking the active role in enforcing the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone

REAR ADMIRAL MARGARET KLEIN , COMMANDER , EXPEDITIONARY STRIKE GROUP FIVE : If there are vehicles on the ground that can shoot down our aircraft which are enforcing the no-fly zone , we consider that a legal mandate to be able attack that equipment .

And here 's another interesting fact : peanuts are not technically nuts ! That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Allergy Outrage ?

AZUZ : Peanut allergies are pretty common . But in some cases , the allergic reactions can be life-threatening . And that 's why experts say it 's important to have a plan in place in order to avoid a potential problem . At one Florida school , the plan in place affects everyone , not just the student with the allergy . And as Jason Carroll explains , the plan is prompting protests .

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : We are not attacking the child or the parents .

UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I guess it 's not fair for one kid to have a set of standards that the rest of the kids have to abide by .

DR. SCOTT SICHERER , PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRICS , MT. SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE : It 's always necessary to have precautions for a young child who has a food allergy . There might be specific procedures that need to be in place to just really ensure that that child does n't end up eating the food that they 're allergic to .
