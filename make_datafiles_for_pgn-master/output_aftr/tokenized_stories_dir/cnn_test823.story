The largest crowds , for a seventh straight day , were in Madrid and Barcelona , but there were also protests in Valencia and smaller cities , protest organizers and Spanish news media reported .

Overall , reports indicated that tens of thousands took to the streets across the nation , which is struggling with a 21 % unemployment rate , the highest in the euro zone .

`` What we are going to do is comply with the law , '' Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba told reporters Friday .

Yet Rubalcaba , who is also deputy prime minister , added that the police would not be there to create even more problems than already exist in the streets .

Spain 's supreme court rejected an appeal late Friday to overturn the electoral board 's order banning demonstrations on Saturday . Authorities insist that the day before elections in Spain should be free of political messages and campaigning , for a so-called day of reflection .

The protests against Spain 's political and financial establishment started on May 15 .

Young people dominated the protests on Saturday but there were also families with young children strolling through the encampment , senior citizens and many people who have jobs but say they 're concerned about the nation 's future , which has a 42 % jobless rate for people ages 15 to 24 .

`` Everybody here is a volunteer and everything started very small but we got organized very fast and it started growing very fast , '' said Juan Lopez , a protest spokesman who 's an internet technology manager who is currently unemployed .

`` You just can see how well one of our best committees , which is the infrastructure committee , work . They made all this in just four days , '' Lopez said , pointing to the bustling encampment .

Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said in an interview with SER radio on Friday that voters ultimately will decide whether and how much change will be made .

On Sunday , voters in Spain 's 8,000 cities and towns will elect mayors , along with 13 out of 17 regional presidents and parliaments . The results are expected to be a bellwether for national elections , which must happen no later than March 2012 .

`` It 's just before elections when the Spanish politicians usually hear the voice of the people , '' Lopez said . `` Now on Monday , we have to see how this develops and what the answer is . The best-case scenario , which is the one we would like , is that they will come down here as citizens to hear us , and to make a new and better Spain , a new and better democracy with all of us are together .
