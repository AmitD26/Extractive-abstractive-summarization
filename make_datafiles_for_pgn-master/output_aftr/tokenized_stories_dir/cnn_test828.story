-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One damp , chilly evening in October , Dolores Kopchak called the police . She had a rather unusual problem : a lion in her back yard .

He immediately shut down Kopchak Road and called for help . What happened next on that evening reads more like the stuff of an action-packed adventure novel than police reports .

The Muskingum County Sheriff 's Office has released many of those reports that reveal how law enforcement officials were thrust into a desperate hunt for potential killers on the loose .

Deputy Jay Lawhorne had been on Thompson 's property before , responding to previous complaints about him , including animal abuse .

Thompson , 62 , had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms , including five fully automatic firearms . A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending .

Lawhorne picked up his M4 rife with .223-caliber ammo and got in the back of the pickup .

The deputies began going up Thompson 's driveway not knowing what they would find . It was already after 6 p.m. and they knew they only had one hour of daylight left .

There were cages on the left and the right of the driveway . Tigers , lions , cheetahs and bears roamed about .

Thompson 's house was empty , save two monkeys and a small dog , Blake said in his report . On his way out , Blake saw a body near an embankment .

A large white tiger was sitting 5 feet away . It appeared the cat had fed on Thompson 's flesh , Blake said .

Right behind Thompson 's large barn , at the top of hill near the house , they saw several large cages where the larger lions had been kept . The deputies secured the heavy wooden doors but as they got closer , they realized the cages had been cut open .

A lion came out just 3 feet away . Lawhorne said he was forced to shoot it dead . Another deputy encountered a lion hissing at him and baring its lethal teeth .

The deputies were able to save a black panther and a spotted leopard .

At 11:30 , the deputies gave up the search for the night . Lawhorne said Sheriff Matt Lutz told him his replacement would arrive at 6:30 in the morning .

They radioed it in and were informed that a Columbus zookeeper was on her way to tranquilize the cat .

Lawhorne and other deputies stood by with assault weapons . Just in case .

This time , it was shot dead .

In all , deputies shot 49 of Thompson 's menagerie . Some , like the Bengal tigers , were endangered species .

John Moore , who worked as a caretaker for Thompson 's animals , said that he had last seen Terry Thompson the day before he died , according to the police reports . Thompson told him then that he had received a letter about Marian cheating on him .

He told Moore : `` I have a plan to find out and you will know when it happens . ''

No one may ever know what Thompson 's plans included -- his death is still under investigation and not all records have been released .

Thompson is gone . So are his animals . The Humane Society of the United States said that under the circumstances , it did not fault the deputies for using deadly force .
