-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said Wednesday that Zimbabwe is in shambles and warned that deaths from starvation and a cholera outbreak threaten to surge with the rainy season approaching .

Bemoaning Zimbabwe 's decline is a familiar refrain for the embattled head of the Movement for Democratic Change . His most recent remarks , however , were backed by former President Carter , who returned from a five-day trip to neighboring South Africa this week and declared Zimbabwe `` a basket case . ''

Addressing Tsvangirai 's allegations that cholera deaths could soon top 50 a day and that the Mugabe-led government seems intent on covering it up , Mumbengegwi noted that Zimbabwe is not the only country where cholera is a problem . Watch why world leaders call the situation in Zimbabwe shocking ''

A report in the state-run Herald newspaper Wednesday said the government has kicked off an information campaign to inform citizens of `` the do 's and do n'ts to combat the disease . ''

The World Health Organization said last week that almost 300 people have died of cholera since August and more than 6,000 cases have been reported .

Tsvangirai said Wednesday that conditions would worsen this month as the rainy season brings steamy downpours to much of Zimbabwe , especially the eastern mountain forests .

Carter , former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Graca Machel , wife of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela -- all of whom belong to a group of world leaders called the Elders -- had hoped to visit Zimbabwe on their recent trip to the region but were denied visas , according to Tsvangirai and a statement from the Carter Center .

The humanitarian problems illustrate the political quagmire in Zimbabwe , where a power-sharing agreement that Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed in September has yet to take effect .

Carter issued a statement Tuesday condemning what he said was Harare 's decision to renege on an agreement to allow him , Annan and Machel into the country . He also offered a damning assessment of the Mugabe regime .

`` After almost three decades of governmental corruption , mismanagement and oppression , Zimbabwe has become a basket case , an embarrassment to the region and a focus of international concern and condemnation , '' he said .

`` We had a complete and balanced agenda and more frank discussions than would have been possible in the oppressive and restrained environment of Harare , '' Carter said in his statement .

`` Meanwhile , top government officials and other privileged people can exchange Zim money at a favorable rate that is several thousand times more than the official rate available to other citizens , '' Carter said . `` They profit greatly from these monetary transactions and shop in special stores . ''

`` The middle class is departing , leaving behind the extremely poor and the small elite group around Mugabe who are profiting from the economic disaster , '' he said .

Carter 's call for African leaders to step up pressure on Mugabe came a day before Tsvangirai asked South Africa 's Mbeki to bow out as mediator between the MDC and Zanu-PF .

`` Sadly , the negotiations have also been hampered by the attitude and position of the facilitator , Mr. Thabo Mbeki . He does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in Zimbabwe is , and the solutions he proposes are too small , '' Tsvangirai said in his statement .

Asked for the Zimbabwe government 's reaction to the MDC asking Mbeki to recuse himself , Foreign Minister Mumbengegwi said , `` We have no right to tell them who to complain about . It is their decision in the MDC . ''

Unless African leaders can find a way to mitigate the political impasse in Zimbabwe , the United Nations or the African Union might need to enter the fray , because , Carter said , `` the poisonous effects '' of the Mugabe regime , including the cholera outbreak , are spilling into other African nations .

Food , medicine and monetary donations should be sent immediately to humanitarian agencies such as CARE , World Vision and Save the Children , Carter said , advising that it is unwise to send cash directly to people in Zimbabwe .

`` It is counterproductive to contribute money that can be confiscated by the Zimbabwe government , '' he said .
