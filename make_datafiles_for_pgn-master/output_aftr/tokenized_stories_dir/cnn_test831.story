After all , producers did n't hesitate to turn the Amanda Knox , Natalee Holloway and Clark Rockefeller sagas into TV movies . And interest in those cases pales compared to Anthony , whose trial became the must-see television event of the summer .

But the public outrage over Anthony 's acquittal on murder charges is making some in the industry rethink the wisdom of adapting her story to the screen .

`` Anyone who pursued a movie based on these events , especially right now , will face some immediate backlash , '' said Matthew Belloni , news director for The Hollywood Reporter .

`` The nerve is so raw on this and so many people are so outraged by the verdict that anything that is seen as an attempt to exploit this , especially if the family is involved , will be seen as a negative by most of the people who followed the trial , '' Belloni told CNN .

The cable channel Lifetime would seem the logical home for an Anthony movie -- it aired the Knox , Holloway and Rockefeller films , and it 's in production on a movie about murder suspect Drew Peterson -LRB- with Rob Lowe in the lead -RRB- .

And Paradigm , another big talent agency , signed Anthony 's lead attorney , Jose Baez , for representation , only to `` un-sign '' him several hours later after facing a drumbeat of criticism .

`` If that girl -LSB- Anthony -RSB- makes one dime off of the death of her child , I 'm just telling you that I feel like America is going to be like , ` we are so done with you ! ' '' she told CNN .

Comedian and social commentator Alycia Cooper told CNN she could imagine a Casey Anthony movie under certain circumstances .

Cooper likes Alyssa Milano for the role . `` I think she 's got the chops , '' Cooper said . The Hollywood Reporter 's Marisa Guthrie picked `` Twilight '' star Kristen Stewart . Nash told us she would cast Katie Holmes or Anne Hathaway .

To play Casey Anthony 's father , the white-haired George Anthony , we heard suggestions of John O'Hurley of `` Seinfeld '' fame , Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Blake .

Speculation about casting the movie may be more than just idle chatter . Some people remain convinced there will be a Casey Anthony movie , including The Hollywood Reporter 's Matthew Belloni .

`` You 've got to believe that something this high-profile , something that everyone is talking about ... that eventually , this will become a movie , '' he told CNN .
