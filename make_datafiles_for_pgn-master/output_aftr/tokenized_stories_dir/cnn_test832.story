Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of three American college students arrested in Cairo passed out from fear when Egyptian authorities accused them of taking part in violence , he told CNN Sunday .

`` There were cops and people with guns standing before us , '' Derrik Sweeney said , describing `` the scariest moment of my life . I did n't know if I was going to survive , and I actually fainted -- the only time I recall fainting in my life . ''

Sweeney , Gregory Porter and Luke Gates were back in the United States Sunday , a few days after an Egyptian court ordered their release .

Egyptian authorities had accused them of throwing Molotov cocktails in the clashes that have rattled Egypt in recent days .

Porter was the first of the students to come home , returning to Pennsylvania on Saturday .

He also thanked his lawyers , embassy officials and the administration at the American University in Cairo for their roles in helping to secure his release .

Sweeney , 19 , of Jefferson City , Missouri , arrived at a St. Louis airport late Saturday night and was greeted by about two dozen relatives and friends .

Sweeney is a student at Georgetown University ; Porter , 19 , is from Glenside , Pennsylvania , and attends Drexel University in Philadelphia ; and Gates , 21 , of Bloomington , Indiana , attends Indiana University .

Speaking to CNN on Sunday , Sweeney said he was `` hoping to see politics in action '' when he went close to the protests , but insisted , `` we were in the sidestreets '' and not in the thick of the demonstrations .

`` We were right near a large crowd , apparently near the interior minister , '' he said , when the police `` shot something into the crowd and we all sprinted away . As we were trying to regather ourselves , we found -- the three of us Americans -- found each other . And then someone came in plain clothes saying that they would take us to a safe place and help us out . The next thing we knew we were getting hit ... The first night we got hit in the face in the back of the neck a number of times . ''

While he does not know who the plain-clothed people were , `` I believe police , '' Sweeney said . `` They were certainly working with the police . They were able to walk around the police where the protestors were n't . ''

Drexel President John Fry released a statement Saturday expressing relief at Porter 's safe return and thanking all those involved .

Three Drexel students remain in Egypt and all of them want to stay as long as U.S. officials do not recommend they leave , Fry said .

Asked whether he wants to return to Egypt , Derrik Sweeney told CNN , `` I really enjoyed most of my time there and hopefully one day , '' but , he added , `` not very soon . ''
