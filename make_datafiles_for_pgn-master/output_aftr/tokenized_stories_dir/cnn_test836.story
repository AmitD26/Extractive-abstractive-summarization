-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Colombian man , possibly linked with paramilitaries there , may be the mastermind behind the kidnapping in Venezuela of major league catcher Wilson Ramos , Venezuelan Justice Minister Tareck El Aissami said Saturday .

Authorities have identified him and an arrest warrant is being issued , he said .

Six Venezuelans have been arrested in the case , and more arrests are possible as the investigation continues , El Aissami said .

Ramos was rescued Friday night after a shootout between his suspected captors and rescuers in the mountainous region of Montalban , about 60 miles from the north central Venezuelan city where he was last seen .

He is healthy and unharmed , authorities said .

The day after Ramos went missing , investigators found the SUV used in the kidnapping , but had few clues to lead them to the perpetrators , he said .

So investigators focused on intelligence work -- matching the description of the snatching to the modus operandi of known criminal groups -- and eventually located a home where they believed Ramos was held .

The owners of the home , Lesbia Quesada , 60 , and Aristides Sanchez , 64 , were accused of being accomplices to the crime and were arrested , he said .

Authorities arrested Alexander Sanchez , 27 ; Francisco Finamor Penna , 20 ; Yosnar Cubillan , 21 ; and Anyuli Tarazona , 22 .

Ramos was full of thanks to his rescuers and his supporters upon his arrival at his family home in Venezuela early Saturday .

`` I did n't expect them . Where they were holding me captive was a very remote place , basically a jungle , and see , I was praying to God to bring me home safely to my family and look at these guys , they risked their lives to save mine and I am very thankful . ''

Ramos , a rising star for the Washington Nationals as a rookie this past year , was in his native country to play in Venezuela 's winter league .

`` I am happy to announce that I have spoken directly with Wilson and he assures me he is unharmed , '' said Mike Rizzo , the team 's general manager . `` He asked me to thank all who played a role in his rescue , and all those who kept him and his family in their thoughts and prayers . ''

Ramos , 24 , emerged as the team 's top catcher this past season . He had a .267 batting average with 15 home runs and 52 runs batted in .
