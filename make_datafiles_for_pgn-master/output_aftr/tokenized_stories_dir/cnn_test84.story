-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It seems today that a new stage of life has opened up . Sociologists call it `` emergent adulthood , '' Time magazine termed it `` the Twixter years , '' and author Kay Hymowitz referred to it as `` pre-adulthood . ''

People in this group are over 18 , but as they head toward 30 they still act and think like adolescents . They bounce from job to job and relationship to relationship , live with parents at home or in a house with five friends , watch ESPN and play video games -LRB- the boy-men -RRB- and read `` Twilight '' and ponder whether he 's just not into you -LRB- the girl-women -RRB- , while all of them sprinkle `` like '' and '' 'n stuff '' and `` ya know '' in their speech . Adolescence used to be a condition you escaped as soon as you could , but these 20-somethings want to prolong it .

After all , books have the power to fortify attitudes . For instance , the `` Harry Potter '' books , a wonderful phenomenon for tweens and early-teens , offered so compelling a world of heroic , beset youth and hostile adults that readers clung to Harry well past the proper age . In fact , quidditch matches have spread to more than 200 college campuses . `` Twilight '' has had a similar impact , intensifying the ordinary shenanigans of teenagers to luridly high melodrama .

Why grow up when adolescence contains so much romance and suspense ? Clinging to such young adult fantasies , pre-adults think that grownup content is a sensation , like `` Fifty Shades of Grey , '' a book so poorly written as to be beyond parody . Only a 14-year-old sensibility could read this passage when Miss Steele first encounters Christian without laughing at the witlessness of the words .

I open the door and stumble through , tripping over my own feet and falling headfirst into the office .

Now , who trips over her own feet and falls headfirst to the floor ? And the callowness of `` Double crap '' and `` Holy cow '' could n't be more phony . Young women loved it , though . And so did many older women , apparently .

Yes , there are several superb recent novels about teens and 20-somethings by talented writers , like Jeffrey Eugenides ' `` The Marriage Plot '' and Gary Shteyngart 's `` Super Sad True Love Story . '' But they have too much sympathy for the emerging adult , too much understanding of young love and companionship , to do the work of correction .

It will take an altogether different book to explode extended adolescence ; specifically , a frolicking comic novel that submits the interests and longings of pre-adults to whimsy , burlesque and farce . Not gentle humor , but all-out comedy or satire that casts the whole experience and habitat of pre-adults as both ludicrous and avoidable .

Let 's have a comic novel do the same for emergent adulthood .
