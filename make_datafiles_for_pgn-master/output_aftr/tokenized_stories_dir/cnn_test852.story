Parts of New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania have been issued warnings by the National Weather Service after a recent dry spell in the region .

New York

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday declared a state of emergency for New York 's Suffolk County , where a 1,000-acre blaze broke out Monday . The declaration makes the county eligible for financial assistance .

The fire continued to rage into Tuesday morning and prompted Suffolk County officials to ask for the emergency declaration , he said during a news conference Tuesday .

`` We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to get the fire under control before winds pick up again , '' he said .

Two firefighters were released from a hospital Monday with minor injuries , and a third suffered second - and third-degree burns after winds fanned flames in a wooded area where he was working , Bellone said .

The injured firefighter , who was taken to Stony Brook University Hospital , is `` doing well '' and `` in good spirits , '' he added .

State officials planned water drops Tuesday from a helicopter in an attempt to control the flames , said Jerry Hauer , New York 's commissioner of homeland security and emergency services .

The National Guard is also on standby in the event that the fire worsens , he said .

The fire was under control by around 4 a.m. Tuesday , but firefighters remained at the scene through the morning , officials said .

New Jersey

In New Jersey , a wildfire that sprawled across about 1,000 acres of rural forest at its peak had been about 75 % contained as of Tuesday , according to Michael Achey , the state 's Forest Fire Service spokesman .

Twenty-five homes are in the fire area , Achey said , but no homes were evacuated .

No injuries have been reported , and the fire remains under investigation , he added .

Connecticut

The flames whipped through northern parts of Milford -- a wooded , marshy area with very few buildings , Zak said . No injuries were reported .

He said his department is accustomed to marsh fires , but Monday 's blaze was on a different scale .

By Tuesday morning , firefighters were still at the scene .

`` We 're aggressively attacking it , '' Zak said . `` It 's still windy out here today , so we do n't want anything to flare up or rekindle . ''

Pennsylvania

In southeast Pennsylvania , a blaze that spread over 450 acres at its worst point was about 95 % contained Tuesday , said Joe Frassetta , district forester at the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry .

Residents of more than 100 homes along the border of the park were evacuated Monday . Flames came within 100 yards of several homes but did not cause any structural damage , Frassetta said .

Despite several smaller overnight fires , rainfall helped keep the brush blaze in check , said Duane Hagelgans , a regional emergency management spokesman .

The 30-acre fire began in a private logging area on Peter 's Mountain , Hagelgans said .

No homes were evacuated , but volunteer firefighters battled both the blaze and rough , mountainous terrain , which hampered efforts to contain the spreading fire .
