Higher advertised fares are the result of new Department of Transportation rules that are going into effect under the banner `` Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections # 2 . ''

Higher prices shown up front is one of the four main changes that you 'll see when the the new rules go into effect starting Tuesday , so let 's talk about what will happen .

Full fare advertising

On some airline websites and in ads , you 've probably seen fares displayed as a certain amount plus taxes and fees . That 's a pretty common thing throughout society , but the DOT has decided that it 's unacceptable for airline travelers . Beginning Thursday , the advertised price has to be the total price including any mandatory per passenger taxes and fees .

Let 's say that there 's a sale for $ 59 each way between Los Angeles and San Francisco . Now , the airline can advertise it as $ 59 each way plus taxes and fees . On Thursday , it will have to be shown as $ 69.80 each way . This applies to advertisements , but more importantly , it applies to reservation websites . They can no longer show just the base fare in the search results .

Wondering what exactly is included in this new fare ? Fuel surcharges must be included in the rate -LRB- as has been the case for years anyway -RRB- and any mandatory fees . Of course , most of the fees people see adding up today are optional fees , like baggage charges , and those can still be broken out . There are , however , a slew of regulations impacting them as well .

Fees become more prominent and standardized

A couple of things make good sense . If there is a change in bag fees or baggage allowances , the airlines must prominently display a link to the change on their homepages for at least three months . Airlines will also have to make available a complete list of rates for all optional services , from pillows to food and drinks .

Under the new rules , anytime a fare quote is given , airlines have to let passengers know that `` bag fees may apply . '' In addition , when a ticket is purchased , the airline must include in the e-ticket receipt , a complete list of all possible bag fees and allowances .

That means detailing different rules for elite frequent fliers , different rules by class of service , etc. . If you 're wondering where they 'll put it , it will undoubtedly go into the fine print at the bottom that nobody reads anyway because there are already too many disclosures down there .

One actual victory for travelers here centers around which bag fees get charged when a traveler is booked on codesharing airlines for trips beginning or ending in the U.S. Today , if you buy a ticket on , say , American , but your first flight is on its codeshare partner Etihad , then the baggage rules on Etihad usually apply .

If you 've ever bought a ticket from an ultra low-cost airline like Allegiant or Spirit , you might have found yourself frustrated by the dreaded `` opt-out '' procedure . You know how it works . The travel insurance or some other optional service might be automatically checked . If you do n't want it , you have to uncheck it before you continue or it will be charged . This rule makes that illegal going forward . All optional services will be `` opt-in '' only .

Allegiant had discussed the idea of giving travelers the choice of two fares . One would be higher , but would not change . The other would be lower , but would go up if the price of fuel went up . So it would simply tie a piece of the fare to the cost of fuel . If people wanted to take a gamble on fuel prices , they could buy the lower fares . That , however , is no longer an option . But it really is minor since the option was n't yet offered anyway .
