-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Mexican nationals were charged Monday in the death of a U.S. Coast Guardsman , whose succumbed to a traumatic head injury after his boat was rammed off the Southern California coast .

Neither man was asked to enter a plea when they appeared Monday afternoon in federal court , where Magistrate Judge Victor Kenton ordered them held without bond , U.S. attorney 's office spokesman Thom Mrozek said . A preliminary hearing is set for December 17 , and their arraignment is set for December 21 .

Having suffered a traumatic head injury , Horne was pronounced dead by emergency medical personnel upon his arrival on shore at Port Hueneme . The other Coast Guardsman tossed overboard was treated at a hospital for `` relatively minor injuries '' and released later Sunday morning , Jenkins said .

Around 5 a.m. Sunday , about four hours after the initial crash , the panga was located about 20 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border , according to the criminal complaint .

Coast Guard officers pulled up and ordered the boat 's occupants , at gunpoint , to exit the boat . They refused to comply , and the panga raced away . It then stalled , refused further orders , and sped away again , the complaint said .

In the third try , a Coast Guard officer pepper-sprayed both men on the panga . That boat 's driver was detained after a struggle with Coast Guard officers , while his passenger was `` detained without incident , '' the criminal complaint said .

The suspects had entered the United States `` illegally from Mexico , '' according to the document .

The same day the two suspects were in court , colleagues of Horne remembered him as a devoted Coast Guardsman and beloved friend . The Redondo Beach , California , resident , 34 , was second-in-command on the Cutter Halibut .

`` Words can not express -LRB- the -RRB- admiration that I have for him , '' said the ship 's commander Lt. Stewart Siebert , as he fought back tears . `` He was my friend , he was my confidant , he was the glue that held my crew together . ''
