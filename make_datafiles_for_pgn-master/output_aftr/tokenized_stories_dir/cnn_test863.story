Since 2006 , her organization , Infinite Family , has used the Internet to connect almost 500 teens with nearly 300 volunteer mentors from all over the world . Stokes started the program after witnessing how HIV and AIDS left many children without parents .

CNN asked Stokes for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011 .

Amy Stokes : I was attending the Social Good Summit in New York , and I received the amazing news while I was standing in a stairwell at the 92nd Street Y.

Most people look at these big problems and think , `` It 's so big , I ca n't do it , I ca n't get involved . '' Having had the ability to have people say , `` Oh , gosh , you do n't have to be a millionaire to try something new , '' is really powerful .

CNN : How will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero ?

Stokes : We plan to use it to start two new computer labs and , at our existing four labs , connect children who are still waiting to have video mentors of their own .

CNN : What do you want people to know most about your work ?

Stokes : We all learn best from each other , which is why growing up in families and communities of caring adults is so important . More than 50 million children in sub-Saharan Africa do not have this opportunity . ...

We 're figuring out how many millions we can serve . I ca n't adopt all of those children , so I have to bring someone else into their lives in some way . ...

We play a critical role in helping our youth learn and develop and one day to become contributing members of their schools , communities and countries .
