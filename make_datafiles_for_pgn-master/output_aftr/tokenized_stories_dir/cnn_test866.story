-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bloody clashes erupted Saturday between pro- and anti-Syrian regime fighters in the Lebanese city of Tripoli , the deadliest outburst of violence in recent weeks and further indication that Syria 's turmoil is spilling across borders .

Twelve people were killed and approximately 50 were wounded in the latest fighting , according to the state-run National News Agency . Of those hurt , 12 were transported to a hospital in the coastal city , including one in critical condition .

The sectarian violence in Tripoli -- which is on the Mediterranean coast , about 50 miles from Homs in Syria -- mirrors the tensions in its neighboring nation .

Clashes in both nations pit Sunnis , who make up the majority of the Syrian opposition and population , against Alawites and other Shiites , who are dominant in President Bashar al-Assad 's government .

Saturday 's fighting is not the first time tensions have simmered over , including in Tripoli .

Last month , violence flared after Lebanese authorities arrested Chadi Mawlawi , an Islamist activist who was helping Syrian refugees by providing food and shelter , his cousin said . Lebanon had accused Mawlawi of being an operative in an al Qaeda-inspired group -- something his relatives deny .

The activist was eventually released , but not before his arrest sparked fighting that killed seven people and left dozens wounded .

Also last month , gun battles in Beirut between rival political parties -- one supporting Syria 's al-Assad and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded . That was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where the powerful Hezbollah militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008 .

Syria has long been a major influence in Lebanon , and not just because of the extensive border the two nations share .

Lebanon was considered part of `` greater Syria '' until the end of World War I. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005 , primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peacekeepers to help stop Lebanon 's long civil war , though they stayed long after the fighting stopped in 1990 .

The Syrian forces ' 2005 withdrawal followed the car-bomb killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut , which some blamed on elements of al-Assad 's regime . Since then , Lebanon 's most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided -- the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati on one side and anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri , the son of the assassinated former prime minister , on the other .

The unrest in Syria that began 15 months ago with peaceful anti-government protests , followed by a government crackdown , has meant further complications for Lebanon .
