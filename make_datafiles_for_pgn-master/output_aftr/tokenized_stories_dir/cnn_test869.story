The case will be `` seriously considered , '' Ramin Mehmanparast , a spokesman for the Iranian foreign affairs ministry , said Tuesday , according to Agencia Brasil .

The 51-year-old diplomat allegedly fondled the genitals of boys and girls -- ages 9 to 14 -- on April 14 at Neighborhood Social Club No. 1 in the capital , Brasilia , the news agency said .

It was not immediately known in what capacity the man worked at the Iranian embassy in Brazil .

The diplomat had been a member of the club for about a year at the time of the alleged assaults . His membership has since been suspended , the social club said .

Iran 's promise to investigate the allegations is a change in position after initially calling the incident a `` misunderstanding arising from differences in cultural behavior '' and a result of media bias , a statement from the Iranian embassy in Brazil said .

`` We would like a clarification from the embassy regarding the very worrying accusations , '' Patriota said , according to Agencia Brasil . `` We hope to get to the bottom of the facts and from there decide what measure to take . ''

Iran also has worked to strengthen ties with Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia and Cuba . It has opened six embassies in the region since 2005 .
