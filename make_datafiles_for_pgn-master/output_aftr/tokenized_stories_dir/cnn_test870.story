Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Pakistani Supreme Court on Thursday convicted Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani of contempt of court but gave him just a symbolic sentence that will not require him to serve time in prison .

The court found Gilani guilty of the contempt charge after his repeated refusals to ask Swiss authorities to revive old corruption charges against the country 's president , Asif Ali Zardari . That makes him the first sitting Pakistani prime minister to be convicted of a crime .

An opposition leader said Gilani should resign following the guilty verdict , but members of the prime minister 's cabinet insisted he would continue in his role and appeal the decision .

`` I think that after the conviction the prime minister should immediately step down from his post , '' Nawaz Sharif , a prominent opposition leader , said on Geo TV . By remaining in power , Gilani risks harming the credibility of parliament , Sharif said .

But members of Gilani 's government criticized the court 's decision as being politically motivated .

`` The verdict is unconstitutional and immoral , '' Nazar Muhammad Gondal , the federal minister for capital administration and development , said on Express News , a local channel .

`` The prime minister has the confidence of the parliament , so he will continue as the prime minister , '' he said .

Imtiaz Safdar Warraich , the deputy interior minister , said the government planned to appeal against the verdict .

Gilani was convicted for `` willful flouting , disregard and disobedience of this court 's direction , '' said Justice Nasir ul-Mulk as he read out the decision .

The judge said that `` the contempt committed by him is substantially detrimental to the administration of justice and tends to bring this court and the judiciary of this country into ridicule . ''

The corruption cases that the Supreme Court now wants reopened stem from money-laundering charges against Zardari and his late wife , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto . A Swiss court convicted them in absentia in 2003 of laundering millions of dollars .

After Musharraf granted a controversial amnesty in 2007 to Zardari , Bhutto , and thousands of other politicians and bureaucrats , Pakistan asked the Swiss authorities to drop the case . In 2009 , the Pakistani Supreme Court ruled the amnesty was unconstitutional and called on the government to take steps to have the cases reopened .

The government did not do so , and the court lost patience . Since Gilani is the head of the government , the court justices view him as responsible .
