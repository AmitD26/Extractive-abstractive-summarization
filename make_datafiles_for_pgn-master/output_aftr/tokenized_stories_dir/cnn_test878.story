-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oh , he was n't always so quiet .

Contrary to his somber popular image -- created in the early days of Beatlemania and never truly put to rest -- George Harrison loved to laugh , and he loved to make others laugh . After all , this is a man who mortgaged his house so Monty Python could make `` Life of Brian '' because he wanted to see it -- `` still the most anybody 's ever paid for a cinema ticket , '' jokes Python 's Eric Idle .

Of course , he could be quiet . He loved to spend hours working in his gardens . He could be prickly , too -- and thoughtful , and bitter , and expansive , and wistful .

In other words , he was a human being , this Beatle and ex-Beatle and musician and racing enthusiast . -LRB- You did n't know about the auto racing ? -RRB- As Martin Scorsese 's award-winning documentary on Harrison , `` George Harrison : Living in the Material World , '' revealed , he was n't easily pigeonholed -- and he liked nothing more than to take the piss out of all the cliches .

After all , this was a man who gleefully participated in a mockumentary about the Rutles , a parody Beatles whose characters included a tight trouser-loving manager named Leggy Mountbatten , a movie called `` Yellow Submarine Sandwich '' and a spouse identified as `` a simple little German girl whose father had invented World War II . '' Harrison played a reporter present at the pillaging of the Rutles ' business headquarters .

The following is an edited and condensed version of the transcript .

Olivia Harrison : He was mischievous . He did like to tease people a lot . I just got so used to being wound up -- he just wound me up every single day I think I knew him . And he said , `` You 're just so easy to wind up . '' He 'd make some really bad remark , and he 'd just do it so I 'd start protesting . And he was funny , and he made you funny to be around him , and if you could make him laugh , that was just great .

CNN : And you , Giles ?

There was no pomp and circumstance with him . And whenever it came to -LSB- recording at -RSB- Abbey Road , there was no red carpet . He wanted everyone to be treated the same .

Harrison : I have no idea . He always said he had no idea what he would have done if he was n't a musician . He did n't have a clue . He 'd have been a total failure , he said . He had no idea how to do anything else .

CNN : So he did n't see dropping the guitar and becoming a landscape architect .

CNN : In the film , you talk about the gardens at Friar Park and how much effort and love he put into them .

CNN : Giles , the music for the documentary came from a range of sources . What challenges did you have in producing it ?

Martin : Marty -LSB- Scorsese -RSB- would want the song , say , `` All Things Must Pass , '' which is a classic track from a classic album , but it 's made for vinyl . And if you played it in the cinema , it would n't be the way you remember it sounding . It would sound small . So you 're ripping everything apart and putting it together so it sounds how you think you should remember it . And that 's a challenge , because you have to pay utmost respect to the original creation , and at the same time , you have to rub everyone 's memories the right way .

CNN : Olivia , did George usually put in a lot of winks and nudges to you when he wrote songs ?

Harrison : It 's been extraordinary . We went to Mumbai , to the film festival there , -LSB- and -RSB- for them , to see footage of George riding around in a rickshaw in India -- not being a tourist , but participating in daily life there -- they were so happy . It was such a great response . It 's been going around the world , to the Istanbul Film Festival , and it 's going to Rome .

CNN : I think the ending is one of the most moving things I 've ever witnessed .

I think it 's a surprising documentary -- it leads you somewhere you do n't expect . You certainly do n't expect it to be as deep . I did n't . I think it 's a real tribute to Marty that he managed to capture that .
