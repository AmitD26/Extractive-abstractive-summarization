-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain : Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa .

Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors

As chief executive of the Economic Development Board , one of Sheikh Mohammed 's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors .

The government 's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom 's dependence on oil .

SM : The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity , so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to . And therefore , because of this aspirational aspect , trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we do n't want to go .

SM : The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing , financial services are growing throughout the region . Bahrain 's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital , the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain .

JD : Strategically and a geopolitical question here : the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran 's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy , and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country . What 's the motivation here ?

JD : Historically , Iran has even made claims against Bahrain , what do you do now moving forward now ? Do you bring Russia , China , the United States and the European Union closer together , in terms of where we should be going in the future ?

JD : Can the GCC -LRB- Gulf Cooperation Council -RRB- become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process ; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward ?

Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board , the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy .

Sheikh Mohammed , who is married with two sons and one daughter , was born on April 14 , 1969 .
