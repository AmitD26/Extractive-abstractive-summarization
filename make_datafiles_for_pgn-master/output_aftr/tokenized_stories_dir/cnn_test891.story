NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- So far it has been a very sunny summer for newbie pop singer Kristinia DeBarge .

Kristinia DeBarge has broken through with the summer hit `` Goodbye . ''

She has a Top 20 hit with `` Goodbye , '' a peppy pop number which borrows from Steam 's 1969 stadium anthem `` Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye . ''

The energetic video just earned DeBarge an MTV Video Music Award nomination in the best choreography category . And later this month the 19-year-old will demonstrate her dance skills as the opening act for Britney Spears ' global `` Circus '' tour .

The L.A.-based singer is well connected in the music business : she 's the daughter of James DeBarge , a member of the '80s R&B group DeBarge . Her debut album , `` Exposed , '' dropped last week , and was produced by Kenneth `` Babyface '' Edmonds . Watch DeBarge tell her subject `` Goodbye '' ''

CNN : He did n't want you to go into music , did he ?

DeBarge : No , because he knows how the music industry is . And some people can become a little jaded and tainted after . So he likes that I 'm innocent and wants to keep that innocence fresh .

CNN : What did he want you to do ?

DeBarge : Something like be a doctor or a veterinarian or a lawyer . I totally admire all those jobs . ... But it 's not my passion . My passion is singing , so if I was to do those things I would n't be happy because I 'd be like , what a waste of talent . I 'm a singer .

CNN : You were on the `` American Idol '' spin-off show `` American Juniors '' in 2003 . What was that experience like ?

CNN : Whose idea was it to borrow from Steam ?

DeBarge : The producers and the songwriters . ... And I was like gosh , what a great idea . Maybe I could take over the old version that 's playing at basketball games and the hockey games ! Even for people who do n't really like pop music ... they can listen to that song and sing along to it .

DeBarge : Sometimes , but they 're good . They 're good personalities . She 's just like everyone else .

And that 's also something that I want to make clear on the album -- that I 'm very normal and I experience all of the same things that 19-year-old girls go through . ... It 's my first album and I 'm hoping that everyone from little girls to older women will really be able to relate to it .

CNN : Are you excited about being one of the opening acts for Britney Spears ?

DeBarge : Yes , I 'm really excited about that . ... She 's a great performer and entertainer and I think that she has so many fans and so to gain her fans is going to be great for me . And I mean the fact that she even approved of it is great .
