-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of the man authorities say was dismembered by a Canadian porn actor called for the suspect 's quick extradition Tuesday and expressed hope that their `` devastating situation '' could become something positive .

`` Jun Lin was our beloved son . As the only son in the family , he was our pride and hope , '' his family said in a written statement issued Tuesday . His killing `` is not only a devastating attack to our family , but also has had a tremendous impact on the whole society . Love and trust must be rebuilt . ''

The family thanked the people of Montreal , who stepped up to support their travel ; and Concordia , which has set up an award in their son 's name to assist Chinese students -- a move the family said `` perfectly reflects Jun Lin 's compassionate spirit . ''

`` We are very grateful and moved by the kindness and sympathy for us , '' they said . `` It is our wish to take this opportunity to turn a devastating situation into something positive that brings the goodness and peace back to society .

Investigators have said the suspect and victim knew each other , though they have not defined the nature of their relationship .

The mailings and the discovery of other body parts behind Magnotta 's apartment triggered an international manhunt . German authorities nabbed him June 4 in Berlin , where they said he had been spotted browsing online articles about himself at an Internet cafe .
