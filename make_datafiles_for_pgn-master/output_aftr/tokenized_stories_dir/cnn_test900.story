In an exclusive interview with CNN , Peres said Israel would act to prevent further attacks .

Peres said Israel had `` enough '' hard intelligence to link the Bulgaria attack to Iran and its proxy Hezbollah and believes more attacks are being planned as part of what he called an `` open war against Israel . ''

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Iran and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah movement were responsible for a number of attacks and attempted attacks against Israeli targets in Thailand , Georgia , India , Greece , Cyprus and other countries .

`` We do n't have an initiative of terror , '' Peres said . `` We do n't do it . But self-defense is the right and the must of every people . ''

Over the weekend , Defense Minister Ehud Barak said he ordered the military to prepare contingency plans to attack Syria 's chemical weapons arsenals , should the need arise .

`` The use of chemical weapons is internationally forbidden ... and what do you do when somebody violates the law ? You fight against it , '' Peres said . `` You stop them . We shall not remain indifferent and tell them , ` Do what you want . ' ''

`` If they will come by force , we shall stop them by force , '' Peres said . `` If they shall come in without force , we shall stop them the way any country defended her border with civilian means . ''

Peres spoke a day after Israel marked the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich , Germany , where 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed .

While he would n't go into details , Peres said Israel was taking precautions to ensure Israeli athletes would not be targeted at the London Olympic Games , which start later this week . He argued , however , that if Israeli intelligence services been at Munich , they would probably have been able to prevent the attack .
