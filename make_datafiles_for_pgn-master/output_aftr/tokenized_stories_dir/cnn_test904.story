Stuart Hersh was in a mall when the Hamas terrorist organization carried out the attack . In 2003 , a U.S. District Court awarded Hersh $ 12 million from the Iranian government , ruling it was responsible for supplying and training the suicide bombers . Hersh says he never received money from Iran .

`` We want to be entitled to the money of Ahmadinejad and his delegations , '' Hersh 's lawyer , Nitsana Darshan-Leitner , told CNN . `` We believe it belongs to us as a judgment holder . ''

The Iranian government will be spending between $ 10,000 and $ 15,000 a night on accommodations at the Warwick , which could result in $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 for Hersh , Darshan-Leitner said .

Hersh and his wife now live in Israel and say they will not move back to the United States until they feel justice has been served .

Originally from Fresh Meadows in the Queens borough of New York City , Hersh said he can not afford to travel to his home state but would make the trip if he were awarded the rooms . He said he would `` invite other terror victims to join him and max out room service on Iran 's credit card . ''

`` All I want is the money that 's due to us and we do n't want the American people to pay for it , '' Hersh said . `` I do n't want them paying disability to me , I want the money from Iran . ''

He holds Ahmadinejad accountable for withholding the money , and the American government accountable for letting him get away without paying it .

Hersh also filed lawsuits in Chicago and Boston , claiming the rights to Iranian artifacts lent to the University of Chicago and Harvard University . Darshan-Leitner said each of those lawsuits is currently before a court of appeal .
