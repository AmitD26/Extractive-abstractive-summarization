-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You 've probably seen the new Apple TV ads with actor John Malkovich having what looks like the most charming chat of his life with Siri , the voice-activated `` personal assistant '' on the iPhone 4S .

`` That 's pretty spectacular advice , actually , '' Malkovich says after Siri tells him to avoid fat , read good books , take walks and `` live together in peace and harmony '' with everyone .

That may be about to change , however .

In the eight months since she debuted in October , Siri has been `` studying up and learning a lot more , '' Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall said during a presentation Monday at Apple 's annual developers ' conference . Forstall then previewed some advancements to Siri that will come this fall as part of iOS 6 , the company 's next mobile operating system .

Apple is equipping Siri with new databases of knowledge , including the ability to retrieve sports scores . She 'll also be able to open an app for you , search movie showtimes , post Facebook updates , make restaurant reservations and provide turn-by-turn navigation to drivers with Apple 's new maps application .

But based on the glimpses we saw Monday , the most interesting improvement to Siri may be the language she uses in her answers , which already sound more natural and conversational .

`` It was Siri flawlessly and quickly answering a mundane question about basketball that Apple should be most excited about : LeBron is taller , Siri is smarter , and the bewitching Apple advertising juggernaut shall parade forward , '' Gilbert added .

But it 's clear from CEO Tim Cook 's recent comments that Apple sees Siri as a big part of its mobile future .

`` Siri is one of the most popular features of iPhone 4S , '' Cook said at last month 's D10 conference . `` But there 's more that it can do , and we have a lot of people working on this . And I think you will be really pleased with some of the things you 're going to see over the coming months . We have some cool ideas about what Siri can do . We have a lot going on on this . ... Sure , it can be broader , and so forth , but we see unbelievable potential here . We 're doubling down on it . ''
