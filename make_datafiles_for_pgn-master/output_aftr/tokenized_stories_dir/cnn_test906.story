-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The insurgents who attacked an Afghan military base where Prince Harry is deployed may have gotten onto the base by sneaking through a hole in a fence , a British military source said Monday . Officials discovered the hole after the attack , the source said , adding that the attackers -- daringly disguised in U.S. Army uniforms -- also tried to blow up parked NATO aircraft with hand-held improvised explosive devices .

NATO releases details of brazen raid on base in Afghanistan

`` This was a well-coordinated and complex attack that we 're taking very seriously , '' a U.S. official said Monday .

It 's extremely rare for Afghan insurgents to use U.S. uniforms in their attacks . The last time CNN can identify was more than two years ago , when NATO repelled attacks on two bases in Khost province in August 2010 .

No coalition troops were killed in that attack , NATO 's International Security Assistance Force said at the time .

Well-trained , well-rehearsed fighters carried out the sustained assault in Helmand province , the ISAF said .

About 15 insurgents organized into three teams penetrated the base 's perimeter fence and did considerable damage , destroying six refueling stations and damaging six aircraft hangars .

Eight coalition military personnel and one civilian contractor were also wounded .

It is too soon to say whether the attackers had `` inside knowledge , '' ISAF spokesman James Graybeal said .

The ISAF would not say how the attackers got the uniforms , but CNN staff who have spent time in Afghanistan say they are for sale in markets there .

Harry , a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne , `` was in no way in any danger '' during the latest attack , ISAF spokesman Maj. Martin Crighton said earlier .

On Saturday , the ISAF said the camp is secure and the strike would not `` impact '' air and ground operations .

Camp Leatherneck , the U.S. side of the base , was not affected by the attack , said Maj. Adam N. Wojack , an ISAF spokesman .

Afghanistan has seen only relatively small and peaceful demonstrations against the film during a week in which there were protests across predominantly Muslim countries and other locations .
