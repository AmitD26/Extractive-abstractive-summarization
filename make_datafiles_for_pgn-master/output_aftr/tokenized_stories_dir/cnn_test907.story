-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rescuers on Friday suspended the search for the 11 people missing from the oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico , the Coast Guard announced .

`` After three days of constant searching , covering more than 5,200 square miles , we 've reached the point where reasonable expectation of survivors has passed , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters Friday evening .

The Coast Guard began notifying family of the missing that they were preparing to end the search early Friday afternoon , Landry said .

Earlier Friday , Landry said conversations with survivors of the blast that set the oil rig Deepwater Horizon ablaze Tuesday night indicate that the missing workers `` might have been in the vicinity of this explosion . ''

Landry said crews were continuing efforts to clean up a 1 - by 12-mile-long oil slick spreading through Gulf waters 40 miles offshore .

`` We are at the ready to respond should something happen , '' she said . `` We 're going to be very forward-leaning . We ca n't back off from this at all . ''

The Coast Guard is still attempting to locate the rig , and two nearby underwater pipelines -- one owned by the Shell oil company -- have been shut down in case there is a collision , Landry said . The closest other rig is more than eight miles away , she said .

BP officials said Thursday they did not know whether oil or fuel was leaking from the sunken rig . But BP Vice President David Rainey said , `` It certainly has the potential to be a major spill . ''

The Coast Guard said it was also keeping a close eye on activity underwater .

Officials said 126 people were on board at the time of the explosion . Of the 115 accounted-for workers , 17 injured were evacuated by helicopter from the rig . An additional 94 people were taken to shore with no major injuries , and four more were transferred to another vessel , according to the Coast Guard .

Angelico said the agency has begun interviewing people involved in the incident as it seeks to determine what caused Tuesday night 's blast .
