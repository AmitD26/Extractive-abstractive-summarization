But other unions said they plan to continue demonstrations into Tuesday , and not all members of Bell 's union had decided to follow her lead . Members of Madison 's WEAC local , the MTI Teachers Union , have voted to remain at the capitol on Monday at least , its president , Mike Lipp , told CNN .

`` I think every teacher in here wants to be back with their students , but we also understand that there are important points to be made , '' Madison high school teacher David Olson told CNN . `` And so far , we 've done a good job of using our collective action to force the issue and to make sure people understand why we 're fighting . It 's an important fight to continue . ''

But the issue has triggered widespread resistance from unions , even those that wo n't be affected by the plan , and the 14 Democrats in the state Senate have fled Wisconsin to stall a vote on the plan .

The demonstrations caused schools districts to cancel classes in Milwaukee and Madison for much of last week as large numbers of teachers took the day off work to protest . Some teachers have been given doctors ' notes to excuse their absences from physicians sympathetic to their cause , protesters told CNN .

And an estimated 55,000 people turned out for Saturday rallies at the capitol , mostly in opposition to Walker 's plan . Several thousand more packed the building on Sunday , sending up a rousing cheer when a group of firefighters -- who , along with police , are exempt from Walker 's proposed bill -- joined them in a show of support .

Speaking on `` Fox News Sunday , '' Walker denied complaints that he was trying to break up public employee unions . But he said that collective bargaining has hindered local governments ' efforts to manage their finances `` time and time again . ''

`` In return , they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed , '' state Senator Jon Erpenbach , a Democrat , said Saturday .
