Authorities do n't have a suspect and do n't know whether the bomb was linked to a white supremacist group , the official said .

The FBI said last week it will consider regional neo-Nazi activity in its investigation of the backpack bomb .

Frank Harrill , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Spokane field office , said last week that authorities know of no link to `` any specific group or individuals '' and called reports linking the bomb to recent neo-Nazi activity in a nearby Idaho town `` premature . ''

The bureau is looking into the incident as `` an act of domestic terrorism , '' and investigators are analyzing `` every square millimeter '' of the backpack , Harrill said .

Then , during the evening of the King holiday , about 15 neo-Nazis demonstrated outside the Human Rights Education Institute in downtown Coeur d'Alene , Stewart said .

About the Spokane bomb discovery , Stewart said : `` It 's clear that it was an attempt to end the march and attack human rights advocates .

The Coeur d'Alene area had been a hotbed of neo-Nazi activity through the Aryan Nations and Order II hate groups since at least the 1970s , though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000 , Stewart said .

Several bombings in Coeur d'Alene in the 1980s , including at the home of a Catholic pastor and priest who was also serving as president of the human relations task force , were blamed on the Order II , Stewart said . The priest was n't injured in that bombing , he said .

A $ 20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible . The FBI is asking the public for information on who might have been seen with the backpack from about 8 a.m. to 9:25 a.m. on the King holiday , January 17 . It also is asking for photos or videos taken in the area .
