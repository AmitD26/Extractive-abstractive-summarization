-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a presidential campaign laden with historic twists , the biggest shock may be yet to come : With three weeks to go , the first of two remaining debates tonight , and most Americans yet to cast their ballots , the final surprise may be that there are no surprises left .

Long ago , Team Obama displayed a heartbreaking lack of faith in its candidate and his prospects . Abandon hope , all ye who campaign here ; they never tried to get Barack Obama re-elected president . Constrained by the paucity of their achievements and the poverty of their ideas , perhaps they felt they had no choice : We ca n't win , they concluded , but maybe we can stop the other guy from beating us . Obama 's thin campaign only tried to stop his opponent from winning .

Until this last month , the president 's `` This is a one-man race '' marketing philosophy was working -- but only with the assistance of an opponent who ran as if his shoes were tied together . Mitt Romney had allowed Obama to paint him as an unacceptable alternative . He also helped the president with 47 % of the brushstrokes .

Team Romney 's inability to introduce their candidate as a good and decent man has frustrated Romney 's core supporters , who 've longed to hear more about their man 's munificence and compassion . Romney 's campaign seemed equally unable to acquaint voters with the transformational business leader who , as Ann Romney describes , has routinely done things others thought `` impossible . '' All that changed two weeks ago in the pure Denver air .

What millions of dollars of ads had not been able to do , Mitt Romney did for himself . The Romney who showed up in the first debate did not , as Obama had led voters to expect , have horns and tail . Instead , he was the most unexpected candidate of all : a reasonable alternative to good-hearted but flailing president . In debate one , Romney even admitted he was having fun , an emotion we were not led to think he was programmed to express .

If the 2008 election was about hope and change , the 2012 contest has always about strength and certainty . In these turbulent and uncertain times , the most unacceptable quality in a leader is weakness .

In one flashing moment in a primary debate , Tim Pawlenty refused to say to Romney 's face what he had said absent his presence , that Romney had created `` Obomneycare . '' Without hesitation , voters neutered Pawlenty .

Now , with only three weeks to go , Obama 's campaign marinades in its powerlessness . Doubts metastasize as the administration moans that no one asked the president to protect our Libyan ambassador , as if it had not been his responsibility . He 's started losing female voters , treating women as no more than a constituency of sexual organs and then hiding behind his secretary of state 's skirt . He pretends to protect women , Hispanics , seniors , when he can not protect himself .

Tonight we should expect a solid performance from both men . Romney has been doing `` Ask Mitt Anything '' Town Halls for five years . On the stump these days , he connects with ease , telling stories of the people he 's met , moved by their hopes and suffering . His growth is evidence that our campaign process is not only built to pick presidents but to shape them .

Five things to watch for in Tuesday 's debate

Mitt Romney may have already won this election : Even if the president has a strong performance tonight , he failed us on the economy , failed us in Libya , failed us in Denver .

How can we trust that Barack Obama wo n't fail us again ?
