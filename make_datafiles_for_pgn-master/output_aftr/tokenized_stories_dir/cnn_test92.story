Numbers do n't lie

When the nominations for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards were announced , HBO received 104 , the most of any network for the 11th year in a row . With multiple opportunities to win for `` Mildred Pierce '' -LRB- 21 -RRB- , `` Boardwalk Empire '' -LRB- 18 -RRB- , `` Game of Thrones '' -LRB- 13 -RRB- and the miniseries `` Too Big to Fail '' -LRB- 11 -RRB- , the cable network -LRB- which is owned by CNN 's parent company -RRB- is poised to show up strong at this year 's awards .

However , to be fair , major network comedies also received multiple nominations , including ABC 's `` Modern Family '' -LRB- 17 -RRB- ; NBC 's `` Saturday Night Live '' -LRB- 16 -RRB- and `` 30 Rock '' -LRB- 13 -RRB- ; and FOX 's `` Glee '' -LRB- 12 -RRB- . Still , it 's hard not to notice the lack of major network dramas in that list .

For some perspective , here is a breakdown of the most nominated networks for the 2011 Emmy Awards :

HBO : 104

NBC : 46

Fox : 42

ABC : 40

ReelzChannel : 10

Major network nominations total 188 , while cable television nominations earned a grand total of 271 . PBS received 43 nominations .

Also , for the most part , cable series have shorter seasons than those on major networks . They usually run 10 to 13 episodes , as opposed to network television 's 23 episodes a season .

Shorter seasons tend to mean tighter storytelling and less `` filler '' episodes . -LRB- `` Desperate Housewives , '' we are looking at you . -RRB-

A perfect example of this is AMC 's dramatic series `` The Killing , '' which based its entire short season on one murder . Every episode of `` The Killing '' had the viewer glued to the small screen , thanks to the show 's tight storytelling , outstanding acting and production qualities . It is much easier to keep a narrative interesting over 13 shows -LRB- without having to include unnecessary storyline filler -RRB- as opposed to a typical network season of 22 shows .

While a longer season is perfect for procedural dramas like `` CSI , '' `` Criminal Minds '' and `` Law & Order : SVU , '' shows that rely heavily on episodic storytelling have huge advantages with a shorter season .

Another thing cable networks are doing extremely well is delivering shows with outstanding production values . Shows featured on HBO and AMC often have lavish , visually striking sets that could easily be the backdrop of a major motion picture .

Last but not least , cable networks are blessed with the freedom to program to a niche audience . Network programming has been forced to cast a wider net , playing to the lowest common denominator . For instance , ABC 's forthcoming remake of `` Charlie 's Angels '' is a show that viewers would probably never see on an AMC network because of the pure fluff factor . Typically , cable networks tend to focus on producing intelligent shows that do n't necessarily rely on gimmicks like the expected jiggle factor on a show like `` Charlie 's Angels . ''

Other networks need to look to `` The Good Wife '' and start taking more risks . One may argue that there is something for everyone on television these days . However , I 'd like to see more shows in the vein of HBO 's `` Boardwalk Empire '' gracing the television landscape , as opposed to more reboots like CBS 's `` Hawaii Five-O '' and shows like the NBC dramedy `` Harry 's Law .
