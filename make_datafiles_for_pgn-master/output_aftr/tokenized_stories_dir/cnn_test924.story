Inter Milan had closed the gap to one with that 3-1 win seven days ago , but the pressure is back on for Sunday 's trip to mid-table Atalanta .

Juve striker Fabio Quagliarella followed up his midweek goal against the Danish side with a hat-trick , while Sebastian Giovinco was also again on target .

Arturo Vidal , who scored against both Inter and Nordsjaelland , opened proceedings to score for his fourth successive match while Kwadwo Asamoah netted an overhead kick in a first half that featured six goals -- one of them to Pescara 's Emmanuel Cascione .

In Saturday 's other Serie A match , Catania moved up to seventh after a 0-0 draw at 10th-placed Cagliari .

France star Franck Ribery netted the opener just before halftime and Austria midfielder David Alaba added a penalty as the Bavarian side followed up the midweek Champions League thrashing of Lille .

Schalke stayed second after a 2-1 win over Werder Bremen , while two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund won 3-1 at Augsburg to remain fourth as Poland striker Robert Lewandowski netted twice .

Real Zaragoza beat Deportivo La Coruna 5-3 , sealed by two late goals from Portugal forward Helder Postiga , to leave the visitors third from bottom .

Celta Vigo remained above Deportivo on goal difference alone after a 3-2 defeat at Rayo Vallecano that pushed the home side up to seventh .

Osasuna stayed at the foot of the table despite winning 3-0 at second-bottom Espanyol .
