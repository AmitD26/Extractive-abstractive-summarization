As NBC celebrates ratings success with the Summer Games -- and weathers the shouts of #NBCfail from the critical -- it 's also staring down the onset of fall TV season , that post-Labor Day flood of returning prime-time staples and new programming .

In an attempt to rise above the swell and pick up as many viewers as possible , NBC 's getting a jump-start on the competition and offering advance screenings of two new comedies following its Olympic coverage as well as two-week `` sampling '' windows on a variety of platforms for all its fall pilots ahead of their premieres .

The idea -- to secure viewership before a show premieres -- is n't a new strategy , and NBC 's not the only network employing it . Fox , for example , has used pre-premiere sampling in the past to promote `` Glee '' and `` New Girl , '' and the network 's doing the same again at the end of this month by offering a two-week window to watch pilots for `` The Mindy Project '' and `` Ben and Kate '' online ahead of their September premieres .

But at the moment , Fox does n't have the viewership that NBC has -- on Monday night , 26.6 million were tuned in to NBC during prime time -- nor does it have a reputation of poorly received fall seasons past to shake off . NBC 's chairman of entertainment , Robert Greenblatt , reportedly told press at the recent Television Critics Association tour the brand 's in a period of transition after being in last place since the ' 03 - '04 season , and is trying to stretch toward content with broader appeal .

To that end , no one 's batting an eyelash that NBC is trying to capitalize on this sizable audience , but whether the efforts will pay off is up for debate . One potential kink is a question of timing , and whether TV-deluged audiences , more accustomed to on-demand versus appointment viewing , will remember to tune in a month . The answer to that , of course , will be compounded by the other question at hand , that of quality .

`` After a while , it 's difficult to get momentum again , '' Young said . `` They 've tried to do quality shows . ` Parenthood ' is a quality show , ` Friday Night Lights ' was a high-quality show , but they somehow just lost traction with viewers , and they have to do something to try to get people back into the tent . ''

Wednesday night will bring a look at Matthew Perry 's `` Go On , '' a darker comedy about a radio sportscaster who joins a group therapy session after his wife dies . After the Games ' closing ceremony Sunday , there 'll be a viewing of `` Animal Practice '' in which Justin Kirk plays a womanizing veterinarian who 's not that into people but does have a monkey sidekick .

Perry 's `` Go On , '' while not a favorite , was more fully formed . `` For all of NBC 's desires to sort of tack toward the middle , it 's a very dark show , '' McGee said . `` I have no problem with drama in comedy . ... There 's a lot of space in the half-hour medium to do different things . But people think 30 minutes and they think , if I did n't laugh the whole time this was n't a successful episode of television . I do n't know how -LRB- ` Go On ' -RRB- will play after the shot put . ''

Regardless , `` They 'd be foolish not to try , '' said Bill Gorman of TVBytheNumbers.com , although he hastened to add , `` I just do n't think it 's going to have that much of an effect . ''

The concept for this year 's strategy has been evolving since 2011 , with NBC aware that the Olympics will bring viewers who are fans of the sporting event but who may not regularly watch the network .

`` We 're doing everything we can to get things out there . It 's been a shift in thinking since Bob Greenblatt came aboard , '' NBC exec Sanders said . `` These days you have to do it all . ... When you 're competing with four other networks and there 's 15 new shows all premiering within one week , it becomes very difficult to get attention and , in some cases , convince people to check out your show , whether it 's a new show or a show that they 're loyal to . We 're really hoping that by doing this not as a traditional launch , but just as a chance to get people to sample the shows , that we 're getting to have a leg up on our competitors , perhaps , and to have a leg up on a more traditional launch . ''

`` There 's really no need for a fall season anymore , '' said TV critic and NPR contributor David Bianculli of TVWorthWatching.com . `` That started so car companies could roll out their new car advertisements , and that 's not happening . The British model of shows that have like , 10 episodes a season , seems to be much smarter in terms of getting good talent and good scripts , but it 's not a model that has worked economically for the States yet . ''

Networks and newspapers , he added , are having `` the same problems right now . They 're desperate for the viewers and readers that they do n't have . They do n't know how to get them , but in trying to attract them , they 're alienating the people that they do have . I think they were trying for young , hip viewers with shows like `` Community , '' which certainly increased their Web presence and their presence in social media , but it did n't pay off in ways that counted , or at least still count for the networks . ''

`` Right now it 's ` The Office , ' ` Parks and Recreation ' and ` Community , ' '' but if you ask the broader contingent what 's on NBC , `` they 're going to say ` Law & Order : SVU ' and ` The Biggest Loser , ' '' which is problematic considering how well the other networks have shaped their content .

`` As for these -LRB- new -RRB- shows , we 're hoping that they 're going to be just as smart , just as funny and insightful , and we 're hoping that they 're going to be instantly accessible to the audience , '' he continued . `` The big shift that I 've felt in the development and the attention in these new shows is just making sure we 're adding an extra dollop of heart . ''
