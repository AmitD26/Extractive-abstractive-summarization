Some natural gas still is flowing to nearby power plants but gas exports to Europe stopped shortly after the revolution began . By the water 's edge you can see the gas pipeline behind a fence , curving down like the crook of an arm and disappearing into the earth . From here it stretches 330 miles under the Mediterranean Sea to Sicily , providing gas for Italy . The company is hoping it can restart gas supplies before the European winter sets in .

The facilities of other Libyan oil companies , he says , may have been damaged , especially ports and terminals . Some fields have been hit by vandalism .

There are other challenges , including bringing back on-line equipment that has sat idle for more than half a year .

For Mellitah , Karim says , getting workers back on the job is the first challenge .

`` You have to first bring back the people to the field . This is the starting point . Without people in the field you can not do anything , '' he says . `` Having the workers back in the field requires some logistics support from an accommodation point of view , catering , transportation , all these kinds of supports . ''

Safety is another concern . At the complex , safety supervisor Abdulbaset Montaser instructs us to wear yellow safety helmets and hands us emergency masks in case of any danger . He quickly reassures us : `` The system that we have here is a very good system and a high technology system , so for six years we do n't have any problem with that . We do n't have any explosion here . ''

Inside the control room workers watch computers monitoring every aspect of production . `` Please reduce the downstation steam , '' one engineer instructs over a radio .

A majority , 85 % , of Libya 's export of its high-quality , low-sulfur light sweet crude go to Western Europe , but oil experts say the country currently is producing only 10 % -15 % of its normal 1.6 billion barrels a day .

`` To reach the maximum of 1.6 million barrels per day , before the revolution started , that could happen anytime between a year or two years from now , '' Manouchehr Takin of the Centre for Global Energy tells CNN .

Walking alongside the intense blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea with Mellitah 's marine superintendant , Adel Sager , we gaze out at the now-empty pier where ships dock to load crude oil for export .
