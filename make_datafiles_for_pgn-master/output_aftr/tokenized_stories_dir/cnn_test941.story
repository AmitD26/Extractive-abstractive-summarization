-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The parents of a 15-year-old American girl are seeking to get their daughter back after she ran away with her boyfriend to Brazil , where authorities handed her over to the boyfriend 's family .

The Brazilian authorities ' decision to give custody of Samantha Hernandez to her boyfriend 's uncle , while a legal action against her goes through the system , has left her family and U.S. officials scratching their heads .

Because Samantha is a minor , she was transferred to the custody of Brazil 's civil police , which will investigate the crime . She was not immediately sent back to the United States because the crime she is accused of committing does not allow for immediate repatriation , the official said .

Instead , she was released to her boyfriend 's uncle , without any consultation with her parents in the United States , the father said .

Details about her boyfriend , his nationality and that of his uncle were not immediately known .

The office of Rep. Connie Mack , R-Florida , who represents the district where Robert Hernandez lives , said it has been in touch with the parties involved .

U.S. officials in Brazil are working closely with Brazilian officials and talking to Samantha and her family to provide assistance , said Heidi Arola , who is with the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro .

The father 's attorney , Albert Gayoso , told HLN 's `` Prime News '' that the U.S. State Department told the mother that U.S. officials conducted a `` wellness check '' on Samantha on Thursday , during which they took pictures of the girl and the house where she is staying .

Also , Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , has reached out to the family , his office said .

Robert Hernandez said he has considered going to Brazil himself to get his daughter , but said he could be breaking Brazilian law if he were to attempt to get his daughter back on his own .

`` We need the attention of the U.S. and Brazilian governments , '' Samantha 's mother , Joann Allard , said in statement . `` Samantha needs to be taken into custody and deported back to the U.S. immediately . ''

`` Honestly , we just want her to come home , '' Robert Hernandez said . `` I want her to really come to her senses and say , ` You know what , this was a mistake . ' ''

`` I definitely do not want to go back . I 'd rather jump off a bridge with sharks and piranhas in the water , with meat tied to my neck , than go back there , '' she said . `` Obviously , they do n't care how I feel . I 'm happy here . ''
