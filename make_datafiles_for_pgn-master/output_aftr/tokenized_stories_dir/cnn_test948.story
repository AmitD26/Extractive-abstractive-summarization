In 1989 , when New York feminist collective Guerrilla Girls began counting how many works in New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art were by women , less than 5 % of the artists in its Modern section were female .

The chief curators of MoMA , the Whitney , the Met , the Guggenheim and the Centre Pompidou are all female , as are the directors of Tate Britain and the Uffizi Gallery . The world 's biggest buyer of contemporary art , according to Art Newspaper is the Qatari royal family , whose purchases are directed by Sheikha Mayassa Al Thani .

`` It is better than it has ever been for women at the emerging level , '' says one of the founders of Guerrilla Girls , Frida Kahlo . But , she warns , `` when one travels up the art world ladder of success , there is a crushing glass ceiling . Women only get so far , especially at the level of economics . ''

Instead of being clumped around the bottom of the results table , four of the top 10 most expensive works were by women , including Japanese installation artist Yayoi Kusama , sculptors Louise Bourgeois and Lynda Benglis , and expressionist painter Helen Frankenthaler .

By medium

Frankenthaler 's inclusion is especially heartening because , with its centuries of tradition as the purview of men , gender bias seems more entrenched in painting than in other media .

When New York critic Jerry Saltz took up Guerrilla Girls ' cause in 2007 , criticizing MoMA 's male-heavy collection as tantamount to `` apartheid , '' he did note that it was exhibiting `` excellent groupings of work by women '' from its photography and drawing collections , and that `` the film-and-video and prints departments have long been virtually gender-blind . ''

That notion appears to be borne out by the entry of female art stars into the very uppermost echelons of printmaking , sculpture and photography . Until last November , Cindy Sherman held the record for creating the world 's most expensive photograph .

Simon Todd , British representative for Artnet , which provides pricing services for collectors , says when it comes to gauging the importance of women in the contemporary art market , auction turnover might not even tell the full story .

`` The majority of the best of British contemporary art does not have the opportunity to appear at auction -- it is sold through galleries , '' he says , noting that sculptor and Turner Prize winner Rachel Whiteread has 191 auction lots logged with Artnet , `` but the vast majority are multiple editions . ''

Three of Exhibition A 's top 10 sellers are women -- former Sonic Youth guitarist Kim Gordon , Julia Chiang , and Aurel Schmidt who sold out one edition in an hour . Co-founder Cynthia Rowley believes online sales `` bring the decision making to the public based on imagery , and away from the hands of the male-dominated traditional art world . ''

Paddle8 cofounder Aditya Julka says female artists make up around a quarter of Paddle 8 's sales activity , and has noticed particularly strong interest in established artists such as Cindy Sherman , Cecily Brown and Michalene Thomas . While Art.sy is still in beta mode , it says nearly half of its sales so far have been of works by female artists .

Getting collected , displayed , reviewed

Solo shows , when a gallery throws a great deal of its resources and floor space behind a single name , are one way to gauge the esteem in which an artist is held .

And , besides touting emerging and established female artists , it also manages to include a healthy number of women in its retrospectives : Eight of the 23 artists -LRB- 35 % -RRB- in a current exhibition about the 1970s and '80s Bowery scene are female .

`` When I do my year 's program , I never check if it 's half women , half men , '' she says , `` but if I check it through the years , it 's even , intuitively . I had one year when everyone was telling me ` What a great program , all these fantastic women . ' I did n't do it on purpose . For me , it 's organic . ''

If lingering economic disparity remains at auction , Munder says it is not something preoccupying today 's female artists , many of whom consider themselves post-feminist .

`` They know the importance of it but they do n't like to stress it anymore , because if you stress it , it opens up that something 's missing , '' she says . `` They just want to play the game on the same level , and you can only play the game on the same level if you do n't unmask that something 's missing . ''

`` Marlene Dietrich , Martina Navratilova and Madonna acted this way and have been interesting role models in this . ''
