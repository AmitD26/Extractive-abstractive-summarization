-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While the Academy gets ready to crown the best films of the past year , we 've got something else for your consideration . From `` The Avengers 2 '' to `` World War Z , '' CNN Entertainment presents your guide to the biggest , best and buzziest movies of 2013 .

Comic Book Heroes

Comic book franchises will be flying by us faster than a speeding bullet this year , from a reboot of the Superman series -LRB- replacing Brandon Routh from `` Superman Returns '' with Henry Cavill for `` Man of Steel '' June 14 -RRB- to the set-in-Japan `` The Wolverine '' July 26 to `` Thor : The Dark World '' November 8 .

`` Great '' Books

Young Adult

With no more `` Harry Potter '' or `` Twilight , '' movie studios have been scrambling to create new teen-oriented franchises , and only `` The Hunger Games '' has caught fire so far . The second installment of the series , due November 22 , just wrapped shooting in Hawaii -LRB- the new Game , featuring survivors of Games past , has a water-and-jungle theme -RRB- . Fans are eager to see Katniss ' wedding dress , the clock-structure of the arena and the confrontation with President Snow . -LRB- Not to mention some extra kissing this time around ! -RRB-

The latter two are good-versus-evil supernatural stories : `` Mortal Instruments '' is about half-angel demon hunters , or Shadowhunters , and `` Beautiful Creatures '' is about light and dark witches , or casters , who discover what they are during a ceremony at age 16 . `` We 've really loved everything we 've seen so far in the film , '' said `` Beautiful Creatures '' co-author Kami Garcia . Audiences will likely love Emmy Rossum 's take on the lollipop-wielding Ridley , who casts her siren spell with each lick .

The first nine minutes of `` Star Trek Into Darkness , '' out May 17 , are already showing in select theaters , which has amped up Trekkie speculation about plot points : Could this be a contemporary `` Wrath of Khan ? '' Will Benedict Cumberbatch 's mysterious `` John Harrison '' character become Khan ? Pointing in this direction is the casting of Alice Eve as Carol Marcus , Kirk 's long-lost love and inventor of the dangerously powerful Genesis device , which could turn uninhabitable worlds into class M planets suitable for humans but could also destroy all pre-existing life .

Alfonso CuarÃ ³ n 's `` Gravity , '' which features `` two people floating in space , '' as George Clooney put it , is also enticing . Clooney 's co-star is Sandra Bullock , who dominates the film , and together , they are the two survivors of a damaged space station . Reports from early test screenings suggest the film , out October 18 , is gorgeous and awe-inspiring , but also divisive along the lines of `` The Tree of Life . ''

2013 will see its fair share of familiar properties getting new life in the form of remakes and reboots . `` The Lone Ranger '' series -LRB- which has existed as radio and TV shows and several film incarnations -RRB- becomes a Gore Verbinski movie -LRB- out July 3 -RRB- with Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer aboard for a Tonto-centric story .

Tom Clancy-created CIA agent Jack Ryan has been played by Alec Baldwin , Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck , and now Chris Pine is getting his turn , with a release date set for December 25 .

Sissy Spacek hands the `` Carrie '' baton over to ChloÃ `` Grace Moretz on October 18 .

And Spike Lee 's American remake of the South Korean thriller `` Oldboy , '' out October 11 , stars Josh Brolin as an executive who has been mysteriously confined for years and is now freed , and sets out to find out who stole his life . Will there be any eating of live octopus like in the original ? They 're not saying , but producer Nathan Kahane promised other `` treats '' for fans . `` If you look carefully , you 'll see some of the cast from the original , '' he said .

Indie Darling

Ryan Gosling fans have three ways to see their favorite actor in 2013 : in `` Gangster Squad , '' `` Only God Forgives '' and `` The Place Beyond the Pines . '' The third of these , due March 29 , reunites Gosling with his `` Blue Valentine '' director Derek Cianfrance and kicked off his romance with co-star Eva Mendes . The movie has been getting rave reviews on the festival circuit , even if Gosling 's role as a motorcycle stunt rider who resorts to bank robbery sounds like a rehash of what he did in `` Drive . '' This time , however , it 's more of a family drama ; Gosling really only carries one third of the film . -LRB- Meanwhile , `` Only God Forgives '' is a reunion with his `` Drive '' director Nicholas Winding Refn , but has yet to screen -RRB- .

Seeking a Friend for the End of the World

There wo n't be a bigger zombie apocalypse than `` World War Z , '' and it 's got one of the biggest stars -LRB- Brad Pitt -RRB- to anchor it . Max Brook 's book featured interviews from various survivors of the Zombie War , which gave both a time line and a sensation of the global nature of the catastrophe . Pitt 's character has the unenviable job of tying up disparate storylines , but if anyone can do it , it 's him .

On the comedic side , it 's a toss-up between Seth Rogen 's directorial debut `` This Is The End , '' out June 14 , and Edgar Wright 's `` The World 's End , '' out October 25 .

Then , in the bound-to-be-self-referencing `` World 's End , '' Simon Pegg , Nick Frost and friends try to do a pub crawl on their last night alive . Fans of `` Shaun of the Dead '' and `` Hot Fuzz '' know this will be epic .

What is it with all the films this year about Earth becoming an inhospitable planet ? `` Elysium '' -LRB- starring Matt Damon , out March 1 -RRB- , `` Oblivion '' -LRB- starring Tom Cruise , out April 19 -RRB- , and `` After Earth '' -LRB- starring Will Smith , out June 7 -RRB- share common themes , but only the first two seem to blame rampant corporatization and wealth discrepancies instead of nature . `` After Earth '' focuses on survival ; `` Oblivion '' is about an underground resistance -LRB- led by Morgan Freeman -RRB- .
