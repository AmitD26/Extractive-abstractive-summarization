-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As a child , Lee Yoon Jung used to hide underground with her classmates when the sirens rang at her school . The emergency drills were held in case of a North Korean attack .

Lee , now 46 , has children of her own , who do not have such exercises at their schools in Ulsan , South Korea .

It represents the attitude shift over recent decades of tension between the two Koreas . South Koreans have become accustomed to living next to their northern neighbor , which often releases bellicose statements and calls it a `` group of puppet traitors . ''

`` Even though there are still many threats , very significant threats like nuclear weapons , we are quite used to those , '' said Lee , about her thoughts on the latest provocation from North Korea .

In South Korea , life carried on . For many people , domestic concerns far outweigh worries about inter-Korea relations .

`` South Korea is always dealing with North Korea , there are always reports in the South Korean media that North Korea is threatening this and that , '' said Karl Friedhoff , program officer of the Public Opinion Studies Center at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies based in Seoul . `` It 's a psychological thing where when you live under a constant threat , at some point you move on and it becomes life as usual . I think that 's what has happened . ''

The institute 's polls in South Korea indicate domestic concerns such as the economy and job creation heavily outweigh concerns about North Korea , even after a controversial rocket launch by Pyongyang in December that drew international condemnation .

Even if North Korea tests a nuclear weapon , Friedhoff does not expect it to raise concerns in South Korea .

North Korea 's failed missile launch `` did very little to move the needle on public opinion . Then , when it came to December , the thought was if this -LSB- launch -RSB- is successful , maybe that will do something . But it also did nothing to move the needle , '' he said , referring to the polls on public opinion .

`` If there is a nuclear test , I do n't anticipate that it 's going to have any effect either , '' Friedhoff added .

South Koreans tend to view North Koreans as a neighbor -LRB- 33 % -RRB- or as one of them -LRB- 32 % -RRB- , according to 2012 Asan Institute data . About 19 % said they considered North Koreans as enemies , 10 % as strangers and 6 % reported no interest , in a nationwide poll that included 2,000 South Koreans .

`` There 's some difference between other countries views and Koreans ' view about this recent North Korea nuclear provocation , '' said Yoon Dong Keun , a college student living near Seoul , who described heightened global concern outside of Korea . His friends received calls from their friends in the United States inquiring about their safety .

`` We ca n't say a North Korea -LSB- incident -RSB- will never happen , '' Yoon said .

North Korea 's rhetoric has fluctuated in recent weeks . At the beginning of January , the nation 's leader Kim Jong Un struck a conciliatory tone on relations with the South , saying that removing `` confrontation '' between the two sides would be important in bringing about their reunification .

South Koreans differentiate between the North Korean people and its leadership , Hong said .

`` Most of the Korean people do n't seem to think the North Korean people are the enemy , '' Hong said . They consider the government hostile to South Korea , he added .
