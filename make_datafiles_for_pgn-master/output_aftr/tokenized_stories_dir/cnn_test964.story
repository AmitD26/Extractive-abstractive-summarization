-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nineteen-year-old Sergio Peña is living his dream .

`` You know , to be a race car driver -- it almost does n't seem real , '' he said . `` It does n't seem like a job at all . It 's more like play to me . ''

Peña may say it feels like play , but his work ethic says otherwise .

`` He is a very methodical , very calculated race car driver , '' said Kip Childress , director of NASCAR 's K&N Pro Series East . `` Sergio is a driver that uses a whole lot of thought behind the steering wheel . ''

Peña is from Virginia and is a first generation Colombian American . His love for racing started at age 4 when his father bought him a dirt bike .

Jai Peña saw early on that there was no turning back . `` He loved it from day one , '' his father said .

Jai Peña bankrolled his son 's efforts for many years . He estimates he spent more than $ 1 million funding this son 's dream of making it to the big time .

`` I would n't change a thing , '' he said . `` The economy is tough , but if I had to do it again , I think I would do it again . ''

The sport of NASCAR is one that calls for major financial backing from sponsors in order for racers to have a legitimate chance to compete at a high level .

NASCAR has at times been criticized for not doing enough to recruit minorities . The sport has made strides in recent years to remedy that problem , most notably through its `` Drive for Diversity '' program , which began in 2004 .

The program looks for `` marketable minority and female drivers with racing experience at the grassroots level , '' according to its website . More than 200 drivers apply to the program each year , and six to 10 are selected , the website says .

With a major sponsor and team behind him , Peña 's skills have become more refined . Last year was a breakout year of sorts for him . He finished the year tied for most wins in the K&N Pro Series East and came in fifth overall in points .

`` Sergio has done quite a bit of work , as well , and he has to perform , '' Childress said . `` Sergio has been able to get the job done on the race track . ''
