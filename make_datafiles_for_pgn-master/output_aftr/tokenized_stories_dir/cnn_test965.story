Los Zetas , arguably the most violent Mexican drug cartel , are headquartered in Nuevo Laredo , which sits directly across the border from Laredo , Texas . The group has operations in at least 11 Mexican states and has been in a bloody turf war in northeast Mexico with the rival Gulf Cartel for the last several years .

In late 2011 , the Texas Department of Public Safety warned against holiday travel to Nuevo Laredo , citing information that the Zetas may be targeting U.S. citizens .
