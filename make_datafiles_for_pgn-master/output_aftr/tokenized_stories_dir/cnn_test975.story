With that in mind , the federal government on Tuesday asked automakers to equip cars with devices that require only fleeting glances to operate , instead of prolonged stares .

Time-consuming functions -- such as text messaging and Internet browsing -- should be allowed only when a car is stopped and in park , the Department of Transportation said .

Drivers should not be allowed to text or browse even at slow speeds because of the danger it presents to pedestrians , the DOT said .

The guidelines , said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood , `` balance the innovation consumers want with the safety we all need . ''

Some 3,000 people were killed and 387,000 injured in 2011 in accidents involving distracted drivers , he said .

The new guidelines , which came after months of review , give automakers guidance about a wide range of electronic equipment installed in new automobiles , but considered `` secondary '' to the job of driving .

They include communications devices , such as hands-free phones , navigation equipment , such as GPS units , entertainment devices , such as DVD movie players , and information gathering devices , such as internet-enabled devices .

LaHood and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief David Strickland said a new NHTSA study showed that `` visual-manual tasks '' associated with hand-held phones and other portable devices increase the risk of getting into a crash by three times .

Researches used video-cameras to study 204 drivers for an average 31 days . The study showed that drivers talked on a cell phone 10.6 percent of the time the vehicle was in operation .

It says the guidelines are voluntary -- instead of mandatory -- because of the `` need for additional research on distraction and its effects on driving '' and because of the rapid changes in technology .
