-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A German opera house forced to ditch its Holocaust-themed staging of a Wagner opera after it horrified the opening night audience said Friday that the decision to perform it only as a concert had gone down well with the public .

The concert version of the production , featuring only the orchestra and singers , was performed at the Oper Am Rhein in Duesseldorf for the first time Thursday night .

But , it said , the effects had gone beyond controversy , with `` some scenes , especially the firing-squad sequence , which was staged with drastically realistic force '' apparently proving an `` intolerable burden for numerous members of the audience , '' both mentally and physically .

As a result `` they were subsequently obliged to undergo medical treatment , '' it said .

German newspaper Der Speigel said in its English-language version that the production depicted `` the character Tannhauser as a Nazi war criminal and it even included a gas chamber on stage . ''

A spokesman for Oper Am Rhein , Daniel Senzek , told CNN Friday that many people had appreciated the decision to stage the production as a concert only .

Some people have requested refunds for their tickets , Senzek said , but was unable to give exact numbers . Other people bought tickets especially to see the concert version of the performance Thursday , he added .

Oper Am Rhein said it had tried to negotiate with Kosminski over his staging after the disastrous premiere but he refused to modify his concept `` for artistic reasons . ''

Tannhauser , which had its world premiere in 1845 , is usually seen as a romantic work combining mythology and history .
