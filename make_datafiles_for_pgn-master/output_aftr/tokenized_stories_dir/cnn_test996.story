-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pop-cultural suburbia : Take your pick .

Happy children . Low taxes . Smooth roads . Picture windows . Quiet streets . Shopping malls .

Or : Bored teenagers . Sterile sprawl . Endless traffic . Creepy neighbors . Festering secrets . Shopping malls .

Why such a divide ?

The suburb `` was touted as the perfect way to package American life in the utopian era that we expected the end of World War II to bring us , '' he says . `` We 're in the Space Age . Television comes out . Air conditioning and dishwashers and all of this stuff . The suburbs stood for the place where this perfect kind of life was going to be lived . ''

The future originally looked something like the past . Tired of six-story walkups ? In the suburbs you could have your own picket-fenced home , just like the ones in small towns of yore . Sick of the subway ? In the suburbs you could ride the comfortable commuter train -- or , even better , travel to work on a speedy expressway in your very own car .

Television was the best mirror of this optimistic age . Mayfield 's Cleavers -LRB- `` Leave It to Beaver '' -RRB- , Springfield 's Andersons -LRB- `` Father Knows Best , '' less biting than the radio version -RRB- and Hilldale 's Stones -LRB- `` The Donna Reed Show '' -RRB- all lived in crime-free municipalities urban enough to have the latest appliances -LRB- like , well , a television -RRB- but removed enough that their kids could play and bike without those crowded city worries -- like traffic , ethnic groups and the poor .

In this period , it was writers who poked holes in suburban perfection . John Cheever , with his quietly desperate New York escapees , was the master of suburban dissatisfaction , but others -- novelist Richard Yates -LRB- `` Revolutionary Road '' -RRB- and journalist Vance Packard -LRB- `` The Status Seekers '' -RRB- among them -- took aim at the consumerist society entwined with suburbia . On TV , only `` Twilight Zone 's '' Rod Serling -- at heart , a writer -- seemed to agree with them .

These days , the pop culture divide still holds . To some -- Woody Allen comes to mind -- the city , for all its faults , is vibrant and lively , and the suburbs are `` American Beauty '' dead ends . To others , particularly television producers , it 's the suburbs -- where most of us live , after all -- where real life happens , and the city is something for the wealthy , the terminally hip , the criminals and the tourists .

The truth , of course , is neither here nor there . Today 's suburbs are increasingly multicultural and , in some cases , have developed their own skyscraper-filled `` edge cities , '' in the term popularized by journalist Joel Garreau . Accurately portraying such a complex environment is as difficult as accurately portraying the people who live there -- though there are some -LRB- author Tom Perrotta , `` My So-Called Life '' producers Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick -RRB- who try .

In the end , suburbia is what our imagination wants it to be , and it wo n't quite fit into those little boxes of ticky-tacky .
