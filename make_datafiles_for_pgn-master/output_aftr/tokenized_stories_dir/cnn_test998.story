Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After agreeing in principle to hold talks on reopening their joint industrial complex , North and South Korea are haggling over the date and time of the potential meetings .

The North broke the impasse between the two sides over the Kaesong Industrial Zone -- a major symbol of cooperation between the two countries where Pyongyang halted activity in April -- by issuing a proposal on Thursday for talks .

South Korea reacted quickly and positively to the offer , noting that it had been `` continuously '' seeking talks on Kaesong since the North shut it down . The South 's unification minister , Ryoo Kihl-jae , suggested the two sides hold ministerial-level talks in Seoul on Wednesday .

It also said it would meet a request from the South to reopen on Friday the Red Cross liaison channel in the border area of Panmunjom , an important line of communication between the two sides that the North cut off as tensions flared earlier this year .

South Korean officials did n't immediately respond to the North 's latest statement Friday .

The shuttered Kaesong complex is one of the main casualties of the recent period of fiery threats and provocative moves by North Korea .

In early April , Kim Jong Un 's regime began blocking South Koreans from entering the manufacturing complex , which sits on the North 's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies .

Pyongyang then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone 's factories , saying it was temporarily suspending activity there . The last South Koreans in the zone left last month .

The North Korean decision to halt operations surprised some observers , since Kaesong was considered an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un 's regime .

The proposal for talks regarding the complex indicates that `` maybe the cost of closure of Kaesong is greater than they had anticipated , '' said Daniel Pinkston , a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia .

At the same time , Pinkston said , North Korea 's key ally , China , which has expressed displeasure with some of Pyongyang 's recent behavior , may not have been `` as generous as the North Koreans have been expecting in terms of aid , assistance , trade and investment . ''

The North Korean proposal did not , however , mention anything about the North 's controversial nuclear and missile programs , which lie at the heart of the tensions surrounding North Korea .

Kim Jong Un 's regime chose a symbolic date on which to make its offer of talks . June 6 is Memorial Day in South Korea , when citizens commemorate those killed while fighting to protect the country , including during the Korean War in the early 1950s .
