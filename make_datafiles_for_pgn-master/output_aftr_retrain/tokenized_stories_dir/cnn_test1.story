Sheridan is asking for $ 5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry , although the actress was paid $ 4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series .

Baute called Cherry a `` really obvious liar '' who was covering up the real reason he killed off Edie Britt , the sassy blonde character Sheridan played for the show 's first five seasons .

He accused other ABC employees of conspiring to cover up evidence that it was a revenge firing in order to protect a show that has earned over $ 1 billion in eight seasons .

Cherry and ABC claim they decided Britt would die in season five in May 2008 , four months before the incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan .

Baute told jurors that there were `` no notes , no calendar , no documents , '' supporting that claim , except for a writer assistant 's notes that he accused the defense of fabricating and backdating .

Cherry and ABC executives testified they did not write e-mails because they wanted to keep the decision a secret .

`` It 's not a ` Navy SEAL Team Six how are we going to kill Osama bin Laden ' decision , '' Baute told jurors , questioning the need for such secrecy .

Defense lawyer Adam Levin , in his closing , said the plaintiffs were asking jurors to accept a `` complicated story of conspiracy , '' while the reality is much simpler .

Levin also pointed to three former show writers who each testified of hearing the plan to kill off Britt in writer meetings in May and June 2008 .

One former show writer called as a witness by Sheridan 's lawyer testified that she did not hear about the plan until later in the year , after the hitting incident .

On Tuesday , the show 's set construction coordinator testified that he received an e-mail that suggested a `` conspiracy to cover up '' information regarding Sheridan 's lawsuit .

`` It was my understanding that they were going to delete e-mails from the hard drives , '' Reinhart said about the e-mail he received in fall 2010 , soon after Sheridan filed her lawsuit .

He read the e-mail and immediately deleted it because he believed it was not intended for him , he said .

`` I honestly tried to put it out of my mind , '' he said , until this past weekend as he realized the Los Angeles trial was nearing an end .

`` I just wanted to make it equal for both sides , '' he said .

Under cross-examination by Cherry 's lawyer , Reinhart said Sheridan 's lawyer suggested he could help him find a job if ABC fired him . Baute denied that outside the courtroom .

The defense later called Jean Zoeller , ABC 's chief litigation lawyer , to testify that she sent memos to every employee connected to the case instructing them to save all their electronic documents . Asked if she asked anyone to delete e-mails , she said , `` Absolutely not . ''

The defense won one victory Tuesday when the judge issued a directed verdict dismissing Sheridan 's battery claim against Cherry . Sheridan 's lawyer downplayed the significance of that decision , saying the damages could have only been $ 1 and jury deliberations will be simplified without it .

`` You hit me , I complained and you fired me for it , '' Baute said , giving a thumbnail description of Sheridan 's case .

Five months and 11 episodes later , Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day , ending her five-year run on `` Desperate Housewives . ''

ABC Entertainment is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate Sheridan 's accusation that Cherry hit her , and then agreed with his decision to fire her .
