Westminster , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The arraignment of Catherine Kieu Becker , the Southern California woman accused of cutting off her husband 's penis and throwing it into a garbage disposal , was continued Friday to September 23 at the request of her public defender .

Orange County Superior Court Judge Debra Carrillo also set bail at $ 1 million for Becker , 48 , who had been held without bail since her arrest this month . She is charged with torture and aggravated mayhem .

Bittar also argued that the media coverage could lead to threats against Becker while in jail , but the judge said authorities are n't aware of any such threats .

When she entered the courtroom inside a defendants ' cage , Becker draped her long black hair over her face to hide from cameras . She was shackled and dressed in a blue jumpsuit .

Though authorities said she speaks English , a translator spoke to her in Vietnamese during the court proceedings .

If convicted on all counts , she would face a maximum sentence of life without the possibility of parole , prosecutors said .

An initial police investigation alleged that Becker , of Garden Grove , California , put a drug or poison in her 60-year-old husband 's dinner on July 11 to make him sleepy .

Becker told authorities her husband `` deserved it '' when officers arrived at the scene after she called 911 , the police report says .

The couple married in December 2009 , but separated in April . The husband filed for divorce on May 16 in Orange County Superior Court , citing `` irreconcilable differences , '' according to the divorce papers .

They have no children , and their only shared assets are a condominium and a 2010 Toyota Prius , court papers said .

Becker then took the penis to the kitchen , threw it into the garbage disposal and turned it on , `` mutilating the organ , '' the prosecutors ' statement said .

The husband underwent emergency surgery at UC Irvine Medical Center , authorities said . He has since returned home , but prosecutors were n't commenting on the husband 's condition out of respect for his privacy .

The Orange County case has been widely compared to the1993 attack against John Wayne Bobbitt by his then-wife , Lorena , who cut off his penis with an 8-inch carving knife while he slept .

Lorena Bobbitt then drove away , tossing the penis out her car window . The penis was eventually found and surgically reattached .

Lorena Bobbitt was later found innocent by reason of insanity . During her testimony , she tearfully described her life at the hands of her abusive husband .

In a separate trial , John Wayne Bobbitt was acquitted of sexually assaulting his wife . He later made appearances on `` The Howard Stern Show . '' He also made a number of adult films .
