Quite the opposite . The 25-year-old is a lean , mean , riding machine . And this Saturday she plans on wrapping those tender palms around the most coveted trophy in U.S. horse racing .

Could this be the first female to win the Kentucky Derby in the 139-year history of the race ?

`` I 'm very physically fit . I 'm strong . I 'm not just a little string bean female that weighs 100 pounds -- and that 's why I ride horses , '' she told CNN .

`` I think my horse Mylute is going to be a live longshot . He 's very laid back , he 's not bothered by much , so the crowds should n't get to him -- he 's definitely the type of horse that you want to have in a race like this . ''

Gender game

The young woman from New Jersey is n't just the most successful female jockey in the country -- she 's one of the best jockeys full stop .

Napravnik is the fifth-highest earning jockey on the circuit today , last year amassing a fortune of more than $ 12.4 million in prize money .

Not that Napravnik is immune to playing on her gender to help raise her profile in this male-dominated sport .

`` For a female jockey it 's a little bit harder to get yourself established . But once you can get over that hump and prove that you 're a competitive rider , and win races , it 's irrelevant what gender you are , '' she said .

Childhood dreams

But it was n't until she stumbled across an old video of the Triple Crown as a youngster , that she discovered racing .

`` I was just inspired by it and that 's when I decided I wanted to win the Triple Crown . ''

At seven-years-old , Napravnik followed her older sister into pony racing -- seen as a training ground for wannabe jockeys .

`` Learning how to ride when I was so young , learning how to communicate with horses , has given me a great foundation in horsemanship , '' she said .

`` It 's a stereotype to say that all female riders are finesse riders . A lot are . But there are also men that have that finesse factor as well . ''

Dedication

She 's suffered five major accidents and taken a total 15 months off work due to injuries . But the talented young rider shrugs off the risks as just a part of the job .

`` I do n't think about the danger factor , '' she said . `` It 's something I 've had a lot of experience in and I try to avoid it as much as I can .
