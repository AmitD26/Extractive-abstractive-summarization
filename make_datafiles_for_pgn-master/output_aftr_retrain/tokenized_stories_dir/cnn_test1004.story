Last month , Google announced the new policy , which spells out how the company will collect and compile information to create a profile of users based on their activity across all of its various sites and tools . That includes Google search , Gmail , the Google + social site and phones running its Android operating system .

Privacy advocates objected to the policy -- which is set to go into effect March 1 . Eight members of Congress , both Democrats and Republicans , wrote their own letter to Page , asking for clarification about the changes .

In Wednesday 's letter , the state attorneys called the policy `` troubling for a number of reasons , '' saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others .

`` Consumers have diverse interests and concerns , and may want the information in their Web History to be kept separate from the information they exchange via Gmail , '' they said . `` Likewise , consumers may be comfortable with Google knowing their Search queries but not with it knowing their whereabouts , yet the new privacy policy appears to give them no choice in the matter , further invading their privacy . ''

`` Our updated Privacy Policy will make our privacy practices easier to understand , and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our signed-in users , '' a Google spokesman said in a written statement . `` We 've undertaken the most extensive notification effort in Google 's history , and we 're continuing to offer choice and control over how people use our services services . Of course we are happy to discuss this approach with regulators globally . ''

They are `` trying to make them simpler and more understandable , which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do , '' he wrote . `` By folding more than 60 product-specific privacy policies into our main Google one , we 're explaining our privacy commitments to users of those products in 85 % fewer words . ''

That was n't enough for the attorneys general . They singled out users of Android phones , which make up about 50 % of the U.S. smartphone market , saying they wo n't be able to `` opt out '' without buying a new phone .

`` No doubt many of these consumers bought an Android-powered phone in reliance on Google 's existing privacy policy , which touted to these consumers that ` We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent , ' '' the letter said .

`` That promise appears not to be honored by the new privacy policy . ''
