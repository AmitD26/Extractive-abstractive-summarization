And , last week , Politico reported :

`` White House Press Secretary Jay Carney downplayed a report that Chinese hackers had infiltrated a secure national security network used to control nuclear codes , saying the perpetrators breached an ` unclassified ' system .

But as we live more and more of our lives online , and as basic needs such as electricity , water supply , transportation and communication depend increasingly on digital commands , the distinction is rapidly disappearing . Disrupt the digital world and you disrupt real lives -- you throw daily existence into uncharted territory .

After the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , we were told that there had been ample warning signs that went unheeded . If there ever is a concerted and darkly effective cyberattack on the United States -- one that robs millions of people of baseline necessities -- we wo n't be able to say that no one told us this might someday happen . We have been told , for years .

The concern appeared to be shared by people on both sides of the political aisle . At a 2004 Senate subcommittee session , Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said : `` We do n't take cyberterrorism as seriously as we should . A terrorist could theoretically use a computer to open up floodgates of a dam , disrupt the operations of an aircraft control tower or shut down the New York Stock Exchange . ''

Republican Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona , at the same hearing , said : `` We 've seen reports that al Qaeda has explored the possibility of damaging some of our key computer systems , seeking to cripple electric power grids , transportation systems , even financial institutions . Just imagine what chaos would result if a cyberattack were coordinated with a more conventional strike , such as bombing a highly populated area and then tampering with emergency systems to thwart hospitals and first responders caring for wounded civilians . ''

FBI Director Robert S. Mueller , at a speech in San Francisco earlier this year , said : `` State-sponsored hackers are patient and calculating . They have the time , the money and the resources to burrow in , and to wait . They may come and go , conducting reconnaissance and exfiltrating bits of seemingly innocuous information -- information that in the aggregate may be of high value . ''

If your car wo n't start , you may feel qualified to pop open the hood and try to figure out how to fix it ; if your lights go out , you probably know where the fuse box is . Digital outages are more mysterious ; when systems go dead , there is a feeling of low-grade helplessness , but usually the confidence that someone , somewhere , is working to bring them back to life .

Thus , the specter of some future cyberattack is troubling precisely because most of us have little sense of how we would individually combat such an incident . Even the terminology is open to dispute . The other afternoon I reached Internet security expert Bruce Schneier in London , where he was attending a conference . I knew he was skeptical about what he considers the inflation of language surrounding computer-based threats , especially terms like `` cyber warfare . ''

`` War is bombs dropping on you , '' he told me . `` War is tanks in your city . War is not your computer being hacked . In any war , there will be a cyberspace component . Wars are fought on all fronts . And cybercrime -- crime -- happens a lot . But that is not war . ''

`` The top American military official responsible for defending the United States against cyberattacks said Thursday that there had been a 17-fold increase in computer attacks on American infrastructure between 2009 and 2011 , initiated by criminal gangs , hackers and other nations .

It may all be cyber , but it 's starting to feel kind of real .

Bob Greene : Six banks apparently were hacked recently , cutting customer access to money

@highlight

He says for many `` cyber '' is like `` virtual '' -- intangible , not real . More and more , that 's not true

@highlight

He says as aspects of our lives bound to digital world , we 're vulnerable to cybercrime

Greene : Officials agree we 're inadequately protected , and cyberattacks are up . It 's real
