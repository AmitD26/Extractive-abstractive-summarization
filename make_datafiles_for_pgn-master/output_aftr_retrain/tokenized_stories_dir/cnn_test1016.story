Princeton , New Jersey -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The midterm campaigns will soon be under way . President Barack Obama has a few more months in the hot days of summer to get legislation through Congress , but representatives and senators will soon be focused on their campaigns with little thought for anything else .

On the other hand , if Democrats do well they can improve their standing in the House and place more pressure on Republicans to make compromises .

Besides the composition of Congress , the midterms will provide some insight into the challenges each party will face and what promises they might make in the 2016 presidential election .

The rebellion taking place within the GOP has been growing more intense . Many senior leaders are warning that their party is on a destructive path that will only lead to more rounds of defeat . Many Republicans privately agreed when former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole said the GOP ought to be `` closed for repairs '' until next year , and in the meantime , `` spend that time going over ideas and positive agenda . ''

The midterm elections will be the opportunity in the next two years for Republicans to show voters they have something more to say , and to offer two or three big ideas they can use in the race for the White House .

Democrats face a similar challenge . They need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post-Obama age . Many Democrats are wondering if the next election will be like 1988 , when Vice President George H.W. Bush campaigned on Ronald Reagan 's record and essentially promised to do more of the same , just in kinder and gentler fashion . Or will Democrats try to offer something more transformative -- a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008 ?

Voters want to hear what Democrats have to say about federal investments in the nation 's economic future , about how to handle climate change and how to build on Obama 's promise to restore the balance between law and civil liberties and homeland security . If Democrats can start developing ideas for the next candidate to run on , they could not only bolster their numbers on the Hill but strengthen the platform for the next crop of candidates to win over voters .

Finally , the midterms will offer a platform for future presidential candidates to show their stuff .

In 1966 , former Vice President Richard Nixon seized the national spotlight , campaigning for Republicans across the nation , and making it clear , through his fundraising and speeches that he was a formidable candidate who could take on Lyndon Johnson , or any other Democrat . This year , candidates from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will seek to use this moment , with the national spotlight turned on the political playing field , for the same advantage .

It will also be a chance for the parties to shake off some of the challenges that are holding them down , such as the right-wing drift of the GOP -- which could hurt the chances of the Republican candidates in 2016 , regardless of how charismatic and talented they are .
