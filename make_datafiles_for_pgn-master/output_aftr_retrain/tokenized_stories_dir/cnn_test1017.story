Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Justice Department is scrambling to meet a federal court 's Thursday deadline to answer fundamental constitutional questions dealing with the health care law championed by President Barack Obama , an escalating political battle that has embroiled all three branches of government .

This came after a federal judge appeared to be deeply concerned by the president 's comments this week , in which he challenged the high court not to take what he called an `` unprecedented '' step of overturning the law .

The White House tried to defuse the ideological firestorm , saying President Obama 's words were misunderstood .

The three judges are Republican appointees from the 5th Circuit U-S Court of Appeals , meeting in Houston . They were hearing a challenge to the health care law from physician-owned hospitals , despite the fact the Supreme Court is deciding the constitutional questions . The high court 's rulings expected in June would take precedence over any other courts hearing similar appeals .

The latest dispute surfaced Monday when the president said , `` I 'm confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress and I just remind conservative commentators that for years , what we 've heard is , the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint , that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law . ''

`` I 'm referring to statements by the president in the past few days to the effect , and I 'm sure you 've heard about them , that it is somehow inappropriate for what he termed ` unelected ' judges to strike acts of Congress that have enjoyed -- he was referring to , of course , Obamacare -- to what he termed broad consensus in majorities in both houses of Congress , '' said Smith .

Government lawyer Dana Lydia Kaersvang appeared initially taken aback , but replied such authority has existed for centuries .

The specific issue before the appeals court was a provision in the law restricting doctor-owned hospitals from expanding their facilities . The challenge was brought by an East Texas spine-and-joint hospital in East Texas .

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney , facing a flurry of reporter questions , said the president was articulating the view the high court has for 80 years generally deferred to congressional authority , specifically on economic legislation based on the Constitution 's Commerce Clause , and was not challenging the Supreme Court .

`` It 's the reverse of intimidation , he 's simply making an observation about the fact that he expects the court to adhere to that precedent , '' he said . `` It 's obviously , as he made clear yesterday , up to the court to make its determination , and we will wait and see that the court does . ''

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell accused the administration of trying to `` browbeat '' and `` intimidate '' the justices .

`` The president , more than anyone else , has an obligation to uphold the legitimacy of our judicial system , '' said the Kentucky Republican . `` But his remarks on the -LSB- Supreme -RSB- Court reflect not only an attempt to influence the outcome , but a preview of Democrat attacks to come if they do n't get their way . ''

Carrie Severino , chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network , said President Obama was out of bounds .

`` The president is tying to bully the court here , threatening them that if they do n't come down his way , they 're going to have the same thing that happened in the State of the Union address 2010 . He 's going to be calling them activists , he 's going to be saying they 're political . ''

The president two years ago attacked the conservative majority for striking down a campaign finance reform law , giving corporations greater power to spend in federal elections .

But some conservative legal sources privately expressed disappointment in the appeals court 's order , saying it appeared punitive and petty to demand the Justice Department defend a position it had never disputed in court .

The outcome of the cases have raised the stakes in a presidential year , and could have a lasting effect on the credibility of the federal courts , which are supposed to be beyond policies .
