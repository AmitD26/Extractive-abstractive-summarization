New Delhi , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Election results in four major Indian states Friday marked a momentous comeback for the country 's ruling Congress-led coalition , although it was undercut in one state by backlash against a graft-tainted coalition member .

In the eastern state of West Bengal , more than three decades of communist rule came to an end as the Congress alliance led by populist leader Mamata Banerjee won a landslide victory .

The Communist Party of India also lost its strong hold in the southern state of Kerala .

Analysts say the left 's Marxist economic policies seem increasingly outdated in the world 's second-fastest growing major economy .

Meanwhile , in the southern state of Tamil Nadu , the federal coalition was defeated as its key ally , the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam , lost its political monopoly .

The man at the center of the scandal , A. Raja , is a DMK member and former telecoms minister . He was arrested last month for his alleged involvement in the selling of telecom licenses at rock-bottom prices .

Tamil Nadu 's chief minister and the head of the DMK party , M. Karunanidhi , resigned after his party 's defeat .

`` For the longest time , local elections in India were fought along caste or religious issues , '' Nilotpal said . `` But now people are awakened , they are saying no to politicians or political families who have dominated for so many decades . ''

Analysts say these election results are crucial as the coalition will be in a better position to act on long-awaited reforms such as a new legislation on land acquisition . They say the regional elections could be considered a referendum ahead of the national elections in 2014 .
