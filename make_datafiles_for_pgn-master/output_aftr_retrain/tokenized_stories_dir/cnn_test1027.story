-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- In a close race that saw each of the top three films swap places between Friday and Sunday , animated smash `` Despicable Me 2 '' once again won the weekend at the box office .

`` Despicable Me 2 '' has easily asserted its dominance over Disney 's `` Monsters University '' in the last two weekends . Though `` Monsters '' has been in theaters twice as long -LRB- it opened June 21 -RRB- , its $ 237.8 million domestic total is only $ 8.6 million more than `` Despicable Me 2 . ''

In second place , Adam Sandler 's first-ever sequel , `` Grown Ups 2 , '' opened to a great $ 42.5 million . The $ 80 million Sony comedy started off slightly better than its 2010 predecessor , `` Grown Ups , '' which debuted with $ 40.5 million on the way to a $ 162 million domestic finish . If estimates hold up , `` Grown Ups 2 '' will stand as Sandler 's second-best opening ever behind 2005 ′ s `` The Longest Yard , '' which debuted to $ 47.6 million .

Review : `` Grown Ups 2 ''

Sandler has proven himself to be one of the most consistent box office draws in Hollywood over the last 15 years , during which time he has accrued 12 live-action hits that grossed more than $ 100 million , as well as the animated winner `` Hotel Transylvania , '' which topped out at $ 148.3 million .

But the film , like many others that have targeted geeky crowds , proved extremely front-loaded in its box office returns . After a $ 14.6 million Friday , `` Pacific Rim '' fell 13 percent on Saturday to $ 12.5 million , and Warner Bros. expects it will fall another 15 percent today to $ 10.9 million . If the film 's domestic total follows the same trajectory as its opening weekend , `` Pacific Rim '' will top out right at $ 100 million .

Review : `` Pacific Rim ''

`` Pacific Rim '' fared particularly well in 3-D , which accounted for 50 percent of its opening-weekend gross , the highest ratio all summer -LRB- though still a far cry from the 70 percent 3-D shares that were typical in 2009 and 2010 -RRB- . The film also played well in 331 IMAX theaters , where it earned $ 7.3 million -- a full 19 percent of its opening-weekend haul .

`` The Lone Ranger '' was n't so lucky . The $ 225 million Western , which last week stumbled with only $ 47.9 million in its first five days , plummeted 62 percent in its second weekend to $ 11.1 million , which gives the film $ 71.1 million and puts it on pace for a finish below $ 100 million . Despite `` The Lone Ranger 's '' disappointing run , a Disney exec this week said the studio remains committed to a `` branded tentpole strategy . ''

1 . `` Despicable Me 2 '' -- $ 44.8 million

3 . `` Pacific Rim '' -- $ 38.3 million

4 . `` The Heat '' -- $ 14 million

5 . `` The Lone Ranger '' -- $ 11.2 million

Two indie releases also made waves in limited release this weekend . Fox Searchlight 's `` The Way Way Back '' expanded into 79 theaters and grossed $ 1.1 million , giving it a robust $ 14,051 per theater average -- and guaranteeing that more theater owners will want to show the film on their screens soon .

`` Fruitvale Station 's '' performance was even more impressive . The film , which stars Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant , the 22-year-old Oakland resident who was detained and shot by a police officer in 2009 , earned $ 377,000 from only seven theaters , yielding a blazing $ 53,898 average .
