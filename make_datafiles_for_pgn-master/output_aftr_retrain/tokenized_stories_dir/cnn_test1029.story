-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I have interviewed Dominique Strauss-Kahn many times over the years , usually after an international summit or IMF meeting . The agenda at those interviews was the normal stuff of such events ; debt , deficits and dismal economic performance .

I worried Strauss-Kahn would be too timid in giving strong views on the eurozone crisis , its leaders and the problems facing the global economy .

After all , why should a man now regarded as an outcast of scandal be willing to offend people anymore , especially as he was looking to rehabilitate his image ?

On the eurozone , he is not afraid to describe the `` crises in leadership '' facing the union , where he says there are `` lions led by sheep . ''

During the interview , I realize I am speaking with a man who is free of responsibility and not really worried about treading on toes .

He knows his place in history will be forever defined by seven minutes in a hotel room in New York and his sexual liaison with a maid there .

I try to lighten the moment suggesting there 's no easy way to ask these questions . He recognizes my predicament and quips back : `` There 's no easy way to answer them . '' He is ready for what is coming his way .

His anger at being paraded in handcuffs before the world 's press is still palpable . `` A most terrible thing ... the perp walk takes place at the moment where you are supposed to be innocent , '' he told me . He maintains the events in Suite 2806 are `` private . ''

`` I agree , I agree , '' he tells me . He calls it a `` mistake '' to `` believe you could have a public life ... and that you can have a private life . ''

He added : `` I have a problem with understanding what is expected from politicians of highest levels . ''

For someone who has been in the public eye for several decades , this may seem a remarkable statement . But perhaps not for someone who has been in the cloistered environment of French politics , where private and public are clearly defined and mistresses and `` libertine soirees '' are ignored .

Listening to Strauss-Kahn talking about the economic dangers ahead is perhaps the most interesting of our time together .

The U.S. wants to `` dominate the world '' by setting the standards for trade with agreements both across the Pacific and Atlantic , he says . `` The Europeans should not be that naive . ''

I am not confident Europe will avoid this fate . Pulling together the strands of our talk , Strauss-Kahn has already said that the EU can not make a decent collective decision . He does n't take it this far , but I suspect he believes those sheep leading the union will lead to a trade slaughter .

Our agreed time of half an hour has passed far too quickly . I am left with the impression of a man who has discovered who his friends are and is now finding out what he wants to do next .

He says politics does not feature in that future . He is quite clear that he will not run for the French presidency . When asked , he says : `` No , no . '' It could not be clearer .

Strauss-Kahn is charming , witty , candid and perhaps cunning . He carries himself with the air of a man unafraid of his life 's next twist .
