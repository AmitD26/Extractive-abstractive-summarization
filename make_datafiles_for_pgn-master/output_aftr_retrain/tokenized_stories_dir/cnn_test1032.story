The NamUs Web site has helped in closing 147 missing persons cases and ID ` ing 149 decedents since its launch .

Decades earlier , on March 15 , 1967 , the remains of a woman clad in a blue dress and white shoes were discovered in a field in Baltimore , Maryland .

The two cases are separated by nearly 500 miles and more than 42 years , but authorities are hoping they can both be solved with the help of a federal database that went online this year .

The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System -LRB- http://www.namus.gov// -RRB- is designed to help law enforcement agencies and medical examiners across the country unravel the mysteries of cold cases involving missing persons and unidentified remains . It also gives countless families a place to look for loved ones and a chance to find answers and peace of mind .

Launched in January , the database was created after the Department of Justice was tasked with finding ways to help solve the thousands of missing persons and unidentified decedents cases in the United States , according to a statement on the Web site . It 's funded through a cooperative agreement from the National Institute of Justice , which is part of the Department of Justice 's Office of Justice Programs .

NamUs communications director Christine Vivian said the project `` was created to address the issue of the estimated 40,000 unidentified dead nationwide , and give families a tool to assist in finding missing adults . ''

`` As more cases are entered into the system , more people in every area -- law enforcement , victim advocacy and the general public -- can become part of the conversation that will resolve cases , '' Vivian told CNN in an e-mail .

NamUs is operated by the National Forensic Science Technology Center in Largo , Florida . It has two separate parts : a database of missing persons information containing 1,996 cases -- of which 147 have been closed -- and an unidentified decedent data system , which lists 5,569 cases . Of those , 149 people have been identified .

Hall was last seen wearing a red shirt , dark blue jeans and large hoop earrings . She has the name `` Willy '' tattooed on her left leg and another tattoo of a heart on her right arm .

Her case file is typical of thousands of other entries for both NamUs databases , which contain detailed information on physical characteristics , clothing , accessories , police reports , photographs and dental charting .

Young hopes that posting the man 's case on the Web site will provide answers to family or friends who may be searching for him .

`` It lets them know that someone is constantly looking for their loved ones and they are not being forgotten , '' he said . `` It gives them hope that one day they will be able to get closure . ''
