Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration is likely to come under new pressure to take more decisive steps in Syria following opposition claims that Bashar al-Assad 's government used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people .

While the regime denied the fresh accusations , the administration said it could not immediately verify the accuracy of newly released videos online purportedly showing civilians suffering from chemical agents outside Damascus .

Still , the images were searing and prompted the United States to seek an urgent U.N. investigation , demand accountability , and not rule out additional help .

Earnest added the administration has regularly considered increased aid for the rebels .

`` The conduct of this investigation , the results of this investigation or the efforts by the Assad regime to inhibit this investigation will certainly impact that calculation about possible additional aid , '' Earnest said .

Key questions would immediately surface if the latest troubling development from a region wracked by civil war for more than two years were to change the overall calculus for the United States .

What new steps would it take ? How would it address uncertainty about the rebel makeup ? And how would it approach what some believe is a worsening multidimensional trust gap on the issue of rebel assistance ?

`` It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor . Today , they are not , '' he said in the August 19 letter .

Inherent political mistrust amid sharp partisan divisions in Washington coupled with close congressional vetting also have influenced the response to Syria . Congress is currently on vacation until after Labor Day .

Also critically , mistrust cuts both ways .

`` Our credibility was n't high to begin with and obviously did n't improve with time , '' said David Lesch , Middle East history professor at Trinity University and author of `` Syria : The Fall of the House of Assad . '' `` They basically shrug their shoulders and say , ` Oh well , what is new ? ' They feel like they are on their own on this . ''

`` There is just a lack of knowledge of these groups , '' he said .

Last August , President Barack Obama said using those weapons would cross a `` red line '' and provoke a U.S. military response . His administration confirmed in June that chemical agents were used in April and it resulted in an uptick of military aid .

But the `` red line '' tag has seriously damaged U.S. credibility in the region , said Andrew Tabler , author of `` In the Lion 's Den : An Eyewitness Account of Washington 's Battle with Syria . ''

But in his letter , Dempsey warned that even limited military action in Syria could lead to deeper involvement -- a point the military has made previously . The administration has said it has no plans to put `` boots on the ground . ''
