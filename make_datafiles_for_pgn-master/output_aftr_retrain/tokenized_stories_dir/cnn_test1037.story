-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Triathlon has a reputation for being expensive . In fact , the perceived costs are enough to stop some prospective participants from taking up the challenge .

There 's no doubt that triathlons are harder on the bank balance than other sports , such as running , soccer , baseball or swimming . But believe me when I say that you do n't need to max out your credit card to do triathlon , to enjoy triathlon and even to succeed in triathlon .

In 2007 , I raced my first Ironman on a road bike -LRB- not the normal TT bike used for Ironman racing -RRB- with regular wheels . I borrowed my friend 's race kit , and wore a $ 20 pair of sunglasses I bought from a gas station in New Zealand three years prior to the race .

The most important investment you can make is in the form of hard work , drive and determination . The most important piece of equipment you can have is a huge heart . The most important weapon in triathlon is your mind .

10 ways to act like a champion

Having said that , it 's hard to compete in a bike ride without a bike . And race directors are not overly keen on your swimming , biking or running in your birthday suit . So here are a few items that every triathlete , budding or otherwise , needs to be able to train and race in this amazing sport :

Goggles : Leaky , ill-fitting goggles can cause panic and discomfort . If possible , try goggles on before you buy them . They should stay on your face , even without the strap . Your eyelashes should n't touch the lenses , and the nose piece should n't cut you like a knife . Slightly tinted goggles are best , as they are suitable for both cloudy and sunny conditions .

Swimcap : These are usually provided by race organizers , but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold .

Race day tips from an Ironman champ

Shoes : Whether you use regular or so-called clipless pedals -LRB- a bit of a misnomer , as you actually clip into them -RRB- will depend on your cycling experience and confidence . Your choice of pedal determines what shoes you wear . Cleated shoes -LRB- these lock onto the pedals -RRB- are definitely not essential for those new to cycling . With flat pedals you can use the same shoes for cycling and running .

Once you fall in love with the sport , and if your wallet can handle the pressure , you may want to add some optional extras or upgrade what you have .

But remember , it 's not all about the gear . It 's about the idea , the plan , the ambition ... . the dream .
