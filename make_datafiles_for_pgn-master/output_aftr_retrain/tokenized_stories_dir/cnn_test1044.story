Contestants practice for hours a day , and almost every season some celebs are brought low by injury . So how in the world will Valerie Harper , who just months ago announced that she had a terminal form of cancer , go for that mirror ball trophy ?

Apparently with the same spirit that caused the `` Rhoda '' actress to offer this up for fans :

`` I hope you dance ! I hope you dance , '' Harper told CNN on Wednesday . '' And that 's what I 'm saying to everybody , that 's just my message . Dance . ''

`` I have lung cancer , '' she said . `` It is situated in the lining of the brain ; it 's not even in the brain . ''

Her husband , Tony Cacciotti , encouraged her to sign on with the hit ABC dance competition , she said . He runs the couple 's production company and had been considering her participation for a few years .

The actress said she initially resisted the idea .

`` I said , ` Give me one good reason , ' '' Harper recalled . `` He said , ` You have cancer ! Get up there , and show people that you can dance and do -- and the doctors said it 's fine to exercise . Encourage people to move , to exercise , to do all the things that will be good for them , and mainly not to sit in the house and glower and worry and feel sorry for yourself because you have this disease and anything else . ' ''

Exercise is generally encouraged for patients , according to the American Cancer Society .

Actress Valerie Harper lives in the moment after cancer diagnosis

Harper , 74 , said she has been responding well to treatment , though she disputed reports she is in remission . Thinking about death makes everyone fearful , she said , `` and we gloss it over ; we pretend it 's not happening , that it 's over there . ''

The show 's host , Tom Bergeron , said Harper is in great spirits , even joking with him that `` Hey , I 'm past my expiration date ! ''
