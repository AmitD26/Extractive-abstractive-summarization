-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's not often supermodels are selected for their social awareness -- unless , of course , you 're flipping a fashion and photography status symbol on its head .

Pirelli , a tire company best known for outfitting the world 's speediest race cars and superbikes , also has a reputation for publishing calendars featuring stunningly beautiful women in the raciest of poses .

Well , Pirelli has decided to scrap this high-performance model for something more sensible . It 's still sexier than a minivan but quite a departure from years past .

`` In tough times , like the one the world is going through ... the idea was to find positive images and transformations in the world , '' said Paolo dal Pino , executive president of Pirelli Latin America .

Instead of a fashion photographer , Pirelli brought in Steve McCurry . The self-described `` street photographer '' is renowned for his image of an Afghan teen in a ragged burgundy scarf , whose peridot eyes peered out from the June 1985 National Geographic cover .

McCurry acknowledges he was surprised to get the call but said he was n't daunted because it is n't so dissimilar to the shots he considers his forte .

Curiosity inspires iconic photographer

As for the models , social consciousness was considered more of an , ahem , asset than what might slip out the sides of a string bikini or loosely draped serape .

Karlie Kloss and Liya Kebede , for instance , were chosen less for their perfect physiques than for their work to bring health care to the underprivileged . Petra Nemcova was n't selected for her hypnotic hazel eyes but for the more than five dozen schools constructed through her Happy Hearts Foundation .

`` They 're there not only for their fantastic beauty but also their social commitment , '' dal Pino explained .

Rio de Janeiro was chosen , he said , because of the economic transformation experienced there over the last 10 years , which by some estimates has lifted as many as 40 million people out of poverty .

Rio : The ` perfect Shakespeare stage '

Oh , and it does n't hurt that Brazil is one of the world 's most colorful and soulful destinations -- and a familiar haunt , as Pirelli staged shoots there in 2005 and 2010 .

Pirelli began speaking to McCurry in February , dal Pino said , and the photographer drove around Brazil before arriving at his blueprint for the project .

`` I wanted Rio to be a presence , '' McCurry said . `` I wanted a sense of the place to be part of the pictures . ''

The shutterbug said he was pleased with the freedom he , the models and staff had to roam the city 's favelas , many of which were considered unsafe for visitors just a few years ago .

McCurry sought to capture the country 's essence , not only through its vivid settings , but also through its people . In addition to the philanthropic temptresses , he photographed slices of Brazil , whether it was MaringÃ ¡ - born actress SÃ ' nia Braga , pop singer Marisa Monte or simply a faÃ § ade bearing one of Rio 's elaborate street art installations -LRB- the city actually differentiates between street art and graffiti `` tagging , '' with the former permissible by law -RRB- .

He also wanted everyday people .

So where 1995 's calendar featured Calvin Klein model Christy Turlington with bare breasts propped atop a metal corset , hands bound at her side , the 2013 shoot brings you images of the Capoeiristas practicing their dance-based martial art that dates back to 16th-Century slaves .

And where 2010 's calendar pictured Brazilian beauty Andrea Beatriz Barros topless , licking a rooster she clutched by the throat , McCurry 's calendar contains an image of a vegetable vendor with an arresting gaze , her halter-top blending in with the peppers at her produce stand .

-LRB- Because we 're intuitive enough to know you 'll be off to hunt for some of these images , we 'll save you the trouble , but be forewarned : As artistic as the photos are , they absolutely and unequivocally are 100 % NSFW . -RRB-

Clothing did n't make them any less beautiful -- `` I think they 're still sensuous , and the sexuality comes through , '' said McCurry -- but he was going for a certain elegance in the portraits .

He wanted to take these top models , who know the cameras and themselves so well and who are so skilled at their craft , and portray them in a natural setting , to `` let them be photographed the way they wanted to be photographed , the way they wanted to be seen , '' he said .

The answer , sadly , is you probably ca n't without dropping some coin . Back issues of the calendar can be purchased on eBay for anywhere from $ 20 to $ 150 , but the auction site , as of Thursday afternoon , had only three copies of the 2013 edition . They were commanding between $ 600 and $ 1,000 plus shipping .

`` We do believe that this -LRB- backlash -RRB- is not going to happen , '' he said . `` We do believe many people will say , ` It 's about time . ' ''
