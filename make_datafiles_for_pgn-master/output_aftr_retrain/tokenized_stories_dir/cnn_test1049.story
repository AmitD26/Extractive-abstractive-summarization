Kogelo , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four years ago this village was the center of `` Obama mania . ''

If 2006 was the start of the love affair , in 2008 it went full-blown .

Everywhere there were Obama T-shirts , DVDs and cakes -LRB- a black forest cake with an edible picture of the president-to-be and Mama Sarah was a favorite -RRB- .

Africans , in particular , saw great hope in the new American president with African roots . But after just one brief swing through Ghana in four years at the White House , many feel let down by Africa 's `` favorite son . ''

The administration contends that Africa is a priority , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been a regular fixture in Africa .

But to Africans , and especially to Kenyans , it is not the same .

`` Under the circumstances with what he has had to deal with we understand , '' said Malik Obama , `` and we hope that circumstances will change . We hope he has the opportunity to come here and say hello . ''

Even without a visit from President Obama , Kogelo is still trying to make good use of the connection .

Simply put , President Obama 's win put Kogelo on the map . Locals here say that charities flooded into Kogelo to get a bit of the `` Obama cache . ''

With a tight race looming in 2012 , many here are nervous .

`` I donÂ ¹ t know the other person who is contesting , '' said Pastor Joseph Omundi of the Christian Life church in Kogelo , `` but we know Barack Obama is the son of this land . ''

But Malik Obama stays positive .

`` Washington , D.C. , is the capital of the United States , but Kogelo is the capital of the world , because everybody comes to visit , '' he said .
