-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly five years into its war against drug cartels , Mexico on Wednesday was rebuked by a human rights organization that found a pattern of abuses by security forces .

Mexican President Felipe Calderon deployed the first of more than 45,000 troops in 2006 to combat drug cartel violence , but , according to Human Rights Watch , instead of solving the problem , it has `` exacerbated a climate of violence , lawlessness , and fear in many parts of the country . ''

In short , the organization found in those five states more than 170 cases where there was evidence of torture , 39 `` disappearances '' with evidence suggesting the involvement of security forces , and evidence of 24 cases of extrajudicial killings .

The pattern that emerges , according to Human Rights Watch , is that these are not isolated acts , but rather `` examples of abusive practices endemic to the current public security strategy . ''

Likely aware of the upcoming report , Mexico 's Defense Ministry last week gave a robust defense of its record and self-policing ability with the announcement of the convictions of 14 servicemen , including two officers for homicide .

A military tribunal found the soldiers guilty in the 2007 shooting deaths of five people at a military checkpoint in Sinaloa .

Since the beginning of the campaign , SEDENA has kept a constant open channel of communication with Mexico 's National Commission on Human Rights , the ministry said .

During that time , 89 complaints against the military resulted in recommendations to SEDENA by the human rights body , the ministry said .

`` That is , only 1.53 % of all the complaints '' filed have resulted in action by the human rights commission , the ministry said .

In the case of the 39 disappearances , Human Rights Watch depended on the testimony of witnesses who saw people being taken by security forces , but who state officials deny arresting or ever having in custody .

The wife filed complaints with several state and federal police bodies , providing the plate numbers of the police cars that took her husband . Two weeks later , Antunez 's body was found in an abandoned house , with syringes around his body . Human Rights Watch said that while it looked like an overdose , examinations showed that Antunez had died from blows to the head ; prosecutors dragged their feet on the investigation ; and to date , there is no progress in the investigation .

This was an example of the 24 suspected cases of extrajudicial killings carried out by security forces , according to the organization .

Among the report 's recommendations , it suggests ensuring civil trials for all alleged military misconduct and enforcing due process to guarantee detainee rights .

However , he said , the organization falls short of proving its allegations .

`` The thing I find interesting is that -LRB- in -RRB- all of these years , Human Rights Watch has yet to raise a human rights violation against the Zetas , the Gulf Cartel , the Sinaloa Cartel , the Juarez Cartel and all of these people who have violated the human rights of many thousands of Mexicans , a large number of which are dead by their own hands , '' he said .
