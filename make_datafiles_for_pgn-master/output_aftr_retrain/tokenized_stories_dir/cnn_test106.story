It is an American crisis , too , a crisis that may thrust the U.S. economy back into recession in 2012 .

If the Euro cracks up , many European banks who hold Euro-denominated bonds will discover that their bonds have lost value . The bonds wo n't fall to zero -LRB- hold on a second for the reason why not -RRB- , but they will lose enough value to play havoc with the bondholders ' capital . The banks will then either have to seek government help or stop their lending to businesses and consumers or both .

The European Union represents a bigger economy even than the United States . If the euro cracks , and euro-holding banks fails , the pain will cross the Atlantic , as the pain of the U.S. crash of 2008 crossed the Atlantic in the opposite direction .

European financial institutions may lose the ability to repay U.S. creditors , inflicting more losses on an already traumatized U.S. financial system .

Collectively , the eurozone countries are far and away the largest foreign investor in the United States . If the eurozone economies slump , Americans will find it harder to raise capital for new projects and businesses .

As a single economy , the EU is America 's largest trading partner . If it buys less , American exporters will suffer .

This catastrophe could erupt almost literally at any minute .

But the indispensable first step is to understand the crisis .

Many Americans perceive the euro crisis as a crisis of government deficits and government debt . That may have been true of Greece , but it 's certainly not true of France , the latest eurozone country to come under pressure in the financial markets . The German public debt is actually slightly larger than the French public debt , yet it is French bonds that the market is selling off .

Why ?

Let me present some very simplified math , using made-up numbers , just to help explain the idea .

Result : You are very happy to own German debt , despite the fact that Germany 's total debt equals 83 % of GDP .

Now imagine you were to buy a French bond worth 1,000 euros . That bond currently pays interest of 30 euros a year , equivalent to -LRB- say -RRB- $ 45 .

People say : `` The U.S. could become Europe if we keep accumulating debt . ''

Yet America 's debt burden is already higher than France 's , and markets accept U.S. debt with profound calm . The difference : it 's not that markets are worried that France ca n't pay its debts . They are worried that France wo n't pay its debts with euros . By contrast , nobody doubts that the U.S. government can pay its debts with dollars .

In the panic of 1893 , holders of American silver certificates -LRB- the paper money of the time -RRB- suddenly panicked that gold was going to become more valuable relative to silver . They began demanding gold in return for their paper , eventually draining federal gold reserves to the legal minimum . At that point , the federal government refused to release any more gold , and the country plunged into one of the worst depressions in U.S. history , exceeded only by the Great Depression of the 1930s .

This was not a debt crisis , such as you might have today in a genuinely poor African country . It was a crisis caused by issuing debt in a currency -LRB- gold back then , euros now -RRB- that the issuing government did not control .

Europe 's options now basically reduce to two : Either smash up the euro to restore each individual government with its own individual currency -LRB- accepting a horrific recession along the way -RRB- or else build a single new pan-European government to control the new pan-European currency -LRB- with considerable inflation risk along the way -RRB- .
