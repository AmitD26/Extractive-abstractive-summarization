Moscow -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian authorities on Friday seized radioactive material from the luggage of a passenger on a flight from Moscow to Tehran , Iran .

The luggage , belonging to an Iranian citizen , contained 18 metal objects packed in individual steel cases , Russia 's Federal Customs Service said . The agency said the material , the radioactive isotope Sodium-22 , can be obtained in a nuclear reactor .

Nuclear expert Michael Friedlander said Sodium-22 has no applications related to weapons . It is generally used to calibrate nuclear instruments in medical equipment , he said .

Initial tests showed that radiation levels of the objects were 20 times above normal , the Russian customs service said .

The customs agency said the objects were sent to a Moscow prosecutor 's office that deals with air and water transport .

No details were available on the identity of the Iranian passenger , who apparently flew to Tehran on the flight .
