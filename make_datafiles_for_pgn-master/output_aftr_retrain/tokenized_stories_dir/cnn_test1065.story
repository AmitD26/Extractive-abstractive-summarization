`` We had access to nuclear deterrence for self-defense because of the hostile policy of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK by force and we will expand and bolster it nonstop as long as this hostile policy goes on , '' an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry said in a report Tuesday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency .

DPRK is short for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , North Korea 's official name .

The North Korean official suggested Tuesday that a nuclear test had not originally been part of the regime 's plans .

North Korea launched a rocket on April 13 , which failed less than two minutes into the flight . It said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit , but much of the international community saw it as a cover up for testing its ballistic missile technology .

Many analysts assume an atomic test by North Korea is just a matter of time following the failure of the rocket launch last month . Two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests .

And activity is being ramped up at North Korea 's nuclear test site , a sign that the country is preparing for a test , according to an analysis of new satellite images by the defense publication IHS Janes .

An image from mid-April shows a full mining train , including an engine and several carts , outside of the tunnel . And a more recent shot on May 9 reveals new road networks at the site along with carts and a vehicle at the facility .

In the statement Tuesday , North Korea denounced as `` absolutely intolerable '' a declaration from the Group of 8 leaders over the weekend , which stated that Pyongyang faces more isolation if it continues its pursuit of a nuclear program .
