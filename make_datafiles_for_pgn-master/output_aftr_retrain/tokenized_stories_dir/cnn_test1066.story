How much , you say ? According to Let 's Move , today 's national fitness program , kids should get a total of 60 minutes of physical activity each day , and adults need 30 .

Here 's why it matters , especially for the kids : Childhood obesity rates have tripled since the '80s , and at this rate , one third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lives . And let 's not mention heart disease , asthma and tons of other largely preventable weight-related ailments .

Besides , exercise just feels good -- and do n't you think most family outings could use a bit more of that ? So ditch the minivan and the trip to Chuck E. Cheese and head outside ! Believe it or not , your kids will thank you : Endorphins plus fresh air and a fun family experience equals a refreshing way to get in better shape -- and you do n't need to chase over-caffeinated children all over a noisy pizza arcade to do it .

And with that said , here are six ways to move it , shake it and make exercise packed with family fun :

Walk the walk . If your crew usually heads to the couch after dinner , make them save their favorite show to the DVR and take a walk instead . Not long , not far , but make sure you get outside and let your meal digest while you stroll . If you 're in a city , walk around the block ; suburban dwellers can make tracks around the cul-de-sac . The point is simple : fresh air and a few steps together .

Make screen time smarter . Stop begging the kids to put away the video games ... and play with them instead ! Fire up the Wii and compete with classics like `` Bowling , '' or bust a move with `` Just Dance . ''

Families with wee ones will love `` Mario Kart '' and `` Wii Fit . '' Even `` Rock Band '' will get you up and out of your seat , which is the whole idea . More into watching plain ol' TV ? Make it a goal -LRB- or competition -RRB- to jump up during commercials ; whoever gets up first -- and stays on his or her feet for the duration of the commercial break -- wins .

upwave : Stop sitting , it 's really bad for you

Admittedly , a Nintendo Wii is an investment , but if you 're game -LRB- see what we did there ? -RRB- , it 's easy to find refurbished models for less than half the price of the latest and greatest .

Take a hike . During the fall , there 's nothing like an adventure in the great outdoors .

National Geographic recently touted the Sourdough Ridge Trail at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State as one of the best family-friendly hikes in the U.S. . They called it a `` mini-adventure through flower-filled meadows '' and `` a great way to introduce kids to the beauty of the high country . '' Whether you 're trekking in snow-capped mountains or at your local state park , it 's hard to beat the call of the wild -- even if you 're doing it with a Baby Bjorn .

Speaking of which , if you 're hiking with small children , you 'll need an aluminum-framed baby backpack ; look for one with a sun visor , water bottle pocket and a design that allows you to set the pack down with the child still sitting inside .

A single online search for `` family mud run '' resulted in pages of events happening all over the country this year . Moms and dads are Running the Ridge in Schenectady , New York , where `` features built by diabolical minds -LRB- are -RRB- ready to test you and your mud-running skills . '' And families are getting dirty for charity in Pennsylvania : The Kids ' Peace 5K Family Fun Mud Run takes place on a 250-acre campus that includes a sandpit crawl , cargo-net climb , Slip 'N Slide and of course a mud pit .

Truth ? Surfing is wicked hard . But it 's also a total adventure , and one that 's now catering to families . And you do n't have to head to Hawaii to do it -LRB- though you certainly could -RRB- : Family surfing packages are popping up all over , from Costa Rica to the more local shores of California and North Carolina . Packages include room , board and some of the best instructors around -LRB- see `` wicked hard '' above -RRB- .

Word to the wise : Spring for a rash-guard shirt and the thickest SPF you can find . Then just hang loose like it 's 1989 , duuude .
