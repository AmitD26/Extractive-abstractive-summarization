-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In recent weeks , Sen. Rand Paul galvanized the nation with a 13-hour filibuster , became the toast of the Conservative Political Action Conference and embraced immigration reform before the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce .

The junior senator from Kentucky has a vision of the Constitution in full , advocating the Second Amendment 's right to keep and bear arms and the Fourth Amendment 's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure .

He 's for civil liberties -- to protect against police abuse or presidential drones , as well as economic liberties and the freedom to run a business without unnecessary regulation . And he wants to give the blessings of those liberties to those who come to America in search of a better life .

As a libertarian and a traditional conservative , we disagree with Paul on a number of issues . Yet we both see his constitutional conservatism as auguring a future in which social tolerance , fiscal temperance and a humbler role for government are pursued not as ends in themselves but because that 's the best path .

Similarly , conservatives argued for larger police and military forces in response to crime and communism , but now that cost is part of our fiscal problem .

Opinion : Rand Paul is right

Modern conservatives need to remember these lessons as they consider the future .

Their predecessors were largely successful in defeating communism , liberalizing the economy and reducing crime . But those policies were n't perfect -LRB- or cheap -RRB- : the crime-fighting of the 1980s and '90s , with an emphasis on policing and incarceration , contributed to current problems such as unfunded pensions , bloated government unions and overcrowded prisons .

After the election losses in 2012 , some Republicans have advocated a need to change . In comes Rand Paul , who may well be on the leading edge of a new conservatism , which will focus on four areas :

3 . We also need to unwind our military engagements while maintaining flexibility in a rapidly changing world . Numbers do n't lie , and our debt and deficits demand a reduction in military spending . Conservatives should aim to achieve the necessary reductions in a smart fashion that maintains readiness and does n't endanger America 's interests . This will be a challenging balancing act , but it should be driven by strategic concerns rather than arbitrary benchmarks .

Paul , Rubio provide competing glimpses of a revamped GOP

Rand Paul has n't -LRB- yet -RRB- changed conservatism , but his views will shape the movement 's future .
