New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With the election just days away , most Americans disapprove of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress , while 58 percent of our fellow citizens say it 's time for a third party .

So let 's break out of the two-party mold and take a look at some of the independent candidates across the country who are surging or struggling as Election Day approaches .

The United States had four independent governors in the 1990s -- Jesse Ventura of Minnesota , Lowell Weicker of Connecticut , Wally Hickel of Alaska , and Angus King of Maine -- but none in the last decade .

This year , we have high-profile candidates running for governor 's mansions and for the U.S. Senate as independents .

Lincoln Chafee is leading in polls to become the first independent governor of Rhode Island -- one of 10 states where registered independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans . President Obama recently decided not to endorse the Democrat in this race out of deference to Chafee , who had been a rare Republican friend in the Senate and supported Obama in ' 08 .

There is `` fatigue with the two parties right now , '' Chafee told me a few months ago . `` People are so weary of the gridlock and partisanship . It 's counterproductive to moving the country forward in our very , very challenging times . ''

Two serious independent Senate runs are being conducted this year , both by centrist Republicans who found themselves being pushed out by conservative Tea Party activists in closed partisan primaries . In Alaska , polls show incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski running neck and neck with GOP nominee Joe Miller , who enjoys the support of former Gov. Sarah Palin . Murkowski is running as an independent in a write-in candidacy .

The last successful write-in Senate candidate was Strom Thurmond in 1954 . But the Murkowski name is almost as influential in Alaska , and Joe Miller 's erratic behavior , including allowing his private security staff to handcuff a local reporter , is provoking a backlash even among conservatives like Ben Stein , who recently called him a `` clown . ''

It might surprise you to know that there are 140 independent or third-party candidates running for the House of Representatives this year -- and while most are admittedly long shots , their campaigns retain an aura of idealism and independence .

The Modern Whig Party claims 50,000 members in all 50 states , and it is running a handful of candidates for both Congress and statewide office this year .

More and more Americans are declaring their independence , because the two major parties seem to be controlled by special interests or the parties ' most extreme elements , leading directly to government dysfunction .

The parties are not mentioned in the Constitution , but they act as if they are the purpose of our politics . They are not . And until they become more representative and responsive to the majority of Americans who feel politically homeless , we will see more declarations of independents . The courage of their example could drive a renewal of our democracy .
