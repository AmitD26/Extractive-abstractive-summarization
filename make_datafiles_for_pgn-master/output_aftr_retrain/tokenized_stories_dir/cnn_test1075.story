D.J. Lee , Samsung 's head of mobile marketing , made the announcement at an event in Seoul to roll out the Galaxy Gear smartwatch and Galaxy Note 3 smartphone .

Unfortunately , that 's about all the detail he provided -- no exact release date , no details on the design , no price and no word on where it will be available .

In a video , they teased a smartphone with a bendable screen that opens up into a smallish tablet .

Berkeley also demonstrated how a phone display screen that 's curved along its edges would open up exponentially more space for viewing content .

`` I 'm expecting the company to aim for an even more extreme curve with its next phone , '' Devindra Hardawar wrote for VentureBeat . `` With its large-screen Galaxy Note lineup , Samsung has shown that it is n't afraid to step into slightly oddball territory . The Note also proves those gambles can pay off for Samsung . ''

A curved screen would also boost Samsung 's status as a leader on the mobile innovation front . Samsung Galaxy phones have outsold Apple 's iPhone during various periods over the past year , as Apple has been dinged by critics who say the company 's phones are no longer breaking new ground .

There were similar criticisms of the newly released iPhone 5S , which was viewed by many as a baby step forward , although reviews of the device have been mostly raves , and it sold a record-setting 9 million units in its first weekend on the market .
