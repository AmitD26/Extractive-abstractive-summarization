`` Yes the people who fly our planes are demanding , and they have a right to be , '' says Faisal Ghazi Kayal , managing director of Saudia Private Aviation .

Capturing the small but significant patronage of the region 's super rich is becoming increasingly competitive as more private jet charter companies tap into a market that is expected to grow by around 12 % in the next two years , according to the Middle East Business Aviation Association .

The in-flight experience is just one part of it , although private jet manufactures and companies that fit out jets are continually pushing the limits of what can be done to meet client needs on board .

Later this month Lufthansa Technik is set to flight test its first steam shower aboard a Boeing 737 -- not an easy job given the hazard of creating pressure and heat within the cabin . Condensation also must not be allowed to form inside or on the plane 's structure .

The royal treatment

Cultural needs are taken into particular consideration .

`` Among Arab clients there is a desire for separate areas for men and women and they are very specific where the bedroom may be located , '' says O'Hare .

`` It 's important that the bedrooms are located near the front of the plane , while for some other markets its OK for them to be located near the back ; so configurations are very important . ''

Other business jet manufacturers like Gulfstream find their larger models are more popular in the region .

`` Gray market ''

One of the biggest problems they face in the region is the `` gray market '' -- planes owned by private individuals who then rent them out without having to go through the same regulatory scrutiny -LRB- or expense -RRB- of the charter companies .

`` It 's like having unlicensed taxi cabs , '' says O'Hare . `` There is a network or brokers out there who cater for this and it actually undercuts the legitimate businesses . ''

`` We like competition but we like competition that is fair and legal . It 's a very expensive business to be in , the margins are razor thin , and we 'd prefer it to be an industry of well-funded organizations experienced in aviation rather than aviation enthusiasts -- the owner-operator syndrome . ''

Efforts are being made to close the loops in the system , according to Kayal , `` and ultimately it will be -LSB- fixed -RSB- , like in any maturing market . ''

Until then private jet charter companies will continue to provide luxury services and play the necessary `` game '' in order to secure the loyalty of clients .
