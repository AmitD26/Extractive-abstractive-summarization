-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 22-year-old American woman has become an unlikely cricketing celebrity in England and Australia because her Twitter name happens to be '' @The Ashes . ''

Ashley Kerekes , a babysitter from Massachusetts , has been inundated with thousands of messages from cricket fans thinking her account relates to the Test series played between Australia and England known as The Ashes .

A bemused Kerekes responded by tweeting : `` I AM NOT A FREAKING CRICKET MATCH !!! . '' In another post she asked : `` What the hell is cricket ? ''

Far from deterring people , her outbursts have made her a celebrity on Twitter , with Australian carrier Qantas even offering to fly her to Australia to watch the famous cricket contest after a campaign by other users called '' #gettheashestotheashes . ''

As for the origins of her Twitter name , Kerekes told brisbanetimes.com.au : `` My boyfriend gave me the nickname years ago , maybe because of the cricket tournament . We do n't remember . He 's been calling me The Ashes forever . ''

`` I 'd turned off notifications on my phone right after my first outburst so I had no idea . After that I went looking around and found that I had hundreds , maybe thousands , of messages about The Ashes . ''

England face the Australians in the second test in Adelaide on December 3 . The first match at The Gabba was drawn .
