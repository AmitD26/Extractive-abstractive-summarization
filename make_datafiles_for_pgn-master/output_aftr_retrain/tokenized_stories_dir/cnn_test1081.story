In her free time , Gilbert stays loyal to the passions she immortalized in her best-selling memoir : yoga , travel and her husband , played memorably by Javier Bardem in the movie version of `` Eat , Pray , Love . ''

The 2006 book about her journey through Italy , India and Indonesia brought her fame and fortune . She followed it up with `` Committed , '' an exploration of the institution of marriage , inspired by her decision to wed the man she met during her travels , after a contentious divorce and swearing off matrimony .

CNN : How did you decide to go back to your roots as a fiction writer ?

CNN : How did you go about doing all the research on the places and the time ?

Gilbert : I just got so lucky after `` Eat , Pray , Love , '' I had all these resources and all this freedom to be able to fund whatever I wanted to do with my life . And so I was able to throw myself into three years of study about 19th-century botany . For me , that 's joyful and exciting and interesting . And it felt like a real tribute to the freedom that I had to be able to do that . And it was intimidating , because I did n't really know that much about the period , and I did n't really that much about the plant adventures of that day . But on the other hand , I 'm such a geek . I just got to really full-on geek out about learning all that stuff , which was very exciting .

CNN : Did the joy in this writing process come from your personal life ?

Gilbert : I 'm getting smarter as I get older . I 'm enjoying my 40s so much more than I enjoyed any other period in my life . I had a friend who told that me your 40s are such a wonderful time because you start to get out of your own way and get over yourself . And that has certainly been the case for me . I do n't have much nostalgia for my 20s and 30s . It 's just a really nice time . I 'm in a really supportive marriage . My husband is a great champion of me and my work . This book was also probably one of the sweetest intimacies of our marriage , because I wrote it in several months in a big burst , and every night , he would come into my office and sit down with a glass of wine , and I would read to him what I had written that day . I felt his excitement , and that compelled me to write faster . And it became this lovely private thing that we were doing together . And I think his influence shaped the book as well .

CNN : What 's your next project ?

Gilbert : I think I 'm going to stick with fiction . I had such a good time with this , I do n't want to let go of it yet . Having been in the corseted , buttoned-up , repressed 19th century , I want to move into the early 20th century and write a novel about girls behaving recklessly . Take off those corsets .
