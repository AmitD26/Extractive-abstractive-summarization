Nairobi , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenyan and English police officers are conducting an `` active search '' for an English tourist kidnapped from a remote Kenyan resort , a local police spokesman said Friday .

Owino told CNN that the search was focused on the border regions of Kenya and Somalia and through a `` significant network '' of contacts across the border .

The couple had arrived at the hotel Saturday afternoon after spending a week in the Masai Mara game reserve in southwestern Kenya . They were the sole guests in the hotel , which has cloth doors .

`` From what we can be able to gather , he resisted , and that 's why he was shot dead , '' Kenyan Police Commissioner Mathew Iteere said Sunday . `` Maybe they wanted to take the two , but he resisted and that 's why he was shot dead . ''

Kenya 's economy depends heavily on tourism and Kenyan officials publicly and privately worry that the case will affect the industry , which took years to recover after the bloody post-election violence in 2008 .

He said that two suspects have been interrogated in the case and hinted that the kidnapping at a luxury resort could have been an inside job .

`` There are strong indications that someone at the resort was acting maliciously , '' said Owino . `` We are looking at those leads very strongly . ''

A maritime security source aware of the situation said Sunday that Islamic militants probably took Judith Tebbut by boat toward Ras Kamboni in Somalia .
