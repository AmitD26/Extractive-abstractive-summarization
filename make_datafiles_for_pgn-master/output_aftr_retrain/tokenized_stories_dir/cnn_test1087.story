-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Levon Helm , the drummer , multi-instrumentalist and singer for The Band who kept the band 's heart for more than three decades , died `` peacefully '' Thursday afternoon , according to his record label , Vanguard Records . He was 71 .

`` He was surrounded by family , friends and band mates and will be remembered by all he touched as a brilliant musician and a beautiful soul , '' the record label 's statement said .

A statement from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , which inducted Helm in 1994 , called him the backbone of The Band .

`` As a member of the one of the most influential rock and roll groups , The Band , Levon Helm produced music that was as much timeless as it was timely , '' it said . `` In the late 1960s and early 1970s when the country was divided , The Band still projected a sense of unity and brought generations of fans together from all over the world . ''

Helm had a voice unlike any other in rock music : definitively Southern , soulful and gritty , an oak-barreled whiskey that sometimes went down with a fiery kick .

He could be mournful , calling up ghosts , as he did in `` The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down '' and the half-chanted chorus of `` King Harvest -LRB- Has Surely Come -RRB- . ''

And he could belt in sheer pleasure , galloping through `` The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show '' or simply lending his unique harmonies to `` The Shape I 'm In '' and `` This Wheel 's on Fire . ''

Music , TV industries mourn Dick Clark

`` They had comedians and wine and music . Always a lot of music , '' he said in 2010 .

After high school , he joined Ronnie Hawkins ' band , the Hawks . When the Hawks moved to Canada in the early '60s , Hawkins and Helm recruited several local musicians , including Robertson , Rick Danko , Richard Manuel and finally Garth Hudson . Hawkins left the band in 1963 , and the group renamed itself Levon and the Hawks .

The next year the group met Bob Dylan , beginning one of rock 's great partnerships . The group , already known for its blazing live performances , ended up accompanying Dylan on his famous 1965-66 tours -- though Helm left by the end of 1965 , upset at the vicious reaction the newly electric Dylan was getting from audiences .

Helm rejoined the Hawks in 1967 , playing on what became known as Dylan 's `` Basement Tapes . '' The group also wrote and recorded its own songs in the same place , a house called `` Big Pink '' in West Saugerties , New York .

Renamed The Band , the group put out its debut album , `` Music from Big Pink , '' in 1968 , to rapturous reviews . `` Six months are left in this proselytizing year of music ... but I have chosen my album for 1968 . ` Music from Big Pink ' is an event and should be treated as one , '' wrote Al Kooper in his Rolling Stone review of the LP .

The music was something new in American rock : both ancient and modern , rooted in the past and eschewing the psychedelic sounds then in vogue . The group , too , looked like something just emerged from a 19th century daguerreotype .

The next album , 1969 's `` The Band , '' earned them the January 12 , 1970 , cover of Time magazine , headlined `` The New Sound of Country Rock . '' The magazine 's artwork featured a menacing-looking Helm , bearded and hatted , looking every bit the American prophet he sometimes sounded .

The tensions of the band were obvious on screen , and Helm in particular did n't hide his anger . In his 1993 autobiography , he talked about his disgust , as Greg Kot observed in a 2002 article on the film 's anniversary .

He also disputed some of Robertson 's songwriting credits , though Robertson questioned Helm 's version . `` Who did the work ? I tried , I begged Levon to write songs or help me write songs -- all the guys . I always encouraged everybody to write , '' he told Kot . `` You ca n't make somebody do what they do n't want to do or ca n't do , and he 's not a songwriter . ''

He also appeared in several movies , the best remembered of which is `` Coal Miner 's Daughter , '' which won Sissy Spacek an Oscar for her portrayal of country star Loretta Lynn .

Helm had some hard times in the late '90s . His studio was hit with a fire . The throat cancer took his voice and medical bills threatened his house . He nearly declared bankruptcy .

But the Ramble , intended as a one-off `` rent party , '' according to Helm , helped raise money and revived his career .

`` If I had my way about it , we 'd probably do it every night , '' he said . `` I never get tired of it . ''

Indeed , it seemed there was nothing he enjoyed more than playing music for a few friends . In 2008 , Helm received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award with The Band . He was n't present to receive it .

He held a Midnight Ramble in Woodstock instead .
