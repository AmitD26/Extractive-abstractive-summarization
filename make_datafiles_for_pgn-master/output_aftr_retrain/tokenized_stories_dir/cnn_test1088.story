-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Modern medicine is remarkable , but only if you have access to it .

In many countries , including the United States , people are suffering because they ca n't get the health care they need .

Georges Bwelle

The problem : In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization . For comparison 's sake , the ratio in the United States is one doctor for every 413 people .

And even if they could see a physician , many Cameroonians could n't afford it . Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-quarters of the country 's health-care spending is private .

`` The only problem they have is poverty , '' Bwelle said . `` And with poverty , they ... can not enjoy their life . ''

In the evenings , the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia . Operations are usually done in a schoolhouse , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .

`` We are receiving 500 people in each trip , '' Bwelle said . `` They are coming from 60 kilometers -LRB- 37 miles -RRB- around the village , and they 're coming on foot . ''

Richard Nares

The problem : For many children fighting cancer , it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments .

`` It 's extremely tough , not just emotionally , but now financially , '' he said . `` Sometimes , both parents have to either leave their job or cut back severely . Some ... do n't have -LRB- an -RRB- extra $ 10 to pay for cafeteria food . ''

`` Transportation , '' they said .

So Nares started picking up families in his old Buick .

Soon , however , Nares could n't handle the number of requests that were coming in . So he teamed up with nurses and social workers from the hospital to create a formal transportation program . He hired a driver , formalized a schedule for pickups and drop-offs and started the Emilio Nares Foundation in 2003 .

The problem : During a two-week trip to Nigeria in 2008 , Stachel witnessed countless times when the lives of mothers and babies were at risk simply because of a lack of reliable electricity .

Pregnant women would arrive at the hospital with severe complications , but without adequate light to treat them , procedures had to be compromised or delayed until daylight . Some women were even turned away .

Stachel said midwives in Nigeria use all kinds of makeshift lighting when they deliver babies : kerosene lanterns , candles , even cell phones .

`` That 's not adequate light for maternity care , '' she said .

Since 2009 , the kits have been helping healthcare workers save lives not only in Nigeria but in facilities throughout Africa , Asia and Central America .

`` I really want a world where women can deliver babies safely and with dignity , '' Stachel said .
