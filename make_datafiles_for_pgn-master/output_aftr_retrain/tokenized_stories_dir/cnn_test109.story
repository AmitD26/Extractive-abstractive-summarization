Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four former officials of the now-closed Peanut Corporation of America were indicted Thursday on charges related to salmonella-tainted peanuts and peanut products , the Justice Department said .

A 2009 salmonella outbreak that prompted a massive recall of peanut goods led to nine deaths and more than 700 illnesses in more than 40 states , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

The 76-count indictment , unsealed in Georgia , alleged mail and wire fraud , the introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead , and conspiracy .

A plant in Blakely , Georgia , roasted and processed raw peanuts . Its peanut paste was sold to customers nationwide and used in crackers , cookies , and other items .

The defendants were identified as Stewart Parnell , 58 , of Lynchburg , Virginia ; Michael Parnell , 54 , of Midlothian , Virginia ; Samuel Lightsey , 48 , of Blakely ; and Mary Wilkerson , 39 , of Edison , Georgia .

Food recalls are common , but criminal indictments around them are not .

Charges in this case appear to have been prompted , in part , by the defendants ' alleged knowledge of the salmonella-tainted product shipment and an alleged cover-up .
