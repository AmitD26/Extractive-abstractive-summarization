Recep Tayyip Erdogan made the statement in the capital , Ankara , during a Justice and Development Party group meeting in parliament .

In the latest unrest , U.N. peacekeepers have been seized in Syria near the Israeli-held Golan Heights , a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday . The four were on patrol near al Jamlah , Syria , when an armed group detained them . Officials were working `` to secure their safe release , '' the spokesman said .

The Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade , part of the rebel Free Syrian Army , said the peacekeepers were caught in the crossfire between Syrian armed forces and FSA fighters . That prompted the brigade to extract the peacekeepers for their security , the brigade command said .

The strikes killed 42 Syrian soldiers , the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday , citing medical sources . It said 100 people remained missing .

But the Syrian government warned that Sunday 's apparent strikes , which followed one last week that Syria also blames on Israel , open `` the door wide for all the possibilities . ''

And Syrian ally Iran warned of a `` crushing response , '' while Russia called reports of Israeli involvement `` very worrying . ''

While Israel has not acknowledged responsibility for the attacks , the country has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups .

`` We are watching everything when it comes to the movement of these types of weapons . We have the means to do that , '' a senior Israeli defense official told CNN 's Sara Sidner on Sunday . The official is not authorized to speak to the media .

Shaul Mofaz , a lawmaker in Israel 's Knesset , told Israeli Army Radio on Sunday that Israel is n't meddling with Syria 's civil war . But Israel must protect itself from Lebanese militants , he said .

`` For Israel , it is very important that the front group for Iran , which is in Lebanon , needs to be stopped , '' Mofaz said .

Carla Del Ponte told an Italian-Swiss TV station that the findings come after interviews with doctors and Syrian victims now in neighboring countries . Del Ponte , the commissioner of the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry for Syria , said the notion is n't surprising , given the infiltration of foreign fighters into the Syrian opposition .

Later , the commission issued a news release saying it `` has not reached conclusive findings as to the use of chemical weapons in Syria by any parties to the conflict . '' Therefore , `` the commission is not in a position to further comment on the allegations at this time , '' the statement said .

The claim of rebels using sarin gas comes after months of suspicions that the Syrian regime has used the same nerve agent against rebels .

President Obama said `` intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient '' in guiding its assessments on chemical weapon use in Syria .

Amid violence , Syrian Internet connections go down

At least 128 people were killed in violence across the country on Tuesday , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported .

Opposition activists reported widespread power and Internet outages in Damascus and throughout the country , warning that the communications cutoff could be an ominous sign .

A regional conflict

Syria is believed to be the main conduit to the Shiite militia Hezbollah in Lebanon , the proxy through which Iran , a predominantly Shiite nation , can threaten Israel with an arsenal of short-range missiles .

In 2009 , the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus disclosed that Syria had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah , according to official cables leaked to and published by WikiLeaks .

The last thing Iran wants is a Sunni-dominated Syria -- especially as the Syrian rebels ' main supporters are Iran 's Persian Gulf rivals : Qatar and Saudi Arabia . Hezbollah 's feared scenario is Israel on one side and a hostile Sunni-led Syria on the other .

Kerry talks about Syria in Russia

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday he hopes Russia and the United States can find `` common ground '' on Syria . Kerry was in Russia for talks .

`` We really believe , the United States believes , that we share some very significant common interests with respect to Syria -- stability in the region , not having extremists creating problems throughout the region and elsewhere -- and I think we have both embraced in the Geneva communique a common approach . So it 's my hope that today we 'll be able to dig into that a little bit and see if we can find the common ground , '' Kerry said , according to a draft transcript of a meeting released by the State Department .

The Geneva plan was proposed last year for negotiations between members of the opposition and the Syrian regime . The United States , Russia , and European and Middle Eastern nations have signed on to the plan .
