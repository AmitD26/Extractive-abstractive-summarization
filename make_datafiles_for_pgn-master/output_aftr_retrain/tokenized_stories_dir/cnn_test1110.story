The soldier 's defense rests partly on the fact he and his identical twin brother have virtually the same DNA , an attempt to undercut authorities ' allegations that the DNA from the crime scenes belongs to the soldier .

The defendant , Aaron Gregory Lucas , 32 , is also a suspect in sex crimes in two other states , authorities say . In addition to raising his twin brother as a suspect , Lucas also claims that a third man may be the culprit in some of the crimes , court papers say .

The twin brother , who has n't been charged in the any of the crimes , could not be reached by CNN for comment .

So-called `` evil twin '' defenses have been used before in courtrooms , experts say . Defendants with an identical twin have sometimes accused the sibling as the real culprit to try to create reasonable doubt and seek acquittal , but the finger-pointing is n't a sure-fire strategy , said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos , who 's also a criminal defense attorney .

`` Cases like this are interesting , '' he added . `` Each twin essentially has to come up with an alibi , and we 're seeing that in this case and seeing it in other cases . It comes down to whose alibi is a little bit better . You can imagine the complexity if both twins are in the same geographic area at the same time of the crime . ''

In fact , both Lucas brothers lived in Alabama and Texas , where the other sexual assaults occurred , but authorities in Alabama , Texas and Colorado say Aaron Lucas is the focus of their investigations , Colorado prosecutors said . Brian Lucas has been to Colorado only once in the past decade and did n't visit El Paso County , according to the Colorado Springs Gazette , citing a police detective 's testimony last week .

The Colorado crimes occurred in Fountain , Colorado Springs and unincorporated El Paso County from summer 2010 until late 2012 , when Aaron Lucas was arrested , CNN affiliate KKTV reported last year . The Colorado crimes began at the same time that Aaron Lucas was first stationed at Fort Carson , the affiliate reported .

Both of the Texas and Alabama cases `` involve DNA evidence that the prosecution states matches the DNA of Aaron Lucas , '' defense attorneys said in court papers .

When Aaron Lucas was arrested last year , Colorado authorities took his DNA and ran the findings in a national law enforcement database , said police in Madison , Alabama , and Texarkana , Texas . His DNA matched samples found in unsolved sex crimes in those jurisdictions , police said .

`` Aaron Lucas has an identical twin brother , Brian Lucas , who has -LRB- a -RRB- similar DNA profile , '' Aaron Lucas ' attorneys said in court documents . `` Additionally , witness statements from the Alabama case describe a vehicle matching that of Brian Lucas being in the area of the attack prior to the assault .

`` The defense believes that Mr. Brian Lucas contributed the DNA in the Alabama and Texas cases and that it is his DNA that was found during those crimes , not Aaron Lucas 's . ''

Aaron Lucas 's attorneys said it is unclear whether the twin brother will be compelled to appear during the trial , expected to begin in January .
