The jury was sent home for the night and will resume deliberations Friday .

One of the defendants was not in the dock at the end of deliberations Thursday because `` she is not feeling well , '' the judge said .

The Italian sisters have told Isleworth Crown Court in west London that Lawson authorized their personal expenditures on Saatchi 's company credit cards , including on designer shoes , clothes and trips abroad .

Their respective defense lawyers said in their closing arguments Thursday that the prosecution 's claims had not been proved .

Both defense lawyers questioned Lawson 's credibility as a witness and said their clients ' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue .

Elisabetta Grillo 's defense lawyer , Anthony Metzer , told the jury that his client was the `` soft underbelly '' by which Saatchi was attacking Lawson after the breakdown of their relationship . The couple divorced this year .

Karina Arden , representing Francesca Grillo , said her client had made no attempt to hide her spending , so it was impossible for Lawson to say she was ignorant of it .

The case has gripped UK media , thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi , a millionaire art collector .

Jane Carpenter , giving the prosecution 's closing argument in the case , said Thursday that the sisters had abused their position `` time and time again '' and that they `` grew bolder and greedier '' as time went by .

In her own testimony , Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times , during two periods of her life , and used cannabis in the past . But she denied being a habitual user .
