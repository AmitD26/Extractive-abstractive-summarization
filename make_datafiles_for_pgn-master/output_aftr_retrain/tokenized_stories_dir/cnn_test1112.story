-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lindsey Vonn of the United States lived up to her billing as the golden girl of the Winter Olympics with a dominant victory in the women 's downhill at Whistler Creekside on Wednesday .

Vonn had been troubled by a shin injury in the build-up to the Games in Vancouver but showed no ill-effects with a blistering run of one minute 44.19 seconds to win her first Olympic medal of any color .

The Minnesotan , the reigning world champion in the discipline and totally dominant on the World Cup circuit in the build-up to Games , decimated the time set by fellow American Julia Mancuso by over half a second from start number 16 .

Vonn is also the first American woman to win downhill gold and the first to win a speed event at the Olympics since Picabo Street triumphed in the super-G at Nagano in 1998 .

Germany 's Maria Riesch , a great friend of Vonn 's and her closest challenger in the overall World Cup standings this season , could only finish a disappointing eighth .

Her husband and coach Thomas Vonn had no doubts she would claim gold with her first attempt despite her pre-Games injury scare .

`` For Lindsey to come though , under this kind of pressure and with her shin injury , is fantastic , '' he said .

`` Lindsey called me before the race and told me , ` I think I got this . I may not need you , '' he added .

There was further triumph for the United States in the men 's speed skating as Shani Davis retained his 1,000 meters crown at the Richmond Olympic Oval .

And the U.S. gold rush continued with a commanding performance from Shaun White in snowboarding 's half-pipe final to successfully defend his Olympic title .

White had a massive four-point lead over compatriot Scott Lago after the first run and rounded off an incredible display with a series of trademark moves in his second effort which scored a massive 48.4 points .

Elsewhere , there were golds in the cross country sprint races for Nikita Kruikov of Russia in the men 's event and in the women 's for Norway 's Marit Bjoergen , who also won bronze in the 10 km freestyle event on Monday .
