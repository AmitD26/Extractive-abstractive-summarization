-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- India may be turning the world 's hottest chili into a weapon , but there are people who actually want to eat the ghost chili -- the bhut jolokia or naga jolokia -- for fun .

`` As soon as something is declared and proven to be the hottest chili pepper in the world , everybody wants to grow it , '' said Dave DeWitt , the author of more than 35 books on chilis , including `` The Complete Chile Pepper Book . ''

In their homes , fans congregate for `` hotlucks , '' the traditional potluck with exponentially higher heat .

Mark Stevens of Monmouth County , New Jersey , is among these self-proclaimed `` chili-heads . ''

`` The main issue is flavor , '' Stevens said . `` It 's not a pissing contest to see who can eat the hottest thing , which is usually what you see when the media reports on the stuff . ''

Once an eater gets used to the heat , he or she begins to appreciate the flavor differences of each varietal , Stevens says .

`` You basically build up a tolerance to the heat and then can taste all the flavors that are underneath it , so that what was just basically flavorless blazing heat , after a while , you can actually taste the different flavors in different chilis in different foods , '' he said .

Stevens says he began eating chilis in the early 1990s when he needed to lose weight . `` I wanted something that I could snack on that was pretty low-calorie but definitely let me know that I had eaten something , and chilis kind of fit the bill . ''

Dave Hirschkop has been selling hot sauces for 17 years through his company , Dave 's Gourmet , and says it 's the hottest sauces that are his best sellers .

The Indian government said last month that it planned to use the ghost pepper in a tear gas-like hand grenade aimed at fighting terrorists or rioters .

Making a weapon is `` probably one of the best things you can do with them , '' DeWitt said .

`` This one has a great flavor but is the hottest in the world ; that 's the bottom line , right ? '' he said . `` People are n't talking about some cascabel -LSB- chili -RSB- or some other variety with that enthusiasm . ''
