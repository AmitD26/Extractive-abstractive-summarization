Bangkok , Thailand -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rights groups and others have called on Thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during mass demonstrations in Thailand 's capital , Bangkok .

The People 's Democratic Reform Committee protest group -- which hopes to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office -- launched its `` Bangkok shutdown , '' intended to last a month , Monday .

Authorities say eight people have died and 470 have been injured since the protests began in November .

`` Security forces should ensure that the right to peaceful protest is upheld -- however , they also have a duty to protect the safety of the public . When carrying out their work , law enforcement officials should apply nonviolent means before resorting to the use of force , and always exercise restraint in its use . ''

Amnesty International also urged protest leaders to `` call on their followers not to commit human rights abuses . ''

The Thai government has deployed some 15,000 military and police to the capital ahead of the planned shutdown , the rights group said .

Ban said he was `` very concerned that the situation could escalate in the days ahead , '' and particularly on Monday .

But the move has done little to appease protesters . They have called on the Prime Minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected `` people 's council , '' which would see through electoral and political reforms .

The national Election Commission has urged the government to postpone elections amid the continuing unrest .

Dozens of countries have issued travel advisories amid fears the tensions could erupt into violence .

`` While protests have been generally peaceful over the last two months , some have resulted in injury and death , '' its online warning said . `` Even demonstrations that are meant to be peaceful can turn confrontational , and can escalate into violence without warning . ''

Ambitious goal

Protest leaders have said they want to rid Thailand of the influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra , the older brother of Yingluck Shinawatra .

Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas . If he returns , he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated .

The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck Shinawatra 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return .

That move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied .

Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra is strongest among the urban elites and middle class , particularly in Bangkok .

Thaksin Shinawatra 's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast Thailand .
