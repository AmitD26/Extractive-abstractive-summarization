Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 after being left at a holiday apartment in the Algarve region .

According to the newspapers , the email was sent on March 4 by a London-based Metropolitan Police intelligence officer to Leicestershire police -- Madeleine 's home county -- who then forwarded it on to investigators in Portugal more than a month later .

In the email , which both newspapers printed a copy of , the officer writes that `` intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken .

The Daily Telegraph reported the Portuguese police then asked Interpol to investigate . However , nothing appears to have come of the lead . Watch how Madeleine McCann may have been abducted to order ''

The case files , released by the Portuguese investigators this week after they shelved the investigation for lack of evidence last month , have provided a raft of leads for the media to report .

On Tuesday , the documents revealed a previously undisclosed sighting of Madeleine in the Netherlands shortly after her disappearance .

She said the child identified herself as Maddie and said she was taken from her mother while on holiday .

`` I start to ask where her mommy was , '' Anna Stam said . `` She could n't tell me that . I wanted to give her a balloon , but she did n't want that . She only wants her mommy , she said . And she said that these people took her from her mommy . ''

At one point , authorities had named the girl 's parents , Kate and Gerry McCann , as `` arguidos , '' or suspects , along with a British man living in Portugal , Robert Murat . But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor 's office said authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them `` arguidos . ''

After closing the case , police turned their case file -- containing up to 30,000 pages -- over to attorneys and private investigators working for the McCanns .
