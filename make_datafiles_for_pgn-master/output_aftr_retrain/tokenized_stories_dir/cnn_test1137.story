-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Think of the Arab souk -- the fabled marketplaces of the Middle East -- and it immediately conjures up images straight from the Arabian Nights : mountains of yellow turmeric , shafts of light through lattices and the air thick with incense smoke .

These powerful associations have not been lost on the team from the United Arab Emirates that last month won the bid to host the World Expo 2020 ; exhibitors making the journey to Dubai in seven years will be setting up their pavilions in the biggest souk in history .

Created in an empty desert area between Dubai and Abu Dhabi , the vast zones of the structure -- each one representing the bid themes of sustainability , mobility and opportunity - are inspired by the labyrinthine galleries of the souk .

For Greg Lindsay , co-author of `` Aerotropolis : The Way We 'll Live Next '' , the Expo proximity to the new Al-Maktoum International Airport and Dubai World Central development is especially significant .

'' -LRB- Dubai World Central -RRB- is the best organic example of an ` aerotropolis , ' '' says Lindsay , whose book puts the case that modern globalized cities such as Dubai are built around , and feed off , airports in much the same way as cities in the 19th century were built around the railways .

`` In 1990 , there was nothing really there ... it was the strategy of Emirates and the civil aviation authority to make Dubai the crossroads of the world .

`` I do think winning the Expo will be a huge catalyst for its development , '' he said .

Hub for a new Silk Road

According to Afshin Molavi , a global geo-economics specialist and senior advisor at Oxford Analytica , Chinese businesses use Dubai as a hub for Africa , Indian traders use the city to access markets across the world and Western multinationals see Dubai as a hub for the Middle East .

Inflating property bubbles ?

Regional instability combined with rapid development has led to one of the world 's most volatile property markets .

Already a magnet for the super-rich , real estate prices are now underpinned by Syrian , Libyan and Egyptian investors sitting out political troubles at home . According to property analysts , prices have already surged 20 % since last year and rents in some neighborhoods are up by 40 % .

Dubai estimates its successful Expo 2020 bid will generate US$ 23 billion , or 24 % of the city 's GDP , between 2015 and 2021 .

With memories still fresh of the bust in 2008 when property prices were slashed by 50 % and Dubai had to be bailed out by Abu Dhabi to the tune of US$ 10 billion , some fear that another massive correction is on the way .

Faris Mansour , director of Mubadala Pramerica Real Estate Investors , told the Cityscape Global conference in Dubai recently that the city should brace for another fall .

`` The -LRB- investment -RRB- capital is temporary and can quickly move out , '' Mansour warned . `` And that 's not to say it will fall necessarily as it did before . But it will fall , it will correct and this is something we should all expect to happen and I expect it to happen in the next 18 to 24 months ... as capital becomes more expensive globally . ''

Despite the dire warning , many believe the Expo -- far from creating a bubble - will underpin property prices for many years to come in a city that recovered from the crisis in 2008 faster than anyone expected .

`` Dubai might be one of the most hyper-connected places on the planet , '' he said . `` You can see it on the streets and in the malls . There are not many places where you can mingle with more than 200 different nationalities . ''
