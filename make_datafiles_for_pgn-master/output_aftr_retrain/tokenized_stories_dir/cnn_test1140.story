Welcome to the hip headquarters of Skyscanner , Europe 's most popular flight search engine -- a hot-house of IT talent with an average employee age of 32 .

Leading the team is CEO Gareth Williams , who broke the golden rules of web start-ups . At first , there was no business model , just a bright idea . And , we 're not in sunny Silicon Valley , California . It 's another damp day in Edinburgh , Scotland .

`` We probably went largely on instinct , '' said Gareth , `` you 're supposed to use market research and a business model in mind , and we had neither of those things .

Frustrated at the time it took to find cheap flights to visit his brother in France , the 44-year-old programmer spent a week building a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet , the first version of Skyscanner .

`` The quantity of traffic leads we send is so high , -LSB- and -RSB- the relative cost of our other distribution channels is so low that it 's a really a great deal for them , '' he said .

`` It is recognition of what 's possible anywhere in the world , '' says Gareth .

`` We 've barely begun on our journey , and the fact we 're doing it outside Silicon Valley is an indication of an increasing trend . ''

`` I ca n't do anything about it , so I ignore it and work on the things that affect me , '' said Williams .

`` We 're very proud to have originated in the port area of Leith . In terms of the European and local economies it will do what it will do . Death , taxes , Google and the economy , I have no control over . ''

But Williams does have control over his surroundings . With his table tennis tables , meeting pods , barista coffee machines and staff perks like language classes , he has taken a little bit of Google and planted it in Edinburgh . Surrounded by university talent , this employer is helping to stem a brain drain out of the capital .

`` We 're right next to Edinburgh University which has one of the best computer science departments in Europe , if not the world , and having access to the graduates and the postgraduates coming out of there is a massive accomplishment for us , '' says Gareth .

`` Silicon Valley is undoubtedly a very special place , but the world outside Silicon Valley combined is much bigger . ''
