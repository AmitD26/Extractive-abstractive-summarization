-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From outward appearances Tuesday 's special election to fill a vacant congressional seat in Florida does n't seem to be that important . It 's just one of 435 seats in the U.S. House , and the winner will serve out a term that comes to a close at the end of the year .

But the contest for Florida 13 has landed smack in the middle of the national political spotlight . It 's seen by some pundits as a bellwether for November 's midterm elections , and there 's been a massive infusion of outside ad money into the race to try to influence the outcome .

Empty your notebook : Republican finger-pointing in Florida

Here are five things we can learn from the race :

1 . Swing district in a swing state : The district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg near Tampa , and it 's up for grabs . While Young captured 58 % of the vote in his 2012 re-election , President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district . Obama also won it in 2008 , grabbing 51 % of the vote . It went for George W. Bush before that .

Rothenberg points out that all things being equal , Sink should win , since she did n't have a primary challenge and had a money advantage , and Jolly had to continuously battle the lobbyist label .

`` Since most nonpartisan handicappers and analysts have for years expected this seat to go Democratic when it became open , a Republican victory would likely say something about the national political environment and the inclination of district voters to send a message of dissatisfaction about the President . And that possibility should worry the White House , '' Rothenberg said .

Eight things to watch till Election Day

2 . Is it all about Obamacare ? : National Republicans are framing the election as a referendum on Obamacare . The National Republican Congressional Committee and pro-GOP outside groups link Sink to the health care law , to President Obama and to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi .

`` Canceled health plans . Higher premiums . Medicare cuts . People losing their doctors . A disaster for families and seniors . For Alex Sink the priority is Obamacare . Not us , '' says the narrator in a TV commercial by the Chamber of Commerce , which is backing Jolly .

Sink recognizes that Obamacare is a major issue . While she highlights how the Affordable Care Act has helped people , she also notes that the law has flaws , and says she 's open to GOP proposals to amend some of the measure 's requirements .

3 . Excitement could translate to turnout : While special elections typically see far lower turnout than general elections , the race in Florida could have a strong showing -- a statistic both sides will be eagerly trying to gauge to predict turnout in November .

By contrast , turnout for that 2010 special election was about 15 % of eligible voters . That 's the total figure , not just early voting .

While registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the 13th District by about 11,350 voters , Democrats seem to be excited about the high early voting turnout so far .

Outside spending also tops the current Senate race in Kentucky , where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is defending his seat .

In addition to the $ 2.4 million spent by the campaigns themselves , as of mid-February nearly $ 9 million had been spent by outside groups , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , which monitors outside spending .

Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the CRP , said the influx of cash has to do with the start of the 2014 midterms .

`` It seems like an anomaly that there would be all this outside interest when it 's going to have to be fought again in November , '' she said . But she added that groups are interested in this race in part because there 's `` no other show in town yet . ''

Outside money , she said , can significantly strengthen or weaken the eventual victor when the race plays out again in November , but it also plays a large role in determining the dialogue and themes in the contest .

About $ 623,000 has been spent in efforts to oppose Sink , and Jolly has benefited from about $ 600,000 more to support him than his opponent .

American Crossroads , the conservative super-PAC backed by Karl Rove , and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are two of the largest super-PACs that have backed Jolly . On the Democratic side , House Majority PAC put in nearly $ 1 million .

5 . From Barker to Biden to Bowzer to Bubba : Beside the national money and attention , the race also landed some big-time surrogates . Vice President Joe Biden flew in to headline a fundraiser for Sink , and former President Bill Clinton recorded an automated call for the Democratic candidate .

But it was n't just politicians .

Bob Barker , the longtime host of `` Price is Right , '' starred in an ad for Jolly in December . And in another blast from the past , Jon `` Bowzer '' Bauman from Sha-Na-Na fame campaigned for Sink .
