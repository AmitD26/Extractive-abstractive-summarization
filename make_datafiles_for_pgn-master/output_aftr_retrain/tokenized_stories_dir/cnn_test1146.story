-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British tabloids have led a feeding frenzy of international media coverage that started weeks ahead of Prince William and Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge 's Australasian visit , but the New Zealand media have been slower to smell the blood .

Local coverage of the celebrity couple 's 10-day visit that starts April 7 has been respectful but largely reactive in its attempts to inspire the same degree of public adulation for British royalty last seen here 31 years ago .

That was in 1983 , when 10-month-old Prince William visited New Zealand for the first time with his parents Prince Charles and Princess Diana . The young prince was just a few weeks older then than his son Prince George will be on this visit .

Until this weekend , the biggest royal media story has been the furore following a former British protection officer 's comments that the release of maps of public viewing points for the royal tour was effectively `` a manual for terrorists . ''

How much New Zealanders are really hankering to see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their much adored eight-month-old George ca n't be accurately gauged until the crowds do , or do n't , choke the streets .

The commitment is , of course , as much about beaming stories and photos of the royals to the rest of the world as it is to satisfying New Zealand audiences .

It is also a priceless opportunity to promote tourism by showcasing images of New Zealand 's natural beauty along with those of the beautiful couple and the loveable third-in-line to the British throne .

Fairfax Media , one of the country 's two biggest media chains , will have staff at every royal event .

Sources close to officials managing the royal visit say they are optimistically expecting `` a bit of hysteria . ''

During Prince William 's first New Zealand visit , the sight of him being set loose to crawl on the lawns of Government House in Auckland with an iconic Kiwi Buzzy Bee toy touched people 's hearts .

When I covered that visit , there was still a collective sense of pride among most New Zealanders at welcoming members of `` our royal family '' whose mother and grandmother was `` our Queen . ''

When William , Kate and George visit this week , New Zealanders who choose to connect with them will do so on various levels , many of them with little regard for any loyalty to royalty .

Public interest will be high in Kate who is visiting New Zealand for the first time on the couple 's first official overseas visit with George .

What could be more feel-good than a pretty , well-dressed `` princess '' toting her beautiful baby ?

New Zealand 's indigenous people , the Maori , have always had a close connection with the British Royal Family , partly because of a historic and often abrogated treaty signed by Maori in the 19th century with representatives of Queen Victoria .

This year , however , the Maori King has declined to see the Duke and Duchess because he believed their diary allowed too little time for traditional ritual .

The crowds that turn out to catch a glimpse of the royals are likely to include a higher proportion of rubber-neckers , anti-royalists and people who just go ga-ga over good-looking , blue-blooded babies than of true-blue royalists .
