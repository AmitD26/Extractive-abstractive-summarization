Montreal , Canada -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A United Nations aviation agency agreed Tuesday that global airline flight tracking is needed in the wake of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 's disappearance and established a September deadline for `` near-term implementation plans for applicable solutions . ''

`` ICAO will continue to provide the necessary leadership to ensure all issues are considered expeditiously to enable a ` performance-based ' International Standard for global airline flight tracking , '' Aliu said in a statement .

Flight 370 has been missing since March 8 despite an international search .

It 's unclear whether the transponder -- a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar to identify a plane 's position , speed and direction -- and the maintenance reporting system , which transmits periodic flight data to the ground , were intentionally disabled or malfunctioned .

Damage to search vehicle

The tail section of the Bluefin-21 was badly damaged when it struck the side of the Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the last 24 hours . But the submersible has been repaired and probably will be redeployed when daylight arrives in the southern Indian Ocean , the U.S. Navy official said .

`` They had 20-knot winds and 3 - to 5-foot seas , '' Dean said . `` They got the vehicle on deck , but in the process of doing so , the vehicle was damaged . They essentially had torn the propeller , the tail section had ripped away , and so there was some damage back aft -LRB- in the area of -RRB- the main electronics bay . There were quite a few components that we had to troubleshoot .

`` The good news is the vehicle is repaired , '' he added .

He said it is likely the team will wait until daylight before deploying the Bluefin-21 on its next mission .

No wreckage was found during its search of `` Ping 2 , '' considered the most likely location of the plane .

The key consideration at this week 's ICAO meeting was developing protocols for tracking aircraft .

The members listened to a brief presentation about several flight tracking technologies , but do not plan to prescribe a specific one .

`` Let me also clarify that performance-based standards differ from ` prescriptive ' standards in that they do not restrict operators to specific technological solutions , '' Aliu said . `` This systems-based approach acknowledges that what will best service airlines and manufacturers over the longer term will be the flexibility to choose from amongst the latest and most cost-effective innovations that meet their global flight tracking needs . ''

This is not the first call for such international standards .

Air France Flight 447 crashed in 2009 in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Brazil , killing more than 220 people . It took five days to find wreckage and nearly two years to find the underwater debris field .

The French accident investigation board recommended that authorities `` study the possibility of making it mandatory '' for commercial airlines to regularly transmit basic flight parameters , including position , altitude and speed .

The ICAO changed some standards after the Air France accident , which will go into effect in November . In what documents describe as `` initial steps , '' airlines were told to make better use of existing communication links , introduce mandatory warnings sent to air traffic control when a plane deviates from the cleared route , and improve procedures to ensure better connections .

`` This was also identified as a low-cost solution , using existing -LRB- equipment -RRB- and technology , '' the ICAO secretariat wrote in working papers presented to this week 's meeting .

Now the organization is considering going further , mandating more frequent and more detailed flight tracking information .

Separately , a satellite communications company proposed a free global tracking service ahead of the meeting .

Inmarsat , the company whose satellite had the last known contact with Flight 370 , said the service is offered to the 11,000 passenger aircraft already outfitted with an Inmarsat connection .

It said the tracking would cover `` virtually 100 % of the world 's long haul commercial fleet . ''
