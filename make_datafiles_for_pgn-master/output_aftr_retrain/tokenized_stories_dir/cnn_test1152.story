And with seasons in tumultuous transition , indoor pools , which are not prey to weather , offer a little bit of an edge . So go ahead and take a dip at these eight luxurious indoor pools .

This nongaming hotel , which is part of the large Borgata complex in Atlantic City , has three indoor pools -LRB- and two more outdoors -RRB- so there 's really no reason for things to get crowded at any of them . A two-lane lap pool is in the two-floor Immersion spa on the 32nd floor and is set against full-length windows that look out to the Atlantic Ocean , the perfect setup for a water workout . A stunning top-floor pool surrounded by lounge chairs , cabanas and lush foliage telegraphs a more exotic tropical scene than the property 's Jersey Shore location . Rooms from $ 149/night . www.theborgata.com

And the world 's greatest beach is ...

Tucked inside what used to be Napoleon 's grandnephew Roland Bonaparte 's Parisian home , the 15-by-6-meter , light-bathed pool area -LRB- which was previously Bonaparte 's stables -RRB- extends out to an expansive , plant-lined terrace . All around the pool , which features mosaic tiles inspired to look like Asian carpet , are chic traditional French touches like floral bas relief on the walls and columns surrounding the mezzanine . Rooms from $ 895/night . www.shangri-la.com

On the 16th floor of the tallest building on the island of Taipa is the glamorous indoor infinity pool of the impressively massive gaming complex of Altira Macau . It 's easy to see why Forbes once named it one of the best hotel pools in the world : One side faces all of the city with crystal-clear floor-to-ceiling windows . Rooms from $ 235/night . www.altiramacau.com

Hot spots in the world 's happiest countries

W 's first ski property is in the heart of the Swiss Alps in the tony town of Verbier . The pool 's interior vibe is totally in tune with W 's urban aesthetic , with tons of black and leather furnishing that would be right at home at any fabulous pool party . From every corner of the pool , you can look out into the Alps , but if you want a closer vantage point , just swim out into the outdoor area -- the pool is heated -- and breathe in the Alpine air . Rooms from about $ 1,000 / night , double occupancy . www.wverbier.com
