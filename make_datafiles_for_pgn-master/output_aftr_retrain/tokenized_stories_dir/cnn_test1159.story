The La Liga side want to reach the European final for the first time since 2002 while the German champions are out to become the first team to defend the Champions League trophy .

With so much at stake , attack and counter attack flowed in waves inside an electric Bernabeu Stadium Wednesday as two of Europe 's top sides delivered on their promise to provide footballing fever in the semi-final .

The opening -- and only -- goal of the match was a fine example of the ebb and flow .

Real Madrid defender Pepe had blocked an early effort by Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic and Cristiano Ronaldo soon found the ball at his feet .

Just minutes later , Ronaldo found himself in space in front of goal .

Di Maria , fed by Ronaldo , missed another good chance to double Real 's advantage when his left footed shot went high and wide .

Bayern turned the screw on the Spanish side as the first half wore on , dominating possession , but despite the best efforts of Philipp Lahm and Arjen Robben the home side kept them at bay .

Ronaldo quickly got down to business at the restart as he had a shot palmed away by Manuel Neuer .

The Bayern goalkeeper had his work cut out on his return to the team and he was again forced to save a fierce shot from Ronaldo .

At the opposite end , Robben , who left Madrid to join Munich , had motored towards goal on a solo run but his shot was safely collected by Iker Casillas , who later punched away another Bayern effort .

The German side had a late appeal for a penalty turned down by English referee Howard Webb .

`` We have to keep focused and take advantage of our opportunities . ''

`` We need everything in the second leg ; sacrifice , courage , quality . We have a small advantage but nobody knows what will happen . ''

He added he expects both Ronaldo and Bale to be fully fit for next Tuesday 's second leg .

In the other semi-final , played on Tuesday evening , Chelsea and Atletico Madrid played out a goalless draw .
