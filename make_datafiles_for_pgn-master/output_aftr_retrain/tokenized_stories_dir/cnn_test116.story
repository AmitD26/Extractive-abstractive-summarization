Not to pass GO . Not to collect $ 200 .

In a campaign replete with marketing genius and every cliche you can think of , Hasbro is encouraging fans of a special Facebook page to vote daily until February 5 for the token they want to save and for the one they want added .

New choices are a diamond ring , guitar , toy robot , cat or helicopter .

The game was introduced by Parker Brothers in 1935 during the heart of the Great Depression . According to Hasbro , which bought the company , more than 1 billion people have played the game in its various versions .

Some tokens are long gone , among them the lantern , cannon and rocking horse .

`` Fans who would still like to play with the classic eight tokens have a limited time to pick up the existing version of the game , '' said Hasbro .

`` Get rid of the iron and bring in the kitty , '' one commenter said . `` That way the dog will have something to chase around the board . ''

Others pleaded for the game to be left alone .

Some , including Jan Blackstock Harville , waxed nostalgic while looking ahead .

`` That ugly shoe needs to go , '' she wrote . `` Although I did swallow the top hat when I was 3 so we never had it ! I vote for the robot . ''
