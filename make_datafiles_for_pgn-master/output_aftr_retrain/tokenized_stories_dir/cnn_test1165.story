The three U.S. soldiers were first indicted by the judge in 2007 . The case was closed in 2008 but reopened last year after Couso 's family appealed to Spain 's Supreme Court .

The three , identified as Philip de Camp , Phillip Wolford and Thomas Gibson , were assigned to the U.S. 3rd Infantry , based in Fort Stewart , Georgia .

In addition to Couso , the tank fire on April 8 , 2003 , also killed a Reuters cameraman , Ukrainian-born Taras Protsyuk .

In addition , the judge placed two senior U.S. officers , identified as Buford Blount and Col. David Perkins , under official investigation in the case , which is a step short of an indictment under Spanish law .

Couso 's family and some journalists have blamed the U.S. military , saying they should have known the Palestine Hotel , a tall structure in Baghdad , was a base for journalists , not combatants .

Then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said American troops fired only after receiving hostile fire from the hotel and the matter received the highest attention , from then-President George W. Bush and then-Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar .

Earlier in the long legal battle , a three-judge panel at the National Court in 2006 ruled that Spain had no jurisdiction in the case . The judges ruled that U.S. troops thought they were firing on Iraqis at the hotel serving as spotters for Iraqi artillery fire aimed at American troops , and that the civilian deaths were not intentional .
