-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Instagram is a decidedly modern invention , but back in your great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents ' day , `` Photochroms '' were the functional equivalent . Photochroms combined emerging photographic technology and the painterly techniques of the old masters to provide technicolor glimpses of the Great Lakes , Old South , Wild West , and Pacific coast .

Photochrom photographers would start the process by coating a printing plate with a light-sensitive emulsion and then exposing a glass plate photo negative onto it .

The photographers would erase the entire plate except for the area reserved for that specific color and make 10-15 more plates to fill out the composition . Photographic details were preserved , but an emotive , if slightly artificial , range of color was added .

Like the locomotives of that era , labor-intensive Photochroms lost steam as the first color film debuted in 1907 , and Kodak made color snapshots widely available with the release of Kodachrome cameras in 1935 . However , as a testament to the charm of the technique , the last Photochrom factory did n't close its doors until 1970 .
