With President Barack Obama , former President George W. Bush and other dignitaries attending a ceremony at the former World Trade Center site , heavily armed police officers and federal security agents -- some wearing body armor -- deployed in the area .

Roads were blocked and police checkpoints for both vehicles and pedestrians surrounded the memorial , with backpacks checked by bomb-sniffing dogs and put through x-ray machines .

At the ceremony , Obama and the first lady stood behind bulletproof protection .

Two of the three individuals believed to be involved in the potential plot on the 9/11 anniversary are Americans of Arab descent who traveled to the United States last week , according to a U.S. government official who spoke on condition of not being identified by name .

Authorities have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests , among other sources , to try to trace the whereabouts of the two , said the U.S. government official . A third person is believed to have been traveling through Europe , though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the United States , the government official said .

`` It 's still ongoing , '' New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Saturday . `` Nothing significant has changed . The threat has been identified as being credible and specific and uncorroborated . ''

American spy networks had intercepted communications of a potential attack from an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan , derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past , officials say .

U.S. officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts . In the days following the raid on Osama bin Laden 's compound , officials indicated al Qaeda had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the United States .

Authorities also say they have picked up `` chatter , '' or widely divergent communications , from extremists that suggest the newly tapped al Qaeda head , Ayman al-Zawahiri , is in some way involved in the current plot .

Three stolen trucks were added to a New York Police Department database because of the threat , said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul J. Browne . The database is connected to the NYPD 's digital license plate readers .

`` We 're adding them in the interest of being prudent , '' Browne told CNN , emphasizing there is no known link to the terror threat .

Both vehicles were subsequently recovered , the NYPD said Sunday .

One was discovered empty , unoccupied and unlocked in a residential area Saturday night by uniformed police on routine patrol . Police said they believe there is no connection between the stolen vehicle and any possible terror plot .

The second vehicle , a van , was found in Queens , said NYPD Lt. John Grimple . It was unoccupied , he said .

A Budget rental van also was stolen in a separate incident from a Jersey City , New Jersey , storage facility earlier this week , Kelly told CNN . He said none of the thefts had been tied to any terrorism plot at this point but were being investigated out of an abundance of caution .

Browne said that whoever took the trucks `` went to great lengths to cover their tracks -- they cut lines to phones and surveillance cameras . ''

Browne also said the city has experienced `` a three-fold increase in suspicious package calls , '' while suspicious vehicle calls have doubled .

`` I can tell people in this community -LRB- are -RRB- really on it , '' said Lanier , adding that her force had beefed up staffing .

In neighboring Prince George 's County , Maryland , officials located one of two missing U-Haul vans , though a police spokesman said authorities `` are not viewing this as terrorism-related . '' Cpl. Evan Baxter said the vans were reported stolen Saturday .

Because the man had already checked bags , Terminal B was evacuated and closed . A bomb squad and other officials located the man 's bags , all of which were opened and inspected .

No explosives were found , according to Bridget Patton with the FBI in Kansas City . She declined to provide any details on the man , who is being questioned .

A Transportation Security Administration statement said the security steps were taken `` out of an abundance of caution . ''

On Saturday , Obama met for a second straight day with his senior national security team , according to a White House statement .

He told NBC 's `` Today '' show that the administration 's main concern is a plot from a `` lone actor , not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the World Trade -LRB- Center -RRB- towers or the plane in Shanksville -LRB- Pennsylvania -RRB- or the Pentagon . ''

Police also were sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles , officials said .

Federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously , while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates .

`` The FBI has been in a planning mode for months with the local and state police officers , as well as the other intelligence agencies , to prepare for this weekend , '' said James McJunkin , assistant director in charge of the FBI 's Washington field office . `` What we have here is a little bit more of a public display than we normally have . ''

One official also noted a possibility that Pakistan-based groups such as Lashkar e-Tayyiba or Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan could be involved .

Al Qaeda `` likely maintained an interest since at least February 2010 in conducting large attacks in the homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates , to include the 10-year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , '' according to an intelligence bulletin issued Thursday .

Bin Laden 's death and the `` removal '' of senior al Qaeda figures since then could add to the organization 's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as September 11 , the bulletin said .
