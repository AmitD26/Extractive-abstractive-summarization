-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serving as a timely reminder to delegates convening for the Rio +20 Earth Summit , the International Union for Conservation of Nature -LRB- IUCN -RRB- has published its latest Red List detailing the ongoing threats to biodiversity on the planet .

A further 5,766 are `` endangered , '' while more than 10,000 species are listed as `` vulnerable . ''

`` Sustainability is a matter of life and death for people on the planet . A sustainable future can not be achieved without conserving biological diversity ... not only for nature itself but also for all seven billion people who depend on it , '' Julia Marton-Lefevre , IUCN director general , said in a statement .

Amphibious creatures like frogs , toads and newts are the most endangered group with 41 % facing extinction . A quarter of all mammals and 13 % of bird species are heading towards a similar fate .

Ocean biodiversity is continuing its decline with a third of all reef-building corals threatened by extinction which could cause potentially catastrophic consequences for humans .

More than 275 million people are dependent on coral reefs for food , coastal protection and their livelihoods , according to the IUCN .

`` The services and economic value that species provide are irreplaceable and essential to our well being , '' Jon Paul RodrÃguez , deputy chair , IUCN Species Survival Commission , said in a statement .

`` Recent work on plant assessments suggests that around one in five plants are threatened with extinction , '' says professor Stephen Hopper , director -LRB- CEO and chief scientist -RRB- , Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , England .

`` We have always adapted and innovated -- 10,000 years ago we innovated with agriculture . But we can only innovate if we have access to a full range of plant diversity , '' he added .

The seed bank at Kew , the largest of its kind in the world , currently stores 11 % -LRB- around 31,000 specimens -RRB- of the world 's plant species .

Smith says the plant extinctions that have occurred since the first Earth Summit in 1992 have all been entirely avoidable .

`` There is no technological reason why a plant species should become extinct . To collect and preserve an entire species which we can keep in the seed bank here for 200 years costs about Â £ 2,000 , '' he said .

Smith says the failures to forge ahead with environmental action in recent years have been down to lack of political will .

But he remains upbeat about Rio +20 .

But others , like Jim Leape , director general of WWF is deeply concerned that Rio +20 talks will stall .

In a statement released by WWF on Tuesday , Leape said the summit is `` doomed to ridicule '' unless world leaders `` get serious about sustainable development . ''

`` They 've added some positive actions around oceans protection . But the text has lots of words that ` commit ' parties to nothing -- such as ` commit to promote ' and ` commit to systematically consider , ' '' Leape said .

`` World leaders ` recognized ' problems 20 years ago , and they 've done little about them since . How long are we going to accept ` we 'll look into it ' as a solution ? '' he added .
