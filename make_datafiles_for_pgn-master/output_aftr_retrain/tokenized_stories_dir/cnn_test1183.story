-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Amid a grove of trees , buried beneath the grass and dirt , Mississippi 's past is colliding with its future .

But the location of the cemetery was lost to history . That 's until an estimated 2,000 unmarked graves were discovered during a survey for a planned campus expansion .

`` As development continues likely more are to be found , '' Erin Kimmerle , a forensic anthropology professor at the University of Florida , said .

Finding coffins

There were four , five and sometimes six boxes with only skeletal remains found here and there on the grounds . Once , in the 1990s , workers building a laundry facility found about 40 unmarked graves , said Jack Mazurak , a spokesman for the medical center .

But last year , that number jumped with the discovery of 66 coffins during a road improvement project at the campus .

Over the years , there were rumors . Depending on who you asked , the coffins contained the bodies of the Civil War dead or slaves .

But experts disagreed . Historical records revealed the area was not a major battlefield during the war , and there was no indication in the state historical archives that a slave cemetery existed on the site .

The medical center partnered with the Mississippi State University anthropology department , with a team led by Prof. Nicholas Hermann , that was tasked with removing the remains for testing .

`` We 're guessing because there 's no personal remains , no clothes , not even really any buttons or pins or anything , that they were probably residents of the asylum and either buried in a shroud or not buried with anything , so that would put them probably around in the mid to late 1800s to early 1900s , '' Derek Anderson , an archeologist on the team , told CNN affiliate WLBT shortly after the finds .

Once testing is finished , the bodies will be reinterred in the medical center 's designated cemetery , Hermann said .

` A lot of graves '

A number of factors , from historical records to the layout of the coffins , led Hermann to believe this was just the beginning of the find .

When he found out the medical center was planning on building a cancer center and a children 's justice center on the site , he said : `` I think you are going to have a lot of graves . ''

When residents died , few were claimed by families . Experts believe poverty may have also played a role -- families could not afford to retrieve and transport the bodies .

As a result , many were buried in unmarked graves in an area of the property believed designated as the asylum cemetery . Without headstones and markings to denote the outlines of the cemetery , it was swallowed up by time .

The answer : ground-penetrating radar .

The radar survey showed hundreds and hundreds of coffin-like outlines in tight rows . Many were believed to be just four or five feet below the surface .

Almost immediately , construction plans on the site were put on hold .

Already the university medical center was absorbing the cost to exhume and rebury the bodies found last year at a cost of about $ 3,000 each , Mazurak said .

`` There is a living link to each grave , '' Mazurak said .

Exhuming and reinterring upwards of 2,000 bodies would cost millions , a price the university ca n't afford . So for now , the medical center will leave the dead where they lie and look for alternatives for the expansion .

As news of the find made headlines , people across the country reached out to the medical center .

The questions , in many cases , were the same : Can you tell me if my family member is buried there ?

Searching for answers

White has spent years researching her family history , trying to piece together the path her family had taken from Mississippi north .

She grew up hearing stories about a great-grandmother who had been institutionalized at the asylum . The details were sketchy , and nobody was sure where the woman was buried or even what name she was buried under .

`` I guess you would call it a rumor in the family . They kept saying she was in an institution a little bit outside of Jackson , '' White said in a telephone call from her Detroit-area home .

`` I asked whether they could tell me if she was buried there , and what name she was buried under , '' she said . `` I 'm just trying to find out what our last name was then . ''

The volumes , all handwritten , are rich with detail , chronicling the name , age , ailment and admission date for every patient from between 1855 and 1935 , when the asylum was closed and relocated .

`` People are very concerned about their relatives , and that 's a driving factor , '' he said .

It 's a years-long project that requires digitizing the records as well as testing DNA , primarily from teeth of the remains . Those results , Hermann says , will reveal details about where the person grew up regionally .

By knowing where the dead came from and what they died of , it will help shed light on the history and treatment of mental health conditions across the state of Mississippi in the late 1800s and early 1900s , Hermann said .
