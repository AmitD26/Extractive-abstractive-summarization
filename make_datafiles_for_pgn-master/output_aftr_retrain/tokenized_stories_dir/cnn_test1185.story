The research findings were reported in this week 's issue of the journal , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , which came out Monday .

King Solomon is known in the Old Testament for his wisdom and wealth and for building the First Temple in Jerusalem .

The fabled mines entered popular culture in 1885 with the publication in Great Britain of the bestselling `` King Solomon 's Mines '' by Sir H. Rider Haggard . In the book , adventurers in search of the mines find gold , diamonds and ivory .

Thomas Levy of the University of California San Diego , who led the research , said carbon dating placed copper production at Khirbat en-Nahas -LRB- Arabic for ` Ruins of copper '' -RRB- in the 10th century -- in line with the biblical narrative of Solomon 's rule .

As early as the 1930s , archaeologists linked the site to the Edomite kingdom , but some of those claims were dismissed in subsequent years .

`` Now ... we have evidence that complex societies were indeed active in 10th and 9th centuries BCE and that brings us back to the debate about the historicity of the Hebrew Bible narratives related to this period , '' Levy said .
