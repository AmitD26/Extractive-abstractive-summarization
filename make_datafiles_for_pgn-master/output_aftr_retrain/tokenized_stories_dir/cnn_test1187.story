-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Sunday , the live Web broadcast of perhaps the world 's most prestigious science fiction awards ended up in the Twilight Zone . Blame it on an attack by ` bots .

The Hugo Awards were being streamed live on video site Ustream when , at 10:43 p.m. ET , the feed went dark during an acceptance speech by fantasy writer Neil Gaiman .

The reason ? Ustream says automated software designed to detect the unauthorized posting of copyrighted material was triggered when , before Gaiman 's speech , the ceremony showed clips of `` The Doctor 's Wife , '' an episode of the popular sci-fi series `` Doctor Who , '' that Gaiman penned .

Hunstable acknowledged that his site 's system for doing so was n't as clear as it should be . He said the automated system has been suspended until Ustream is able to `` better balance the needs of broadcasters , viewers , and copyright holders . ''

Perhaps as a boon to disappointed fans , Gaiman , a prolific Twitter user with more than 1.7 million followers , shared a link Monday to his video acceptance speech from when he won the SFX Award for screenwriting in February .

`` Copyright bots switched off the Hugo Award stream last night , '' he wrote .

Gaiman , whose `` Doctor Who '' episode explored the doctor 's most longstanding relationship in an unprecedented way , is known for the groundbreaking `` The Sandman '' graphic novel series and books like `` Neverwhere , '' `` American Gods '' and `` Coraline , '' which was turned into an Academy Award-nominated animated film in 2009 .
