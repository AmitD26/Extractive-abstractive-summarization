NEW : New fears for Timbuktu in Mali conflict

The climate in the south of Mali is more humid than in Timbuktu and the fragile rag paper texts are now showing signs of mildew and rot .

`` It would be the ultimate irony if all of these had survived the evacuation but had been destroyed because we do n't have the resources to archival box them and insert humidity traps for the period they are in exile , '' said Diakité , who has now started a campaign to raise the estimated $ 7 million it will cost to rescue the manuscripts .

The threat has been compounded , she said , by the pending rainy season in Mali which usually begins in the middle of June . Bamako , where the manuscripts are being held , has some of the country 's heaviest rain .

Diakité is now calling on the global community to join the fight to save what she describes as an irreplaceable collection which includes works of poetry , fiction , commerce , medical theory and religious thought .

`` Our ultimate goal is to return them to their home in Timbuktu , '' said Diakité .

But that wo n't happen , she said , unless the manuscripts can be protected now .
