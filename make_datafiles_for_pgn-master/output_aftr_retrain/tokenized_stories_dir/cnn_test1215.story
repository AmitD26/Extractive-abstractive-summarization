Translation : After two straight elections in which GOP fumbles kept Republicans in the minority , McConnell has another chance at running the Senate as majority leader , but that wo n't happen if he 's defeated here at home and knocked out of the game .

2014 midterms : Key races to watch

On the eve of primary day here , McConnell appears confident he has crushed his challenger from the right , Matt Bevin . But it remains to be seen how much of a toll the manpower and money he has spent against Bevin will take -- whether it will weaken him in what is expected to be the toughest campaign against a Democratic challenger in the three decades he has been in office .

It is also unclear whether the Republicans who do n't support McConnell in the primary will end up voting for him in the fall . McConnell 's campaign points out that Republican primary voters largely rallied around Rand Paul after a divisive GOP battle in 2010 and hope the same will happen this year for McConnell .

Grimes , a 35-year-old attorney and Kentucky 's secretary of state , has a classic campaign strategy against the 72-year-old , five-term Senate incumbent : it 's time for change .

To counter that , McConnell is using a classic strategy for a longtime incumbent . He is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn Kentuckians about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in Washington representing them instead of a potential Senate majority leader .

We put that to McConnell in a brief interview .

`` What Kentuckians have to decide is which direction they want the country to take , '' McConnell told CNN .

Poll : Democrats competitive in key Southern showdowns

Like Republicans all over the country , McConnell is trying hard to make this election a referendum on Obama , who lost Kentucky big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now .

The problem for McConnell is that he too has a high unfavorable rating , and Democrats here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall .

But McConnell has already been working hard to soften his image with positive television ads .

At their appearance in Bowling Green , she introduced McConnell by calling him her `` soul mate . ''

Grimes is unabashed in her quest to get female voters to the polls by reminding them that she would be their first female senator , but also by ripping McConnell on issues relating to women , such as his opposition to equal pay legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Act .

Grimes edges out McConnell in cash battle

`` Women in Kentucky have been treated just as badly in this environment as men have . Obamacare , you know women are typically those who manage their family 's health care . They 've been adversely impacted by Obamacare in a serious way . Surveys indicate women object to Obamacare even more than men . I think it ought to be pulled out from the root of the grass , and we ought to start over . I know that 's not the view of my opponent in the fall , '' McConnnell told CNN .

`` This election is not a referendum on the President . Nothing about this election is going to change who our President is , but we can actually change who is in Washington , D.C. , and put someone there who fights for the people of this state instead of looking out for his own job , '' Grimes told CNN .

Like other Democrats on the ballot this year , she sidestepped our questions about whether she would welcome the President 's help .

Grimes ' father was a prominent supporter of President Bill Clinton during his campaigns and presidency . The former President , whom she called `` family , '' has already been to Kentucky to raise money for Grimes .
