-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They 're books you 've likely seen in the hands of readers at the pool or under the shade of a beach umbrella , often a dog-eared paperback folded in two and smeared with sunscreen .

Click through the gallery above to see what makes each author 's reading list for the coming months , and read on to learn about their all-time favorite beach reads .

For summer , Emma Donoghue , of `` Frog Music '' and `` Room '' fame , wants `` a meaty plot ; brilliant language ; extra points for hilarity . '' She wants something she can read for hours on end , `` anything too delicious to spoil by only reading it in 10-minute snippets when you 're tired . '' Books from two Pulitzer Prize winners -- Jhumpa Lahiri and Michael Cunningham -- are on her to-read list this summer .

But a beach read does n't even need to be a book , Donoghue said . `` When I 'm on beaches I read magazines , because then it does n't matter so much if my kids spatter them with sunblock , mud or juice . ''

Joshua Ferris , author of `` To Rise Again at a Decent Hour ''

`` What I bring to the beach is whatever I 'm reading at the moment , and what I 'm reading at any given moment usually concerns death , misery and marital discord , which do n't seem too beachy , '' Ferris said . `` I find it impossible to alter my reading for the sake of a season , and I never want to take a vacation from being honestly and firmly in the world . ''

His favorite vacation read of all ? `` The back of a beer bottle . ''

Michael Koryta , author of `` The Prophet ''

`` It would need to be a very atmospheric book , one that transports you to another place . The setting need not be tropical but I feel it should be remote or at least romantic , '' he said .

This summer , Stephen King 's `` Mr. Mercedes '' and Jo Nesbo 's `` The Son '' make his list . But Koryta called Stephen King 's `` Bag of Bones '' hard to beat and said `` Jaws '' by Peter Benchley `` redefined the way people looked at the ocean from the beach . ''

Sarah Lotz , whose novel `` The Three , '' was released in May , prefers a beach read `` that can be put down and picked up without straining my brain -LRB- it 's quite easily strained -RRB- . '' She said crime and fantasy are among her favorites , `` something I can lose myself in . ''

`` I think the whole of my generation was glued to it in the '80s , '' she said . `` It 's a truly horrible novel in a lot of ways , but I was absolutely sucked in by the melodrama of it , and whenever I think of it , I smell coconut suntan oil . ''

Jojo Moyes , whose romance `` The Girl You Left Behind '' will be available in paperback in June , said vacation is the perfect opportunity for something more challenging . This year , it will be `` The Vacationers , '' by Emma Straub .

`` The ability to sit and read for long stretches means that I read books that might be a little more challenging than in my everyday life , when I tend to fall asleep after two pages , '' Moyes said . `` A couple of years ago , I read Hilary Mantel 's ` Bring Up The Bodies , ' which I 'm pretty sure I would n't have managed at the end of a working day .
