The meaningful cases in law almost always involve a clash of virtues . School prayer cases , for instance , sometimes balance two virtues reflected in the Constitution itself : The guarantee of free exercise of religion , and a bar on the establishment of a state religion .

On the side of execution without further delay , the virtue upheld is that of `` finality of judgment . '' That is , once a verdict and judgment are rendered , it should be difficult to upset . Victims ' family members sometimes see a promise in that judgment , and finality renders a certainty to the process that some see as promoting deterrence of crime .

Congress , in passing bills such as 1996 's Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act -LRB- which strictly limited the ability of someone like Troy Davis to receive relief by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus -RRB- , sought to promote this value . The Supreme Court has also repeatedly cited `` finality of judgment '' as an important value in cutting off appeals .

Other than the mention of capital punishment itself , it is hard to see much support in the Constitution for the virtue of finality .

Deliberation is a predominant central virtue promoted by the Constitution . That document requires that in criminal cases , there be an initial appearance , indictment by a grand jury , representation by counsel and the right to not only appeal a conviction but to petition for habeas corpus . All of these slow down the process . Above all , our Constitution expressly mandates `` Due Process , '' even when that process produces delay and uncertainty , as it is bound to do . Deliberation is what makes us civilized , and when it fails , we fail profoundly .

A second virtue , mercy , is also an explicit part of the Constitution . The federalists insisted on the inclusion of the pardon power , for example , for the express reason that it gives the system some outlet for this core virtue . -LRB- In Davis ' case , it is the Georgia Board of Pardons and Parole that had the power to grant clemency -RRB- .

The Troy Davis case shows us a truth : We have wandered too far from our own best virtues .

If we are to err , let it be on the side of deliberation and mercy , rather than the unsettling finality we have seen pursued by the state of Georgia . Should we choose those better virtues , we might all sleep better .
