-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ecuador international Christian Benitez , the top scorer in the Mexican league last season , has died suddenly at the age of 27 .

The striker popularly known as ` Chucho ' passed away in the Qatari capital Doha , one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish .

Having played at the 2006 World Cup as a youngster , Benitez had developed into an important component of an Ecuadorian side bidding to reach next year 's finals in Brazil .

His 24 international goals make him the third highest scorer overall for Ecuador 's national team .

Jose Chamorro , the player 's agent , told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital , where he had been taken after complaining of abdominal pains .

Manchester United star Antonio Valencia , an international colleague of Benitez who played with the striker at leading Ecuadorian side El Nacional a decade ago , was among those struggling to come to terms with the loss .

Ecuador 's interior minister Jose Serrano was among those who took to the micro-blogging site to comment , writing : `` Dear Chucho , thank you for your goals and your happiness . ''

Sunderland 's Craig Gardner , who played with Benitez at Birmingham City between 2009 and 2010 , was also moved to comment .

`` His sudden departure is a big shock for each member of the technical and administrative staff . He was a player that over the short period he was here was regarded for his high moral character . ''

After leaving the Quito side , who posted a tribute on their website to Christian on Monday , the South American plied his trade with such success for Mexico 's Santos Laguna that he alerted the interest of the English Premier League .

`` Christian will always be present in our hearts and we will never forget you . Rest in peace , '' read the club website .

Benitez 's last international goal came when in a 4-1 World Cup qualifying win over Paraguay in Quito in March .

The Ecuadorians , who failed to qualify for the 2010 finals in South Africa , lie third in South American qualifying , with a quarter of the campaign still left to play .

The top four teams in the nine-team group will automatically qualify for the 2014 World Cup .
