-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israel 's monthlong assault on the Palestinians has taken a heavy toll , with some 2,000 Palestinians killed and 10,000 more wounded . Most of these victims were civilians and many of them children , representing just the latest bloody chapter in a tragic history .

The people of Gaza need three things . First , they need a peace agreement that ends the hostilities and lifts an Israeli siege that has been in place since 2007 and has turned Gaza into what some journalists have called `` an open-air jail . ''

Second , the Palestinians in Gaza need humanitarian aid and funding for development , so they can rebuild their shattered lives , their bombed-out neighborhoods and their fractured communities .

Qatar has already provided humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza and we have pledged to assist with rebuilding efforts once hostilities have ended . But we are also working behind the scenes to facilitate the kind of dialogue that can lead to a lasting peace . Ultimately , Qatar wants to help the Palestinians realize their self-determination by establishing a secure Palestinian state .

It is precisely because we are impartial that we are often approached to mediate and create platforms for dialogue between different factions . In 2008 , for example , we were able to broker a peace agreement between the various factions battling for supremacy in southern Lebanon . Later , we played a similar role in Darfur . Over the years we have hosted an Israeli Trade Mission and kept our door open to Western think tanks like the Brookings Institution .

More recently , because of our open door policy , we were able to help negotiate the exchange of an American soldier for five Taliban prisoners . And today we are helping facilitate communication between the United States , the United Nations , our Arab neighbors , Israel and Hamas as the various parties struggle to find a peaceful solution to the violence in Gaza .

Qatar stands ready to help reconcile differences and advance the prospects for peace . We stand ready to play our part in advancing dialogue and achieving solutions to the seemingly intractable problems confronting the people of the Middle East . Some of these problems , like Gaza , have been years or even decades in the making . But that does not mean they can not be solved . The bleeding , the suffering and the dying must be stopped .

In Qatar , we will always keep an open door to peace .
