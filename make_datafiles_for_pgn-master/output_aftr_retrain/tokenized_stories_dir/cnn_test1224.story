-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An international music awards show announced a new Adele album Tuesday -- but nothing 's happening , says her label chief .

The confusion started with a tweet from the World Music Awards , an international contest that has been broadcast from such locales as Los Angeles , Las Vegas and Monaco .

In a tweet , the show said , '' #adele confirms 2015 Tour After The Release Of Her New Album ' 25 ' ! ''

So what 's the deal with the World Music Awards ? It may have gotten attention for the tweet , but Billboard observed that the contest is `` something of a curiosity on the international awards calendar . '' The American broadcast of its 2014 show was supposed to run on NBC but did n't because of `` technical issues . ''

Adele herself has said little . She did hint in May that a new work could be in the offing , but her Twitter account has mostly been silent , with just three tweets since that May 4 post . -LRB- The most recent promoted an album by Example . -RRB-

Oh , and `` 21 '' won the Grammy for album of the year .
