-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He 's fired darts at a gray whale , sped through St Petersburg in an F1 car , and taken a supersonic flight in a bomber jet .

Now Russia 's `` action man '' president , Vladimir Putin , has again flexed his muscle in his latest testosterone-filled publicity stunt -- diving to the bottom of the Baltic sea aboard a red submersible to explore a 19th century shipwreck .

State television showed images of the Russian strongman carefully inspecting the wreck from the front seat of the glass-fronted capsule .

It 's not the first time the thrill-seeking president has taken to the water in a bid to highlight his intrepid spirit and physical prowess .

In 2009 , Putin dived to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia aboard a mini-submarine .

Then in 2011 the Russian leader announced he had discovered two ancient urns while scuba diving in the Black Sea . Though , embarrassingly for the president , the Kremlin last year admitted the stunt was staged .
