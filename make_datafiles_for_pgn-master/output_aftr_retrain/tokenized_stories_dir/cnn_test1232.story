Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The year 2012 was supposed to herald Hillary Clinton 's swan song , a golden departure amid speculation that she might consider another run at the presidency in 2016 .

An independent review released Tuesday cited `` systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies '' at the agency Clinton heads . The review board completed its investigation this week . Clinton received a copy of the report on Monday and said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its recommendations , including strengthening security , adding fire safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas .

Citing health reasons , Clinton delays testimony

Clinton , who had been recovering from stomach flu last week and a concussion following a fainting spell , informed the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees over the weekend that , at the advice of her doctors , she would be unable to testify at upcoming hearings about the deadly events in Benghazi . In her place , deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns testified on Thursday .

Initially , that did not sit well with some members of Congress , especially Republicans , who have been highly critical of the Obama administration 's handling of the Libya attack .

Ros-Lehtinen issued a statement saying , `` We still do n't have information from the Obama administration on what went so tragically wrong in Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of four patriotic Americans . We have been combing through classified and unclassified documents and have tough questions about State Department threat assessments and decision-making on Benghazi . This requires a public appearance by the Secretary of State herself . Other Cabinet secretaries involved should also be held publicly accountable . ''

Lawmakers are right to demand answers of Clinton , said David Rothkopf , editor of Foreign Policy magazine .

Rice attacked for Benghazi comments

U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice withdrew her name from consideration to become the top U.S. diplomat after drawing heavy criticism from Arizona Sen. John McCain and other Republicans over her public statements about the Benghazi attacks .

In a letter to Obama , Rice said the Senate `` confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive , and costly â € '' to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities . That trade off is simply not worth it to our country . ''

Clinton praised Rice as a capable leader and insisted `` she made very clear in her appearances that the information was subject to change , as more facts were gathered and analyzed by the intelligence community '' in a press conference at the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe -LRB- OSCE -RRB- conference in Dublin earlier this month .

Disciplinary actions at State

State Department resignations follow Benghazi report

But there is no reason to think Clinton 's presidential prospects are dimmed , political experts say .

Before the report came out , Clinton had enjoyed wildly popular approval ratings in nationwide polls . A Bloomberg National Poll released this month showed 70 % of Americans have a mostly or very favorable view of Clinton , with 24 % holding a mostly or very unfavorable opinion of the nation 's top diplomat . Similar polls from Politico/George Washington University , ABC News/Washington Post and the Siena College Research Institute showed consistent high marks .

`` Think about 2012 when Benghazi was a fresh issue . How much did it help the GOP in the end ? Somewhere between nada and zilch . Only a small portion of the electorate seemed interested , and overwhelmingly , they were already voting Republican , '' Sabato said . `` I have a hard time believing that Benghazi will make much difference after the passage of four more years . ''

Rothkopf agrees .

`` Further , truth be told , the misfires prior to Benghazi really occurred much farther down the food chain within the State Department , '' he said . `` Suggesting errors in judgment regarding a particular post in a particular country fall within the direct purview of the Secretary of State is a gross misreading of the nature and demands of her job .
