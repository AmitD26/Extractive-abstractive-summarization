Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A newly published edition of an authoritative Chinese dictionary has come under fire for leaving out the homosexual definition of a word commonly used to refer to gay men and lesbians .

The committee charged with revising and updating the dictionary said they chose to leave out the definition because they did n't want to encourage its use , the director of the committee Jiang Langsheng told Chengdu Business Daily .

Coming out of the closet in China

`` It 's unacceptable that the ` gay ' meaning of ` tongzhi ' was excluded from the dictionary , a reference book written for all , simply because of the compilers ' own preferences and values , '' Nan Feng , a gay rights activist told the state-run news agency Xinhua .

Like activists , linguists are also unhappy with the decision to leave out a term that is widely used in daily Chinese dialogue .

`` There have always been good words and bad ones , '' Cui Yan , a planning editor for Science and Technology Document Press , told Beijing Business Daily . `` But they are all linguistic phenomena . Just because the dictionary does n't include them does n't mean they do n't exist . ''

Across the web , people have spoken out about the lack of the colloquial definition of `` tongzhi . ''

One user on China 's microblogging site Sina Weibo , who calls himself `` Yves Hugo '' said `` Tongzhi are there . They are a group of people . Whether you ` encourage or not . ' Tongzhi means gay people . The definition will be in dictionary at some point . ''
