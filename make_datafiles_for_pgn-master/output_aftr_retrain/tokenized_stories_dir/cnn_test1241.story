-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked enforcement of an Arizona abortion law that opponents call one of the most restrictive in the country .

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday put the controversial parts of the law on hold while further legal challenges proceed . The San Francisco-based court also moved the case on a judicial fast-track and said it would tackle the issue as soon as possible later this year .

Those groups said in their successful emergency appeal the ban would force doctors to wait until a woman with a high-risk pregnancy was close to death or would suffer major medical damage before terminating a high-risk pregnancy .

The Arizona ban would also apply to women who have been informed the fetus would not survive after birth .

`` We are relieved that the court blocked this dangerous ban and that women in Arizona will continue to be able to get safe , appropriate medical care , '' said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project . `` Abortion is a serious , personal decision that should be made by a woman , her family and her doctor -- not by politicians . ''

Many Arizona state prosecutors , who would have enforced the law , were at odds on whether the law should be put on hold until its constitutionality was ultimately determined in the courts .

Gov. Jan Brewer signed the new law in April . She had supported Judge James Teilborg 's decision Monday to allow the new law to proceed , saying it protects women and children . The appeals court 's new order now puts that enforcement on hold .
