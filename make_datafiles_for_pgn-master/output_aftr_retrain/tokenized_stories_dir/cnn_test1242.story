Martin was at the British consulate in Jerusalem , the Foreign Office said . His family said they expect him to fly home to London over the weekend .

Ahmed Yousef , an adviser to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh , said the decision to release Martin was made as a `` good will gesture '' and was in response to the many calls they had received to let him go .

Martin is a documentary maker who has worked for the BBC , ITN , and other broadcasters , and reported for the British newspaper The Times . He was arrested February 14 by Hamas on suspicions he was involved with Israeli espionage activity .

Martin 's wife , Anne , said the family was `` extremely relieved '' at her husband 's release .

British consular officials had been allowed to visit Martin while he was jailed and the British Foreign office had publicly called for his release . The Tel Aviv Foreign Press Association had also called on Hamas to release Martin , asking the group `` to respect the rights of every journalist on assignment , to work without fear of being arrested . ''

Before Hamas took over Gaza in 2007 , the kidnapping and abduction of foreign journalists was a frequent occurrence as part of the factional warfare in the territory .

Since that time , no foreign journalists have been abducted . BBC journalist Alan Johnston was being held by another group in 2007 , and was released shortly after Hamas took power .

Palestinian journalists are subject to various forms of restriction and intimidation by authorities in Gaza , but Martin 's case was the first time Hamas had arrested a foreign journalist .
