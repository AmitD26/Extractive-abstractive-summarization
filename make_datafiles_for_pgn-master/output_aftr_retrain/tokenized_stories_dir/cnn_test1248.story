COCOA , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ask just about any college student , and they 'll tell you they 'd jump through hoops to avoid taking a class that meets Fridays .

Brevard Community College used $ 267,000 in energy savings to add 10 new full-time faculty positions .

It worked out better than anyone could have imagined , Drake says .

`` If it were n't for the savings that we have netted from energy management and the four-day workweek , we would not have been able to do several of the vital things that are going to help us attract and retain even more students , '' Drake said .

Brevard Community College began the four-day workweek during the 2007 summer session . The following fall and spring , it added a half-day but then went back to the four-day work week again this summer . iReport.com : Are you working a four-day week ?

Over that year-long period , by closing on Fridays and turning down the air conditioning and heating systems , the college saved $ 267,000 in energy costs . The savings allowed Brevard to hire 10 full-time faculty members . Watch : Shorter work week boosts morale , productivity ''

Stile , who is a single mom , saves a 50-mile round trip with the four days of classes . She spends the extra day with her son , which means one less day she has to pay for child care . She says she can also get more done .

Evers , who drives nearly 100 miles a day from Orlando , Florida , to take a biology class at Brevard , saves gas and says the Friday off is a win-win .

`` I get an extra day to go to work , and I have an extra day to study , '' Evers said .

The four-day workweek at Brevard has yielded even more positive results : There 's been a 44 percent reduction in staff turnover , according to Drake .

`` We have had a 50 percent increase in applications for employment during the same period this year as opposed to last year , '' Drake said .

Drake says he often receives calls from other colleges and universities wanting to know how it 's working . It 's working so well that when the fall semester begins , Brevard Community College will shift to a year-round four-day workweek .

Although the change has been a welcome relief to some workers , it 's created hardships for others .

Mylitta Barrett , a single mother , says the switch means she spends less time with her three sons .

Barrett now needs a sitter in the mornings to care for her severely disabled son , Joseph , until his bus comes and says she has less time for her other boys as well .

`` You ca n't make up the soccer game that I missed on Monday because you were working and did n't get home until seven o'clock at night , '' Barrett said .

`` I do n't like being thrown in this position where my life is going to get more difficult because of energy savings or whatever reason they decided to do this , '' Barrett said .

Whether the four-day workweek will prove to be just a short-term solution to rising energy costs or is here to stay , only time will tell .
