The company apologized , but that has n't stopped a lot of the chatter criticizing Acura for not doing more to keep the casting agency in check . This really is n't a new story considering how many times in the past we 've heard similar stories , including that advertising agencies have non-urban dictates like refusing to buy advertising space on black-focused radio , TV , magazine and online properties .

Worldwide , nearly $ 500 million is spent on bleaching products , an effort for people with darker skin to lighten their skin . This is pretty laughable considering the lengths some whites go to darken their skin through tanning beds or even spray painting a bronze look in order to appear darker . -LRB- I 'm still trying to figure out the skin tone of Speaker of the House John Boehner . -RRB-

But there is another critical discussion that must be had , and that is the belief that the lighter skinned you are , the better your life will be .

The effects of this mindset are examined in the documentary `` Dark Girls , '' produced by actor/director Bill Duke and directed by Chan Berry .

Facilitator : Show me the smart child .

-LSB- A Black child 's hand points to the fairest-skinned depiction among a spectrum of drawings of a little girl , identical , save for the skin color -RRB- .

Facilitator : And why is she the smart child ?

Child : 'Cause she is white .

Facilitator : OK . Show me the dumb child .

-LSB- The little girl , who is brown-skinned , points to the drawing of the child with the darkest skin -RRB- .

Child : Because she black .

Facilitator : Show me the good-looking child .

-LSB- The little girl points to the fairest drawing . -RSB-

Facilitator : And why is she the good-looking child ?

In addition to the Acura controversy , there have been complaints that on album covers and magazine ads , the skin of Beyonce , who is already light-skinned , is made even lighter to make her appear white .

Even when it comes to dating , some black men have the view , `` Light is bright ; she 's alright . ''

Berry says it 's vital that we have real discussions about this issue .

`` I want to continue what has happened six months ago when we dropped the trailer on everybody -- to know that -- to recognize that there is an issue with us , and then start the healing process , '' he said . `` If you recognize that you have an issue , and then open up about it and start talking about it , that 's when the healing begins .

`` So with our film -- we 're not psychiatrists , or psychologists , or sociologists , Roland . We 're just filmmakers who decided to point a lens at this particular subject , this issue , to say , ` Listen . This is how we can fix this , possibly . Just open up and talk about it , ' because , as Bill says , you 're not going to find anything outside of yourself to heal this . It 's going to come from within . ''

While `` Dark Girls '' -LRB- www.officialdarkgirlsmovie.com -RRB- makes its way across the country , Duke and Berry are working on their next documentary , which will deal with light-skinned black women .

Because she was afraid of her black relatives showing up and exposing their secret .
