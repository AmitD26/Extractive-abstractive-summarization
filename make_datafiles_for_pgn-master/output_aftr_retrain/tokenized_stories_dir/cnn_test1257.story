Sometimes Ebola , or cholera or other infectious diseases , emerge and are brought under control , but the current Ebola crisis in West Africa continues to grow . What makes the critical difference in quickly controlling an outbreak ?

Luck plays a part . Where the first cases emerge , what the weather is like , the coincidence of holidays and migration can all make a difference in how quickly disease spreads . Biology also matters , including the unexpected evolution of pathogens and the level of prior exposure and immunity in populations at risk . Health infrastructure is important too . Countries that invest little in health -- including training health personnel and public health surveillance and diagnostic capacity -- will struggle to mount a rapid and effective response .

Although Ebola is not transmitted by water , fears spread in Liberia that the government was poisoning wells to increase the number of cases . In Guinea , on August 29 , people rioted when a market was sprayed with disinfectant they believed was infected with the Ebola virus , with more than 50 injured . People attacked health workers and the hospital in Guinea 's second largest city , Nzerekore , shouting : `` Ebola is a lie ! ''

Early on , there were violent clashes between security forces and angry residents trying to leave . A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot , and four other residents were wounded . In addition , residents who could afford it bribed security forces to get out , while others fled by swimming away or escaped when security was lax . Access to routine health care inside the quarantine zone was limited and there were reports of pregnant women desperate for help .

Meanwhile , on September 6 in Sierra Leone , government officials announced a three-day quarantine to facilitate detecting cases through house-to-house searches . Yet detecting Ebola cases is not necessarily straightforward , and Sierra Leone does n't have sufficient capacity to hospitalize everyone it may identify . Doctors Without Borders issued a statement that `` lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola as they end up driving people underground and jeopardizing the trust between people and health providers . This leads to the concealment of potential cases and ends up spreading the disease further . ''

So what can be done ?

Efforts to ensure that survivors are not shunned and stigmatized are also important , and survivors , who are immune from reinfection , can play an important role in the response . In other words : Ensure that the Ebola response respects human rights .

Access to health information and treatment , involving the community in the planning and response to the epidemic , making sure that restrictions on liberty and movement are imposed only when they are strictly necessary -- these are all human rights principles that are codified in international treaties .

Of course , respecting , protecting and fulfilling human rights is not a magic bullet to stop a disease in its tracks . But , as we 've seen in the current Ebola outbreak , failing to implement a response in line with human rights principles can increase the risk that a small outbreak will become a much larger one .
