Spot gold prices tumbled by more than $ 100 an ounce , or 8.7 per cent , in a few hours on Monday amid a rout in metals markets , while silver fell 11 per cent . Faltering European demand and weaker than expected Chinese economic data depressed oil prices , pushing Brent crude down by 3 per cent to $ 100.02 a barrel , a nine-month low .

The S&P 500 recorded its worst session in six months , closing 2.3 per cent lower as energy and materials companies tumbled .

Gold has enjoyed a stellar run over the past decade . Prices surged more than sevenfold since 2001 to an all-time high of $ 1,920 a troy ounce in 2011 , as investors turned to the metal as a haven from turmoil in the rest of the financial world .

But as fears over the eurozone debt crisis recede and investors bet on a recovery in the US , sentiment towards gold has suffered . Credit Suisse , Société Générale and Goldman Sachs have all called the end of the bull market in recent months .

In addition to Mr Paulson 's $ 3.1 bn holding of shares in a gold exchange traded fund , at the end of last year Mr Paulson 's hedge funds controlled shares in at least nine gold miners worth almost $ 1.1 bn at current prices , according to regulatory filings . More than half of that is in one stock , AngloGold Ashanti , where Paulson & Co is the largest holder with a 7.35 per cent stake .

AngloGold Ashanti shares have dropped 39.5 per cent so far this year .

John Reade , Paulson & Co partner and gold strategist , said that the fund had not changed its long-term thesis on gold , arguing that quantitative easing by the world 's central banks would ultimately lead to higher inflation : `` Federal governments have been printing money at an unprecedented rate creating demand for gold as an alternative currency . It is this expectation of global paper currency debasement which makes gold an attractive long-term investment . ''

More than half Paulson & Co assets are denominated in gold including the great majority of Mr Paulson 's own fortune , according to people familiar with the firm .

The Tudor hedge fund has been betting against the gold price this year , according to people familiar with the situation . Tudor declined to comment .

Traders added that Cyprus ' decision last week to sell a portion of its gold reserves as part of a bail-out deal had dealt a sharp blow to confidence in the market , arousing fears that other eurozone countries with much larger gold reserves could follow suit .
