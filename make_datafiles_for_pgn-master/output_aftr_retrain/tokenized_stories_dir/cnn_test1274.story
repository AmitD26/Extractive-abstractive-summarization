Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Five U.S. service members were killed when a helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan , a U.S. official said early Tuesday .

The U.S. official , who did not want to be identified , did not offer additional information about the victims .

It was the first coalition helicopter crash with fatalities since September , when two separate crashes killed a total of 11 coalition service members .

One occurred in early September , killing two ; the other in the third week , killing seven service members and injuring two more .

In August 2011 , a helicopter went down killing at least 30 U.S. service members , the single deadliest loss for U.S. troops in the Afghan war . Insurgents shot down the CH-47 Chinook , which was carrying 25 U.S. special operations forces .

Some the those who died belonged to the same covert unit that conducted the raid that killed Osama bin Laden , though they were not the same men , a military official said at the time .
