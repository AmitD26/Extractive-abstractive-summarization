Zhang Dejiang , a Chinese vice premier , will replace Bo as Communist Party chief of Chongqing , the biggest metropolis in southwestern China , the official news agency Xinhua reported Thursday .

But in recent weeks , his foothold near the summit of the Chinese Communist Party started to crumble .

Wang Lijun , the man who helped Bo spearhead the anti-criminal crackdown , was also at the heart of the scandal that appears to have brought him down .

Wang is a decorated policeman whom Bo appointed as Chongqing 's police chief . Following the well publicized anti-crime push , Wang became a vice mayor of the city .

But in early February , he set off a frenzy of intrigue and speculation by entering the U.S. consulate in Chengdu , six hours ' drive from Chongqing , and staying there for one day . Rumors began to circulate that he had tried to defect .

The Chinese prime minister , Wen Jiabao , hinted at the level of displeasure in Beijing about the affair during a news conference Wednesday . He said the Chongqing authorities must `` seriously '' reflect on and draw lessons from the Wang incident .

His comments now appear to have been an early indication of the fate awaiting Bo .

`` The news came faster than I expected , '' said Wenran Jiang , political science professor at the University of Alberta . But Bo 's removal was `` not surprising , given Wen Jiabao 's tone , '' he said .

Bo , 62 , had served as Chongqing party chief since November 2007 . Before that , he was party chief of Liaoning Province , where huge state-run corporations were concentrated . He also served as minister of commerce and mayor of Dalian , a progressive coastal city in northeastern China .
