-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was an election night like none other , in every sense of the phrase . In addition to the obvious -- the selection of the nation 's first black president -- Tuesday night 's coverage on CNN showcased groundbreaking technology .

CNN 's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York .

And he was right . Cue CNN political correspondent Jessica Yellin .

`` Hi Wolf ! '' said Yellin , waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network 's New York City studios . Or at least , that 's the way it appeared at first glance .

Jay Leno has poked fun at the hologram , and mash-up spoofs that replace Yellin 's voice with Carrie Fisher 's lines from the movie already are making their way around the Internet .

CNN dubbed it a `` hologram '' -- a three-dimensional image that 's been reproduced . And it 's the brainchild of a few people . A hologram creates an image using coherent light , such as lasers ; CNN 's technique used conventional cameras to capture multiple images from different angles .

`` About a dozen years , I 've been trying to do it , '' David Bohrman , CNN 's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief , said to Blitzer on `` The Situation Room '' on Wednesday . `` I 've basically been a crazy mad scientist trying to get it done . ''

Chuck Hurley , the Washington bureau 's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the `` hologram , '' called it simple chroma-key technology that 's been taken `` to the Nth degree . '' Watch the hologram on air ''

On Tuesday night , Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio . Technicians placed a round piece of red laminate on the studio floor where she was `` beamed in '' so that Blitzer would know where to look .

Gal Oz , a SportVU designer who came to the United States to work with CNN on the endeavor , said it was originally designed `` to create a matrix effect in sports '' -- in other words , to provide 360 degrees of perspective for instant replays .

But it has n't been used for its intended purpose yet . Instead , for the past three months , the company has been perfecting it for CNN 's election coverage , Oz said . Tuesday night 's live interview of Yellin was essentially the technology 's world debut as well .

Hurley and Oz agree that as good as the image looked on television Tuesday , it can look even more realistic . Hurley said the blue glow around Yellin and Will.i.am was added intentionally to avoid confusion .

`` You do n't want to have the effect where it looks so good that for every future live shot , you have people on the blogs saying , ` Oh they 're not really there -- they 're in a studio , faking the moon landing . ' ''

Hurley said considering it was CNN 's first real `` test launch '' with the high-end gadgetry , they were `` beyond thrilled . '' That 's not to say there were n't setbacks .

Hurley and Oz both said they could n't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology . But could this become a staple of future TV news ?

`` We 'll see . It was a little ornament on the tree , '' Bohrman said . `` But television evolves , and how we do things evolves , and at some point -- maybe it 's five years or 10 years or 20 years down the road -- I think there 's going to be a way that television does interviews like this because it allows for a much more intimate possibility for a remote interview . ''

The day after her virtual appearance in New York , Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining , even when it 's presenting important political stories .

`` We do serious journalism , but we also have fun . This is fun . This is about what we can do , about pushing the envelope and pushing the boundaries , '' she said . `` Someday when this is even more advanced , having a fuller visual field for interview subjects could give viewers even more of a sense of people . ''

Now , in hindsight , Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better `` Star Wars '' joke .
