WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judicial council on Thursday admonished the chief judge of the nation 's largest federal appeals court for having `` sexually explicit photos and videos '' on his personal Web site , but decided against any further punishment .

Judge Alex Kozinski , 58 , of the San Francisco , California-based 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals previously apologized and had recommended an investigation because of the public controversy over the material .

But Kozinski was not disciplined because he had removed himself from an ongoing obscenity trial when news broke of the visual material on alex.kozinski.com , which the judge launched in 2002 , according to the 41-page opinion issued by the judicial council .

According to the council 's written opinion , the material included a photograph of naked women painted like dairy cows , a woman shaving her pubic hair , and a video of a half-dressed man `` cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal . ''

He admitted storing some of the sexually explicit photos , but said , `` I do n't know why I kept them . ''

The judge also said he never considered his site public and thought he had blocked access to the subcategory file in question , which was labeled `` stuff . ''

`` I have caused embarrassment to the federal judiciary , '' he said . `` And thus whatever shame was cast on me personally , it reflected on my colleagues and our system of justice as well . ''

The controversy erupted when Kozinski was about to serve as a trial judge -- separate from his work on the higher appeal court -- in a 2008 obscenity prosecution of adult film producer Ira Isaacs . Kozinski recused himself when the Los Angeles TImes published a story about the Web site material , and he later asked for a probe into the incident .

The Isaacs case has not gone to trial , but is on appeal over pending motions at the 9th Circuit . Kozinski is not expected to take part in the matter .

He is especially outspoken in oral arguments on his appeals court , and his detractors say he tends to dominate the questioning , often to the dismay of his fellow judges .
