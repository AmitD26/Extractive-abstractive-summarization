-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 800 people have been killed in a key Syrian city over the past 40 days , a Syrian monitoring group said Sunday .

Most of those killed were ISIS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters , battling for control of Kobani , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .

The group said 302 Syrian Kurdish fighters were also killed .

Two civilians beheaded

The real death toll could be a lot higher .

The group said it believes the actual casualty figure is twice the number documented , `` because there is absolute secrecy on casualties and due to the difficulty of access to many areas and villages that have witnessed violent clashes and bombardment by the two sides . ''

Video from Kobani on Sunday showed a plume of smoke rising above the city , known in Arabic as Ayn al-Arab .

Most of the city 's 200,000 people have fled across the border into neighboring Turkey .
