-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A retired American doctor who was working with Ebola patients in West Africa returned to the United States -- and put himself in quarantine .

He plans to be in isolation for 21 days , which is the incubation period for the disease -- or the time between infection and onset of symptoms .

`` My last encounter with a patient who had Ebola was on July 19 , '' he said . `` I contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on my arrival ... and informed them I had been in West Africa and my history . ''

Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood , saliva , urine and other secretions of infected people .

Patients are only contagious when they show symptoms , not during the incubation period , according to the World Health Organization .

`` I was not concerned that I was contagious when I left Africa , and not concerned at this time because I have no symptoms of the disease , '' Jamison said .

The retired pediatrician said he was volunteering with Medical Teams International .

So far , the disease has been confined to Liberia , Sierra Leone and Guinea . One man died in quarantine in Nigeria after leaving Liberia .

Dr. Kent Brantly arrived in Georgia on Saturday aboard a specially equipped plane and was taken to Emory University Hospital .

The treatment of the patients will be conducted under strict safety protocols , U.S. officials said .

There 's no cure for Ebola . The most common approach is to support organ functions and keep up bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection .

Despite the risks , Jamison said he 'd return to West Africa to help combat Ebola .
