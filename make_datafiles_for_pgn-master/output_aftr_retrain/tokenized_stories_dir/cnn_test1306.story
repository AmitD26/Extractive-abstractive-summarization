The 73-year-old Cianci lost a Providence mayor 's race for the first time in seven runs on Tuesday , falling to political neophyte Jorge Elorza .

`` It just did n't happen , '' Cianci said in his concession speech . `` But that does n't mean that we do n't have the heart and the spirit and the love for this city to say that we would n't do it again if we needed to . ''

Unofficial results , posted on Rhode Island 's elections board website , showed Elorza winning 53 % of the vote , with Cianci getting about 44 % support .

Had their roles been reversed , Cianci 's swearing-in ceremony in January would have marked the fifth consecutive decade in which he has served as the city 's mayor .

Not all those terms , however , were continuous -- though they very well might have been had he not been forced to resign twice in disgrace .

`` In this mayor 's two administrations , there has been more corruption in the city of Providence than in the history of this state , '' said Judge Ernest Torres .

`` You 're not going to get a Pulitzer Prize or an Emmy by saying ` Buddy Cianci is a convicted felon , ' '' Cianci told CNN at his Providence headquarters recently . `` Everybody knows that . ''

But Elorza , his Democratic opponent , was n't taking any chances .

`` We have a storied history of corruption here in our city , '' he said at an October press conference . `` And those incidents of corruption are very well-documented in Mr. Cianci 's administration . ''

As to his own future , Cianci remains a staple on local talk radio . And it 's hard to totally count out someone who ran for -- and nearly won -- a job that he twice lost due to convictions .

Following cries of `` No ! '' from his supporters , Cianci promptly added , `` For this year . ''
