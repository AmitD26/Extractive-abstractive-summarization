Almost 30,000 travelers filled out the survey in just a few days , in exchange for 8,000 Spirit reward miles .

It turns out that travelers ' hate was n't only directed at Spirit , according to the airline 's own survey . Passengers are mad at most U.S. airlines .

`` I think if any organization asks for feedback , you would expect the vast majority of responses would be directed at the company that seeks it , '' Ben Baldanza , Spirit 's president and CEO , said in a statement . `` But in this case , we were surprised that most consumers chose to share their frustrations about other airlines . ''

World 's worst airport in 2014 is ...

Spirit does n't get most of the blame in its own survey . Southwest Airlines gets the most complaints about seats -LRB- 36 % -RRB- , followed by United Airlines ' service -LRB- 22 % -RRB- , American Airlines-owned US Airways ' delays -LRB- 22 % -RRB- , Spirit 's fees -LRB- 18 % -RRB- and Delta Air Lines ' costs -LRB- 11 % -RRB- .

Spirit 's cheerful defense : Pay for what you want on your flight , and do n't pay for what you do n't want . The airline 's new This is Spirit 101 campaign shares the details of how to reduce those fees , including paying for checked luggage from home and printing your boarding pass at home .

But really , it 's about Spirit

It 's a good effort by Spirit to lump complaints about its fees into the conversation about Americans ' growing resentment of most U.S. airlines . But really , most customers blame Spirit by a wide margin .

Spirit received nearly three times as many complaints as the next airline during the study period , the report found . And Spirit has been hit with $ 565,000 in fines for violations of consumer protection laws involving deceptive advertising , baggage and oversales .
