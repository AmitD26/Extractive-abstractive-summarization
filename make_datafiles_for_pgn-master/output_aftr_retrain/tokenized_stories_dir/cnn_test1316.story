She 's also a she .

People describe the app using female pronouns . Her gender has even prompted some users to flood blogs and online forums with sexually suggestive questions for Siri such as `` What are you wearing ? '' -LRB- Siri 's baffled response : `` Why do people keep asking me this ? '' -RRB-

The fuss over Siri 's sex also raises a larger question : From voice-mail systems to GPS devices to Siri and beyond , why are so many computerized voices female ?

One answer may lie in biology . Scientific studies have shown that people generally find women 's voices more pleasing than men 's .

Another answer lies in history . According to some sources , the use of female voices in navigation devices dates back to World War II , when women 's voices were employed in airplane cockpits because they stood out among the male pilots . And telephone operators have traditionally been female , making people accustomed to getting assistance from a disembodied woman 's voice .

When automakers were first installing automated voice prompts in cars -LRB- `` your door is ajar '' -RRB- decades ago , their consumer research found that people overwhelmingly preferred female voices to male ones , said Tim Bajarin , a Silicon Valley analyst and president of Creative Strategies Inc. .

`` Cultural stereotypes run deep , '' said Nass , who details the BMW episode in his book .

Most companies that produce automated voices hold auditions for voice actors and collect recordings of them speaking . Then they invite focus groups to listen to the recordings and rate the voices on how well they convey certain attributes : warmth , friendliness , competence and so on .

`` It 's casting , '' Nass said . `` It 's something Hollywood has known for a long , long time . ''

Look no further than examples of automated or artificial-intelligence voices in sci-fi movies and TV shows . Voices of authority or menace tend to be male : the homicidal HAL 9000 computer in `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey , '' the computer program in `` WarGames , '' or Auto , the spaceship 's autopilot function in `` Wall-E . '' More subservient talking machines , such as the onboard computer from the `` Star Trek '' TV series , skew female .

Nuance , a Massachusetts-based company that develops speech technologies for Ford vehicles ' SYNC system , Amazon e-readers and other clients , creates both male and female voices . It 's then up to the client to choose which voice , and gender , best fits their product , said chief creative officer Gary Clayton .

`` As these products become part of our everyday lives , there 's a huge opportunity for personalization , '' added Brant Ward , the company 's director of advanced speech design . `` I could have an approximation of my wife 's voice read me a text message in my car . ''

Siri : Brilliant or sexist ?

Siri , the iPhone 4S 's voice , grew from a five-year research project that was funded by military agency DARPA and led by SRI International , a Bay Area research institute . The project spawned a company , also called Siri , that launched an iPhone app in February 2010 and was acquired by Apple two months later .

That original Siri voice-to-text app -- powered in part by Nuance 's technology -- also worked by people speaking commands into their phones , although it did n't talk back . And it had no gender . In fact , the app was originally conceived to speak in a gender-neutral voice , said Norman Winarsky , vice president of SRI and a co-founder of Siri .

`` What Apple did is absolutely brilliant , '' said Winarsky , who calls speech `` the most natural of all human interfaces . ''

Many GPS devices and computer text-to-speech programs now offer multiple voice options . And someday soon , voice-technology experts say , Siri will probably speak in a variety of voices , too .

`` I think they have to be understood in a broader context in which they 're one small piece , '' she wrote in an e-mail to CNN . `` Voices intended to convey authority -LRB- such as voice-over narration in films -RRB- tend to be male . So yes , probably these compliant female robot voices reinforce gender stereotypes , not just because they serve the user but because the technology itself is about communication and relationships -LRB- areas that women are presumed to be good at -RRB- .

Zorach listened to some sound clips of Siri online , then e-mailed back again .

`` What 's interesting to me is how they seem to intentionally make her speech sound artificial -- they could choose to make her speech more seamless and human-like , but they choose instead to highlight the technology , '' she said . `` That makes you aware of how high-tech your gadget is . ''
