Major cities like Paris crackle with energy year-round .

To save some money on hotels in the off-season , arrive late without a reservation , notice how many empty rooms they have -LRB- look for keys on the rack -RRB- , and give the receptionist an excuse to win your business with a deep discount . Explain that you 're a senior -LRB- hosteller , student , artist , whatever -RRB- with a particular price limit , and bargain from there .

For many travelers , `` shoulder season '' -- April , May , early June , September and early October -- offers the best mix of peak-season and off-season pros and cons . In shoulder season you 'll enjoy decent weather , long days , fewer crowds and a local tourist industry that is still eager to please and entertain .

Outside of peak season , adventurers loiter all alone through Leonardo 's home , ponder un-pestered in Rome 's Forum , kick up sand on virgin beaches and chat with laid-back guards by log fires in French chateaux . In wintertime Venice you can be alone atop St. Mark 's bell tower , watching the clouds of your breath roll over the Byzantine domes of the church to a horizon of cut-glass Alps . Below , on St. Mark 's Square , hungry pigeons fidget and wonder , `` Where are the tourists ? ''

Without the crowds , you can enjoy step-right-up service at tourist offices and experience a more European Europe . Although many popular tourist-oriented parks , shows and tours will be closed , off-season is in-season for the high culture : plays and operas are in their crowd-pleasing glory . For instance , in Vienna , while the Boys Choir , Opera and Spanish Riding School are scarce in the summer , all have a busy schedule of performances through the rest of the year .

Europe 's major cities crackle with energy year-round . In London , you can spend your days at the British Museum and National Gallery , and your nights at a cozy pub or a world-class play . In Paris -- the City of Light that always sparkles -- you can get face-to-face with Mona and scale the Eiffel Tower . In Florence , you 'll see Renaissance paintings and Michelangelo 's David without peak-season crowds .

But winter travel has its drawbacks . Because much of Europe is in Canadian latitudes , the days are short . It 's dark by 5 p.m. . The weather can be miserable -- cold , windy , and drizzly -- and then turn worse . But just as summer can be wet and gray , winter can be crisp and blue , and even into mid-November , hillsides blaze with colorful leaves .

To thrive in the winter , you 'll need to get the most out of your limited daylight hours . Start early and eat a quick lunch . Pack for the cold and wet -- layers , rainproof parka , gloves , wool hat , long johns , waterproof shoes and an umbrella . Use undershirts to limit the washing of slow-drying heavy shirts . Dress warmly . Cold weather is colder when you 're outdoors trying to enjoy yourself all day long . And cheap hotels are not always adequately heated in the off-season .

While Europe 's wonderful outdoor evening ambience survives year-round in the south , wintertime streets are empty in the north after dark . English-language tours , common in the summer , are rare during the off-season , when most visitors are natives . Another disadvantage of winter travel is loneliness . The solo traveler wo n't have the built-in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season . Still , this can be a plus , since it encourages you to really connect with the locals you traveled halfway around the world to meet .
