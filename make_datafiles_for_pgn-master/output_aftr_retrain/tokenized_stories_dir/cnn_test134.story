-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Health care was a huge topic during Wednesday 's presidential debate . President Barack Obama said the repeal of Obamacare would cause seniors ' prescription drug payments to rise .

`` We were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $ 600 , '' Obama said during his debate with GOP challenger Mitt Romney . He went on to say that if Obamacare were repealed , `` those seniors right away are going to be paying $ 600 more in prescription care . ''

The law helps make Medicare prescription drug coverage more affordable .

Once that figure had been reached , beneficiaries were responsible for the full cost of their drugs until they had spent $ 4,550 -- after which , their share usually dropped to 5 % . That coverage gap is referred to as the `` donut hole . ''

The Affordable Care Act changed the formula .

Last year , people with Medicare who reached the donut hole got a 50 percent discount on covered brand-name drugs and a discount on generic drugs .

Recipients will pay less and less until 2020 , when they will be responsible for only 25 % of the cost of their drugs until they reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit , according to a 2010 posting on healthcare.gov by Jonathan Blum , director for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services .

Conclusion : Seniors , on average , would pay the $ 600 cited by Obama -- and then some , according to Medicare figures , if the Affordable Care Act was not in place .
