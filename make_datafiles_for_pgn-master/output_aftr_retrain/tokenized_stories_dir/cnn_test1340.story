Louay Shabana , head of the agency , said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed . Shabana put the economic destruction at more than $ 1.9 billion .

The fighting largely stopped Sunday with a cease-fire . Israel has said 13 of its citizens -- including 10 soldiers -- were killed during the offensive , which started December 27 .

Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel .

The attacks destroyed public sector and private buildings in Gaza , affecting even the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 's facilities and halting economic and social services , the statistics agency said . Watch Palestinians recover bodies from rubble ''

Gaza 's gross domestic product was slashed by 85 percent during the 22 days of war , and it could take a year for the economy to recover , the agency said in a preliminary report .

Ging , UNRWA 's Gaza director of operations , said the bill could reach `` billions of dollars . ''

Gaza 's main border crossings , which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks , were open Monday . Infrastructure repairs were being made , but 400,000 people still had no water , according to Ging .

Streets in some northern Gaza towns were flooded with sewage , and about 50 U.N. facilities were damaged , he said .

More than 170 supply trucks crossed into Gaza on Monday , less than a third of the daily number that crossed in 2005 , said John Holmes , U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator .

Israel tried to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza , a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said in a posting Monday on the IDF Web site .

Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint , the officer said .

The operation 's goal , he said , `` was to improve the security situation in southern Israel , and to facilitate peaceful living for the Israeli civilians living there . ''

`` We asked ourselves how to accomplish this , and the answer was to hit Hamas hard -- to strike the tunnels , the terrorists themselves , and all of their assets -- in order to prevent them from committing war crimes by firing rockets that target our civilian population , '' the officer said .
