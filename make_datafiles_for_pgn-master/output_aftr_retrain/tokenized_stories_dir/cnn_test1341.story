In recent years , Kuwaiti waistlines have swollen to make them among the most obese people on the planet . Nearly 70 % of Kuwaiti males over 15 are overweight or obese , according to the World Health Organization . For women , the figures are even worse -- slightly over 80 % .

Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently placed Kuwait second only to the United States on a league table ranking countries by the amount of food they consumed per capita to sustain being overweight .

Many attribute the weight problem to rapid changes in lifestyle propelled by oil revenues that have transformed Kuwait into prosperous modern consumer society .

`` I think it started with Kuwait being a rich country , '' said fitness expert Yousef AlQanai , who was overweight himself until getting in shape eight years ago . `` We have a lot of oil , so this transcends to how we live our lifestyles . It made our lives much easier . We do n't have to work in order to survive . ''

Chief among these changes has been the introduction of fast food . American fast food outlets arrived with the U.S. troops during the first Gulf War , becoming a permanent fixture on the country 's culinary landscape . Some have tailored their menus to cater to bigger appetites in the region , such as a best-selling Pizza Hut dish that features a cheese pizza with a cheeseburger crust .

Rania Al Mutawa , a 36-year-old Kuwaiti woman who is training for a 10-kilometer race being organized alongside Kuwait 's first marathon , said the love affair with fast food was leading many in her country to pile on the pounds . Many lacked awareness of the health consequences of eating fast food regularly .

`` People in Kuwait consider McDonalds and Burger King as full meal restaurants -- and not junk food , '' she said . `` The average Kuwaiti does not know what goes into that type of food . It 's just like a home-cooked meal . ''

AlQanai agrees . `` Some kids grow up not knowing that this is not good for them . ''

`` We trust them to choose menu items that are right for their lifestyles , '' he said .

He said Kuwaiti culture also placed strong emphasis on eating at communal gatherings -- with little value placed on moderation . `` If you eat less , it means you did n't like it and whoever invited you is not a good host , '' he said .

According to a report in Businessweek , the number of bariatric surgeons in Kuwait has increased tenfold over the past decade , with at least 5,000 patients receiving the procedure in Kuwait last year -- compared with 3,000 in Canada , which has more than 30 times the population . The report added that the legal barriers to surgery in Kuwait are lower than in the United States .

But for AlQanai , the only lasting solution to obesity comes not from the shortcut of surgery , but hard work in the gym .
