The videotaped , apparent beheading of a fourth Westerner by ISIS holds strong similarities to the prior three . In all four videos , the victims are kneeling in orange clothing on the sand and a black-clad man with a British accent speaks to Western leaders .

Henning speaks very briefly , for 10 seconds , and appears less composed than at least two of the others .

The camera has only one angle throughout , whereas there were multiple angles in the videotaped killings of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff . Foley 's video ran five minutes and Sotloff 's two minutes and 47 seconds .

The latest tape , released Friday , opens with a short news clip on the British Parliament approving military strikes against ISIS from the Russian news agency Russia Today .

Then the recording goes to a slate that reads `` Another Message to America and its Allies . ''

A masked man dressed in black standing over Henning makes a reference to the third Westerner beheaded by ISIS , British aid worker David Haines . The killer says his message is for British Prime Minister David Cameron .

In all four videos , the man wears black garb covering everything almost but his eyes . He wears a leather strap with a pistol and waves a knife in his left hand . He speaks with a British accent .

`` It sounds , and he looks very much , like the same executioner that we 've seen in the two previous killings , '' CNN 's Nic Robertson said in an interview when ISIS released the video of the third beheading . `` That accent there is unmistakably British . ''

It 's also not certain the man actually kills the hostages because the video goes to black before the beheading occurs .

Last week , FBI Director James Comey said the United States believes it has identified the ISIS militant in the video showing Foley 's killing . Comey did not publicly identify the man but FBI officials said they believe the same militant speaks in the videos showing Foley , Sotloff and Haines .
