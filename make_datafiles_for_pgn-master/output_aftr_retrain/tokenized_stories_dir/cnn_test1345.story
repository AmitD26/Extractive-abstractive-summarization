The man on the voicemail is flirty and clearly asking for a date . But it 's the name on the message that 's raising red flags .

`` I do n't want to wait 'til you come back to have dinner with you , '' he said .

But the unwanted voicemail is n't the real problem for Fernandez . It 's where and to whom he made inappropriate advances .

Dogged by sex scandal , Filner to enter counseling

The women , like Fernandez , say the former chairman of the House Veterans ' Affairs Committee used his significant power and credentials to access military sexual assault survivors , who they say are less likely to complain .

Fernandez is a retired master sergeant from the Air Force . She served 23 years in the United States and was deployed to the Middle East after 9/11 .

Secrets that women of San Diego no longer keep about its mayor

In civilian life , Fernandez now speaks openly about her assaults and is an active member of the NWVAA , which supports victims of military sexual assault .

`` He looks at my card . He looks at me . He says , ` Fernandez . Are you married ? Do you have a husband ? ' Very quick , very direct . I said , ` No , I 'm divorced . ' ` Well , you 're beautiful , and I ca n't take my eyes off you , and I want to take you to dinner . ' I was really shocked and I was like , ` Uh , OK , ' '' Fernandez said .

Then came the phone call and voicemail , which Fernandez never returned .

Nurse accuses mayor of sexual harassment in his office

At the same NWVAA event where Fernandez spoke , Army vet Tindley gave a speech about her violent rape , which she said happened during her eight years of service . She bore a son from the sexual assault .

Filner , who was running for mayor of San Diego at the time , was also scheduled to speak . In the green room , he asked Tindley about her rape .

When asked if she said anything , Tindley replied , `` What am I gon na say ? You 're a congressman . What am I gon na say to you ? What am I gon na say to his man ? Can he destroy my life , can he stop me from moving forward ? ''

Lawyer : Mayor never got harassment training

A series of complaints

Three weeks ago , as women began to step forward to reveal instances of sexual harassment , the veterans at the NWVAA began to compare notes .

Tara Jones , the president of the group , said she 's spoken to seven to eight women who had varying encounters with Filner at the women 's veteran events , from groping to unwanted requests for dates .

Jones , who says she was raped while she was in the Navy , formed the NWVAA as a safe haven for military sexual assault victims . She invited Filner into her group , lavishing praise on his service to veterans while he was a congressman in Washington . She even stumped for him as he campaigned to be San Diego 's mayor .

That 's a sentiment that Fernandez shares .

`` We 're all victims of military sexual assault . It appears to me that he was targeting the organization and hitting on the women of this organization because they were easy prey , '' Fernandez said . `` He 's part of an organization that 's against sexual assault and sexual violence against women and sexual harassment . And he 's doing the very thing that we are fighting to make stop in our service and in our country . ''

Tindley questioned why Filner was in public office .

Lee Burdick , Filner 's chief of staff , dodged CNN 's questions and would not answer to the latest allegations from the female veterans .

Filner 's attorney Harvey Berger had no comment .
