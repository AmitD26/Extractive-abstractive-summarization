`` I think it was a huge mistake , '' Patrick said Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''

`` One problem the President has is he does n't tell the story well or regularly , '' he said . `` When Democrats ... grow a backbone and stand up for what it is we believe , we win . ''

`` You know the importance of repetition is something I had to learn , '' Patrick said . `` It 's not to say that everything has been solved , we have reached the Promised Land . But we are better off than we were . ''

But while Patrick blamed the President for his party 's losses nationally , the Massachusetts chief executive himself shirked responsibility for his own state 's failure to elect Democrats .

Looking to the next election , Patrick had lovely things to say about fellow Democrat Hillary Clinton , but he admitted the thought of her as the inevitable Democratic candidate is bad for the party -- a point he has been stressing for months .

`` I think Hillary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton -- has been an extraordinary public servant and would be a terrific candidate for president , '' Patrick said . `` But I think that the narrative that it 's inevitable is off putting to regular voters . ''

`` I do n't mean that as a criticism of her . I just think that people read inevitability as entitlement . The American people want and ought to want their candidates to sweat for the job -- to actually make a case for why they are the right person at the right time . ''

Reflecting on his own political future , the outgoing governor says he 's thought about a 2016 run , but has ruled it out .

`` I have thought about it , '' Patrick admitted . But , he added , `` I ca n't get ready for 2016 . ''
