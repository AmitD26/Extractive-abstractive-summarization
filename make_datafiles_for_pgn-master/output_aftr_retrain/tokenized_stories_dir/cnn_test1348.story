The pro-Russian government of Ukraine 's southeastern Crimean region declared independence Tuesday ahead of a scheduled referendum on whether to join Russia , ignoring international warnings that the vote wo n't be recognized .

In the regional capital Simferopol , pro-Russian militiamen guarded the airport and train station , some wearing armbands that proclaimed their allegiance to `` the autonomous republic of Crimea . '' Flights into the region from Ukraine 's capital , Kiev , were canceled Tuesday , while flights from Moscow appeared to be landing as scheduled .

A guard at the railway station told CNN that he and his comrades were looking out for weapons being shipped in from the rest of Ukraine .

Ukraine 's interim government , backed by the United States and European powers , has said the upcoming vote is illegitimate .

And from Russia , ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych -- run out of his country in a revolt that triggered the current crisis -- insisted he was still the legitimate leader and vowed to return to Kiev `` as soon as the circumstances allow . ''

Ukrainian government forces in Crimea have been surrounded in their bases by well-equipped troops wearing uniforms with no insignia -- troops Western countries say are Russian but whom Moscow calls local `` self-defense '' forces . The move has effectively severed the strategic peninsula , which has an ethnic Russian majority , from the rest of Ukraine .

`` Any discussion about the future of Crimea needs to take place with the new government of Ukraine at the table , engaged in it , participating in that conversation , '' Psaki said . The United States understands that Russia has interests in Crimea , `` but those interests in no way justify military intervention or the use of force , '' she added .

The head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also said the referendum would be illegal . Swiss Foreign Minister Didier Burkhalter , the OSCE 's current chairman , said holding the referendum without everyone affected being on board would `` provoke tensions instead of leading to sustainable solutions . ''

OSCE monitors have been denied entry into Crimea by armed men several times since the crisis began .

`` The Russian Federation will respect the results of the free vote of Crimea 's people during the referendum , '' it said .

`` We have a firm position , but still we are seeking a political solution , '' Fabius tweeted . `` The only legitimate vote in Ukraine will be May 25 , the upcoming presidential election . ''

`` We are not only deeply worried , but we believe what is intended by Russia in view of the Crimea is completely unacceptable , '' Steinmeier said during a visit to the former Soviet republic of Estonia , now a NATO ally and European Union member . Steinmeier said Germany and Estonia `` agree that we will stand up to further escalations united and determined . ''

`` The people on the Maidan would soil and sleep and eat in the same place , it was worse than tramps , '' he said .

Meanwhile , a commander of the notorious Berkut riot police -- disbanded after Yanukovych was ousted but celebrated as heroes in Crimea -- denounced the February revolt in Kiev .

`` The Maidan was a provocation from start to finish , '' said Vladimir Krashevsky , whose forces appeared to have close ties to the militia . `` There was no democracy , and no real indignation from the people . It was a paid-for event . ''

And pro-Russian billboards portray Sunday 's choice as one between a free Russia and a Ukraine under the swastika . Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called that `` one of the more outrageous placards I have ever seen . ''

`` There are a lot of older people who probably remember World War II and the tragedies that took place in Ukraine , and so this is just pure , unadulterated scare tactics , '' Albright added .

And Fabius defended Ukraine 's new government Tuesday , saying it was `` legitimately installed by the Ukrainian parliament '' and that the extreme right `` is not represented . ''

`` I 'm not just the legitimate President , but I am also the head of the military . I 've not stopped my responsibilities , I 'm alive , I 've not been left without my powers , '' he said .

Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych 's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities , putting the two countries on a collision course over control of Crimea .
