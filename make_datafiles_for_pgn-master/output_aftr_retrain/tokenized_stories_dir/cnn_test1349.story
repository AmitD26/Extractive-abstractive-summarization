`` We have no plans to impeach the President . We have no future plans , '' Boehner told reporters after a weekly meeting with GOP members .

Boehner said `` this whole talk about impeachment '' comes from `` the President 's own staff '' and from congressional Democrats .

`` Why ? Because they 're trying to rally their people to give money and to show up in this year 's elections , '' he said .

Boehner 's decision to sue Obama was designed to address outrage from tea party activists and others within the GOP base over a string of Obama executive orders they say circumvented Congress .

The lawsuit covers his decision last year to defer a health law requirement that businesses provide insurance coverage to their employees .

But the suit also opened the door to more discussion about impeaching the second-straight Democratic president by a Republican-led House .

Dan Pfeiffer , a longtime aide and senior Obama adviser said last week that impeachment talk should not be considered a long shot .

`` I would not discount that possibility , '' Pfeiffer said .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid raised the subject on the Senate floor on Tuesday at about the same time Boehner was ruling it out .

`` Look in the papers today , the American people are totally opposed to this , '' Reid said . `` We should n't be off on those tracks of impeachment and suing the President . We should be legislating . ''

But the campaign arm has pulled in $ 1 million alone since Scalise 's comments on impeachment over the weekend .
