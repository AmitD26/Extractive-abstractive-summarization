Greeted by throngs of Catholic worshipers from across the region , Pope Benedict XVI ended his two-country tour in Havana 's Revolution Plaza with a reference to what he described as a need for `` authentic freedom . ''

Changes between Cuba and the world can come only if `` each one is prepared to ask for the truth and if they decide to take the path of love , sowing reconciliation and brotherhood , '' the pope said Wednesday .

He also met with the Communist country 's former leader , Fidel Castro , before heading to the airport for a Rome-bound flight Wednesday evening .

Conflicting reports emerged Wednesday over whether the pope had met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez . Two Cuban sources told CNN the pontiff met Tuesday with Chavez , who is in Cuba for cancer treatment . But Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said reports of the meeting were false .

In a farewell speech just before boarding the plane , he criticized the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba , saying `` restrictive economic measures , imposed from outside the country , unfairly burden its people . ''

Benedict , whose office has routinely cast the trip in the context of a spiritual pilgrimage , at times addressed political issues -- often subtly , and on occasion more overtly .

Later , he prayed for `` those deprived of freedom '' while in Cuba 's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba . And he made several references to freedom in his final sermon in Havana , addressing a nation that human rights groups have routinely denounced for its abuses .

Many in Cuba and around the world listened closely to the pope 's homily at the enormous open-air Mass Wednesday to see whether he would expand on -- or be more forceful in -- his apparent criticisms . But his comments often seemed couched in a broader discussion of religious openness .

The pope arrived in the so-called popemobile , his bulletproof vehicle , which slowly made its way to the altar . At some points , he appeared just a few feet from the crowd , which shifted as onlookers tried to get a closer look .

Rescue workers carried away at least three people who fainted in what was a comparably mild Caribbean heat , after waiting for hours for the pope to arrive .

`` Every time the pontiff comes comes here , there 's always some sort of transformative period for us afterward , '' said Jorge Luis Rodriguez , a Havana resident who joined the thousands that filled the square on Wednesday .

But Cuban dissidents complained that police prohibited some activists from leaving their homes to attend the Mass and that others were detained .

Amnesty International said in a statement that activists were `` facing a surge in harassment in a bid to silence them during the pope 's visit . ''

Government opponents were detained , threatened or stopped from traveling freely leading up to pontiff 's arrival , according to the human rights group .

Elsida Martinez , a Havana resident who said she watched from the square when John Paul spoke in 1998 , said there was a noticeable difference between the two pontiffs . Cuba itself was also different , she said .

When John Paul came `` it was a different period in our history , '' said Camilo Ortiz , a 50-year-old Havana resident , but the former pontiff 's visit still `` had more power '' than Benedict 's .

When John Paul visited years later , the country was still reeling from its effects .

But some Havana residents at Wednesday 's Mass said they were optimistic .
