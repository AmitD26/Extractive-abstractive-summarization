Rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport on Sunday , leaving nine people dead and 25 others wounded , the government said .

CNN personnel could hear gunfire and blasts throughout the day . Heavy smoke billowed above the airport .

While the government issued a statement calling for calm , Libya 's government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces . Many of the armed groups are on the state 's payroll .

State-run al-Rasmiya television gave the death toll , citing Libya 's Health Ministry .

Brigades from the Zintan militia have controlled the airport since the Libyan civil war in 2011 . Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years .

`` The revolutionary brigades are inside Tripoli International Airport , '' the Libyan Revolutionaries Operations Room , an Islamist militia in the capital , posted on its Facebook page .

Late Sunday morning , the sounds of fighting could also be heard in the vicinity of a Zintan base in a western suburb of Tripoli .

Libya 's interim government released a statement Sunday that said regional brigades and `` field commanders '' are carrying out `` operations , '' and they moved on Tripoli Airport with `` no order or legitimate cover , coming from different directions ... ''

Robertson said the violence was `` putting the lives of people in the area in grave danger .

`` We urge all sides to cease violence immediately and to engage in meaningful dialogue , '' he said .

In a statement the night before the fighting erupted , the U.S. State Department expressed concern about what it said was the `` ongoing violence in Libya and dangerous posturing that could lead to widespread conflict there . ''

Even though Libyans successfully toppled the 42-year rule of Moammar Gadhafi in 2011 , the country is far from stable . Armed militias are now the biggest challenge .

`` The United States is deeply concerned by the ongoing violence in Libya and dangerous posturing that could lead to widespread conflict there , '' the State Department said in a statement Saturday .

`` We affirm our support for Libya 's democratic transition and urge the seating of the new Council of Representatives as soon as possible , '' the statement added . `` Finally , we stress the vital role Libya 's Constitution Drafting Assembly plays in building the new country for which Libyans sacrificed so much during the revolution .
