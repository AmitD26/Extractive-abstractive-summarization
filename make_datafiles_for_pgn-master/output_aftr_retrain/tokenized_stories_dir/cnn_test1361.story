`` I ca n't help myself . ''

As the startlingly beautiful and fiercely intelligent Lt. Uhura on the hit 1960s TV series , Nichols was a revolutionary figure at a time when the only African-American women you saw on U.S. TV were usually playing servants .

Indeed , Star Trek was reportedly the only program Martin Luther King Jr would let his children stay up late to watch .

When Nichols was considering leaving the show to pursue a career on Broadway , King Jr personally implored her to stay , saying she was a powerful role model for black people across the country -- and the world .

`` So I stayed and I never regretted it . ''

NASA ambassador

As the original series drew to a close at the end of the decade , a real-life space race was gathering pace -- and this time it was Nichols calling for auditions .

The United States landed a man on the moon in 1969 -- but our astronauts need n't be limited to white males , said Nichols .

`` There were no women , and there were no minorities in the space program -- and that 's supposed to represent the whole country ? '' she says , her voice rising incredulously down the phone from her home in Woodland Hills , California .

The glamorous sci-fi celebrity was soon enlisted by NASA to recruit the country 's first female and ethnic minority astronauts .

She traveled the length and breadth of the United States calling for promising astronauts to come forward -- among them was Sally Ride , the first American woman in space , and Charles Bolden , the current NASA administrator .

Nichols was n't just a TV celebrity -- she was a TV revolutionary , locking lips with William Shatner in one of the small screen 's first interracial kisses , in 1968 .

Though at the time , she did n't quite see what all the fuss was about .

The scene -- in which Lt. Uhura and Captain Kirk are controlled by humanoids who force them to embrace -- received a huge response from the public , largely positive .

`` It demands that you respect everyone else equally . It 's as simple as that . ''

Her grandfather was a white Southerner who married a black woman , and in doing so was ostracized by his wealthy parents . Nichols ' father was a factory worker who also served as town mayor .

A talented dancer and singer , Nichols started performing Chicago clubs at 14 , meeting one jazz legend who would change her life forever -- Duke Ellington .

She later toured with the successful composer , despite other people 's reservations about what was expected of schoolgirls at the time .

Enduring wonder of space

As a child , Nichols was also told that `` girls were n't supposed to like science '' -- not that she took much notice .

`` Science is not a boy 's game , it 's not a girl 's game . It 's everyone 's game . It 's about where we are and where we 're going , '' she says , and you can almost picture the serene figure of Lt. Uhura in red uniform , speaking at the controls .

`` Space travel benefits us here on Earth . And we ai n't stopped yet . There 's more exploration to come . ''
