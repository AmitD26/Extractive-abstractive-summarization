`` Got all your Christmas shopping done ? '' he asked one woman as she pulled out her proof of insurance and registration .

`` No , I have n't even started , '' she answered before telling VanSolkema what her daughter and son were asking for .

Listening in were Santa 's helpers with UPtv , who quickly dashed about a local store buying , wrapping and delivering the presents to the traffic stop within 15 minutes .

`` Oh my God , can I hug you ? ''

And no tickets .

Lowell Police Chief Steve Bukala said you can learn a lot about somebody in just a few minutes .

`` Most of the contact the police officers have with the general public is on a traffic stop and you can find a lot out about that person in that 10 to 15 minute window , whether they 're having a good day , a bad day , or a horrible day , '' he said .

`` And then we got this idea : what if we could change that person 's day in real time ? What if we could change that person 's day right now ? ''
