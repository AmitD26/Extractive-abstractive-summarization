`` I 'm gon na tag you in this hideous photo and then unfriend you if you do n't stop oversharing and poking me . ''

If you said this to someone 10 years ago , they 'd look at you like you were speaking Klingon . Nowadays , you just sound like an active user of social media .

Most are common words that Facebook refitted with new meanings . Some have stuck , while others have been forgotten . A few have even been recognized by dictionaries as official pieces of the 21st century lexicon .

Here are nine of the most memorable .

Friend

Unfriend

Facebook giveth , and Facebook taketh away . Are you tired of your uncle 's political rants ? Unfriend him !

By adding an `` unfriend '' option , Facebook created new shorthand for aborting a friendship or an acquaintance . It 's a lot easier to say , `` I unfriended Bob '' than `` I 'm not going to be friends with Bob anymore because he annoys me with his daily musings about his toenails . ''

Unfriending someone is considered a more drastic step than simply tweaking your Facebook settings to block or minimize their posts .

Status update

Like

Few things have sparked more debate on Facebook than the `` Like '' button , which debuted in 2009 and soon spread to partner sites . Suddenly , with a quick click you could endorse your friends ' updates , jokes and cute-kid pictures .

Cynics , lamenting what they saw as Facebook 's forced cheerfulness , unsuccessfully asked for a `` Dislike '' button .

Instagram , Pinterest and other social networks also adopted the Like model for favoring posts , although they used a heart symbol instead of a Like thumb . -LRB- You Like me right now ! You Like me ! -RRB-

5 ways Facebook changed our lives , for better or worse

Poke

Some saw it as a flirty invitation to an online chat or real-world hookup . But the obvious sexual innuendo made it awkward to use in conversation . `` I poked Aunt Betty '' just sounds all kind of wrong .

Share -LRB- and overshare -RRB-

Share buttons popped up all over the Web . Share this ! Tweet this ! Pin this ! Snap this ! Sooo much sharing .

Not me , of course . Other people .

Wall

It 's complicated

Tag , you 're it ! No , you 're it ! What was once just a child 's game is now a way to get people to notice your posts , or to embarrass them by flagging them in unflattering photos . Come to think of it , maybe Tag is the new Poke .
