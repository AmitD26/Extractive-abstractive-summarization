Arizona 's Legislature has passed a controversial bill that would allow business owners , as long as they assert their religious beliefs , to deny service to gay and lesbian customers .

`` I think anybody that owns a business can choose who they work with or who they do n't work with , '' Brewer told CNN in Washington on Friday . `` But I do n't know that it needs to be statutory . In my life and in my businesses , if I do n't want to do business or if I do n't want to deal with a particular company or person or whatever , I 'm not interested . That 's America . That 's freedom . ''

On Friday , the LGBT group Wingspan staged a protest march to the governor 's office that drew about 200 people . Some carried signs with messages `` God created us all equal '' and `` Shame on Arizona . ''

Tucson-based Rocco 's Little Chicago Pizzeria posted a photo on its Facebook page of a sign with a message for state lawmakers : `` We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona legislators . ''

The Greater Phoenix Economic Council , in a letter to Brewer on Friday , urged the governor to veto Senate Bill 1062 , saying the `` legislation will likely have profound , negative effects on our business community for years to come . ''

He added , `` With major events approaching in the coming year , including Super Bowl XLIX , Arizona will be the center of the world 's stage . This legislation has the potential of subjecting the Super Bowl , and major events surrounding it , to the threats of boycotts . ''

On CNN 's `` The Lead with Jake Tapper , '' Arizona state Rep. John Kavanagh , a Republican , said the bill would not allow hotel clerks or waiters , for instance , to turn away customers , unless there was a `` substantial burden on their sincerely held religious beliefs . ''

`` As we witness hostility towards people of faith grow like never before , we must take this opportunity to speak up for religious liberty , '' the group said on its website , asking people to contact Brewer and urge her to sign the bill . `` The great news is that SB 1062 protects your right to live and work according to your faith . ''

Cathi Herrod , the center 's president , told CNN on Friday , `` The Arizona bill has a very simple premise , that Americans should be free to live and work according to their religious faith . It 's simply about protecting religious liberty and nothing else . ''

But Robert Boston , a spokesman for the Washington-based Americans United for Separation of Church and State , told CNN the legislation would `` fling the door wide open to discrimination , not just against gay people , but basically to any class of individuals that a religious fundamentalist decides he or she does n't want to deal with . ''

He added , `` A woman who is pregnant out of wedlock , for example , ` Well , out the door , you do n't get served in my business . ' ''

The Arizona legislation was passed as conservative states work to counter laws legalizing same-sex marriage . Arizona voters approved a ban on same-sex marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008 .

`` What today 's bill does is allow private individuals and businesses to use religion to discriminate , sending a message that Arizona is intolerant and unwelcoming , '' the group said in a statement .

`` It 's a very bad day for Arizona , '' Rep. Chad Campbell , a Phoenix Democrat who voted against the legislation , told CNN Friday .

He added , `` Let there be no doubt about what this bill does . It 's going to allow people to discriminate against the gay community in Arizona . It goes after unprotected classes of people and we all know that the biggest unprotected class of people in the state is the LBGT community . If we were having this conversation in regard to African-Americans or women , there would be outrage across the country right now . ''
