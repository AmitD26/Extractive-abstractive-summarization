Francesco Schettino faces possible charges of manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning ship after the vessel struck rocks and rolled onto its side in the waters off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13 . Sixteen bodies have been recovered , and 16 people remain missing from the roughly 4,200 people who were aboard the cruise liner .

`` We do n't think that any of the -LRB- justifications -RRB- for Schettino 's house arrest are valid . He is not going to escape or to repeat the crime , '' Parascandola said .

Prosecutor Stefano Pizza did not speak to reporters as he entered or left the court . Prosecutors want Schettino 's house arrest revoked and the captain sent back to jail to await trial .

`` I hit this projection of rock that seems almost stuck into the ship , but this was my mistake , '' Schettino said , according to a 126-page transcript . '' ... There is n't anything I can say , as I was convinced that passing within .28 of a mile there would n't be any problem . ''

According to the transcript , Schettino said he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking . `` This is what allowed me to limit the tilting , '' he said .

Maritime lawyer Jim Allsworth said the maneuver is `` fairly standard '' in the case of a ship taking on water and in danger of sinking or capsizing . `` The best thing to do is to put it aground to stop it sinking . ''

La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera published excerpts from a telephone conversation Schettino had with a friend after his January 14 arrest .

The captain called his friend from the prosecutor 's office , and authorities tapped the phone , the newspapers said .

`` In my place , someone else would n't have been so benevolent to have gone right under there , because they have pissed me off , go , go there , '' Schettino said , in an apparent reference to getting close to the island , according to the newspapers . `` The shallows were there , but it was n't signaled by the instruments that I had , and I went through ... in order to follow what the managers wanted . ''

Both Costa Cruises and authorities have criticized Schettino 's behavior .

Costa can not conduct an independent investigation because prosecutors seized the ship 's data recorder . The recorder had some connection problems but is working , Costa chief executive Per Luigi Foschi has said . It contains conversation recordings and navigation system data , he said .

In the transcript , Schettino also described the chaos , saying that he helped passengers onto lifeboats and that some became stuck because of the angle of the listing ship . He said he was trying to launch a lifeboat when he realized he was no longer on board .

However , in the wiretapped conversation , Schettino told the friend , `` When I understood that the ship was tilting , I decided to leave , and left , '' according to Corriere della Sera .

A captain 's leaving the ship with passengers still aboard is difficult to defend , said Italian criminal defense attorney Ugo Meucci , who does not represent Schettino .

`` This is a very difficult position because our law is very strong , and the risk is very high for the captain , '' who could face a 15-year jail sentence , Meucci said .
