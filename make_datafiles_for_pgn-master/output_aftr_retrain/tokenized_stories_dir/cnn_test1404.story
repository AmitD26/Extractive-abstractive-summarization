One of the two women making history at the prestigious Augusta National Golf Club is a former U.S. secretary of state . The other , Darla Moore , is a former banking magnate and , by all accounts , a force to be reckoned with .

Moore -- who , along with Condoleezza Rice , has been admitted as a member of the previously all-male club -- once graced the cover of Fortune alongside the words , `` The Toughest Babe in Business . ''

`` To get a picture of Darla Moore , imagine , say , a cross between the Terminator and Kim Basinger , '' the 1997 profile read .

Her friend and admirer Martha Stewart described Moore , who hails from South Carolina , as `` a cutthroat killer underneath . ''

Moore took on two fellow magnates and won . She `` booted '' T. Boone Pickens from Mesa , the oil and gas company he founded . And she forced Rick Scott out at Columbia/HCA `` after the health care giant got slammed with a massive criminal investigation , '' the article said . Scott is now governor of Florida .

`` Ms. Moore 's combined gifts of $ 70 million make the Moore School the beneficiary of one of the largest private donations to a U.S. business school , '' the website says .

Celebration , surprise , humor after Augusta National admits first women

While she has been largely out of the news for years , Fortune -- part of CNNMoney.com -- noted last year that she was `` back . ''

`` Just like any savvy Southern belle , she summoned her sweetness to wage her battle and get her way . Convening students and TV news crews on the university campus , Moore announced a $ 5 million gift to build an aerospace research center named for astronaut Ron McNair , a South Carolinian -- from Moore 's hometown , in fact -- who died in the 1986 Challenger disaster . '' She challenged the state to match her contribution . Haley called the request `` premature , '' the article notes .

Membership is latest honor for trailblazer Rice

Earlier in 2011 , the South Carolina General Assembly passed a bill recognizing Moore , a native of Lake City , `` for her many years of service to the Palmetto State '' and particularly to the university . The bill described her as an `` outstanding public benefactor . ''

Moore received her bachelor 's degree in political science from the University of South Carolina , and later an MBA from George Washington University .

Rainwater is suffering from progressive supranuclear palsy , a brain disease referred to as PSP , Fortune reported in November , adding that he requires 24-hour care . Although it 's not life-threatening itself , the disease can lead to life-threatening complications such as pneumonia and swallowing problems , according to the Mayo Clinic .
