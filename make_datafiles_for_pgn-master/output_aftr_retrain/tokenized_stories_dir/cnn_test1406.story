The final tally in the 300-member parliament was 153 votes in favor of the cuts and 128 opposed , with 18 abstentions .

The cuts have provoked ire among Greeks furious about the effects of multiple rounds of belt-tightening , which have resulted in cuts to pensions and pay . They have seen unemployment soar to more than 25 % .

Earlier , protesters in Athens threw Molotov cocktails and police fought back with tear gas outside the parliament as lawmakers prepared to vote .

There is a second step needed before Greece can get the bailout funds : Sunday 's vote on the 2013 budget . Because it contains many of the measures from Wednesday 's vote , it is expected to pass .

More than one-fifth of the population could face poverty , defined as a family of four on an income of 13,842 euros -LRB- about $ 17,500 -RRB- per year , state news agency AMNA has reported .

The austerity bill sets out reforms and fiscal measures worth 13.5 billion euros over the next two years . It will raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 and cut pensions on average between 5 % and 15 % .

Some salaries in the public sector will be reduced by about a third , and several bonuses will be scrapped . Some judges must take a 30 % pay cut , for example .

The thorniest issue is that of labor law changes .

`` The measures just never stop . Every time , politicians say they are going to be the last measures ... they are never the last , '' Melina Grigoriadou , a 50-year-old married businesswoman with two children , told CNN .

Although Grigoriadou works for an export company that has not cut wages , she said her family 's income has fallen by almost a third because of new taxes , higher utility bills and inflation .

As she looks around in Thessaloniki , Greece 's second-largest city , she sees real poverty affecting those who 've had their incomes and pensions drastically cut , or suddenly lost their jobs . Despite paying for social security from her wages , getting a doctor 's appointment now takes months and medicines are costly , she added .

What makes the hardship worse is that the international funds Greece stands to receive will not go to help create jobs or support infrastructure , Grigoriadou said , but to service its huge debt .

Some critics of austerity have called for economic stimulus programs instead , like those implemented in the United States .

But if Greece is to stick to the course laid out by the so-called troika -- the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- more budget cuts will be necessary , as the country 's debt woes are worse than previously believed .

The Democratic Party of the Left , or DIMAR , one of three parties making up the coalition headed by Samaras , said it would abstain from the vote on the new round of austerity measures , turning in blank ballots . Still , it plans to vote Sunday to approve the government 's new budget .

Samaras ' own center-right New Democracy party was expected to vote in favor of the package .

Although the third coalition member -- the socialist party Pasok -- supports the cuts , individual party members came out against them .

Radical leftist party Syriza , bitterly opposed to austerity and closely connected to Greek unions , called on its website for Greeks to demonstrate against the `` rape '' of democracy and the dashing of the hopes of the people .
