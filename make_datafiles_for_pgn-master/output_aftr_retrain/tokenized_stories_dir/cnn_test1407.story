By 2030 , the top cancer killers in the United States will be lung , pancreas and liver , according to a new report published Monday in the American Association for Cancer Research 's journal .

Researchers looked at trends in cancer incidence and death rates between 2006 and 2010 , and used that data -- combined with expected U.S. demographic changes -- to predict numbers for 2030 .

Overall , the cancer-related death rate has been decreasing , researchers say , as a result of improved screening and treatment options . Yet while deaths from breast , prostate and colon cancers are projected to drop , deaths caused by liver , pancreatic , bladder and leukemia cancers are expected to increase .

`` We 've been able to turn the tide in other cancers , with an investment in -LRB- research -RRB- , '' said lead author Lynn Matrisian , vice president of scientific and medical affairs at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network , which funded the study . `` We 're hoping that with increased effort ... we will be able to impact and change those projections . ''

The rate of pancreatic cancer has been slowly increasing for the past 15 years , says Dr. Otis Brawley , chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society . Some of that rise can be attributed to the prevalence of obesity and diabetes .

`` Many Americans are not aware that the combination of obesity , high-caloric intake and lack of physical activity is the second-leading cause of cancer in the U.S. , '' Brawley said . `` It is linked to at least 12 types of cancer , of which these are two . This is an American problem ... the rise in pancreatic cancer is not as severe as in Europe where obesity is less of an issue . ''

Obesity may affect cancer patients ' outcomes

This is unlikely to change by 2030 , the researchers say , except for colorectal cancer , which is expected to be surpassed by thyroid , melanoma and uterine cancers in total number of cases .

The dramatic increase in thyroid cases is not a new epidemic , they say , but simply an increase in the number of cases being diagnosed . And while thyroid cancer has a 98 % five-year survival rate , only 6 % of pancreatic cancer patients are alive five years after diagnosis .

The pancreas is difficult to scan with current imaging technologies , Matrisian says , because of its location in the body . And pancreatic tumors are often surrounded by dense tissue that render drugs useless . Surgery is the only treatment known to cure pancreatic cancer , but less than 20 % of cases are operable , the report says .
