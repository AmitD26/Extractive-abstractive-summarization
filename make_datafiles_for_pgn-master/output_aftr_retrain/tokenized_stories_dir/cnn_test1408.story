Talks with Iran over its nuclear program resume Thursday . Make no mistake : The deal the Obama administration is pursuing with Iran over its nuclear program is a good deal . It will leave Iran with neither a nuclear weapon nor an undetectable breakout capability . And by ensuring that the deal also is a win for Iran , Tehran wo n't have incentives to cheat and violate the agreement .

It 's either a deal or another war in the Middle East . Those are the stakes .

Iran 's nuclear program has steadily advanced over the years . As the West has escalated sanctions to gain leverage , the Iranians have escalated their nuclear program for the same reason .

In 2005 , the Iranians offered to cap their enrichment program at 3,000 centrifuges . The West nixed that offer . By the time the George W. Bush administration left office , the Iranians had around 7,221 centrifuges . Today , they have more than 19,000 centrifuges . Their stockpile of low enriched uranium has reached more than 10,000 kilograms . It was around 1,000 kilograms when Barack Obama took office .

The end result is that the Iranians have added a lot of new facts on the ground , making a complete roll back a near impossibility . The nuclear deal that could have been secured years ago is likely more attractive than any deal Washington can strike a year from now .

In addition , Washington 's current negotiation cards may soon expire .

The sanctions regime and the international consensus to isolate Tehran might quickly disintegrate if talks fail and the blame falls on Washington -LRB- read Congress -RRB- . In fact , the Iranians are counting on this .

Those in Congress worried that even the offer of modest sanctions relief in the talks will cause the collapse of the current sanctions infrastructure must consider how quickly sanctions can fall apart if there is n't a deal . In the former case , Washington will extract valuable concessions from Iran in return for the lifting of sanctions . In the latter case , Washington will lose the sanctions without getting anything from the Iranians .

That would be the cost of Congress overplaying its hand .

No wonder U.S. lead negotiator Wendy Sherman told CNN after the last round of talks that `` we have to do everything we can to reach a diplomatic solution . '' She continued : `` There are other options , but a diplomatic solution is the best option , and we all have to do everything we can as quickly as we can to see if in fact we can achieve just that . ''

Fortunately , diplomacy is not only the best available option , the deal Obama is pursuing is also a very good option .
