To prove she was n't just an opportunist hoping to use a U.S. Senate seat in New York as a ticket to bigger things , then-first lady Hillary Clinton tried to show voters that she cared about their values and views -- she listened .

5 things we learned from Bill Clinton interview

There is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that Clinton is saying what she needs to get elected , but would govern differently .

`` You wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment demands , '' Kohn said .

Starting in May , before Clinton crisscrossed the country selling her book `` Hard Choices , '' the former secretary of state started to talk about populist and liberal issues like college affordability and income inequality .

Zelizer : Are Democrats afraid of the income inequality issue ?

Clinton told an audience at the liberal New American Foundation in May that `` the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach '' and because of that , `` many Americans understandably feel frustrated , even angry . ''

Clinton has also recently labeled college affordability `` one of the biggest problems we have in the country , '' and says if she were elected president she would `` tackle growth , which is the handmaiden of inequality . '' People close to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the minimum wage .

Clinton would back limits on money in politics

Clinton 's changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book tour , like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was `` dead broke '' when it left the White House .

At the same time , possible opponents from the left -- like Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Vice President Joe Biden -- have generated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to Clinton .

Other than changing her tune , Clinton has n't been quick to address liberals who have questions for her . Instead of sitting down with them -- something that a candidate would certainly do , especially one battling distrust -- she has continued to hold events around her book and her family 's foundation .

Polls might explain why she has n't reached out yet : Right now , liberals do n't matter that much to whether Clinton would win the Democratic nomination in 2016 .

A CNN/ORC International Poll from June found that only 11 % of Democrats want a more liberal option to Clinton . Twenty percent want someone more conservative and 63 % want Clinton .

What 's more , a Washington Post/ABC News poll from the same time showed that 72 % of self-described liberals supported Clinton , a number that was larger than moderate and conservative Democrats .

While Stamp , who attended Netroots Nation , said there was n't an overarching feeling of being snubbed by Clinton , she acknowledged , `` It would have been interesting to hear her in a progressive setting . ''

`` People want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates hear about the work they are doing on the ground , '' she added .

After the conference , left-leaning Democrats said they felt more energized and organized than ever -- and they hope that will lead to more influence on who their party nominates in 2016 .

Rubio calls Clinton a ' 20th century ' candidate

`` She should n't be the inevitable candidate , '' said Erica Sagrans , the campaign manager for Ready for Warren , an effort to enlist Warren to run for president in 2016 . `` Our take is that no one should feel like they ca n't support a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there is a lot of support for Hillary . ''

On this goal , progressives seem to be winning . Clinton has talked more about populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be forced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president .

`` There is this sort of inherent question , is Hillary ready for us ? '' Kohn said about 2016 . `` It is not enough to just be the next in line . The question is : Are you really , truly listening ? ''
