Two American missionary workers infected with the deadly Ebola virus were given an experimental drug that seems to have saved their lives .

Dr. Kent Brantly was given the medication , ZMapp , shortly after telling his doctors he thought he would die , according to a source familiar with his case . Within an hour , doctors say his symptoms -- labored breathing and a widespread rash -- dramatically improved . Nancy Writebol , another missionary working with Samaritan 's Purse , received two doses of the medication and has also shown significant improvement , sources say .

The drug was developed by the biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. , which is based in San Diego . The company was founded in 2003 `` to develop novel pharmaceuticals for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases , focusing on unmet needs in global health and biodefense , '' according to its website .

Mapp Biopharmaceutical has been working with the National Institutes of Health and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency , an arm of the military responsible for countering weapons of mass destruction , to develop an Ebola treatment for several years .

`` A whole menu of antibodies have been identified as potentially therapeutic , and researchers are eager to figure out which combinations are most effective and why , '' a news release about the grant said .

Tekmira , a Vancouver-based company that has a $ 140 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop an Ebola drug , began Phase 1 trials with its drug in January . But the FDA recently halted the trial , asking for more information .

Sources told CNN the medicine given to Brantly and Writebol abroad was a three-mouse monoclonal antibody , meaning that mice were exposed to fragments of the Ebola virus and then the antibodies generated within the mice 's blood were harvested to create the medicine .

However , the drug can also be produced with proteins made from tobacco plants . ZMapp manufacturer Kentucky BioProcessing in Owensboro has been working with Samaritan 's Purse and Emory University Hospital to provide limited quantities of the drug to Emory , according to company spokesman David Howard .

4 . Why did American missionary workers get the drug ?

Many have asked why these two workers received the experimental drug when so many -- around 1,600 -- others in West Africa also have the virus .

The process by which the medication was made available to the American patients may have fallen under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 's `` compassionate use '' regulation , which allows access to investigational drugs outside clinical trials .

No . The drug had shown promise in primates , but even in those experiments , just eight monkeys received the treatment . In any case , the human immune system can react differently than primates ' , which is why drugs are required to undergo human clinical trials before being approved by government agencies for widespread use .

Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , says scientists have to be careful about assuming this drug will work in other patients as it appears to have worked in Brantly .

`` Having worked with administering antibodies for people for a really long time , that would be distinctly unusual , '' he told CNN . `` As we all know in medicine ... you have to withhold judgment . ''

7 . Does the company have more vials of the drug ?

'' -LRB- Kentucky BioProcessing -RRB- is working closely with Mapp , various government agencies , and other parties to increase production of ZMapp , but this process will take several months , '' Howard said .

We do n't know . Samaritan 's Purse covered the cost of Brantly and Writebol 's evacuations but did not pay for the drug , according to a spokesman .

When a patient gets an experimental drug , the drug company can donate the product under compassionate use . Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc. might have done that in this case .

Health insurance companies typically do not pick up the tab for treatments that have not been approved by the FDA . But they usually would cover the cost of any doctor fees associated with giving the drug and any costs associated with monitoring how the drug is working .

9 . Would this drug stop the Ebola epidemic ?

If it were widely available , it certainly could n't hurt . An effective Ebola drug could help doctors treat the deadly virus , which is killing about 60 % of the people infected in West Africa . But a vaccine would be a much more effective tool in stopping this , and future , epidemics .
