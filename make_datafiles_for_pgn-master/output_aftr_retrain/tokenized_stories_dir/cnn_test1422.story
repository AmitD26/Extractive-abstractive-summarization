The number of new Ebola cases is growing faster than the ability of health officials to handle them , the head of the World Health Organization said Friday .

`` In the three hardest hit countries , Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in the Ebola-specific treatment centers , '' said Margaret Chan , the WHO director-general . `` Today , there is not one single bed available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia . ''

At least 2,400 people have died in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , where the outbreak has been concentrated , Chan said . Cases have also been reported in nearby Nigeria and Senegal .

This is considered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history . The World Health Organization said Monday the rapid spread of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing .

Taxis packed with families who fear they 've contracted the deadly virus crisscross the Liberian capital , searching for a place where they can be treated , the WHO said .

`` As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened , it immediately fills to overflowing with patients , '' the U.N. group said .

The new funds will pay for transportation and support to send 100 more health care workers to help fight the epidemic . The WHO and several nonprofit agencies on the ground have repeatedly called for the international community to send additional trained help .

On Sunday , President Barack Obama said the Ebola outbreak needs to be a `` national security priority . '' He told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the U.S. military could help set up isolation units and provide security for public health workers .

`` If we do n't make that effort now , and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world , there 's the prospect then that the virus mutates . It becomes more easily transmittable . And then it could be a serious danger to the United States , '' he said .
