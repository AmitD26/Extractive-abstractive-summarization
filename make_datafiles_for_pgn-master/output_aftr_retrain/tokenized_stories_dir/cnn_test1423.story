Mike Linder , director of the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality , told CNN that the proposal from TransCanada will undergo a public comment period followed by final revisions by the company before his agency does its full assessment .

A State Department official told CNN on Thursday that the Obama administration has not received a new permit application for the proposed alternate route for the northern portion of the pipeline .

Linder , a Republican who is a political appointee , said it is up to TransCanada to submit a permit application to the State Department .

The 1,700-mile pipeline , intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day , has become a political lightning rod in the United States .

Last year , the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013 , citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the vital Ogallala Aquifer , which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state 's agricultural economy .

Environmentalists fear a burst in the pipeline would allow oil to seep into the massive water table .

Supporters , including the oil industry , say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country 's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions .

Under the timeline provided by Linder , hearings for public comment will be held and TransCanada will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route .

`` We will have a significant amount of time for public comment , '' Linder said . '' ... They 'll refine the route they really want to focus on as a preferred route and then do a more in-depth analysis on the ground of the actual route . ''

Regarding the State Department 's role , Linder said the situation is unique because under normal circumstances , TransCanada would have an application pending . However , the initial application was rejected , so the company must file a new one .

Republican leaders are pressuring Obama and Democrats to speed approval of the pipeline .

`` With this new route submitted and the state of Nebraska acting to move forward , the president is running out of excuses for blocking the Keystone pipeline any longer , '' House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , told CNN on Wednesday , noting that a `` veto-proof majority '' in the House of Representatives supports the project .

The House on Wednesday approved a Republican bill that aims to fast-track the Keystone project as part of another 90-day extension of federal transportation funding . The 293-127 vote allows Boehner to begin negotiations with Senate Democrats over a longer-term funding measure for road , rail and bridge projects .

Obama announced in March that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline , which runs from Cushing , Oklahoma -- a key repository of U.S. oil -- to the Gulf . He had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion , even when he blocked the full project .

Giving the Canadian oil easier access to the Gulf means the glut in the Midwest goes away , making it more expensive for the region , but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets .
