It is 10 years after the invasion of Iraq , and images of Iraqi women from various political parties are filling the streets of Baghdad ahead of April 's local elections -- a sign to casual observers that women 's equality is on track in this war-ravaged country .

On the political front , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has not appointed a single woman to a senior cabinet position , despite the fact women are guaranteed 25 % of the seats in parliament by the constitution . The Ministry of Women 's Affairs , a poorly-funded and mostly ceremonial department , is the lone ministry headed up by a woman .

Constitutionally , women were able to secure the ability to pass their citizenship on to their children by non-Iraqi husbands , making Iraq one of a handful Arab countries with such a provision for their female citizens .

This not only is making women more vulnerable , it is giving women from various sects -LRB- Sunni or Shia -RRB- or religion -LRB- Muslim or Christian -RRB- different legal treatments on the same issues .

Economically , women have gone from being visibly active in the Iraqi work force in the 1980s -- particularly in the farming , marketing and professional services sectors -- to being nearly non-existent in 2013 .

The saddest part of the story is the lost memory of what Iraqi women once were . I grew up in Baghdad with a working mother who drove herself to the office and always told me that I could anything I wanted with my life . My mother 's friends were factory managers , artists , principals and doctors .

It would be unfair to blame the regression Iraqi women have faced only on the last 10 years , as the previous decade of economic sanctions that preceded it also took its toll on Iraqi society .

But it is necessary to observe -- especially in light of all the changes that are happening in post-Arab Spring countries -- that female political participation in a country 's democratic process can not be the end of the story . Women 's active economic and social engagement is just as crucial to society as it is to their own wellbeing .

America entered Iraq in 2003 with lots of promises , but women 's rights were not even on the radar screen . Ten years later , Iraqi women find themselves the subjects of a story that does not have a happy ending .
