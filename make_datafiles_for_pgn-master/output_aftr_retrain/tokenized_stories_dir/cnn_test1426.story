-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the midst of the contentious debate over the Common Core State Standards , many critics have lost perspective on its purpose .

In 1983 , then Secretary of Education Terrel Bell commissioned the seminal report , `` A Nation at Risk , '' which highlighted American students ' falling SAT scores and awakened the nation to its educational malaise . Among many of the report 's recommendations , which eventually became a platform for modern education reforms , were calls for `` more rigorous and measurable standards . '' American students were victims of low expectations and inconsistent learning goals .

But despite the report 's warnings and billions of dollars more spent on education , not much has changed . Thanks to benchmarked national and international exams , like the National Assessment of Educational Progress -LRB- NAEP -RRB- or Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study -LRB- TIMSS -RRB- , we know that American students continue to fall short . -LRB- There 's one sliver of good news : For a number of reasons there have been dramatic improvements in some individual states like Massachusetts . -RRB-

These exams highlighted how the performance of American students differed widely between states and districts . Some states had high internationally competitive standards ; others were far too low . In fact , some states were dumbing down standards and exams in order to hide the poor performance of their students .

For example , New York State rated 87 % of its fourth graders proficient in math , according to its own state testing in 2009 . That would be astounding -- if true . But NAEP results calculated that only 40 % of the state 's fourth graders were proficient or better in math .

So began the coordinated effort from governors , educators and legislators to compose benchmarked standards that would be the same across state lines . The product became the Common Core State Standards . Its genesis was local and its purpose was to lift education performance through state , not federal , collaboration . This was the original intent of the Common Core . It is a worthy and necessary idea .

While various questions about Common Core and its implementation persist , such as how to handle data privacy or concerns that some of the standards may not be rigorous enough , individual states have the right and ability to craft their own supplemental solutions . For example , this year Ohio passed HB 487 to protect the confidentiality of student data and Florida altered its Common Core standards to include more advanced calculus standards .

Some of the criticisms leveled against Common Core stem from mistakes made in local implementations -- not from a uniform federal mandate . It is ironic that the very thing which many of Common Core 's critics value the most -- local control -- has often resulted in curricula , subject matter , readings , and exercises in local classrooms that are objectionable , substandard , or politically tendentious .

Bennett : The problem is how to address American students ' flat or falling test scores

He says lack of common standards means inconsistent and unreliable learning results
