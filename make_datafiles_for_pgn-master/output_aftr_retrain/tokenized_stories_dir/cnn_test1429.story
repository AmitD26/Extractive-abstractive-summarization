Khartoum , Sudan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Many southerners are voting for an independent Sudan this week , thirsting for freedom from the north . They equate sharia or Islamic law that President Omar al-Bashir has vowed to strengthen with slavery .

Al-Bashir has declared that if Southern Sudan votes in favor of separation , sharia will become the main source of Sudan 's Constitution , Islam the state religion and Arabic the official language .

Many in the north are embracing al-Bashir 's pledge .

`` When the south goes , then the north will be Muslim , '' he said . `` For a Muslim , unity is not as important as religion . Sharia is religion . Sharia is Islam . ''

But there are other faces of Islam in Sudan , including a Sufi community , and Mustafa 's position is hardly shared by all Sudanese .

Even many Muslims find the imposition of Islamic law troubling , and it 's even more disturbing for the small and ancient Christian community in the north .

`` We as Christians , we feel that Christianity is a Sudanese religion and should be respected , '' said Bishop Ezekiel Kondo , who oversees Khartoum 's Episcopal Church and chairs the Sudan Council of Churches .

Al-Bashir 's vow to strengthen Islamic law came as a shock to Kondo .

But Mohammed Othman Salih , secretary-general of the Sudanese Muslim Clerics Council , brushed aside such concerns .
