The famed inventor , military hero and former boy scout , told CNN that advances in the use of GPS mean that the technology could not only emerge in the next few years , but is already being road tested by companies such as Google .

If there is anyone who should know about the future of GPS , it is Brad Parkinson . The former air force colonel was an integral member of the team that invented GPS technology . While he is now a professor emeritus at Stanford University in California , in the 1980s Parkinson headed up the GPS program run by the U.S. military .

`` When I invented the system I was a United States colonel , '' says Parkinson . `` I was in the air force and had a PhD in aeronautics from Stanford , and a master 's degree from MIT . I 'd been testing inertial navigation systems for three years in my past and I had taken digital controls at MIT . ''

The development of GPS was the product of a military program called 621B . Parkinson had the idea that satellites could be used to help find and track targets to make weapon deployment more accurate .

Initially , the military was resistant to the idea , says Parkinson . `` The air force did n't want it because first of all they thought we could n't necessarily do it and secondly they are used to their old ways . And their old ways were , in essence , carpet bombing , it was very sad . ''

Fortunately Parkinson found some powerful allies who helped drive the program forward . At a critical moment in the fledgling technology 's development , Malcolm Currie , a physicist and U.S. Navy officer , introduced Parkinson to General Kenneth Shultz , whose personal interest in the program kept the research of GPS alive .

`` The most dangerous thing in an automobile is the driver . Usually because of distractions or because he does n't understand how slippery the road is . I 'm saying GPS can absolutely be the key and cornerstone ... This is really exciting .

`` As Google has already demonstrated , robotic cars are already here , '' says Parkinson , `` but the version that they are using is far too expensive and cumbersome to be a practical product for general use . ''

As with most new technologies , Parkinson anticipates a ` trickle down ' effect whereby cutting-edge experiments being done at the top level will gradually be incorporated into everyday vehicles .

In September 2012 , California legalized self-driving vehicles . The new law obliges the California Department of Motor Vehicles to draft regulations for autonomous vehicles by the beginning 2015 , meaning robot cars are unlikely to become available before that point .
