CNN 's On the Road Japan team visited Japan 's oldest whisky distillery just outside Kyoto to learn more about a spirit that 's just been named the best in the world .

Just a few weeks ago , the Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013 , made by beverage giant Suntory , took home top honors in Jim Murray 's `` Whisky Bible '' . The whisky guru referred to it as `` near indescribable genius . '' Scotch did n't even make the top three .

While Japanese whisky has been taking home awards for over a decade , this was a first . And standing in the cellar piled high with oak casks , some American , some Spanish , and some Japanese , you get the sense that its rise around the globe has only just begun .

Do n't call it Scotch

Perhaps it 's the purity of the water , which Fukuyo says makes a gentle spirit . Or maybe it 's because the whisky is exposed to Japan 's dry , cold winters and hot , humid summers as it matures inside those casks . Or maybe it 's about the blending .

Creating a perfect blend

Formulas of the most popular labels can change up to two dozen times a year , Fukuyo says , because no two casks are exactly the same . Change one ingredient in the blend and that precious balance is no more .

It 's a challenge that seems even more daunting when we learn some products use 15 or 20 different types of whisky . Even single malt contains whisky from about ten casks , he says , although all from a single distillery to qualify for the single-malt moniker .

A matter of taste

From blending , we 're on to tasting . If you like your whisky neat , well , here 's the first big surprise with Japanese whisky : add water . Even if it 's just a dash .

So once in the glass , the whisky has to hold its character and flavor , even while the proof begins to drop . Fukuyo confesses he drinks it straight , but definitely not without a drop or two of water to open it up .

As for that best-in-the-world whisky ? You ca n't get it in Japan , Fukuyo says . Only 3,000 bottles were released , and they were all exported .

While Japanese whisky is making headlines , whisky culture in the country is distinctly low-key . Many whisky bars are small with only a dozen or so seats and a solitary bartender .

Fragments fly in every direction as Suzuki chips away , before he spins his handiwork into a lowball glass , pours single malt whisky over the top and then carefully lifts the cube twice with a spoon to release the aromas .

We 've learned our lesson . Another 12-year Yamazaki on the `` rock , '' please . It 's time to relax and enjoy .
