U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces take control of Mosul Dam on Monday , fighting back ISIS militants who had seized the dam , President Obama told reporters .

`` The U.S. military used fighters , bombers , attack and unmanned aircraft to conduct 35 strikes , '' said Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby . `` We destroyed over 90 targets including a range of vehicles , equipment and fighting positions , '' he said .

The brutal attacks of ISIS militants as they took control of towns and villages in northern Iraq forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee .

`` ISIS tells people to pay or convert , '' said one Christian man who fled ISIS forces .

`` We were afraid , terrified they 'd call us infidels , '' a Christian woman there told CNN 's Nick Paton Walsh . `` My Muslim friend told me to just leave . ''

Now she said she hopes ISIS fighters wo n't reach the monastery .

On several ISIS websites , the group posted a message Monday threatening that `` America will disappear from the map soon on the hands of knights of al-Khilafa , '' a reference to the caliphate ISIS claims it wants to recapture .

Built in the early 1980s under former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein , the dam sits on the Tigris River about 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- north of the city of Mosul . It serves as a key source of electricity , irrigation and flood protection .

ISIS has a track record of attacking its enemies with water .

`` ISIS has already used other smaller dams to gain control of territory , to pressure Sunnis to support them and to punish the Shiites , '' Daniel Pipes , president of the Middle East Forum , told CNN this month .

The 3.2-kilometer-long Mosul Dam holds back as much as 12.5 million cubic meters of water , according to Engineering News-Record , a construction industry website .

` Very poor foundation '

But even if the militant group does n't try to destroy the dam , concerns remain about its sturdiness .

A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report in 2006 said that what made the dam especially dangerous was the risk of internal erosion of its foundations .

The structure is built on layers of soil that dissolve or erode in water .

The Army Corps said the dam was `` constructed on a very poor foundation '' that was n't designed for the conditions .

Seepage has plagued the structure since the reservoir behind it was filled , according to a U.S. government report in 2007 , and sinkholes have appeared near the structure , suggesting problems beneath the surface .

During the American military occupation of Iraq , U.S. authorities spent tens of millions of dollars on short-term repairs on the dam .

But with the immense structure now in the midst of a conflict zone , it remains unclear if it will get the maintenance it needs anytime soon .
