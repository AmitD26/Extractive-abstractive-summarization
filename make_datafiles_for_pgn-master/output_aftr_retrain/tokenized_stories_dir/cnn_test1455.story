-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Wednesday , a propaganda video appeared on the Internet featuring Moner Abu-Salha , the U.S. citizen from Florida who died conducting a suicide bomb attack in Syria for al Qaeda in May .

Abu-Salha says he travelled from the States to Turkey where he eventually connected with representatives of the Nusra Front , al Qaeda 's Syrian affiliate , explaining , `` From tons of research I knew that mujahideen -LSB- holy warriors -RSB- come from all around the world , they come to Istanbul . I heard that the Turkey-Syrian border is close . ''

He says that the members of al Qaeda then took Abu-Salha to a `` safe house '' in Turkey where he encountered two other al Qaeda fighters who had been wounded and who were recovering in the house .

Abu-Salha stayed at the safe house for a month , he says , before he was spirited across the border into Syria .

The issue of `` homegrown '' American extremists fighting in Iraq and Syria has raised significant concerns among counterterrorism officials . The government is tracking about 100 Americans who have fought or attempted to fight in the Syrian conflict .

Douglas McArthur McCain , who grew up in Minnesota , died while fighting for the ultra-militant Islamic State in Syria this past weekend .

However , for now , no American involved in the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts has been charged with plotting an attack inside the United States . Both Moner Abu-Salha and Douglas McCain died fighting in the region rather than conducting attacks in their own country .

A European diplomat in Turkey told Reuters , `` In recent months especially we 've seen a real hardening in Turkey 's attitude , a recognition that this is a potential threat to their national security and a desire to take more practical steps through intelligence channels , police channels . ''

Abu-Salah 's recounting of his travel illustrates the potential risks foreign fighters take when seeking to reach Syria -- which may be exploitable by security services . Of his initial attempts to connect with militants in Turkey he said : `` It was very dangerous what I was doing because I could have went to jail . ''

If Turkey 's new measures to disrupt the foreign fighter flow continue and a coalition can be built to adequately track and disrupt movement of militants into Syria and Iraq , the threat posed by Americans and other Westerners fighting with jihadist groups in the region may diminish over time .
