Jose Callejon scored a late winner for Real Madrid against Mallorca on Saturday evening as Jose Mourinho 's men fought back from a goal down to defeat Mallorca 2-1 and extend their lead at the top of La Liga .

Israeli international Tomer Hemed gave Mallorca the lead in the 39th minute which they held on to until the last quarter of the match .

Third-placed Valencia missed the chance to move within one point of Barca as they slumped to a 1-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad .

Mauricio Lanzaro gave them the lead with a well-executed header in the 39th minute , but 11 minutes from time Zaragoza defender Javier Paredes scored an own goal .

It denied the home side a valuable three points which would have put them in touch with fellow strugglers Sporting Gijon and Villarreal .

The kick-off had already been delayed due to a torrential downpour , but further rain during the game forced referee to Paolo Tagliavento to take the players off and eventually force a premature end to the match with the score a 1-1 .
