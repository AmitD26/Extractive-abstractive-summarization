Just a few blocks from Rodeo Drive sits the Spadena House , or Witch 's House as it is universally called , inducing double takes from most who pass by .

If it were n't so impressive , the Witch 's House might be an eyesore : The shutters look like they 're falling off , the roof is curling and the yard is thorny . It resembles the rickety gingerbread house occupied by the witch in `` Hansel and Gretel . ''

`` The whole concept is that the house should feel as if it emanated from the ground , '' says Libow , a Coldwell Banker real estate agent who bought the home nearly two decades ago and has been restoring its , well , decay ever since . Everything is carefully designed to create `` a home that looks as if it 's 300 years old that really is n't . ''

Take the rotting cedar shingles : Libow had them dyed to look like they 'd been on the home for centuries . The wavy look of the roof makes it appear as if `` the home could take off at any moment , '' he says -- witchcraft , you might say , achieved by stacking plywood underneath the shingles .

Libow actually lives in the home , making it off limits to the public . But tour guides shuttle eager visitors past the home daily .

And while overzealous tour guides tout its appearance in everything from `` The Witches of Eastwick '' to `` Hocus Pocus , '' Libow says the only modern-day film the home has appeared in was 1995 's `` Clueless . ''

`` It was strictly a background shot -LRB- with -RRB- Alicia Silverstone walking by the house , '' he says . `` But everybody respects the home for being in that movie . ''

The Witch 's House is believed to have first appeared on screen in the 1921 silent film `` The Face of the World , '' says Kimberly Reiss of Beverly Hills Heritage , an organization dedicated to promoting the history of the city .

`` The thing that makes this property important is it set the bar for storybook architecture in Los Angeles during the '20s and '30s , '' she says .

By the time the home came back on the market in the late 1990s , Libow , a Realtor , called it a `` sixties nightmare '' and it was only getting interest from buyers who wanted to tear it down , something the seller forbid . The more Libow showed the Witch 's House , the more it cast a spell on him .

Today , the home is n't just a tour stop or a must-visit for trick-or-treaters on Halloween . In 2013 the Witch 's House became an official Beverly Hills landmark , something Libow worked hard to achieve .
