In Illinois , African-Americans make up 15 % of the population -- but account for 58 % of the marijuana-possession arrests , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .

In Alabama , African-Americans make up less than 25 % of the population -- but 60 % of the marijuana-possession arrests , the ACLU says .

And the ACLU says the findings show racial disparities in marijuana arrests have grown significantly over the past 10 years .

Counting both juvenile and adult arrests , rates for whites have remained steady at about 192 arrests per 100,000 people . But the arrest rate for blacks rose from 537 per 100,000 in 2001 to 716 per 100,000 in 2010 , according to the report , meaning that proportionately , blacks are 3.7 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana .

Increasing arrest rates do n't correlate to marijuana usage rates by race , according to data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 2001-2012 cited in the ACLU report .

In 2010 , for example , 27.6 % of African-Americans ages 18-25 and 33.4 % of whites in the same age group said they had used marijuana in the previous 12 months .

Joseph Occhipinti , executive director of the National Police Defense Foundation , says despite the numbers , the disparity in arrest rates is n't racially motivated .

`` The aggressive policing of marijuana is time-consuming , costly , racially biased , and does n't work , '' says Edwards . `` These arrests have a significant detrimental impact on people 's lives , as well as on the communities in which they live . ''

The ACLU study estimates that combined , U.S. states spent over $ 3.6 billion enforcing marijuana possession laws in 2010 , and there was one marijuana arrest every 37 seconds .

According to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , `` Marijuana is a harmful drug and its use should be prevented and treated -- not promoted . ''

`` These arrests rarely result in prosecution , and there is no basis for believing this is a deterrent , '' he told CNN . `` It 's hard to see the purpose being served . The only use I can see is putting certain people , and in this case young black men , on notice . When you look at the statistical pattern , it 's hard not to see this as racial profiling . ''
