Soccer star David will take former popstar wife Victoria and their four children back to Europe , with big-spending French club Paris Saint-Germain confirming that the former England captain has passed a medical and signed a short-term deal ahead of Thursday 's transfer deadline .

The 37-year-old was later unveiled at a press conference , ending speculation about his next destination following the end of his six-year spell with U.S. MLS team Los Angeles Galaxy in early December .

He had been linked with a host of clubs around the world but , in the twilight of his career , has decided to join a team on the rise thanks to the injection of hundreds of millions of dollars by its Qatari owners .

Beckham is one of the world 's most recognisable names , both for his sporting prowess and numerous off-pitch endorsement deals , and his pulling power could provide a valuable income stream for PSG -- which must conform to European football 's financial fair play rules that restrict over-spending by club owners .

`` I think it 's very difficult to quantify , '' Chadwick said . `` He 's been away from Europe for too long -- he 's now really in his twilight years , we do n't know what part he 'll play in the team , we do n't know how he 'll be used for commercial purposes , we do n't know how the French public will respond .

However , one leading football executive who had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Beckham to join his team said that the midfielder still had a strong role to play on and off the pitch .

`` Not only were we looking for a playmaker in midfield but also a leader in the dressing room and someone to set the standards on and off the pitch . Beckham would have brought all that , '' the executive told CNN on condition of anonymity .

`` Sure Beckham would have ensured exposure and possibly commercial opportunities , but without the quality as a player it would n't have been at all interesting . ''

Beckham had the chance to join PSG in January 2012 , but opted to stay in the U.S. , ending his American mission with his second MLS Cup title before announcing that he would not fulfill the second year of his contract extension .

`` It 's an exciting city and now there 's a club that 's going to have a lot of success over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years . I 'm very honored I 've been picked to be part of the future of PSG . ''

`` But when I watched him in the MLS he still has the physical condition to play at the highest level . He likes to compete . On the pitch he can add a lot .

`` They are not signing him for his ability to sprint -- it 's his technique and vision . He has that ability to elevate his game depending on the opposition . He can play a part for PSG in both Ligue 1 and Champions League . ''

The club 's owners , the Qatar Investment Authority , have splashed out on top players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic , Thiago Silva , Javier Pastore and Lucas Moura since taking over in 2011 .

`` He told me that he does n't look at all to be in shape . Beckham is super-ambitious , '' Arsene Wenger told reporters this week .

`` If , in his mind , he wanted to play in the Premier League he would not have gone on holiday . He would have prepared and come in and tried to impress me . He told me he has done nothing at all . ''

Beckham admitted it might take `` a few weeks '' to get fully fit .

`` It wo n't take long , '' he said .

He explained that he could not play for another club in England except Manchester United , where he won six Premier League titles and the Champions League before moving to Spain in 2003 .

`` I 'm very honored by the offers I had from other Premier League clubs but I did n't want to play there unless it was for Manchester United . ''
