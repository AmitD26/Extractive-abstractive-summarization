-LRB- CNN -RRB- These days , Silicon Valley is hot and Wall Street is not .

There 's a tech bubble and no one knows when exactly it will pop . We have sky-rocketing valuations like Airbnb -LRB- $ 13 billion -RRB- , Uber -LRB- $ 41 billion -RRB- , Snapchat -LRB- $ 10 billion -RRB- , Dropbox -LRB- $ 10 billion -RRB- and so on .

But there 's one problem : The startup world is cluttered with `` wantrapreneurs '' who fail to recognize that success demands a tenacity , resiliency and energy unlike any traditional job short of combat infantry soldier or SWAT team member .

One top venture capitalist remarked that we see only about a dozen great companies emerge every year in the U.S. Too often , they 're doing boring and un-techy things like preventing or curing diseases , or solving complex big data challenges that just are n't as sexy or well-publicized as the next hot-or-not dating app .

As the job market recovers , hopefully , more of those wannabes turn to good old-fashioned W2 jobs , with predictability , stability and health insurance . It 's a place where 99 % of people belong . The lesser entrepreneurs should go out and find regular jobs , clearing the clutter for those with the idea , drive and overwhelming ambition to build truly great companies . Because really , we do n't need more startups that are lame , same and tame .

If you 're not a passionate , tenacious , driven entrepreneur willing to work 90-plus hours a week while confronting a high failure rate , update your resume and get a job .

Sameness : Do we really need a gazillion game apps ?

How can anyone get excited about the next food , personal finance , Web marketing or taxi dispatching tool with three or four cute new features ? Scores of niche versions of LinkedIn , for example , have died painful deaths , trying to do just what LinkedIn does well , but for some subset of the business world . Too many startups offer little more than a tweak in an effort to distinguish themselves .

Massive valuations were once the reward for unstoppable meteoric growth . Just think back on the very early days of Facebook , Google , Priceline and eBay . Sadly , very few startups sustain that kind of growth for anywhere near as long as they sustain their sky-high valuations .

How quickly did Myspace come and go ? Where went the rapid user growth of Twitter and Groupon and LivingSocial , among many others ? When Groupon merchants and customers did n't return , the stock went from a peak of $ 30 to a recent close of under $ 8 .

Amazon recognizes that it ca n't forever be a leading retailer . Its remedy ? New delivery systems , Amazon Web services , content , publishing platforms and more . Amazon will do what it takes to not be labeled tame . Google has seen a leveling off of its enormous search ad revenues , but the many businesses it has invested in or acquired will likely drive its growth for years to come .

But if you must ...
