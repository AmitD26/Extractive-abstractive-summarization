-LRB- CNN -RRB- He does n't wear a uniform or hold an official rank , but Hadi Al-Amari is a powerful military leader in Iraq .

He leads the Hashd Al-Shaabi , a predominantly Shia paramilitary force doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit from ISIS extremists .

Al-Amari is confident his men , with help from the Iraqi army and some Sunnis , can crush ISIS in Iraq without this coalition 's help . He 's sure because the Iranians are advising them .

`` We do n't need it , and we wo n't need it , '' he said . `` Anyone who puts their faith in the international coalition to liberate Iraq is putting their faith on a mirage . ''

Iran knows what it 's doing , in his view . `` Yes , we declare to the world , we have Iranian advisers , and we 're proud of them , and we thank them deeply for participating with us because Iran has more experience than anyone else on Earth in fighting terrorism . ''

Does it matter that Iran is advising militias fighting ISIS ? Does it matter which countries are taking part in the fight against ISIS -- including that one of them , Iran , is a longstanding U.S. foe ?

When asked questions along those lines Wednesday in Washington , it seemed that even top U.S. military officials did n't have easy answers . The view is that defeating ISIS is good , while relying on and possibly strengthening Iran is not .

To make sense of this all , one needs to understand not only the international landscape and Iraqi politics , but Islam itself .

The religion 's two major sects are Sunni and Shia . In Iraq , Sunni Arabs comprise 15 % to 20 % of Iraq 's population , with about half of them in urban areas like Baghdad , Mosul and Tikrit , according to the Council on Foreign Relations . About 18 % of Iraq 's population is Sunni Kurds .

And it matters .

Haider al-Abadi took over as Prime Minister last year in part to address these deep divisions . Still , some Sunnis have n't seen the change they want : For instance , Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud in February called for direct U.S. arming of Sunni tribes like his or at least pressure to make Iraq 's government help them more in the fight for Anbar province .

And Shiite militias sometimes have done more to hurt than help the cause of unity .

Just a few days ago , Iraq 's most powerful Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said people `` must always act with self-control , '' according to the New York Times . Still , there 's hardly a guarantee such calls for restraint will be answered , especially amid the chaos of war .

Given these harsh realities , it 's not necessarily cut and dried what a Sunni citizen in Tikrit will think if either Shia militias or the Shia-led Iraqi military battle the Sunni group ISIS .

Jessica Stern , a lecturer on terrorism at Harvard University who this month published , `` ISIS : The State of Terror , '' says it 's imperative to address the sectarian divisions in Iraq and continue pushing for changes in its government .

She notes that `` the anti-Sunni , Shia-promoting government of Maliki '' was a big reason ISIS was able `` to take root '' in Iraq .

`` Many Sunnis feel under siege . ISIS is saying , ` We 're going to protect you . ISIS is presenting itself as a savior of Sunnis , '' she said .

But , as Biddle points out , reform in a bureaucracy comes slow .

There 's been talk for years about healing Iraq 's sectarian divide . What 's to say talk will translate into action anytime soon ?

Biddle thinks the U.S. should consider sweetening the carrots offered to the Iraqis as incentives -- and start carrying bigger sticks -- to spur it to get its act together . The biggest stick would be pulling out of the fight against ISIS .

`` Right now we seem to be limping along with whatever they do , '' he said . `` We 're not offering them many goodies to do what we want and not making them feel like they 're going to suffer much either if they do n't do what we want . ''

It 's also a staunch foe of the United States , which its leaders have cast as the `` Great Satan . '' That lack of love is mutual , with Washington leading a years-long standoff with Tehran over its nuclear program . -LRB- There are ongoing talks aimed at resolving that impasse , but critically no deal yet . -RRB-

It 's not in Iran 's interest to have Iraq devolve into a sectarian war , says retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Francona , a CNN military analyst .

`` The Iranians are smart enough to know that 's a possibility , so they would be telling the Shia-led militias not to make this a Sunni v. Shia fight , '' Francona said .

`` Anything anyone does to counter ISIS is in the main a good outcome , '' Gen. Martin Dempsey said .

Defense Secretary Ashton Carter suggested that the matter was more nuanced . The U.S. is worried about Iran 's role , he said .

`` It is something that is concerning to us , '' he said of Iran 's role , `` in particular because the sectarian danger in Iraq is the principal thing that can unravel the campaign against ISIS . ''
