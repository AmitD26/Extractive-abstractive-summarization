-LRB- CNN -RRB- Diplomacy can be dangerous . U.S. diplomats have come under attack in various places in the last few decades .

According to a telegram from the embassy in Guatemala City , a young man dressed in fatigues and carrying a sub-machine gun on August 28 , 1968 , ordered Mein 's vehicle to stop and for the ambassador to get out . He did , then ran -- prompting a cry of `` Shoot him , kill him . ''

Mein was shot and fell to the ground about 12 yards behind his limousine .

The gunmen took Noel and another American , as well as diplomats from Saudi Arabia , Belgium and Jordan , according to a U.S. intelligence memo . The captors ' demand : Free various people , mostly Palestinian guerillas , then imprisoned in Jordan , Israel and the United States .

This spurred negotiations that did n't go anywhere , ending instead with the killing of Noel , fellow U.S. diplomat George Curtis Moore and Belgium 's Charge d'Affaires . U.S. authorities say the assailants belonged to the Palestinian terrorist movement known as `` Black September , '' claiming that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat signed off on the attack .

Their bullet-riddled bodies were found a short time later in mainly Muslim west Beirut , which was then controlled by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat 's guerrillas .

Two former Muslim guerillas were convicted in the kidnapping and killings , only to be freed in 1996 .

About eight months after President Jimmy Carter appointed him as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan , Adolph Dubs was taken from his car while heading home from the embassy .

His captors took the Foreign Service veteran to the Hotel Kabul , where Dubs died in a shootout between captors and Afghan police -- a violent death that , whomever fired the fatal bullets , the U.S. State Department considers an assassination .

A former eight-story hotel facing the sea transformed into America 's embassy in Beirut turned into a war zone in April 1983 , when a truck loaded with explosives was rammed into its entrance .

The result was horrific . Offices were pancaked on top of each other , the elevator shaft and stairwell destroyed , the cafeteria full of bodies and rubble , recalled the then U.S. ambassador Robert Dillon , who himself was dug out of the rubble .

While 44 people inside the embassy survived the blast , 17 Americans , 25 Foreign Service nationals , 10 contract workers and 10 visa applicants and passerby did not .

In 2008 , Dillon said the attack was believed to have been carried out by a family `` under the direction of members of Iran 's Revolutionary Guards . ''

On August 7 , 1998 -- around the exact same time a bomb went off at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , killing 11 -- a huge explosion tore through the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi , Kenya .

Those are both jarring numbers , but they 're still a fraction of the more than 200 people total killed in the attack , in addition to more than 4,000 wounded .

That 's where Ambassador Christopher Stevens was when mortar and rocket fire struck a U.S. diplomatic annex there . Stevens did n't survive , nor did State Department computer expert Sean Smith or Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty , two former U.S. Navy SEALs then acting as security contractors .

Anne Smedinghoff , a 25-year-old public diplomacy officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul , was delivering books to a school in southern Afghanistan when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy .

She died in that April 2013 attack , as did four others .

`` We thought she was relatively safe in the embassy compound , '' her father Tom Smedinghoff told CNN . `` But as it turned out , Anne really wanted to do a lot more . ''
