New Delhi , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- Do not generalize India as a country of rapists .

That was the firm message from the German ambassador in New Delhi after a professor back home was accused of turning down a male Indian student 's application for an internship due to the South Asian nation 's `` rape problem . ''

Professor Annette Beck-Sickinger never did such a thing , according to her and the University of Leipzig . The university points out four of her 30 students and two of her laboratory interns come from India ; while it was n't clear how many of them were men , the university said 29 of its 44 Indian students total are male .

The firestorm began with a recent post on the social-networking site Quora . It featured what appeared to be screenshots of email excerpts involving someone in the University of Leipzig 's biochemistry department . They fell under this provocative headline : `` What should an Indian male student do if he is denied an internship opportunity on the basis of India being projected as an unsafe country for women ? ''

The post did n't identify Beck-Sickinger , blacking out the name of the emails ' author . But it did lead with this statement that was later linked to her : `` Unfortunately I do n't accept any Indian male students for internships . We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I can not support . I have many female students in the group , so I think this attitude is something I can not support . ''

Speaking about how Indian men might be stereotyped due to reports about alarming instances of rape in their native country , she said , `` I fully agree that this is a generalization and may not apply to individuals . However it is also unbelievable that the Indian society is not able to solve this problem for many years now . ''

`` Of course we can not change or influence the Indian society , '' she added , `` but only take our consequences here in Europe . ''

One user , identified as Sas Vijay , said , `` Do n't leave this issue . It is a serious fault to generalize people on such grounds . File a complaint . ''

One person echoing that view publicly is Michael Steiner , Germany 's ambassador to India .

`` Your oversimplifying and discriminating generalization is an offense to these women and men ardently committed to furthering women empowerment in India ; and it is an offense to millions of law-abiding , tolerant , open-minded and hard-working Indians , '' Steiner wrote Monday in a letter posted on the embassy website .

`` Let 's be clear : India is not a country of rapists . ''

CNN 's Harmeet Shah Sing and journalist Kunal Sehgal reported from India , and CNN 's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta . CNN 's Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report .
