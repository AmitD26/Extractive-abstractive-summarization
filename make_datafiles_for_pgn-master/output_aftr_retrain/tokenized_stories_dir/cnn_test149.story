-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Warner Bros. scored a huge victory in the long-running and byzantine legal battle over the copyright to Superman yesterday , thanks to a ruling by 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that cements the studio 's control over the lucrative superhero character .

This decision follows a ruling last October that denied any part of the copyright to the heirs of Superman 's other co-creator , Joe Shuster . Shuster and Siegel famously sold their creation to DC Comics for a mere $ 130 in 1938 , long before the character went on to become a multi-billion dollar franchise for the studio , thanks to the success of numerous Hollywood blockbusters , television shows and other merchandise .

Jeff Trexler , an attorney and law professor who previously served as a clerk in the 9th Circuit , told Wired that while `` it 's entirely possible that the court would have reached the same outcome without the Facebook ruling ... Facebook made it practically inevitable . ''

Wired reached out for comment to Warner Bros , who responded :

`` This is a great day for Superman , for his fans , for DC Entertainment and for Warner Bros. . Today 's ruling vindicates DC Comics ' long-held position that it entered into a binding agreement with the Jerry Siegel family in 2001 . The Court 's decision paves the way for the Siegels finally to receive the compensation they negotiated for and which DC has been prepared to pay for over a decade . We are extremely pleased that Superman 's adventures can continue to be enjoyed across all media platforms worldwide for generations to come . ''

The decision comes at a fortunate time for the studio , whose new Superman reboot `` Man of Steel '' heads to theaters in June . Before the latest ruling , Warner Bros. would have been unable to create new `` derivative works '' based on Superman 's first appearance in Action Comics # 1 â € '' presumably including Superman films â € '' without accounting for the profits to the Siegels as co-owners , complicating plans for a potential Man of Steel sequel and the Justice League movie slated for 2015 .

Now , Warner Bros. will likely be able to proceed without further hindrance , ending a nearly 65-year legal battle whose uglier moments included a letter from Siegel 's dying widow -LRB- the original model for Lois Lane -RRB- accusing the Warner Bros. lawyers of harassment and a still-ongoing lawsuit by Warner Bros. accusing the Siegel 's lawyer Marc Toberoff of misconduct .
