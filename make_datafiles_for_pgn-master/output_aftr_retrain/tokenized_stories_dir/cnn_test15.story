The protests in Oakland have `` disrupted workers trying to get to work and impaired the port 's ability to operate , '' port spokesman Issac Kos-Read told CNN . Craig Merrilees , a spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union , said the port has told its members not to report for work for the overnight shift because of the mass of protesters at the port .

`` What has this accomplished ? '' he asked . `` This is disrupting the 99 % ''

Oakland has been a flashpoint of the Occupy movement since October , when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown . One demonstrator , a Marine veteran of the war in Iraq , suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile , according to a veteran 's group ; police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers .

The ILWU -- which represents 15,000 dockworkers -- has distanced itself from the protest movement . The union `` shares the Occupy movement 's concerns about the future of the middle class and corporate abuses , '' ILWU President Robert McEllrath wrote to locals last week -- but he urged the movement to stay out of its dispute with the port of Longview , Washington , and warned against `` outside groups attempting to co-opt our struggle in order to advance a broader agenda . ''

In Houston , police arrested 20 protesters after dozens of police on foot and on horseback confronted a somewhat larger group of Occupy protesters who blocked an interstate on-ramp , authorities said .

Police handcuffed some protesters and led them to a police vehicle . Six face felony charges of using criminal instruments to block a public roadway , said Houston Police Department spokesman Victor Senties .

In Long Beach , California , protests caused isolated traffic delays but did not hinder port operations , according to Police Chief Jim McDonnell .

A spokesman for the port in Portland said the protests had partially shut down the port there . In addition to the West Coast port blockades , demonstrators in Salt Lake City and Denver said they were planning to disrupt operations of Walmart distribution facilities . About 40 to 50 people protested at the Denver facility , CNN affiliate KCNC reported .

The demonstrations were part of a nationwide day of protest called in the aftermath of efforts by cities across the country -- including New York , Boston and Oakland -- to clear demonstrators from encampments they had set up in public parks and other locations .

The port protesters are focusing on terminals owned by SSA Marine , saying it is owed by the Goldman Sachs investment firm , which they argue exemplifies corporate greed and is anti-union .

SSA Senior Vice President Bob Watters disputed the protesters ' claims , saying Goldman Sachs owns less than 3 % of an investment fund that has a minority stake in the company . He also said the company is the largest employer of International Longshore and Warehouse Union members on the West Coast .

In a letter to members sent last month , International Longshore and Warehouse Union president Robert McEllrath said the organization shares Occupy protesters concerns about what they consider corporate abuses , but he said the union was not sanctioning any shutdown .

`` I 'm just barely getting on my feet again after two years , and now I got ta go a day without pay while somebody else has something to say that I 'm not really sure is relevant to the cause , '' trucker Chuck Baca told CNN affiliate KGO .

Port officials say shutting down their facilities will only cost workers and their communities wages and tax revenue .

Port of San Diego board chairman Scott Peters issued an open letter to the community on Sunday asking that protesters not disrupt work .

`` The Port of San Diego is made up of working people with families who serve the public each day by helping to bring in goods that are important to the people of the San Diego region , '' Peters wrote .

`` They are the 99 % , the gardeners , the maintenance workers , the dock workers , the Harbor Police officers , the office workers , the environmental workers -- all working to improve the quality of life in San Diego Bay and on its surrounding lands , '' he said . `` It is these people who would be hurt by a blockade of our Port . ''
