In Wednesday 's attacks :

-- Two men opened fire on an 18-year-old worker as he was vaccinating children on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar . The worker died of bullet wounds to the head , said Dr. Janbaz Afridi , the provincial director of the polio campaign .

All the attacks Wednesday took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , a province rife with Islamic extremists .

On Tuesday , five workers were killed : four in Karachi ; and a 14-year-old volunteer in Peshawar as she and her sister were leaving a house after administering vaccines .

Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA 's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden 's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader 's presence there .

Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011 .

In June , a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region , the Taliban said .

CNN was not able to reach the Taliban for comment regarding the latest attacks .
