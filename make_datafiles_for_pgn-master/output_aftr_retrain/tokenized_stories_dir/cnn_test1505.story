-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nasser al Ansari is the CEO of Qatari Diar , a state-owned real estate investment company . Famous for its purchase of London 's Chelsea Barracks , Qatari Diar was established in 2004 by the Qatar Investment Authority , to support Qatar 's growing economy and to co-ordinate the country 's real estate development priorities . It is now valued at $ 1 billion with 18 projects underway .

Al Ansari is a graduate from the University of Miami and was responsible for high profile projects such as New Doha International Airport and the promotion of private sector investment through public sector privatization .

He joins us on MME to talk about the vision for Qatar , how Qatari Diar fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Morocco , Sudan , Syria , Egypt and Europe .

Nasser al Ansari : I believe so . In the 1970s , local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth . But now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region . We now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth .

JD : I do n't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010 . This must give you great cushion to expand the Qatari Diar model .

JD : In fact very close in the neighborhood as well . It 's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region . Is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside Qatar ?

NA : I think with the knowledge and know-how that we have gained in this area of expertise , we would like to export it to other countries to help their economical reformations ; to try to create business opportunities for their local businessmen and to create job opportunities for the people in that particular country .

JD : It 's quite a radical departure say from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank giving loans or grants for development . This is turning the world upside down in your region , it is not ?

JD : You want a hard return .
