Former biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins killed himself in July , authorities say .

Bruce Ivins , who authorities say killed himself in July as the Justice Department prepared to charge him in the anthrax case , is alleged to have sent the e-mail to himself last September .

An FBI agent quotes the message in an affidavit accompanying applications for search warrants for Ivins ' e-mail accounts .

`` Yes ! Yes ! Yes !!!!!!! I finally know who mailed the anthrax letters in the fall of 2001 . I 've pieced it together ! Now we can finally get this over and done with , '' the e-mail reads .

In it , the former biodefense researcher says he plans on turning information over to his lawyer and that his lawyer would then give it to authorities . The e-mail does not say who Ivins believed was responsible .

The documents -- which the Justice Department says are the last Ivins-related search warrants that had yet to be released to the public -- also contain new details about allegations that Ivins wanted to kill his co-workers .

The FBI agent also alleges that Ivins said during the session that he had walked around the `` ghetto '' areas of Frederick , Maryland , near his home , late at night `` hoping that someone would try to hurt him so that he could stab them with a sharp pen . ''

That description is similar to something Ivins allegedly wrote on YouTube referencing a winner of the television game show `` The Mole . '' Authorities said Ivins ' YouTube message read : `` The least someone could do would be to take a sharp ballpoint pin or letter opener and put her eyes out , to complete the task of making her a true mole ! ''

General details of the therapy session have previously been reported . After the meeting , social worker Jean Duley contacted authorities and Ivins was taken into custody . He was released after being evaluated at two hospitals .

Notes allegedly written by Ivins at the time of his hospitalization were found in the trash at his home after his death . According to the FBI , he wrote about the stresses in his life and the possibility of facing prison time .

The anthrax probe continues , Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said .

The anthrax attacks occurred less than a month after the September 11 , 2001 , suicide attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania . Letters filled with bacterial spores were sent to Senate Democratic leaders and news organizations .

Scientists from inside and outside the FBI said they traced a strain of anthrax from the envelopes and victims to a batch of anthrax in Ivins ' lab at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute in Fort Detrick , Maryland .
