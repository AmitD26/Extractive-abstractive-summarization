At first glance , a second political act for Weiner might seem impossible . It was a little more than a year ago that the liberal Democrat crashed and burned on national television , tearfully resigning after right-wing bloggers exposed his bizarre habit of sending raunchy photos and messages to strangers .

On Wednesday night , when asked in an interview with People magazine whether he is considering a bid for mayor , Weiner said he is not planning a campaign -- but he did n't rule out a run for political office in the future .

It was June 2011 when comedians of late-night TV were feasting on Weiner 's misery . Conservatives crowed over the scalp they 'd claimed -- and were ecstatic when a Republican won the special election to replace Weiner . A few months later , with no longtime incumbent to protect the seat , Weiner 's district was eliminated altogether when population changes required New York state to reduce the size of its congressional delegation .

That appeared to be the final chapter in Weiner 's political career . He claims to have no plans beyond caring for his newborn son and insists that recent news stories are simply wrong .

Although known across the nation as a left-wing firebrand , Weiner has had a profile in New York as a pragmatic , centrist Democrat willing to break from the city 's liberal orthodoxy . In 2005 , when Weiner made a first run for mayor , he publicly castigated the eventual Democratic nominee for proposing the re-imposition of a local tax on every stock trade to raise money from Wall Street -LRB- a favorite but unworkable liberal plan -RRB- .

Weiner often railed against the rising cost of living for his financially squeezed constituents -LRB- 45 % of whom voted for John McCain in 2008 -RRB- and co-founded a bipartisan Middle Class Caucus in Congress .

As the third and final term of Mayor Michael Bloomberg winds down , the field of Democrats running to succeed him lacks a candidate with Weiner 's loud , laserlike focus on middle-class issues . That absence has political insiders wondering if there might be room at the table for Weiner .

Even more tantalizing is Weiner 's $ 4.5 million political war chest that would , if activated , qualify him for $ 1.5 million in public matching funds and land him near the city 's $ 6.7 million campaign spending cap . That makes him one of the best-funded mayoral candidates in New York , and more than just the punch line of a joke .

Fast-forward to modern times when Mayor Rudy Giuliani used a press conference to announce plans to separate from his second wife -- who apparently learned of his intentions from news reports -- and tried to have her kicked out of Gracie Mansion , the official mayoral residence , so that his new girlfriend could move in . Giuliani eventually straightened out his personal life : He got a divorce and girlfriend Judith Nathan became wife No. 3 . New Yorkers more or less shrugged .

Even ex-Gov . Eliot Spitzer , who resigned after admitting to hiring prostitutes , has returned to public life , hosting a nightly show on Current TV and recently offering weekly commentary alongside other ex-officials on the New York political TV show `` Inside City Hall . '' As host of the show , I have received exactly one complaint to date .

If it 's true that , as Weiner insists , he had no physical contact with the women to whom he sent raunchy messages , he will likely get as least as much latitude as Giuliani and Spitzer . And if Weiner has the support of his family -- and is prepared to make a full apology for the lying -- he can eventually expect to find his way back into some form of public service .

Your move , Mr. Weiner .
