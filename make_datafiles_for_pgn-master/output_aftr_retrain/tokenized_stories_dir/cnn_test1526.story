BEIRUT , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lebanon 's prime minister condemned the firing of rockets into northern Israel after an attack wounded two Israelis on Thursday . He said his government is trying to determine who was responsible .

U.N. soldiers on Thursday inspect the site in Lebanon thought to be the source of rockets fired into Israel .

Israel 's military warned Israeli civilians to stick close to shelters after police said at least four rockets hit near the city of Nahariya , about 6 miles -LRB- 10 kilometers -RRB- south of the Lebanese border . The Israeli military said it returned fire across the border with mortars .

Schools and kindergartens were closed in Nahariya and the nearby town of Shlomi , the Israel Defense Forces reported .

The Israeli campaign in Gaza is aimed at halting rocket fire from the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory . Israel fought a similar battle against the Lebanese Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah in 2006 , during which Hezbollah rained rockets on cities in Israeli 's north for a month before a cease-fire was reached .

But Hezbollah has kept a tight rein on its forces in southern Lebanon since the cease-fire , and a number of Palestinian factions operate in southern Lebanon as well .

He said UNIFIL 's commander , Maj. Gen. Claudio Graziano , is in `` constant and close contact '' with both sides `` and has urged maximum restraint in order to prevent any escalation of the situation . ''
