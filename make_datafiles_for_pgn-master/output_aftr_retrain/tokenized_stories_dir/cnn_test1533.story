But what began as a day out in the spring sunshine 20 years ago ended as the darkest hour in the history of British football .

Clough , one of the legends of the British game , had been denied an FA Cup Final with Forest a year earlier , when his side lost to Liverpool at the same stage of the competition and at the same venue .

The atmosphere in the ground for the 1989 semifinal exploded as the teams emerged onto the pitch . But none of us was prepared for what was to follow .

The match action lasted less than six minutes . I ca n't remember a single kick . What I do recall quite vividly are the scenes of distress , desperation and death at the Liverpool end that destroyed so many families and shocked the world .

Some fans were hoisted up into the stand above by fellow supporters , but the main escape route was over the high perimeter fence and later through a small gate that was forced open as police -- who initially thought they were dealing with a pitch invasion -- recognized the true scale of the problem .

Advertising boards were used as makeshift stretchers and some of those being carried away had their heads covered by coats . The Sheffield Wednesday gymnasium became a mortuary .

I will always remember the bid to revive one young fan in front of the main stand . Those efforts seemed to go on forever before finally hundreds of spectators let out a huge cheer as the lad at last showed some sign of life . I still wonder to this day whether or not he made it .

Meanwhile I had an open phoneline to a copytaker at The Press Association and described those shocking events unfolding in front of me , including news of the first fatalities .

For the second time in four years I had gone to cover a football match and ended up filing a disaster report .

Within hhours of returning from Belgium , I was among a small group of football writers summoned to No. 10 Downing Street for a meeting with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher .

The Hillsborough tragedy was played out in full view of 53,000 spectators and TV cameras .

People who came to watch a football match went home haunted by scenes of carnage and chaos that will stay with them for the rest of their lives .

Later , in an area beneath the empty south stand , FA chief executive Graham Kelly faced media at an impromptu press conference and expressed his shock , sadness and sorrow . Understandably , he did n't have all the answers as questions were fired his way .

What led to the disaster is well documented . Lord Justice Taylor , a High Court judge commissioned by the government to produce a report , concluded that police operational errors were largely to blame for allowing the gates to be opened to relieve congestion outside the ground . Many questioned why the kickoff to the game had not been delayed .

English football was quick to react with perimeter fences pulled , followed by the phased-in arrival of all-seater stadia .

The oldest victim at Hillsborough was 67 , the youngest 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley , a cousin of current Liverpool captain and England international Steven Gerrard .

Gerrard was six weeks away from his ninth birthday at the time of tragedy . There is nothing Liverpool would want more than to mark the 20th anniversary season with at least one gleaming trophy .
