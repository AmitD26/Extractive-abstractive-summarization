Larry Rosenbaum surveys the field where he hopes to build a high-end specialty cheese factory .

Like small towns all across America , this agricultural community is suffering , with unemployment approaching 10 percent .

One key selling point : His product would meet the strictest standards of the Jewish and Muslim faiths .

Rosenbaum says the demand for kosher and halal cheese is high but the selection is slim . So he 's been eyeing a plot of barren farmland between Aurelius and Auburn -- two Cayuga towns -- as the future home of a $ 40 million , 64,000-square-foot factory that would churn out feta and brie .

The goal is for his company , Saratoga Cheese Corp. , to produce 30 million pounds of cheese in the first year and distribute it domestically and internationally .

`` It 's the beginning of a trend of bringing back manufacturing industry to New York , '' said Rosenbaum . According to the Public Policy Institute of New York State , manufacturing in New York declined more than 30 percent between 1997 and 2007 . Watch Rosenbaum talk about his plans ''

If Saratoga Cheese can get off the ground , it could mean a boost for local farmers like Dale Hemminger , who has agreed to supply kosher milk to Saratoga Cheese Corp. .

Hemminger says it could be a crucial new market for his milk . And though he was at first skeptical of Rosenbaum 's plan , Hemminger says he admires Rosenbaum 's vision .

But that vision is still $ 10 million short of becoming reality . Rosenbaum has secured $ 30 million in government grants , loans and private funding , but needs $ 40 million before Saratoga Cheese Corp. can break ground . Given the recession , securing the final amount is proving no small feat .
