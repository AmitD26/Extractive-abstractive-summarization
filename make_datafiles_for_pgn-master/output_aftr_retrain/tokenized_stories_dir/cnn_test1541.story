The newly married husband and wife , in Thailand for their honeymoon , were struggling to find a way home to California after explosions at two Bangkok airports wounded four people and both airports were shut down .

The day before , thousands of anti-government protesters stormed the airports to protest the return of Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat from an economic summit in Peru .

`` The upper level outside is really crowded with protesters and for the most part they 're kind of quiet and polite , '' Gannon said from the airport . `` They 're roaming the airport , they 're cheering and clapping and walking around , but it 's clearly their domain . '' Watch protesters clash ''

It was not clear which of the two occupied airports she was speaking from , but tourists were stranded in both .

Ongoing protests caused authorities to cancel all incoming and outgoing flights at the main hub , Suvarnabhumi International Airport , which handles 60,000 incoming passengers daily , an assistant to airport director Serirat Prasutanond told CNN .

`` As more and more tourists leave -LSB- the airport -RSB- , the fact that we do n't have any information and there 's no one to give us information , now we feel stranded here and we do n't know where to go , '' Gannon said . `` It seems a little bit more hostile than it was earlier . ''

Gannon said she 's heard nothing from airport personnel and her quest for answers is hurt even more by the fact that many people in the airport speak no English .

`` I do n't know what happened to my flight , '' one woman waiting in an airport told CNN . `` They wo n't talk to us and I 'm angry and sad because I have two small children and they 're sick so we want to go home . ''

The airlines have also been mum on the situation , Gannon said , making it difficult for them to decide whether to wait it out at the airport or try to find a hotel .

One traveler said the wait was frustrating .

`` They 've started coming through and telling us that we possibly might be out of here in the morning , '' he told CNN . `` But either way , there 's no problem . We just sit here and relax and enjoy the ride . ''

Gannon said she and her new spouse just hope to get home sometime in the near future .
