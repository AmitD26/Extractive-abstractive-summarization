The virus has the classification H1N1 because it includes two key viral proteins , hemagglutinin -LRB- H -RRB- and neuraminidase -LRB- N -RRB- . Zielinski took the genetic sequence of a variant of hemagglutinin and created a computer algorithm to turn it into music .

Using computer programs he created himself , as well as a commercial product , Zielinski composed his song by assigning instruments and musical notes to various properties of the protein .

Zielinski took the various categories of amino acids , the building blocks of the protein , and assigned each a different instrument -- piano , organ , low synthesizer , percussion . The melody was created by assigning notes to specific amino acids . Each beat of the song also corresponds to one of numerous amino acids .

He first learned of the sequence through an immunologist friend at the Mayo Clinic , he said . Zielinski saw it as a form of highly organized information that a human did not design .

`` The only way I could look at that and make sense of it , since I 'm not a biochemist , was , well , I could try translating it into another very organized form of information that people do , and then see if I could hear anything . And the answer , of course , turned out to be no . ''

But even if the mystery of the virus did not reveal itself in musical form , the result is a curiously melodic , innovative , somewhat soothing work .

Less methodical swine flu songs are also emerging on YouTube . User `` CelicaAaron '' parodies the Jonas Brothers ' song `` Lovebug , '' crooning , `` I ca n't get your snout out of my mouth / I 'm sick to my stomach all the time . ''

A short spoken-word effort by user `` Micfri '' warns , `` You know who has swine flu ? Pigs ! ''
