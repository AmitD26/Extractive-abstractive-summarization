HAVANA , Cuba -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a major shake-up the likes of which Cubans have not seen for decades , President Raul Castro on Monday reorganized his Cabinet , replacing longtime aides to his brother Fidel , who resigned from office a year ago , citing poor health .

Among the changes :

Felipe Perez Roque , the 43-year-old foreign minister , was replaced by his deputy , Bruno Rodriguez Aprilla .

Carlos Lage Davila , an economist , lost his job as Cabinet secretary , but no mention was made of removing him from his other post as vice president of the Council of State .

`` It looks like Raul putting some of his own people in , '' said Wayne Smith , director of the Cuba program at the Center for International Policy in Washington , who led the U.S. Interests Section in Havana during the Carter administration .

Smith noted that Cuba 's government underwent `` quite a few shake-ups after the revolution first came in '' in 1959 , but said Monday 's move `` is the biggest shake-up that I 've seen in a very long time ... for the last 30 or 40 years . ''

She noted that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez met with both Castro brothers during a visit late in February to Havana , on what Granma described as a `` work visit , '' and speculated that Raul Castro may have asked him then to buy in on the changes .

`` They really need Chavez to be on board , because without the subsidized oil from Venezuela , they 're dead , '' Huddleston said .

Communist leader Fidel Castro experimented with that during the 1990s , but pulled back .

`` It represents a significant step by Raul Castro to gain autonomy and , essentially , distance himself from Fidel 's old gang , '' said Larry Birns , director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs .

`` In other words , he feels confident enough that he has an independent base of power . ''

Otto Reich , who served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs during the George W. Bush administration , said he was withholding judgment .

`` It 's a little early to tell what this really means , '' he said . `` Some people are saying the Fidelistas are being replaced by the Raulistas . But the other side is : Are we talking about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic ? ''
