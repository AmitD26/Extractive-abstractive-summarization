-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- Magazines are full of beauty and health secrets with tips on how to improve your inner health and polish and paint your external persona . All of this designed to keep you feeling young .

With its low price , boxy-yet-stylish shape and must-have technology , the Scion xB is very youthful .

We think that the beauty magazines are missing out on the best way to feel young : drive the right vehicle !

We 've picked vehicles that are unique , different and even a little quirky . You are what you drive , and when you drive a spunky , youthful vehicle , that 's exactly what you are !

So , here are our choices for the top 10 vehicles to keep you feeling young :
