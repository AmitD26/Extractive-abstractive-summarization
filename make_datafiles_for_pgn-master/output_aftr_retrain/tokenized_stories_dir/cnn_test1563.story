KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Welcome to democracy , Afghan-style .

An Afghan woman in a burqa veil holds up a photograph of President Hamid Karzai .

More than 3,000 donkeys , 3,000 cars and three helicopters will traverse harsh terrain to carry voting materials to remote polling stations . And 30 observer groups , domestic and international , will be on hand to help guard against fraud .

At the heart of every vote will be the two biggest impediments to progress for one of the poorest nations in the world : stifling corruption and an increasingly bloody Taliban resurgence .

The number of Afghan civilians killed increased 24 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year , according to the United Nations . NATO and U.S. forces have suffered record losses this summer , with 75 troops killed in the month of July alone .

Amid the violence , the candidates continued their last-minute campaigning , with the hope that the elections can showcase Afghanistan 's fledgling democracy .

`` We hope that this election will go ahead in accordance with the constitution of this country and the rightful freedoms of our people , in the best manner possible , so that the Afghan nation can determine its future , '' said historian Omar Khan Massoudi , director of the National Museum in Kabul . Watch young Afghans talk about their hopes ''

The top U.S. envoy to the region , Richard Holbrooke , expressed optimism that Thursday 's vote would be Afghanistan 's moment to shine . It 's tough to organize elections during a war , he said , but the reality is that violence during elections is common place in many parts of the world .

`` Afghanistan has never had a contested election , '' Holbrooke said . `` So this is a remarkable experiment in democracy and something that Afghanistan needs to give legitimacy to the new government . ''

That legitimacy has become a key issue in the campaign . Frontrunner President Hamid Karzai 's chief challengers -- former finance minister Ashraf Ghani and former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah -- have both lashed out at the incumbent for failing to rein in corruption . In its annual global corruption perception index in 2008 , Transparency International ranked Afghanistan 176 out of 180 countries and said graft was `` a major factor impeding the country 's stability and future growth . ''

Babrak Babarkhale , a former journalist and Mujahadeen fighter in the war to end Soviet occupation in the 1980s , said he planned to vote for Abdullah because he was fed up with corruption .

`` There is no doubt there is a hardcore element in it , '' he told CNN . `` But there are thousands of people under the same brand , Taliban , -LSB- who -RSB- have joined the insurgency because of other reasons . ''

The insurgents are filling a vacuum left by Afghanistan 's Western-backed government , which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede now suffers from nepotism , corruption and predatory practices .

Abdullah said last week that Karzai 's government had failed to capitalize on the opportunities presented by international aid and troops . The government , Abdullah said , had failed to `` stabilize Afghanistan to the extent that eight years down the road , we would have been able to say less troops rather than more . ''

Most polls , however , show Karzai with a commanding lead .

But can a nation as troubled as Afghanistan carry out fair and free elections ? Some observers of Afghanistan and human rights activists have voiced their doubts .

A new Gallup Poll found that fewer than one in four voting-age Afghans are confident the election will be fair and transparent .

Voting in Afghanistan , Eide said , is not yet the kind of democratic expression understood in the West .

Eide said 3,000 donkeys were `` mobilized '' to carry ballots to remote mountainous regions .

Of the 4.6 million new registered voters , 39 percent are women . So thousands of women had to be employed to search burqa-clad female voters .

Human Rights Watch , however , said Tuesday that the recruitment drive for women began too late , and as a result , not enough women will be available for security checks .

Human Rights Watch also said Tuesday that election-related violence was a serious impediment . Between April 25 and August 1 , the rights group documented at least 13 political killings and at least 10 abductions of electoral commission officials , candidates and campaign workers . It said provincial council candidates had withdrawn after receiving death threats .

The overall security situation is `` considerably worse than during the last elections , '' Human Rights Watch concluded .

But despite the violence , despite the threats from the Taliban to disrupt the voting , enthusiasm filled the air Monday as the presidential candidates wrapped up their campaigns .

A campaign rally resembled more a rock concert than a political event in Afghanistan , as Kabul stadium transformed into a sea of blue , Abdullah 's campaign color . Supporters hoisted banners and sported T-shirts emblazoned with Abdullah 's face .

`` I believe there is a dire need for a change of course in Afghanistan , irrespective of who becomes the president , '' said Rauf Roashan of the Institute for Afghan Studies , a scholarly center founded by Afghans living abroad .

No one can say with any certainty whether abounding energy will translate into high turnout . Not in a war-ravaged nation .
