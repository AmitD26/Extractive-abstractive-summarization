SOUTH CHINA SEA -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aboard the Svend Maersk , the sound of the ship 's five-story high engine permeates like a heartbeat through the four-football field length of ship .

Chief Officer Christian Vium talks to CNN 's Eunice Yoon as night falls on the bridge of the Svend .

But a more telling sight is when the massive vessel nears Singapore and passes by dozens of idle ships .

A 10 percent drop is expected this year in the shipping business , which one analyst called `` a $ 20 billion black hole . '' It 's an industry that is a prime indicator of the global economy -- 90 percent of world trade is carried on ships such as the Svend Maersk to ports and onto shops around the world .

The crew comes from Denmark , Germany , Romania and the Philippines . `` We 've been joking that the ship was the United Nations at sea , '' said Captain Nikolaisen . `` There are many nationalities , sometimes eight , maybe more . They are professionals -- most of them -- and they know that we can not afford to be unfriendly to one another . ''

Some of the crew are over 60 ; among the youngest is 24-year-old recruit Joey Lamasan . Lamasan still has trouble sleeping since he left his village in the Philippines . But here , he can earn triple what he would make back home .

`` The salary in the Philippines is too small compared to the salary on board the ship , '' said Lamasan , who is on a six-month contract -- typical for many young seafarers .

But what they fear the most `` would be fire or explosion , '' said Captain Nikolaisen . `` We can not run away . ''

Life on the boat -- like the scenery -- can be repetitive . There is no mobile phone service , no booze , and limited Internet access . Many of the seamen work in two four-hour shifts ... to stay alert . Meals and coffee breaks are routine . Free time is usually spent alone in the cabins , playing computer games together , or occasionally calling home on a satellite phone .
