Authorities sort through the wreckage thought to be Debbie Hooper 's car . She went missing September 20 .

The 44-year-old grandmother from Whitesburg , Georgia , was always on time for her play dates with her baby granddaughter . She was always on time picking up her 15-year-old son from school .

Nearly a week after the torrential downpours that left the metro Atlanta area drenched , authorities are still searching for Hooper 's body , which was last believed to have been in the Dog River in Douglas County , west of Atlanta . Late Monday afternoon , authorities discovered a female body in the Dog River Reservoir , said Brad Robinson , chief deputy of the Carroll County Sheriff 's Office . They are waiting for lab work to identify the body , which is expected to be released Tuesday afternoon .

Six flood-related deaths already have been reported in Douglas County .

Last Friday , when the water ebbed , a search crew of nearly 25 law enforcement officers from Carroll and Douglas counties uncovered Hooper 's vehicle , a Jeep Liberty , stuck in the water in the Dog River . The team also recovered Hooper 's purse .

`` It was like putting an ant in front of the fire hose , '' said Sheriff Phil Miller of the Douglas County Sheriff 's Office . `` The little Jeep Liberty looked like it had been put in a crusher and beat into pieces . ''

The following Saturday morning , more than two dozen authorities and four cadaver dogs continued to search the Dog River area . Miller said the water flow had been constant , which means the body could have drifted into the Chattahoochee River .

Hooper remains the last missing flood victim in the Atlanta area , but in Tennessee , a man who disappeared after swimming in an overflowing ditch on a dare is still missing .

This month 's storm has been one of the worst in Southeastern U.S. history . The death toll in Georgia and Alabama has risen to 10 .

`` We talked every day , '' Bartke said . `` We spoke to each other even if we were busy , even if it was for two seconds just to say ` Mom , I love you . I 'm busy right now , but I will call you back . ' ''
