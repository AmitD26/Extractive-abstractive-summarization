Beirut , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The leaders of Lebanon and Syria vowed to improve cooperation between their two countries Sunday , tying up a meeting aimed at thawing frozen relations .

`` We want to open new horizons between the two states , '' Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri said at a news conference at the end of the two-day meeting , which happened in Damascus , Syria .

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was not at the news conference . Official Syrian news agency SANA reported that both al-Assad and Hariri `` saw the visit as a starting point to restore cooperation between the governments of Syria and Lebanon . ''

`` Both sides agreed that the institutions and ministries in both countries directly coordinate and communicate to remove all obstacles to the cooperation on all levels , '' SANA reported .

Hariri has previously blamed Syria for the 2005 assassination of his father , Rafik Hariri , a former Lebanese leader who was a prominent figure opposing Syria 's continuing presence inside Lebanon .

A popular uprising after the elder Hariri 's killing in 2005 helped lead to the withdrawal of Syrian forces after almost 30 years of military and political domination of Lebanon .

The United States , which also accused Syria of involvement in Rafik Hariri 's assassination , withdrew its ambassador four years ago . President Obama decided to make an effort toward reconciliation and announced earlier this year that he was returning a U.S. diplomat to Damascus .
