-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state , an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday .

In an hours-long process , 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office . A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement .

The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras .

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya 's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month .

The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis , in addition to the unity government .

Zelaya , who says he does not recognize the election , also has said he would not accept the post even if Congress voted him back in . Accepting the job , he said , would legitimize the coup .

Despite the diplomatic pressure from abroad , lawmakers were voting the will of the people , Congressman Juan Angel Rivera Tabora said .

`` History will judge us , and I 'm certain it will judge us positively , '' he said . `` Congress did n't make this problem . The problem came to us . ''

Those voting against Zelaya echoed those sentiments . After the coup , the same body voted to install Micheletti as interim president . Wednesday vote only happened because the agreement between the two sides called for it , many lawmakers repeated .

The coup came on the day the term-limits vote was to have been held .

Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup .

But the United Nations , the Organization of American States , the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately . He was n't .

Zelaya , who was flown out of the country while still in his pajamas on the day of the coup , has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras ' capital since secretly returning to the country September 21 .
