-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Torrential rains and flooding since June have affected 600,000 people in 16 West African nations , the United Nations reported Tuesday .

People walk in the flooded streets of Ouagadougou , Burkina Faso , last week .

The worst hit have been Burkina Faso , Senegal , Ghana and Niger , said Yvon Edoumou , a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , or OCHA , in the Senegalese capital , Dakar . So far , 159 people have died , he said . Sierra Leone has also been hard hit , according to the U.N. .

The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday it has begun distributing food to tens of thousands of homeless flood victims .

WFP has set a goal of feeding 177,500 people , mainly in Ouagadougou , the capital of Burkina Faso , where 150,000 people have been affected and key infrastructure -- including a central hospital , schools , bridges and roads -- has been damaged .

The flooding in Burkina Faso is the worst in 90 years , WFP said .

`` It is always the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most from floods like these as their few remaining assets are swept away , leaving them hungry and destitute , '' WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said .

Roads and buildings have been ruined from Mauritania to Niger , the U.N. reported . In Agadez , Niger , a town about 458 miles -LRB- 738 km -RRB- north of the capital , Niamey , close to 988 acres -LRB- 400 hectares -RRB- of vegetable crops and hundreds of livestock were washed away .

The rainy season in West Africa begins in June and continues through late September . In 2007 , 300 people died and 800,000 were affected by the storms .

Despite the misery , Edoumou said the rains are a mixed blessing for countries dependent on agriculture . The harvest this year will be more bountiful , he said .
