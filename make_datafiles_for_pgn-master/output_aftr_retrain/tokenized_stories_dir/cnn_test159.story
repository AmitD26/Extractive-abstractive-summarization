The GPDA has threatened to boycott Sunday 's German Grand Prix should a repeat of last weekend 's Silverstone race occur , with tire supplier Pirelli responding by modifying its tires with a Kevlar strip to prevent punctures .

Germany 's Vettel , a world champion in each of the last three years , says it is up to each driver to decide whether they feel comfortable in the cockpit .

`` The good thing from it was that right after the Silverstone race many people sat together and were looking for a constructive solution , and we arrived here in Germany with a different set of rear tires .

`` It was a positive surprise to see that given that small window of time , Pirelli was able to bring a different component , and now we have to see if it works .

`` So I think it is very positive that they took the criticism seriously and just decided to make some changes . ''

Sunday 's race represents a home grand prix for Vettel , who celebrated his 26th birthday earlier this week .

`` We are very confident that we could win here , but we shall not underestimate our competitors .

`` We are not putting ourselves under too much pressure though , as there is no way of forcing a win here or indeed anywhere else . ''

Elsewhere in motorsport , it was announced that Argentina will host a round of the MotoGP world championships for the first time since 1999 .

The South American country will host elite motorcycling racing at the newly-built Termas de Rio Honda circuit on a three-year deal starting from next season .

`` It is a great honor to receive this championship in Argentina in addition to other sporting events that take place in our country such as the Dakar Rally , '' Argentine National Tourism Minister Enrique Meyer told MotoGP 's official website .

`` We hope that the Argentine public can enjoy the top class of motorcycle racing , which has n't come to our country since 1999 , and we will do our best to make sure MotoGP stays in our country for a long time . ''
