-LRB- OPRAH.com -RRB- -- He can saw himself in half , sing a selection of Broadway showtunes and swing on a flying trapeze .

When Neil Patrick Harris , one of the stars of the hit CBS sitcom `` How I Met Your Mother , '' is n't dabbling in the extraordinary , well , he 's probably hosting an awards show .

In the late '80s , Neil -- known as NPH to his fans -- landed the starring role on `` Doogie Howser , M.D. '' After years of child stardom and teen heartthrob status , Neil left the small screen for the stage . He became a respected Broadway actor , starring in shows like `` Rent , '' `` Cabaret '' and `` Proof , '' before returning to television .

Now , millions know Neil as Barney Stinson , the womanizing , slap-happy sidekick on `` How I Met Your Mother , '' which begins its fifth season September 21 .

Like Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson before him , this man-of-many-talents is also making his mark as an awards show host . On Sunday , September 20 , Neil will host the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards . He shares his thoughts on fate , finding balance and making out with his co-star .

Kari Forsee : How are you preparing for Emmy night ?

Neil Patrick Harris : I 'm just trying to make sure all the comedy host elements are in place . We 'll have a good opening bit and a couple surprise things throughout . We want to balance respecting the show and the doling out of the awards with the sort of random things that will keep the audience 's attention in other ways . So that 's kind of been my job . You want to make it unique and , yet , classic . That 's a tricky dynamic . Oprah.com : Planning an Emmys party ? Get 4 entertaining solutions

NPH : Well , it 's sort of a litany of e-mails and phone calls all day with the producers . We had a great opening short film we are going to shoot , and it would be the first thing you shot . That was going to be with Alec Baldwin , and he withdrew at the last minute . So that got scrapped , and we 're off to plan D , E or F. It 's sort of like now you go : `` That 's fantastic , great . We 've got that person , '' or `` Oh , that person did n't work . Now what do we do ? '' A lot of `` now what do we do ? '' questions .

KF : So the day after the Emmys , a new season of `` How I Met Your Mother '' premieres . Last season 's finale left us wondering if your character , Barney Stinson , will finally settle down and start dating Robin Scherbatsky .

KF : `` How I Met Your Mother '' puts a lot of stake in fate . Are you a believer in fate ?

NPH : I do n't know what to make of fate . I certainly do n't think you can predetermine things . It feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen , it rarely does . But if you allow for good things to happen , they seem to . I think a lot of that is more perception , you know ? A lot of people would take getting rear-ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another , and I think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it was n't worse . That allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that . I think if you try to angle your life in those ways , then fate , destiny , karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth . Oprah.com : How to get lucky in love and life

KF : I 'm curious , how did your father meet your mother ?

NPH : They were college , fraternity and sorority sweethearts . This was in Albuquerque . She was in Alpha Chi Omega . And he was in , something Pi ? They did the whole , you know , he gave her his pin . She was pinned , and they were a couple . Then , they were married , and they 've only been with each other . I 'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents . ... We did n't have a lot of money growing up , but we were never made to feel poor . They had amazing senses of humor , senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids . So I lucked out .

NPH : They were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous . They 're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame . Their main concern was just my well-being and my brother 's well-being during all of our crazy times , whether they be intimate or very public . They 're remarkable people .
