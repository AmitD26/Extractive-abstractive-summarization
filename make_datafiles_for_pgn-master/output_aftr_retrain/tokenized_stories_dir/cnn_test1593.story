-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 9-year-old girl was laid to rest Wednesday as a 15-year-old girl , described as an acquaintance , was in court on charges she carried out the younger girl 's murder

It did n't lead them to a stranger , a child predator or a convicted sex offender -- avenues police had originally considered because of Olten 's age

Instead , it led them to a 15-year-old girl who , according to Peggy Florence , a family spokeswoman , had played with Olten .

On Wednesday , Olten 's family looked towards closure as two drastically different scenes unfolded in Missouri .

Olten 's family and friends watched as two white horses pulled her casket in a glass hearse . Hours earlier , a judge had ordered the 15-year-old suspect to be held while he decides whether she should be tried in adult court . Authorities have not released the suspect 's name .

The Olten family spent the day of Elizabeth 's funeral remembering a very special little girl and mourning their loss , choosing to celebrate her life , instead of attending the court hearing of the teen accused of killing her . After the funeral ceremony , they released pink balloons , in honor of Elizabeth Olten 's favorite color .

`` She wanted to be a mother , she wanted to love others and take care of others , '' family spokeswoman Florence told HLN 's Nancy Grace . `` She was just a lovely child -- she never met an animal she did n't love and dress up and play with . ''

`` She was a beautiful little girly girl , '' Florence said . `` She had everyone 's heart . ''
