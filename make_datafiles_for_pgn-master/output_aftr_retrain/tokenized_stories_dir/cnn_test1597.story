`` High winds are over , but the rain and flood threat remain in Mid-Atlantic and Northeast , '' CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said . `` There are major travel delays -- and more expected on Monday . ''

Flooding in West Virginia caused one death there , authorities said .

Con Edison reported more than 100,000 customers without power in New York City and Westchester County on Sunday , while the Long Island Power Authority said that 150,000 of its customers were without electricity .

`` The ground is so wet from all the snow we 've had this winter , it 's helping the trees to topple over , as well as our utility poles , '' said Long Island Power Authority president and CEO Kevin Law . `` The conditions are still too terrible to get crews out there . ''

Law said that some customers will likely go without power until early in the week .

The outages were mostly due to power lines downed by Saturday 's winds , which toppled trees and utility polls . Wind speeds reached 75 miles per hour at New York 's JFK International Airport -- as strong as a Category 1 hurricane -- and 72 miles per hour in Atlantic City , New Jersey .

New York-area airports reported delays of at least two hours on Sunday , while Boston 's Logan International Airport averaged 40 minute delays .
