`` Rodrigo Rosenberg , for some reason , decided to put an end to his life , '' Castresana said at a televised news conference .

Rosenberg was shot from behind in a brazen daylight attack while riding his bicycle in Guatemala City , the nation 's capital . He was shot three times in the head , once in the neck and once in the back , Castresana said .

The two brothers , who own a pharmaceutical company , had been cousins of Rosenberg through a previous marriage and did not know that he was the target of the assassination , Castresana said .

Rosenberg fed information to the hit squad leader that led to his own death , giving descriptions of what the target looked like and where he would be .

`` It was the two brothers and no one else , '' Castresana said . `` Not a politician . Not a -LSB- government -RSB- minister . Not a police chief . No one . Just these two brothers . ''

About 300 investigators from 11 nations reached their conclusion after an exhaustive examination of 100,000 telephone calls , 9,500 documents , surveillance videotapes , and 135 interviews with 11 suspects and others , Castresana said .

Colom had maintained since the May 10 slaying that he was innocent despite Rosenberg 's explosive videotape , which was made public the day after his death .

Guatemalan authorities have arrested 11 men on suspicion that they carried out the killing , but the Valdez Paiz brothers remain at large .

He also said that he did not know where the brothers were but that they would surrender after Tuesday 's conference .

Calderon did not answer calls seeking comment Tuesday .

Arrest warrants for the brothers were issued December 10 , Castresana said , noting that the suspects were already out of the country by then .

Rosenberg recorded the tape blaming Colom three days before his death .

Businessman Khalid Musa and his daughter , Marjorie , were killed , Rosenberg said , because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption as the president wanted .

Rosenberg was Musa 's attorney .

`` He wanted to open a box of lightning and thunder , '' said Castresana , a Spanish judge .

In two April 21 e-mails , seven days after the Musa killings , Rosenberg wrote , `` I ca n't stop crying '' and `` I feel like I 'm disintegrating , '' Castresana said .

Rosenberg used one of the phones to call threats to his personal cell phone and had the other delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers , who gave it to the hit squad leader . Rosenberg then used the new cell phone he kept to give instructions to the hit squad leader through the second phone , Castresana said .

According to the investigator , Rosenberg told his secretary before his death that she would be receiving a check from Panama that should be delivered to the Valdez Paiz brothers . The check had been made out by Luis Alejos , a Rosenberg friend and business associate who at the time was Guatemala 's minister of communication , Castresana said . Alejos resigned from office in June , a few weeks after the slaying .

After receiving the check , Francisco Jose Valdez Paiz destroyed it , Castresana said . The businessman paid the 300,000 quetzales -LRB- $ 35,900 -RRB- for the assassination out of his own pocket , Castresana said .

In his videotape , Rosenberg said Gustavo Alejos would be among those responsible for the lawyer 's death if it happened .

`` If you are reading this message , it means that I , Rodrigo Rosenberg Marzano , was murdered by the president 's private secretary , Gustavo Alejos , and his associate Gregorio Valdez , with the approval of Mr. Alvaro Colom and -LSB- first lady -RSB- Sandra de Colom , '' Rosenberg said .

`` I do n't have any rancor in my heart , '' Colom said . `` Just immense gratitude for those who waited patiently with us . ''

The United Nations established the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala in 2006 to investigate corruption and political violence . More than 200,000 people have been killed in the nation since 1970 , mostly as a result of organized crime , drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996 .

There were 6,451 slayings in Guatemala last year , of which only 230 verdicts were achieved , Castresana said . That means , he said , that more than 96 percent of the killings in 2009 were not solved .
