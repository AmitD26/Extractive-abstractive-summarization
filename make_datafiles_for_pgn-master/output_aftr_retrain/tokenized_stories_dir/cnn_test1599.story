Chicago , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A body found Monday in the Chicago River is that of Michael Scott , president of the Chicago Board of Education , police said .

Scott 's wife told police that it was `` very unusual '' for him not to be home by midnight , Weis said .

The gunshot entrance wound was on the left side of his head , police said . A weapon was found either under or alongside his body , Weis said , and Scott 's car was in the immediate area .

The police investigation will include ballistics evidence and analysis of surveillance cameras in the area , Weis said . It is too early for police to draw conclusions , he added .

`` Chicago has lost a great leader , and the city 's school children have lost a devoted champion . ''

`` We 're just stunned and shocked , '' he said . `` Michael was so effervescent , so full of life . ''

Scott had been appointed to the Chicago Board of Education three times , twice as president . He most recently was appointed in February . Previously , Scott was board president for five years , until July 2006 .

Scott disclosed in early August that he had been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury investigating how students were chosen for admission to some of Chicago 's most elite public schools .

Scott , who was a developer , also was criticized in August when it was revealed that he had quietly arranged to develop city-owned land near a park that would have been used in the 2016 Summer Games . The move would have positioned Scott to cash in , had Chicago been awarded the Olympics .

The 2016 Games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil .
