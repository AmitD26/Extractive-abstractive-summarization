But this is n't the set of a low-budget sci-fi flick ; it 's the departure lounge of South Korea 's Incheon Airport , where seven `` super clone '' sniffer-dogs have been dispatched in the war against contraband luggage .

The pack of golden Labrador Retrievers are all genetically identical to `` Chase , '' whose legendary snout kept him top of Incheon 's drug-detection rankings right up until his retirement in 2007 .

But now after years of training , the new class is following in their genetic donor 's paw-prints , consistently outperforming the rest of South Korea 's naturally born sniffers in the hunt for heroin , cocaine and methamphetamines .

Although the seven Labrador clones cost upwards of $ 100,000 each , every single one of them made the grade .

But Lee refuses to take all the credit : `` I think half of the ability comes from the genetic background and half comes from the training , '' he said .

Lending weight , if it were needed , to the claim that aptitude is indeed a balance of nature and nurture , the dogs still display variations in performance despite their identical genes .

And leader of the pack is Tutu . `` Last year , he won a medal for detecting the most drugs at the ICN -LRB- Incheon -RRB- airport , '' boasts his long-time handler Park Ji-yong .

Lee says that , due to the high number of travelers passing through Incheon , the airport has experienced problems with the spread of infectious diseases , `` so the Korean government have asked us to clone some quarantine sniffing dogs ''

`` Wolves are endangered species in Korea , especially grey wolves . We collected cells from the ear of wolves ... and transported to surrogate dogs and finally we produced cloned wolves '' says Lee .

So , now that he 's cloned man 's best friend , are there any plans for man himself ?

`` Scientifically all the animals , including humans , can be cloned , but I have never thought about -LRB- it -RRB- . It 's illegal and it 's an ethical problem . ''
