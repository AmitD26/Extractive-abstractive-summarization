Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Roberto Feliz and Dr. Hiba Georges were quickly jolted from the most modern of medical care in Boston , Massachusetts , to the most rudimentary of care when they flew to Haiti last week to work at a hospital housed in two tents run by the University of Miami .

The doctors , who worked at the Boston Medical Center , quickly learned that when you have no technology -- not even the simplest blood test -- you have to make medical decisions in an entirely different way .

The patient was a boy who needed his leg amputated or else he would die of either an infection or rhabdomyolysis , a kidney disease that follows injuries where muscles are crushed .

Finally , the doctors decided to do the surgery themselves that night by the moonlight under a mango tree .

`` We just sawed his foot off . We did n't have to use anesthesia because he was already unconscious and was n't feeling a thing , '' Feliz says .

But they 'd waited too long . The boy took his last breath during the surgery .

`` Some of the doctors cried , '' Feliz says . `` I told them , ` There is no crying in medicine . ' ''

`` We tried to see if we could get some urine going , but there was not a drop . We filled him with fluids and gave him Lasix , a diuretic , to get him to pee , but nothing , '' Feliz says .

The boy died as the doctors were treating him .

After that boy 's death , surgeons were quicker to give permission to amputate , Feliz says .

Feliz says if there 's any silver lining to practicing such rudimentary medicine , it 's that it made him a more humble doctor .
