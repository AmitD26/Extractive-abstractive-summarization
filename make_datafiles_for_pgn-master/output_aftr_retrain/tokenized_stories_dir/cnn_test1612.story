Noriega 's lawyer , Frank Rubino , said he would continue to fight the extradition . He had said Noriega hoped to return to Panama to be closer to his family .

The former Panamanian strongman was captured in the 1989 U.S. military invasion of Panama and was convicted in 1992 of racketeering for accepting bribes to allow drugs to be shipped through Panama destined for the United States .

His attorneys had argued that his status as a prisoner of war meant he should be returned to Panama , but a separate court ruling last Friday rejected that argument .

Hoeveler noted that Noriega `` has not always sought repatriation , '' and had , at one time , asked to be allowed to go to a third country .

Noriega also faces possible prison time in Panama , where he is accused of kidnapping , extortion and the murder of political opponents .

Though the charges are more serious , if the 69-year-old Noriega is convicted of murder , he would likely serve much of his sentence under home detention in Panama .

Panamanian law provides home detention for anyone 74 years old or older .

The Panamanian constitution would also forbid his extradition to France .

CNN 's Patrick Oppmann in Miami and Jim Bittermann in Paris contributed to this report .
