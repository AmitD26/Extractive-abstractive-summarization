According to an internal BP document released Sunday by Rep. Edward Markey , D-Massachusetts , BP believed that the worst-case scenario could be as high as 100,000 barrels , or 4.2 million gallons of oil per day .

The document , submitted in May , maintains the 60,000 barrel estimate , but stipulates that if the `` blowout preventer and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions , the rate could be as high as 100,000 barrels a day . ''

`` It is clear that , from the beginning , BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill , '' said Markey , the chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee in the House Energy and Commerce Committee .

`` Considering what is now known about BP 's problems with this well prior to the Deepwater Horizon explosion , including cementing issues , leaks in the blowout preventer and gas kicks , BP should have been more honest about the dangerous condition of the well bore , '' Markey said in a statement .

BP spokesman Robert Wine said the May estimate cited in Markey 's document is irrelevant to the current situation because the oil company has no intention of removing the well 's blowout preventer .

`` The allegation does n't make sense , '' Wine told CNN . `` Why on earth would we remove the blowout preventer when it 's sitting on top of the sea well and providing some control -LRB- of the spill -RRB- ? ''

Toby Odone , another spokesman for BP , added that the blowout preventer will be removed only when the well is completely killed .

`` Thus far efforts made by mortals to try to solve the crisis have been to no avail , '' state Sen. Robert Adley said in a statement released after last week 's unanimous vote for the day of prayer . `` It is clearly time for a miracle for us . ''

The resolution names Sunday as a statewide day of prayer in Louisiana and calls on people of all religions throughout the Gulf Coast `` to pray for an end to this environmental emergency , sparing us all from the destruction of both culture and livelihood . ''

BP said it was able to capture roughly 8,480 barrels of oil from midnight to 12 p.m. Saturday . The company said it captured 24,500 barrels -- just over a million gallons -- of oil Friday , a little less than it captured the day before .

Meanwhile , oil recovery efforts in the Gulf resumed Saturday morning on the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise , after work was suspended for about 10 hours because of a mechanical problem .

A venting device aboard the drilling ship was not working properly , said Ayla Kelley , spokesperson for the Deepwater Horizon command center .

Other recovery efforts continued during the time that the Discoverer Enterprise was idled , she said .

She said the problem was with a blocked flame arrester , designed to prevent oil from combusting by extinguishing the flame .
