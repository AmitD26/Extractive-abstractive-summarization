-LRB- Health.com -RRB- -- Parents who believe that playing video games is less harmful to their kids ' attention spans than watching TV may want to reconsider -- and unplug the Xbox . Video games can sap a child 's attention just as much as the tube , a new study suggests .

Elementary school children who play video games more than two hours a day are 67 percent more likely than their peers who play less to have greater-than-average attention problems , according to the study , which appears in the journal Pediatrics .

`` Video games are n't less likely than television to be related to attention problems , '' says the lead author of the study , Edward Swing , a doctoral candidate in the department of psychology at Iowa State University , in Ames . `` They were at least as strong as television at predicting attention problems . ''

However , the study does n't prove that video games directly cause attention problems . It could be that kids who have short attention spans to begin with might be more likely to pick up a joystick than a book , for instance .

The relationship between video games and attention is probably a two-way street , Swing says . `` It would n't surprise me if children who have attention problems are attracted to these media , and that these media increase the attention problems , '' he says .

Previous studies have examined the effect of TV or video games on attention problems , but not both . By looking at video-game use as well as TV watching , Swing and his colleagues were able to show for the first time that the two activities have a similar relationship to attention problems .

C. Shawn Green , Ph.D , a postdoctoral associate in the department of psychology at the University of Minnesota , in Minneapolis , points out that the study does n't distinguish between the type of attention required to excel at a video game and that required to excel in school .

Experts have suggested that modern TV shows are so exciting and fast paced that they make reading and schoolwork seem dull by comparison , and the same may be true for video games , the study notes .

`` We were n't able to break -LSB- the games -RSB- down by educational versus non-educational or nonviolent versus violent , '' says Swing , adding that the impact different types of games may have on attention is a ripe area for future research .

The study also suggests that young kids are n't the only ones whose attention spans may be affected by video games .

The American Academy of Pediatrics , the leading professional organization for pediatricians and the publisher of Pediatrics , recommends that parents limit all `` screen time '' -LRB- including video and computer games -RRB- to less than two hours per day .

`` A hard boundary , such as two hours , is completely arbitrary , '' he says . `` Children are individuals , and what makes sense for one wo n't necessarily work for another . ''
