Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two major civil liberties groups filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging the government 's asserted authority to kill U.S. citizens living abroad who are designated as terrorists .

U.S. officials believe al-Awlaki , a Yemeni-American , influenced Maj. Nidal Hasan , the man accused of killing 13 people in the 2009 Fort Hood shootings , and played a more active role in Umar Farouk Abdul-Mutallab 's attempted bombing of a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009 .

Officials also believe al-Awlaki inspired Faisal Shahzad , who has pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges in the attempted car bomb attack in Times Square in May , as well as several others .

The ACLU and CCR announced the challenge to the government 's plan to use lethal force against U.S. citizens `` located far from any battlefield without charge , trial , or judicial process of any kind , '' a statement from the groups said .

The two groups and al-Awlaki 's father , Nasser al-Awlaki , are particularly concerned about the use of drones to target civilian al-Qaeda supporters . Unmanned drones are frequently used in the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan , where Taliban and other insurgents are believed to be operating .

The suit specifically challenges the law that prohibits attorneys from providing representation for al-Awlaki without first seeking a license from the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Asset Control .
