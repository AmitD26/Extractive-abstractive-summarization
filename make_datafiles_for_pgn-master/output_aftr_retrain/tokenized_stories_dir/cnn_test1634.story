LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was the stench . That was what really hit Danny Boyle the first time he went into a slum in India .

In `` Slumdog '' a poor man wins a place on India 's version of `` Who wants to be a Millionaire ? ''

The director , who is renown for films like `` Trainspotting '' and `` 28 Days Later , '' had never even been to India before he and his crew traveled there to make the critically acclaimed Oscar contender `` Slumdog Millionaire . ''

`` It 's pretty mad , '' admits Boyle . `` Everything is extreme . It 's too hot , the tea is too sweet ; everything is kind of too much . '' But , he adds : `` That 's wonderful for drama , absolutely wonderful . ''

He and his crew threw themselves into shooting their drama in the streets and landmarks of India 's `` city of dreams '' using passers-by as extras . They also shot in the Dharavi -- Asia 's largest slum -- and Juhu slum which can be seen from the city 's airport .

`` Slumdog '' is a classic rags-to-riches story about a young boy from the slums , Jamal Malik -LRB- played by British actor Dev Patel -RRB- , who beats millions of other Indians to bag a coveted place on the country 's version of TV game show `` Who Wants to be a Millionaire ? ''

Through the timely story of the young `` slumdog , '' Boyle illuminates the contradictions of present day India -- the nuclear power that does not provide public sanitation for its population -- and Mumbai was the ideal city in which to do it .

`` Mumbai is a city of extremes , '' Boyle explains , `` Life is raw . It 's incredibly powerful and rich because their economy is expanding , the richest men in the world are there ... but then there is also this enormous poverty as well . '' Do you think Danny Boyle has captured India in `` Slumdog Millionaire '' ? Tell us below in the SoundOff box .

Boyle achieved this realism by immersing himself , his crew and actors in the Mumbai sprawl , and shooting as much as possible in real locations .

`` It 's daunting at first doing these scenes outdoors with loads of people watching , but they just warm to it and everybody is , like , laughing and they start clapping at the end of the scenes , '' Patel laughs .

`` You ca n't stop the bystanders in Bombay , '' she explains , `` It is something that you attract anyway , especially if you have a camera out there and a foreign crew and a song and dance .

`` You are definitely going to attract a huge crowd and you ca n't do anything about it . The only thing you can do is enjoy it . ''

`` You just do n't have any control in India , '' he explains . `` If you seek it , it will drive you insane . You 've got to go with it really and just see what happens . ''

They wanted to draw as little attention to themselves as possible to keep the crowds looking natural .

'' -LSB- We used -RSB- a Canon stills camera , which takes 12 frames per second . If people see a stills camera , they do n't think it 's recording live action , '' he explains .

`` You arrive and you feel a bit vulnerable and naked again , and that 's a really good thing , because you are not tempted to just step in your own footsteps all the time . ''
