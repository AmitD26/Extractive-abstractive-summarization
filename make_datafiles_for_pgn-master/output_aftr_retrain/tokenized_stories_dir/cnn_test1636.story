`` We learned a lot about the culture , '' Aaron Berlin said . `` That was one of the great things about volunteering . We were really incorporated into the daily lives of the children and the volunteers who ran the orphanage . ''

The two are examples of what some call `` honeyteers '' -- - newlyweds whose honeymoons double as volunteer projects . These couples not only tour distant locales but also get involved with the communities they find there .

`` I think it 's just , going to Cabo is getting really old , '' said Alexia Nestora , who writes the blog Voluntourism Gal . `` This is a way to give back to the community and connect a bit more . Before , you had a bit of a stereotype of going out Peace Corps style . Now it 's a bit more mainstream . ''

During their four-week stay , the couple stayed in separate men 's and women 's housing during their honeymoon . It did n't matter , because they were there to volunteer -- and getting to know the local kids was the highlight of their trip .

The Lagasses are incorporating Swahili into their own children 's names and have even started looking into adoption . One day , they hope to bring their young son with them for a visit .

`` We just want him to grow up to understand that there are other people in the world less fortunate than us , and we have to be thankful for everything we have , '' said Yvan Lagasse .

Kam Santos of Cross-Cultural Solutions said the organization 's volunteer projects all lead to an overarching goal . In other words , the work does n't end after four weeks . The next group of volunteers moves the project forward .

Mancini said the trip was an opportunity to learn about his wife 's heritage .

`` Lina 's mom is from China , and I know Chinese people here , but it really gave me an appreciation for the culture and the incredible history , '' he said .

The couple taught English to students ages 8 to 14 , collaborating with translators on lesson plans . In one of the scenarios they designed , students `` bought '' clothes using fake money , then modeled them in a classroom fashion show . The experience showed Mancini another side of his wife .

`` I saw her as a teacher , as there with the children , and that 's exciting for someone hoping to be a father some day . You see her as a leader . She knows a little Chinese , and I do n't know a lot , so it was nice to see her getting us around and helping me out . ''

`` It 's a bonding experience , '' Fenequito added .
