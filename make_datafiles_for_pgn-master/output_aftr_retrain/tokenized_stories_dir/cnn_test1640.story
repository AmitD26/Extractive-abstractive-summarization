-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nigel De Jong has been dropped from the Netherlands squad for their Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Moldova and Sweden .

The Manchester City midfielder was involved in a tackle that broke the leg of Newcastle United 's Hatem Ben Arfa in Sunday 's English Premier League match at Eastlands .

Coach Bert van Marwijk told the Dutch Football Federation 's official website : `` I just informed the squad and told him I saw no other possibility .

`` In the near future I will discuss this matter with Nigel but right now we have to focus on the upcoming two matches . ''

It is not the first time a tackle from De Jong has caused controversy after his high challenge on Spain 's Xabi Alonso during the World Cup final . He was shown a yellow card after planting his boot into Alonso 's chest .

`` It is unfortunate , especially since he does not need to do it . The funny thing is that the referee did not even show a yellow card for it .

`` Apparently , there are other standards . But I have a problem with the way Nigel needlessly looks to push the limit . I am going to speak to him . ''
