Hurricane Prediction

AZUZ : Well , the predictions are in for this year 's Atlantic hurricane season , and the forecast : above average . The season starts on June 1st , lasts through the end of November . Here 's a look at the prediction for this year versus an average year . Storms are assigned a name when they reach a certain intensity . Experts are forecasting that we 'll have 15 named storms . A typical season has 11 . Of those 15 , the prediction is that 8 will turn into hurricanes , and four of those will become major hurricanes . An average year has six hurricanes , including two major storms . Now , the people who make these predictions point out they are just preliminary . Another one is scheduled to come out on June 2nd .

Kyrgyzstan Protests

Thailand Protests

AZUZ : A somewhat similar situation is happening southeast of there in Thailand , where protesters are speaking out against that country 's government . These demonstrations have been going on for weeks . The country 's prime minister declared a state of emergency there yesterday , sent a helicopter to pick up some officials after protesters broke into Thailand 's parliament building . They stayed there for a few hours and then regrouped at their usual meeting spots . The demonstrators -- they 're called `` Red Shirts '' -- they 're supporters of Thailand 's former prime minister . He was removed from office in 2006 and left the country in 2008 while he was facing corruption charges . The Red Shirts want him back , and they want the current prime minister to call for elections . The country 's leader says these protests are a violation of Thailand 's constitution .

AZUZ : North Korea has sentenced an American citizen to eight years of hard labor for entering North Korea illegally . Back in January , Aijalon Mahli Gomes crossed over the border from China to North Korea . That 's why he was arrested . Crossing the border without permission is against the law there . The United States does n't have any official relations with North Korea , but some people are asking the U.S. government to try to get Gomes released .

Brazil Flooding

AZUZ : Moving over to South America now , where firefighters in Brazil are trying to rescue victims of this : mudslides and severe flooding caused by heavy rains . Almost a foot of rain fell on Rio de Janeiro in one day . Nearly 300 people had been rescued by Tuesday , but officials said the severe weather had killed more than 100 others , and there are some people who are still trapped .

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! Dendrology is the study of what ? If you think you know it , shout it out !

AZUZ : The city of New York is on a mission to plant a million trees over the next decade , and some folks your age are helping out . It 's not training them for a career in dendrology .

RICHARD ROTH , CNN UNITED NATIONS CORRESPONDENT , NEW YORK : Bronx teenager Fabian Vasquez comes home after a day of hanging with his friends .

UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Headache ! Headache !

ROTH : They were hanging sixty feet in the air . It 's all part of New York City 's Million Trees Training Program .

ADRIAN BENEPE , NYC PARKS COMMISSIONER : It 's an effort to take kids known as disconnected youth , connect them with employment possibilities , connect them with the environment . So in essence , it 's a combination environmental program and jobs program .

MARK CHISHOLM , TREE PROFESSIONAL : My rule of thumb is four times whatever this diameter is , is what you want .

ROTH : Fabian is learning the ropes from a world champion climber and tree professional .

ROTH : And while tree climbing is physically demanding , it 's the mental and emotional challenges that initially need to be overcome .

ROTH : They have to stay alert on the streets of New York , and especially ninety feet up .

ROTH : But does a city known for its asphalt jungle need to train its citizens for green jobs ?

Before We Go

AZUZ : Before we go , a tasty tradition for baseball 's opening day . It is Milwaukee 's annual sausage race ! The mascots are all different kinds of sausage , but this relay links them together . It 's kind of nice to see that kind of teamwork . I mean , no one 's being a brat . They all deserve a pattie on the back . Of course , all this entertainment is for the fans . They really get into it , especially when the last guy crosses the finish line .

Goodbye

AZUZ : I mean , seriously , you never sau-sage a cheer . Hot dog ! You guys have a great day . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .
