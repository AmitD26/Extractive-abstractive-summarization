-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As record oil prices dominate the headlines , natural gas is an energy sector gaining more recognition . MME 's John Defterios -LRB- JD -RRB- talks with the CEO of Dolphin Energy , Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh -LRB- AS -RRB- about the importance of the natural gas sector , the impact of high oil prices , and increasing global energy demand .

Al Sayegh is head of the largest single energy initiative in the Middle East , linking the three Gulf states of Qatar , U.A.E. and Oman , and producing two billion cubic feet of gas a day , equivalent to 350,000 barrels of oil .

John Defterios begins by asking him why his company spent seven years building a giant natural gas plant an pipeline in a region swimming with oil .

-LRB- AS -RRB- : It was clear from the beginning , we needed to import gas and the Qataris wanted to export gas . So there was economic alignment . We respected that and they respected our needs , but political will , I believe , these three countries are very close politically and they needed to exercise this closeness and this project provided a fantastic opportunity for us to come together .

-LRB- JD -RRB- : It 's fascinating . I do n't think people realize the scope of this field . The Qatari side of the North Field is 14 per cent of the world 's supply of natural gas . This has a long , long shelf life in terms of production , does it not ?

-LRB- AS -RRB- : It has a very long life . Our transaction is for 25 years but it can go much longer than that . We hope we will be able to produce more from this field to fill our pipeline to its maximum capacity .

-LRB- JD -RRB- : There is a lot of political pressure now , or calls from Washington and the European Union for OPEC to provide more oil , more energy to the global market . But what is the reality ? Is there is a capacity problem or is there not ? What is from your view the reality today ?

-LRB- JD -RRB- : I see the tone in the Middle East is much more pragmatic . So there is not a rush to get all this capacity built to get oil to market . Is this a change of attitude that needs to be preserved for future generations now ?
