The iPad 2 will support three different wireless configurations : UMTS , CDMA and Wi-Fi only , according to `` industry sources quoted by DigiTimes '' citing component makers .

That 's up from the two versions Apple currently offers : UMTS plus Wi-Fi , and Wi-Fi only .

To explicate the alphabet soup , UMTS is the standard used by major 3G carriers such as AT&T and T-Mobile , while CDMA is compatible with Verizon and Sprint networks .

Customers who want to connect to non-AT & T 3G networks must either buy an external wireless hotspot device such as the Verizon MiFi -LRB- Verizon already sells a MiFi plus iPad package -RRB- or trim a standard SIM card down to MicroSIM size , like Wired.com 's Charlie Sorrel .

The current 3G model of the iPad is not tied to a contract : Customers pay a flat monthly rate for data and can opt out whenever they please .

So if this rumor is true , it means that when the iPad 2 ships , you 'll have to pick a 3G model based on your carrier preference . If you do n't plan to be on the road a lot , there 's still the Wi-Fi option .

Whether Apple hammers out sales agreements with Verizon or Sprint remains to be seen .

If Verizon gets the iPhone and the iPad , it would greatly expand Apple 's potential market , and would also likely deal a severe blow to AT&T , which has been roundly criticized for the inability of its 3G network to keep up with iPhone-induced demand .
