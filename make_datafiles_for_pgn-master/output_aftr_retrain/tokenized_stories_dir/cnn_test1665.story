-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japan 's national sport of sumo wrestling was rocked by a match-fixing scandal on Thursday after it was revealed three wrestlers had admitted to rigging bouts .

The messages exchanged between wrestlers discuss how fights would be arranged and also the amount of money that would change hands .

`` I 'll hit my opponent head on , '' was one message reported in British newspaper The Guardian .

`` For 20 more I will concede . After the meet , I need to make at least 50 or I 'll be in serious trouble , '' read a further text which discussed the financial rewards for one wrestler .

`` You fall when I move to tackle , '' read another message reported by Japanese news wire Jiji Press .

It is the latest controversy to hit sumo after a gambling scandal emerged in July last year when 34-year-old wrestler Ozeki Kotomitsuki is said to have illegally bet on baseball games .
