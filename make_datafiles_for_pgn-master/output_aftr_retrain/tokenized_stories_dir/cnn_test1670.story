Forensic tests found no link to Spierer and have determined the body belongs to an African-American female , said Alfarena Ballew , chief deputy coroner for Marion County .

Bloomington police have been searching for Spierer , a 20-year-old sophomore , since June 2 , when she was last seen leaving a sports bar after a night out with friends .

In mid-June , police found possible new clues to Spierer 's disappearance -- images of a white pickup caught on a security surveillance video . But they ruled out a connection .

In late June , hundreds of volunteers searched a 10-mile area in Indiana in an event called `` Find Lauren Day . ''

Spierer 's mother was at the event and thanked the volunteers even though they were not successful .

`` Perhaps it was a terrible accident that happened and we can deal with that , '' Charlene Spierer said in late June . `` What we ca n't deal with is what we do n't know . So information is the most valuable thing we need right now . ''

Officials still do n't know how the body ended up in Fall Creek . Ballew said her office will use DNA evidence and dental records to help identify the woman and make a determination about how she died .
