-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Carefully constructed looks that borrow from another time are all the rage on the streets of St. Paul and Minneapolis . But with vintage and thrift clothing stores popping up on every corner , the vintage look of the Twin Cities almost ca n't be helped .

Since 2006 , Minneapoline blogger Ellen Lawson has been documenting the evolving street style in her hometown . She has watched the neighboring cities shed a DIY-esque style and celebrate the rise of local designers . After moving back to Minneapolis once she finished college in Iowa , Lawson found her style evolving as well .

`` The blog was really bare bones at first , '' Lawson said . `` I had a point-and-shoot camera , and took photos of everything . I think I 'm a little more edited now . I have a grasp of my own personal style .

The individualism in the Twin Cities challenges Lawson to capture as much of it as she can . Feminine lace and crochet meet up with menswear and masculine footwear to create a mash-up of different styles .

`` We are a really interesting , creative city , '' Lawson said . `` I do n't think a lot of people know that . ''

Below , Lawson describes the basis for Twin Cities style .

CNN : What was the 2006 fashion scene in Minneapolis like when you started the blog ?

Lawson : I think people are really budget-conscious here , so thrifting is big . There are so many styles , but it 's largely ` budget-friendly creative ' . We 're just getting to be more open to paying high-fashion prices , but it 's a little hard for a lot of people here to get their minds around it . But they 're creative , and always carry a retro element .

We do have a big hipster contingent in the city , so that affects the style . The high-waist/accentuated waist has been very popular and it goes back to the retro feel of Minneapolis . When you have a lot of people thrifting , you 're going to end up having clothes from another time .

Lawson : I just found out one of our local designers is going to be on Project Runway . We 've had five people from the city in Project Runway .

CNN : Who are some of the favorite local designers and where do the style-inclined shop ?

There 's so many . They kind of pop up all over . All of the sudden , you 're going down the street and then there 's another vintage store .
