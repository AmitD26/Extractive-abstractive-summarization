Their talks came barely two weeks after three deadly explosions ripped through Mumbai , an attack that revived memories of the 2008 terror siege of India 's financial hub . Pakistan was quick to condemn the July 13 bombings of Mumbai while New Delhi was careful not to finger Islamabad .

`` This is indeed a new era of bilateral cooperation between the two countries and it is our desire , and I believe after having spoken to you mister foreign minister , that it is the desire and commitment of both the governments to make it an uninterrupted and uninterruptable process , '' Khar remarked , standing beside the Indian leader after their meeting .

`` We have reaffirmed our commitment to resolve all outstanding issues through a comprehensive , serious and sustained dialogue . While being fully cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead , I can confidently say that our relations are on the right track , '' he said .

India and Pakistan have have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947 , two of them over Kashmir , which both nations claim .

Earlier this year , New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai strikes , which have been blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups .

Under U.S. pressure , Indian and Pakistani leaders held meetings last year in a bid to put their dialogue back on track , but no dramatic headway has been made .

In 2004 , the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues , including Kashmir , terrorism and Pakistan 's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border , which it sees as a threat to its water supplies .

Since then , successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony .

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan 's President Asif Ali Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings .
