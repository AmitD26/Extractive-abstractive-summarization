-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States must beat Guadeloupe on Tuesday to guarantee a quarterfinal place at the Gold Cup , having suffered a shock first group-stage defeat in the CONCACAF region tournament .

`` I do n't think the heat was a factor . On the night we were not sharp enough , '' coach Bradley told the U.S. Soccer website .

Striker Clarence Goodson reduced the deficit in the 68th minute when Michael Bradley flicked on Landon Donovan 's corner , but the four-time Gold Cup champions could not manage an equalizer .

The Panamanians lost to the U.S. in the 2005 final after a penalty shootout , and reached the quarterfinals in 2007 and 2009 .

In Sunday 's Group A games , defending champions Mexico take on second-placed Costa Rica having already qualified for the last eight after two successive 5-0 wins .

However , Mexico 's hopes have been hit by the suspension of five players -- Guillermo Ochoa , Francisco Javier Rodriguez , Edgar Duenas , Antonio Naelson `` Sinha '' and Christian Bermudez -- who tested positive for the banned drug clenbuterol .

To finish second , El Salvador -- whose only point came in a 1-1 draw with Costa Rica -- must beat bottom nation Cuba by 11 goals and see the 2009 semifinalists lose to five-time champions Mexico .

Third-placed Guatemala , who have only one point , must beat bottom nation Grenada by a big margin and hope the Hondurans lose .
