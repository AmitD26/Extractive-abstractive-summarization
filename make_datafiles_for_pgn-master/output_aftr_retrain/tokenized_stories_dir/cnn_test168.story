Never mind that Holmes is a fictional character . To this day , in books , TV and movies , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's creation remains just as popular as he was when he debuted in the late 19th century .

Much of Holmes ' appeal has always been his amazing mind -- how he is able to solve a seemingly insurmountable mystery through simple observation and deep thought . Would n't we all like to borrow from his bag of mental tricks ?

In turn , Konnikova uses Holmes as an example of how anyone can learn to think more clearly , improve his or her memory and generally increase everyday mental power .

CNN : How did you become a fan of Sherlock Holmes ?

Konnikova : I was introduced to Sherlock Holmes by my Dad when I was young . We had a tradition every Sunday night , he would read to us . Different stories , different books . `` The Count of Monte Cristo , '' `` The Three Musketeers , '' things kids would really enjoy .

One Sunday we started the Sherlock Holmes stories , and it was just a completely eye-opening experience . I remember sitting there riveted . It really stuck with me as I grew older . I realized how powerful they were from a literary standpoint .

Conan Doyle was such a phenomenal writer . I do n't think people appreciate just how good the work really is . He 's masterful with voice , with conversation , with pacing , with description . He has it all down .

I was also struck by how incredibly accurate his psychological observations were . Sherlock Holmes became this figure who predated modern psychology , neuroscience and our understanding of how the mind works by more than a century . Combing through the stories , I thought it would be a fascinating way of looking at the mind by using this fictional character .

Konnikova : Holmes is really a mindful detective , someone who knows the true value of observation , which means being mindful and in the present moment , really taking in your surroundings , really taking in everything . That type of approach permeates all of his thinking . He 's not just aware of his environment ; he 's aware of himself ; he 's aware of the contents of his own mind . He has a powerful knowledge of how he thinks , what mistakes he is likely to make . Holmes puts it best when he says it 's the difference between seeing and observing .

CNN : What is the `` brain attic '' Holmes talks about ?

CNN : Are there everyday benefits of learning to think like Holmes ?

Konnikova : Absolutely , this type of approach can make you healthier , happier and sharper .

CNN : Where would you start ?

When you 're cognitively busy , you 're not thinking as clearly . If you 're someone with a busy schedule who has to multitask all the time , even if you just practice this quiet mindfulness a few minutes a day , just let your mind focus on the present moment , it can make a huge difference in the clarity of your thinking .
