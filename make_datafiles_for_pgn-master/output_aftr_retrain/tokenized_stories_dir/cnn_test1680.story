Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two women who say they suffered severe medical complications from a generic drug lost their Supreme Court appeal Thursday , essentially ending their separate lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers .

The financial and safety implications from the court 's ruling , could prove enormous . Generic drugs currently account for more than 70 % of prescriptions filled in the United States . That number is expected to rise in the coming years , with patent protection due to expire on several popular and lucrative consumer drugs , including Lipitor and Viagra . The blockbuster health care reform bill championed by President Barack Obama would also encourage greater use of generics . About a third of generic drugs have no brand name competitors .

The court split along conservative-liberal lines . `` It is beyond dispute that the federal statutes and regulations that apply to brand-name drug manufacturers are meaningfully different than those that apply to generic drug manufacturers , '' said Justice Clarence Thomas . `` Indeed it is the special , and different , regulation of generic drugs that allowed the generic drug market to expand , bringing drugs more quickly and cheaply to the public . ''

After four years of taking the drugs , the women each developed tardive dyskinesia , a severe longterm neurological disorder that causes involuntary muscle movements .

In 2009 , the FDA acted on its own and issued an order to the makers of both brand-name and generic versions of metoclopramide to add a specific warning about the increased risks of developing tardive dyskinesia .

The generic drug makers are trying to dismiss the lawsuits . They cite a 1984 congressional law pre-empting state `` failure-to-warn '' claims .

But the high court had given a big victory to patients and consumer rights groups in 2009 when it ruled in favor of plaintiff Diana Winn Levine , when she sued Wyeth -- now owned by Pfizer -- after losing an arm to gangrene from a common , brand-name anti-nausea prescription medication . She had won a $ 7 million judgment from a Vermont jury for her claims .

Thomas acknowledged that from the plaintiffs ' perspective in the latest cases , `` finding pre-emption here but not in Wyeth makes little sense . '' But he added , `` because pharmacists , acting in full accord with state law , substituted generic metoclopramide instead , federal law pre-empts these lawsuits . We acknowledge the unfortunate hand that federal drug regulation has dealt Mensing , Demahy and others similarly situated . '' The majority noted Congress and the FDA , not the courts , can now change the law if they want .

Sotomayor , expressing her frustration , said , `` As a result of today 's decision , whether a consumer harmed by inadequate warnings can obtain relief turns solely on the happenstance of whether her pharmacist filled her prescription with a brand-name or generic drug . The court gets one thing right : This outcome makes little sense . ''

`` Patients will now be taking generic drugs at their own risk , '' said the group 's president Gibson Vance . `` It is absurd that doctors and patients will have to make medical decisions knowing that only brand-name drug manufacturers -- not generics -- can be held accountable for their drugs ' dangerous side-effects .
