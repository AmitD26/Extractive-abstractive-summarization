`` Do you really think this is a way for grown men to be behaving ? '' he said he had asked paparazzi staked out at the home of the woman , but they ignored him .

Comic Steve Coogan and former motor racing boss Max Mosley were also on the panel , alongside member of Parliament Zac Goldsmith .

The witnesses were asked how much it cost to fight newspapers

`` You 've got to risk a million pounds to get justice , '' said Mosley , who successfully sued the now-defunct News of the World tabloid for libel .

Mosley also talked about the difference between defamation and invasion of privacy .

The hearing is separate from a government-backed inquiry into press ethics .

The Leveson Inquiry was set up in response to outrage at revelations of the scale of illegal eavesdropping and police bribery on behalf of News of the World , which was shut down in July over the scandal .

Police are separately investigating phone hacking , computer hacking and bribery .

Phone hacking involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely .
