-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Voters in the Democratic Republic of Congo head to the polls on November 28 to pick a president and parliament in the mineral-rich central African nation . This is Congo 's second election since 1997 , and analysts consider it the nation 's true test of democracy .

Congo 's history

Congo gained independence from Belgium in 1960 , and soon after Patrice Lumumba was elected the nation 's prime minister . Mobutu Sese Seko seized power in a coup five years later and changed the country 's name to Zaire .

Sese Seko was toppled in a 1997 coup led by Laurent Kabila , who renamed it the Democratic Republic of Congo .

Soon after Kabila was assassinated in 2001 , his son , Joseph Kabila , assumed power and announced the formation of a U.N.-led transitional government two years later . He won the 2006 election , making this year 's poll the second since the toppling of Sese Seko . The 2006 election overseen by the United Nations was considered a bridge to transition from a dictatorship . Analysts say this year 's election is the true test of democracy .

International observers considered the 2006 poll -- the first free election in Congo in about 40 years -- as generally free and fair . There were some clashes between supporters of the two frontrunners , but no major violence was reported . His main rival Jean-Pierre Bemba , who got the second-highest number of votes , disputed the official outcome .

Kabila is hoping to secure another five-year term as the opposition hopes to persuade voters change is overdue . A series of campaigns have been held nationwide , with some media reports of violence during the period .

Why is Congo important ?

Congo 's success is vital to the Great Lakes region , which has suffered the effects of the violence in the nation . Violence and rapes are widely reported in eastern Congo , including a holiday season mass rape last year that sent shock waves across the international community .

The east remains the epicenter of attacks by anti-government militias . The international community has spent massive amounts of money in an effort to stabilize the vast nation .

Despite its rich resources , Congo battles violence and poverty . A decade of conflict between government forces and armed militias left millions dead as a result of the fighting , and hunger and diseases .
