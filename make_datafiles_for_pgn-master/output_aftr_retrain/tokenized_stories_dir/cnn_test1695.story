The protests -- organized by Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir -- included women and children .

`` That 's why we reject Obama and we do n't believe that he 's reaching out to Muslims . ''

The spokesman said about 20,000 people attended the rallies .

More than one in 10 of the world 's Muslims live there .

Although it has a reputation for being home to a relatively tolerant and easy-going brand of Islam , a Pew Forum analysis rates it as having high levels of legal restrictions on religion and religious social tension .

Government restrictions on religion are tighter in Indonesia than in Russia or Turkey , and social tensions are higher than in Nigeria or Egypt , the think tank says .

Obama is scheduled to arrive in Jakarta on Tuesday as part of a 10-day visit to India , Indonesia , South Korea and Japan .

Obama spent part of his childhood in Indonesia .

However , Muslims in Indonesia remain pessimistic .

His visit to India -- the third largest economy and one of the world 's few growth markets -- also includes meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi and addressing the nation 's parliament .
