-LRB- Oprah.com -RRB- -- It began with a sign reading `` Be excellent to each other , '' which I printed from my computer in Gothic type and taped to my workspace . I was about to launch into a series of temporary jobs to supplement my freelance writing income .

My plan was to temp for a few months , save enough money so I could stay home and write for a while , back and forth , my intention being eventually to write full-time .

As is often the case with best-laid plans , however , I soon discovered an unexpected goal within my temporary career : the pursuit of excellence as a way of life .

My fellow temps were skeptical . `` People treat temps like dirt , '' they scoffed . `` You 'll be lucky if you can maintain excellence through your first assignment . ''

They had a point : I was likely to meet challenges . Nevertheless , I rolled up my sleeves and went to work .

No one seemed to notice the sign until several days into the job , when I set up a videotape for a troubleshooting meeting . The tape showed `` the girls '' malfunctioning -- throwing chocolate chip cookies at each other instead of neatly filing them into their respective boxes .

`` Hey , '' I heard a software engineer exclaim as I left the room . `` They are n't being excellent to each other ! '' `` Yeah ! '' someone else shouted . `` Be excellent to each other ! '' Later someone left a box of the girls ' cookies in the break room , accompanied by a note : `` For the team . Thanks for your excellent help . ''

Not everyone embraced excellence with such enthusiasm . Some people ignored the sign -LRB- and the intention -RRB- . Others were short-tempered , despite my best efforts . But , for the most part , my colleagues responded positively to kindness .

On one occasion , being excellent even helped redirect the career of an unhappy administrative assistant . After overhearing her on the phone with her daughter , I asked if she had majored in child psychology , since she seemed especially gifted at dealing with children . Several weeks later , she came to thank me for my observation and to say goodbye : She was leaving to open her own day-care center .

During mundane moments , I came to understand that excellence was n't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me . On the contrary , sometimes it meant defending someone against vicious gossip or saying no to a colleague who asked me to lie about his overtime hours .

Next I offered employment workshops through university extension programs and community centers , where I intended to present practical information but somehow ended up teaching excellence as well .

I was given the opportunity to test this commitment when my best friend and my father died within the same year and I was called upon to devote full-time hospice care to them both . I was there until their very last breaths -- my most profound experience with excellence yet .

I finally met my writing goal and am no longer temping , though we are all temps in one form or another , since nothing really lasts forever . Still , my practice of excellence endures .

Now , instead of a sign , I carry excellence within me as a mantra , as a presence . Excellence has the most impact when I first focus on my own peace and happiness , and then send it out into the world .
