-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It has become a great American tradition , an act of small-town civics , an example of direct democracy in action where citizens get to meet presidential candidates multiple times .

The Iowa caucuses are low-turnout , high-intensity elections . There are 2.1 million registered voters in Iowa . But the total turnout for the GOP caucus in 2008 was just 118,696 people , despite the months of media hype .

Mike Huckabee won the caucuses that year with nearly 41,000 votes , beating Mitt Romney by more than 10,000 votes while being outspent considerably . That 10,000-vote margin represented less than half of 1 % of the entire state 's electorate .

Overall , the state of Iowa is representative of heartland America -- 37 % registered independent , 32 % Democrat and 30 % Republican . But caucus-goers do not represent that political spread . Instead , 88 % of GOP caucus voters in 2008 identified themselves as `` conservative , '' and only 11 % described their views as moderate . Nearly two-thirds were evangelical .

Rick Perry 's invested his considerable campaign cash in a combination of in-state ad-buys and ground-game organization . Michele Bachmann 's campaign , which once was strong enough to win a straw poll in the state , has collapsed under the weight of the candidate 's considerable overreach , marked by high-level defections and rock-bottom polls . Bachmann has taken to desperately trying to compare herself to Margaret Thatcher at every stop while her campaign cites the judgment of a conservative Christian group that she is `` biblically qualified to be president '' -- whatever that 's supposed to mean .

One of the real questions in this caucus is whether retail politics matters as much as it used to . Mitt Romney basically dissed the state for the first 10 months of 2011 , still stinging from his expensive rejection in 2008 . But his well-funded campaign was able to buy aspects of a statewide organization and negative ads to tear down rivals .

And if he wins Iowa on Tuesday night , his months-long double-digit lead in New Hampshire will solidify and he will be almost assured of winning the first two states , well on the way to winning the nomination . Additionally , he has the weight of precedent on his side : The front-runners who have conventional wisdom behind them tend to win the Republican nomination eventually , after the party flirts with a dark horse .

But Ron Paul is a wild card . His supporters are by far the most dedicated , if not the most numerous . They will turn out come sleet or snow -LRB- though the temperature is supposed to be above average -RRB- . The January 3 caucuses are smack in the middle of winter break for universities , but Paul 's younger supporters might just come back early to vote for their hero .

If Rick Santorum 's recent momentum continues , he can claim the evangelical mantle as the consistent social conservative alternative to Romney , the man he endorsed in 2008 . He provides at least one other clear point of contrast -- Santorum has been hammering away at middle class and blue collar issues , while Romney embodies the one percent of the wealthiest Americans .

The countdown to the Iowa caucus can now be measured in hours , instead of weeks or months . Whatever you think about the disproportionate influence this heartland state has on our politics , it can not be ignored . The presidential election year of 2012 is here . And on Tuesday night , the race for the White House will really kick off .
