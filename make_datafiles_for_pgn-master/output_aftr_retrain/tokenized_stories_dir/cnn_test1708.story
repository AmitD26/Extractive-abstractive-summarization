LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I have a confession . As a music style , heavy metal has completely passed me by . I do n't understand it . I 'm not even sure I want to . `` Bring your daughter to the slaughter , '' bellows Iron Maiden 's Bruce Dickinson . Why would I want to do that ? Why would I want to listen to anyone even suggesting I do that ?

As a child of the 70s , how could I have missed the birth of a wildly popular new music genre right in the next decade ? Even at the end of the 80s , when Iron Maiden was releasing its `` First Ten Years '' compilation of greatest hits , I would have been sixteen -LRB- or thereabouts -RRB- , the perfect age to fall for the charms of a long-haired , rebellious rocker in tight leather pants . You 'd think .

I meet him at the TotalRock studios in Central London . The stairs are scuffed . It smells of stale sweat . I 'm pleased to see Malcolm is wearing the traditional heavy metal attire of black T-shirt and black jeans . Obviously I 'm going to have to go and buy a T-shirt , perhaps one with a skull on it .

`` You can wear anything you want , '' Malcolm assures me . `` You 'd probably be surprised how many heavy metal fans there are who have very high-powered business jobs -- even members of parliament who are into metal . They ca n't go around dressed as I 'm necessarily dressed now all the time because it does n't fit into their jobs . ''

His main allegiance later shifted to Led Zeppelin , but when it comes to music styles he 's not fussy . `` I 've got eclectic tastes , '' he says . `` I 'm happy to listen to Frank Sinatra , listen to AC-DC , to all sorts . ''

I 've heard someone compare heavy metal to pantomime , I say . Surely that ca n't be true ?

He hastens to add that a lot of time and effort goes into staging the shows , and from that perspective , it 's completely serious . The problem with heavy metal , Malcolm says , is that the mainstream media misrepresented it for years .

`` You can understand people actually seeing what was being presented to them thinking ` I do n't get it and I do n't want to get it , ' '' Malcolm says . Now many more people `` get it . '' Some 30,000 people listen to TotalRock each week , many of them women .

`` It 's ended up being I think a music that attracts if not fifty percent female fans then certainly a very big minority . The fact is metal has never tried to exclude women . ''

So what of lyrics like `` bring your daughter to the slaughter '' ?

It should be stated here that there are varying degrees of heavy metal , from the hair metal of carefully-coifured Jon Bon Jovi to the black art of New York doom metal band Unearthly Trance .

Dozens of sub-categories of metal have evolved to include black metal , stoner metal , thrash metal , power metal , goth metal , death metal and grind core , to name a few .

What binds them all is a fierce dedication to the style of music and an admirable loyalty to their chosen bands . There seems to be none of the fickleness associated with the pop world where young performers are routinely thrown on the scrapheap after a few hits -- or flops .

As Malcolm says , it 's not unusual for bands to have a career that spans decades . Iron Maiden has been going for almost 30 years . Black Sabbath for even longer .

So is there any age when heavy metal fans should retire gracefully from the scene ?

`` Absolutely not , no , no , no , '' Malcolm says , looking slightly shocked . `` If you love it and enjoy it why should you have give it up because you reach a certain age ? Definitely not . Metal is ageless . ''
