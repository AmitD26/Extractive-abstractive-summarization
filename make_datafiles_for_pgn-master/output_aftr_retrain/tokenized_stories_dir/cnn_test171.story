The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco denied a request to re-examine the issue , months after judges gave gay and lesbian couples constitutional blessing to wed in the state . A stay on same-sex marriages in California remains in place until the issue is exhausted in the courts .

In February , a three-judge panel of that court ruled the measure unconstitutional . In its split decision , the panel found that Proposition 8 `` works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians '' by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th Amendment .

Backers of the proposition had asked for a larger panel of judges to rehear the case . In a seven-page order Tuesday , the court refused .

Supporters of Proposition 8 vowed to appeal to the nation 's highest court .

`` Marriage is a universal good that has been honored by diverse cultures and faiths for the entire history of Western civilization , '' said Brian Raum , senior counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund . The organization is part of the legal defense team for ProtectMarriage.com , the banner organization for proponents of the measure .

Fast facts : Same-sex marriage

`` The ProtectMarriage.com legal team looks forward to standing before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the people 's right to preserve the fundamental building block of civilization , especially since the dissents accompanying today 's decision strongly support our arguments . The democratic process and the most important human institution -- marriage -- should n't be overthrown based on the demands of Hollywood activists . ''

Gay-rights advocates , meanwhile , hailed the court 's action .

`` Today 's refusal by the 9th Circuit to grant further review is a testament to the meticulous and well-reasoned opinion originally issued by the court , '' said Kate Kendell , executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights .

Is same-sex marriage too radical for America ?

`` While the supporters of Proposition 8 will now seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court , there is no doubt that they are on the wrong side of history . Excluding same-sex couples from the right to marry runs counter to our highest ideals of equality and fairness . ''

`` Today 's decision by the Ninth Circuit ... brings committed same-sex couples in California one step closer to being able to marry , '' said Evan Wolfson , president of the group Freedom to Marry .

`` It 's now been three and a half years since the freedom to marry was stripped from loving and committed same-sex couples . It is long past time for this ` gay exception ' to marriage in California to come to an end . ''

Last month , a federal appeals court in Massachusetts struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act -- the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage -- as unconstitutional . The issue before the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was whether the federal government could deny tax , health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry . The Massachusetts case could also soon be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court .

Currently , same-sex marriage is legal in six states : Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , Vermont , New Hampshire and New York , along with the District of Columbia . Washington and Maryland voted earlier this year to allow same-sex marriages , but the laws have not yet taken effect .

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also announced last month that it supports same-sex marriage .
