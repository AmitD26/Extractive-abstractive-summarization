-LRB- Financial Times -RRB- -- Three of the most powerful officials in Angola have held concealed interests in an oil venture with Cobalt International Energy , the Goldman Sachs-backed explorer whose operations in one of the world 's most promising energy frontiers are under investigation by US authorities , the Financial Times has learned .

Warning its shareholders that it might face liabilities under US anti-corruption laws , Houston-based Cobalt said in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice were investigating its Angolan operations .

The three men 's previously opaque shareholdings in Cobalt 's local partner could raise questions about compliance with US anti-corruption law , which makes it a crime to pay or offer anything of value to foreign officials to win business .

Manuel Vicente , who was the head of state-owned Sonangol until his appointment in January as minister of state for economic co-ordination , and General Manuel HÃ © lder Vieira Dias JÃºnior , known as Kopelipa , the head of the presidency 's military bureau , confirmed their holdings in Nazaki in near-identical letters .

They said their interests and those of General Leopoldino Fragoso do Nascimento were held through Grupo Aquattro Internacional . Aquattro is named as a Nazaki shareholder in two company documents from 2007 and 2010 obtained by the FT. They said Aquattro had been `` recently dissolved '' but did not say whether they had disposed of their interests in Nazaki .

Gen Fragoso do Nascimento , a former head of communications in the presidency , did not respond to requests for comment .

`` Cobalt has at all times complied fully with both US and Angolan laws , '' it said . Nazaki , which did not respond to a request for comment , denied the allegation , Cobalt said .
