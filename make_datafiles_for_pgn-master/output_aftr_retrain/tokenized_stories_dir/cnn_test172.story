-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three days after Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crash landed at San Francisco International Airport with the loss of two lives , there is still no official explanation for what caused the incident .

Who 's in charge of the investigation ?

In the United States , the National Transportation Safety Board -LRB- NTSB -RRB- is the government agency that investigates all major aviation accidents . Its purpose is to explain accidents and provide safety recommendations . Since it was formed in 1967 , the NTSB has completed more than 132,000 aviation accident investigations , with most taking weeks or even months to complete .

Did passengers ignore safety messages ?

What happens after a crash ?

In the exhaustive investigation that follows , all factors -- mechanical , operational , and human performance -- are taken into account . Here , the NTSB relies largely on other parties , including the airline involved , the aircraft 's manufacturer , and in the case of international flights , investigators from the airline 's home country , to help examine evidence .

In the case of Flight 214 , Asiana will be expected to provide `` whatever information is demanded of it , '' according to Ballantyne . Boeing will provide technical expertise during the examination of the aircraft , while South Korean investigators will offer insight from the Korean perspective , as well as assistance with translation -- especially when questioning passengers and crew .

`` The NTSB essentially acts as a coordinating body for other parties , '' explained Todd Curtis , a former Boeing air safety engineer . `` Everyone else is playing a support role . ''

Because of the large amount of evidence , the NTSB never speculates prematurely . `` First guesses are often wrong , '' said retired pilot Chesley `` Sully '' Sullenberger , who successfully ditched a U.S. Airways flight in New York 's Hudson River in 2009 after the aircraft was disabled when flying through a flock of geese . `` There are so many factors that could potentially impinge on this -- we do n't even know what they are yet , '' he cautioned .

What happens to the pilots after a crash ?

Although air crash investigations can seem a lot like the TV show `` CSI , '' though in the United States a crash is not legally considered a crime scene unless terrorism or sabotage is suspected early on . `` The pilot is free to go to his hotel after the crash , '' said Ballantyne . `` He will receive assistance from his airline and his pilot 's union . ''

Sullenberger said investigators will be looking at human factors , such as fatigue â € '' though he stressed it is far too early in the investigation to rule this in or out . `` When they landed in San Francisco at 11.30 in the morning , it was 3.30 am on their body clocks -- a low point of alertness . ''

The NTSB works quickly to interview survivors and eyewitnesses after a crash . `` These statements can corroborate flight data , and even fill in gaps , '' said Curtis .

Flight attendants hailed as heroes

How long until we find out what happened with Flight 214 ?

`` One way of describing this whole investigatory process is that these investigators are in charge of writing a non-fiction detective story that may take a year to complete . It may eventually have 1,000 pages . ''

But Sullenberger said investigators have `` a huge advantage '' in this case . `` The plane and most of its components have landed on an airport and are immediately accessible . It 's not on the floor of the south Atlantic like Air France 447 . They have the crew members who survived and are able to be interviewed ... It makes it much more likely that we will eventually find out exactly what happened , how it happened , and why it happened . ''

Curtis said he is also confident about the process .

`` So in this case , I 'm certain we 'll find everything we need for a definitive conclusion . They will have plenty of everything they need to get this thing done . ''
