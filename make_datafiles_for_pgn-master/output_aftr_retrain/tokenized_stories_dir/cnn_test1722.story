-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bill Haas should have spent Sunday celebrating a friend 's wedding . Instead he was toasting a fourth PGA Tour title after beating major champions Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley in a playoff to clinch the Northern Trust Open .

Haas , the 2011 FedEx Cup series victor , looked to have won the California tournament outright after shooting two-under-par 69 in his final round .

`` I 'm sure I 'll talk to him later and hopefully his day is even better than mine , '' the 29-year-old Haas told the PGA Tour 's official website when asked about missing friend Jon Hopson 's big day . `` It 's pretty sweet for both of us today .

`` I never expected to make a 40-footer , especially in that situation . A little luck was involved . I guess it was meant to be . ''

`` Bill hit a tremendous putt , '' the 41-year-old Mickelson said . `` We 're thinking it 's a very difficult three . It 's a defensive hole . You 're just trying to make four , believe it or not . ''

The 25-year-old Bradley added : `` I did n't think he was going to make that one . I should have known , though , because he 's a great putter and a great player . ''

Haas was battling a partisan crowd at the Riviera Country Club , with onlookers lending their backing to California native Mickelson -- a two-time winner of the event who was on a roll after clinching the AT&T National Pro-Am seven days before .

`` Honestly ` Phil ' sounds really similar to ` Bill , ' so you just kind of pretend that maybe they 're for you , '' said Haas . `` If I 'm at home , I 'm cheering for Phil . ''

Former world No. 2 Sergio Garcia carded a stunning 64 to finish tied for fourth on five under , level with 10th-ranked Dustin Johnson -LRB- 71 -RRB- , his fellow American Jimmy Walker -LRB- 69 -RRB- and New Zealand 's Jarrod Lyle -LRB- 70 -RRB- .
