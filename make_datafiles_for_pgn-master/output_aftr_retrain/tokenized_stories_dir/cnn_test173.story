`` People often call it the ` Marathon Church , ' '' said Taylor , a senior minister and CEO of the Old South Church in Boston , pointing to the brush of blue and yellow paint that spell out the word `` FINISH '' in bold letters on Boylston Street 's pavement outside .

The church 's Colonial-era congregation -- which included Ben Franklin and the Americans who first gathered to plan the Boston Tea Party -- is part of the legacy of a city propped up by its past . The church reopened Monday as authorities removed the last remaining barricades to restore a semblance of normal life .

A popular eatery called Forum , which sustained heavy damage , remains boarded up as workers in hazmat suits clean blood-stained floors and remove shattered glass windows .

`` It was thunderous , '' she recalled . The restaurant , a Boylston Street fixture , remains closed as a result of the blast .

By most accounts , many in Boston seem to have come to terms what transpired , though a once-distant perception of terror has now become more personally felt in the days since the attack .

`` There 's a pause and a fear , but we 're not going to be defeated by two punks , '' said Gerardo DeFaeritiis , whose shoe store reopened Monday after being part of a crime scene for the past week .

`` Like everything else , time is the best medicine . ''

Cleaning crews continue to mop up the remnants of glass and scattered debris , while painters splash green paint onto wrought iron gates and wooden moldings atop store fronts , blackened in last week 's attack .

Dolly Lakkis , who owns an eyeglass store on Bolyston Street , said that returning to work brought an eeriness accompanied by sadness . A floral memorial sits directly outside her window , where passersby come to pay their respects .

`` We 're ready to get back to normal , '' she said . `` We 're not going to sit back and take it . ''

That sense of resiliency also seems inextricable from the city 's history . Even younger residents drop off-the-cuff references to figures like Paul Revere in their casual bar-room banter .

`` This is not a young city , '' Nancy Taylor said . `` We 've been tried and tested over centuries . We 've been through wars . We 've been through witch trials . So it 's not as if we have n't seen horror before . ''

Her stone church looms almost directly over the marathon finish line , where its 19th-century spire is a welcome sight to runners , signaling their 26.2-mile trek is nearly over .

Up until last week , the church had been shuttered only once in its history , which dates back to America 's first European settlers .

`` We were taken over by the British , who were a little upset with us because we dumped their tea , '' said Taylor , describing the only other time the church formally closed in 1775 .

From her vantage point view atop the church 's 246-foot campanile , she witnessed the clouds of smoke and debris that filled Boylston Street after the blasts .

`` One of most extraordinary things was watching people down on the ground sorting themselves out , '' she said . `` Some people were running literally towards the danger to help people out .

Now , residents who were directly and indirectly affected by the attack are returning to Old South Church looking for ways to cope with their trauma .

`` I do n't know what to expect , '' said the longtime member of the Old South Church . `` I have nightmares . I have flashbacks . ''

But for the moment , a lingering trauma has left him still wary of public places .

`` I actually turned down four wonderful Red Sox tickets for Saturday night because I 'm not sure that I 'm ready for an open-air crowd just yet , '' he said . `` I 'd have no idea who 's sitting next to me or behind me . ''

After visiting Fenway Park `` hundreds of times before , '' he 's just going to wait .
