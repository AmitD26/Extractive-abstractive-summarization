The public aspect of the visits should go smoothly enough . Nobody has a stake in upsetting an American Secretary of State . . Election year politics will diminish any unpleasantness in Israel , and even in Egypt , where the secretary should deliver some tough messages on the need to create and respect democratic principles , nobody really wants a fight .

But not so far beneath the surface , agendas diverge and challenges abound for an America that 's no longer as admired , feared or respected as much as it needs to be in a region critical to its national interests . Here 's a guide to some of them :

The good news , of course , is that for the first time in 40 years , Egypt has competitive politics ; the bad news is that the most anti-democratic and exclusive forces in the country are the ones who are competing .

Clinton will find herself sandwiched between Islamists she does n't trust and whose values are n't her own , and generals she believes have subverted Egypt 's nascent democracy but are necessary to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel .

Navigating this course wo n't be easy . The meeting with Egypt 's President Mohamed Morsy will carry great symbolism : the United States sanctioning the rise of political Islam in the Arab world 's most important country . Although Clinton can rationalize she is meeting the democratically elected president of Egypt , Morsy is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , whose views on issues such as female genital mutilation , women 's rights , peace with Israel and U.S. policies throughout the region diverge from hers , and America 's .

The meeting with the generals wo n't be much easier . The Obama administration believes that the military -- not the Brotherhood -- has been mainly responsible for subverting the democratic process , and yet it 's really hard-pressed to do much about it .

Peace process : Clinton 's lack of leverage in Egypt will be mirrored in Israel . Israel 's focus on domestic issues such as the military conscription law and election politics in the U.S. will ensure that the Obama administration will not seriously push the revival of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations .

Once upon a time , visits by secretaries of state to these countries really mattered . Not so much anymore . The Middle East has gotten a lot more complicated , and the locals act increasingly without reference to what America thinks or does . It may not be pretty to watch , but we better get used to it .

The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller .
