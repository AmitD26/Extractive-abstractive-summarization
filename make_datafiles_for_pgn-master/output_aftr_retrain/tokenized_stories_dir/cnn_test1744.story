Istanbul -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The American exploration vessel `` Nautilus '' was supposed to begin broadcasting its undersea archeological and environmental exploration of the Black Sea July 7 , according to the expedition 's Facebook page .

Instead , two days before the launch date , the ship was in Syrian territorial waters in the eastern Mediterranean Sea , assisting with the recovery of the bodies of two Turkish pilots killed when their reconnaissance jet was shot down by Syrian anti-aircraft defenses .

The military search and recovery operation marked an unexpected change of course for a research expedition led by Robert Ballard , the undersea explorer who gained fame for discovering the wreckage of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean in the 1980s .

`` When this incident happened , we immediately looked into our resources , including the military and private sector , '' Unal said .

But he added that few governments or corporations had submersibles capable of traveling to depths of more than 1,000 meters .

`` E/V Nautilus is a 211-foot research vessel equipped with state-of-the-art exploration and telepresence technology , '' said a statement on the expedition 's official website . `` Our rotating Corps of Exploration aboard Nautilus will be mapping the geological , biological , archaeological and chemical aspects of these regions to depths of approximately 2,000 meters . ''

The website also said the Nautilus was equipped with several remotely operated vehicles -LRB- ROVs -RRB- that typically worked at extreme depths .

Turkish officials say the Nautilus is effectively under Turkish military command while participating in the recovery operation .

`` We ca n't risk anything , '' Unal said . `` As part of our agreement , there are still people as we speak from my ministry and from the navy and Turkish air force for coordination purposes on board the Nautilus . ''

Scientists at the expedition 's command center on the campus of the University of Rhode Island also said they could not comment on the emergency operation , though one scientist told a colleague that after the unexpected delay , he was `` eager to get back to doing science '' as soon as possible .

These photos could hold valuable evidence about what weapon was used to shoot down the jet . The Syrian government insists anti-aircraft cannons brought the jet down when it flew within sight of the Syrian coast .

Turkey says the jet was flying 13 nautical miles off the Syrian shore , in international airspace , when it was struck by a Syrian surface-to-air missile . Syria 's president suggested the military may have thought it was a plane belonging to Israel .
