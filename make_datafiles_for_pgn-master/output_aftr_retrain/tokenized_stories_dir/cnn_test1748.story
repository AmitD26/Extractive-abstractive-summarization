`` Contracts are contracts , '' Board of Trustees Chair Karen Peetz said Friday during a trustee meeting in Scranton , Pennsylvania . `` And no there 's no plan to -LRB- change -RRB- that . ''

Ten months later , Sandusky was arrested . He was convicted last month of sexually abusing children over a 15-year period , with much of the abuse occurring on the Penn State campus .

According to the university website , Paterno 's amended contract was finalized in August 2011 and totaled $ 5.5 million in payouts and benefits , which included a $ 3 million bonus and title as head football coach emeritus if he retired at the end of the 2011 season .

Both former university President Graham Spanier and former Vice President Gary Schultz were involved in the renegotiation , while the board of trustees as a whole had been left out of the loop until November when Sandusky was arrested , a source told CNN . Spanier was fired after the grand jury presentment against Sandusky came to light while Schultz was charged along with former Athletics Director Tim Curley with lying to a grand jury and failure to report suspected child abuse .

After being `` bombarded with hate mail and threatened with a defamation lawsuit '' following Paterno 's firing over the scandal , the board eventually approved Paterno 's new contract , according to The New York Times , which first reported the story .

`` Board members who raised questions about whether the university ought to go forward with the payments were quickly shut down , '' the newspaper reported .

Paterno also could have stopped the attacks had he done more , Freeh concluded .

Wick Sollers , a lawyer for the Paterno family , could not be immediately reached for comment Saturday .

The former head coach died of lung cancer in January at the age of 85 .

On Saturday , a halo that had been painted above Paterno after he died was removed from a State College , Pennsylvania , mural titled `` Inspire . ''

Meanwhile , Sandusky is awaiting sentencing on his abuse convictions .
