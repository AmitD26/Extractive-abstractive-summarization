Victoria Nuland , a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department , said `` two U.S. personnel and two Pakistani staff of the Consulate were injured and are receiving medical treatment . '' No U.S. consular employees were killed , she said .

Nuland 's statement followed an assertion by local Information Minister Iftikhar Hussain that two Americans had died in the blast .

Umar Riaz , a senior Peshawar police official , said the U.S. consular security detail surrounded the vehicle , which was severely damaged , and took away the people who 'd been traveling in it .

As a result , Riaz said , he had no information about the people who were in the consular vehicle .

`` Let me just very clearly condemn the attack on our consulate personnel in Peshawar , Pakistan . We pray for the safe recovery of both American and Pakistani victims and once again we deplore the cowardly act of suicide bombing and terrorism , '' she said .

Clinton praised the response of Pakistani authorities , saying some of the injured were airlifted to hospitals in Islamabad .

Peshawar is about 190 kilometers -LRB- 120 miles -RRB- from the country 's capital , Islamabad .

In April 2010 , three explosions went off in rapid succession near the consulate .

It was formerly known as North West Frontier province , a name assigned during British colonial rule . The ruling party changed the name to reflect the province 's majority Pashtun population .
