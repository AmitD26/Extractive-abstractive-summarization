-LRB- Financial Times -RRB- -- Lambeth Palace has ordered an independent inquiry into investments made by the Church of England 's £ 5.2 bn investment fund after the Financial Times revealed that it had indirectly invested in Wonga , the payday lender .

The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was `` embarrassed '' and `` irritated '' that the Church Commissioners had indirectly invested in Wonga , the payday lending firm that he has vowed to `` compete out '' of business by encouraging credit unions to be set up in churches across the country .

In an interview with the BBC 's Today programme on Friday morning , Justin Welby said that the amount of Church money indirectly invested in Wonga was about £ 75,000 out of investments totalling £ 5.2 bn .

The church , which claims to have a strong ethical investment policy that explicitly bans companies involved in payday lending , invests in Accel Partners , the US venture capital firm that led Wonga 's 2009 fundraising .

When asked if capitalism was amoral , he said : `` I do n't think capitalism is necessarily amoral , it can sometimes be immoral but it is not of itself immoral . ''

`` The 25 % figure is exactly the same for pornography , gambling ... in armaments it 's 10 per cent . They 've gone down a route to maximise their profits ; they 're absolutely explicit that they want to make 5 per cent above the rate of inflation . ''

`` I said to him quite bluntly we 're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence , we 're trying to compete you out of existence , '' said the Archbishop .

The Church 's plan revolves around opening its network of 15,000 church premises to existing credit unions and offering volunteers to help run them .

The Church has played an increasingly active role in the debate over ethical banking in recent months , both as an investor and because Archbishop Welby was an outspoken member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards .
