The searches were connected to a big police operation Saturday targeting radical Islamists suspected of involvement with the bombing of a Jewish supermarket in September .

Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Wednesday that the 12 suspects in custody would be detained for an additional 24 hours . Normally French authorities can only hold suspects for 96 hours before they must press charges or release them .

Police who searched premises in Torcy , about 25 kilometers -LRB- 16 miles -RRB- east of Paris , overnight Tuesday found bags of potassium nitrate , sulfur , saltpeter , pressure cookers and headlight bulbs , all items useful in making homemade explosives , Molins said in a statement .

A shotgun and handgun were also found , he said . The search continued Wednesday morning .

The premises where the alleged explosives components were found are used by the same person at whose address a list of Jewish organizations was found by police Saturday , Molins said .

However , police inquiries suggest that two people suspected of throwing a grenade through the window of the Jewish supermarket in Sarcelles , a Paris suburb , may still be at large , he said .

This step is allowed under French law if there is a serious risk of an imminent terrorist threat , and can be renewed once , leading to a maximum possible period of detention without charge of six days . It is only the second time this provision has been used since it came into law in 2006 , he said .

The suspects are being held on suspicion of having links to terrorism , manufacturing deadly explosives , illegal possession of weapons and attempted homicide of police officers .

Three of them have criminal records for drug trafficking , theft or violence , Molins told reporters Saturday . One man who was arrested on top of a building in Torcy on Saturday was armed with a loaded .22-caliber pistol , Molins said .

French intelligence operatives had been monitoring him since spring -- well before the Sarcelles attack -- but he had not been questioned by authorities , Molins said .
