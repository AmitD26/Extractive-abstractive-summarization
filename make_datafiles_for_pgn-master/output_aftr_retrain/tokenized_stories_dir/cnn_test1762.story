-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sometimes life can turn on a dime . Just ask Richard Eggers , a former Wells Fargo employee .

`` It was silly and stupid , '' Eggers told CNN affiliate KCCI-TV . `` I am not terribly proud of it , but , it does n't warrant a termination a half a century later . ''

Wells Fargo says it 's following federal laws laid down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act -LRB- FDIC -RRB- . They 're designed to weed out employees guilty of identity theft and mortgage fraud .

Wells Fargo says between May 2011 and May 2012 , it performed thorough background checks on all its team members , regardless of when they were hired . The screenings were the same as those required for new hires .

Wells Fargo says Eggers has been put in touch with an FDIC case manager to work on steps to `` make him eligible for reemployment . ''

Leonard Bates , an attorney representing Eggers and three other employees who used to work for the company , said he may file a class action lawsuit against Wells Fargo and the FDIC .

`` Common sense tells you that Mr. Eggers and his 49-year-old crime was not the downfall of the mortgage industry in 2008 and 2009 , '' Bates told KCCI .
