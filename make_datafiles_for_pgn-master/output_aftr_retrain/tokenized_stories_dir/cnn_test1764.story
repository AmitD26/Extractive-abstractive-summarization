LeMond called on McQuaid and his predecessor -- honorary UCI president Hein Verbruggen -- to quit , insisting that progress in the sport can only be made if they step aside .

`` I want to tell the world of cycling to please join me in telling Pat McQuaid to resign , '' he wrote . `` I have never seen such an abuse of power in cycling 's history -- resign Pat if you love cycling . Resign even if you hate the sport .

`` The sport does not need Pat McQuaid or Hein Verbruggen -- if this sport is going to change it is now . Not next year , not down the road , now ! Now or never ! ''

The UCI refused to comment on LeMond 's statement when contacted by CNN . The Union is preparing for a meeting on Friday during which it will discuss possible reforms in the wake of the Armstrong scandal .

McQuaid has insisted a $ 100,000 donation from Armstrong to the UCI in 2002 , revealed in USADA 's report , was not part of a cover-up .

But LeMond insists McQuaid is a barrier to change within the sport , and he called on people to donate to a fund to help Kimmage fight his legal battle with the UCI , who he accused of corruption .

`` People that really care about cycling have the power to change cycling -- change it now by voicing your thought and donating money towards Paul Kimmage 's defense .

`` If people really want to clean the sport of cycling up all you have to do is put your money where your mouth is . ''

`` It 's up to the UCI to look at the sport , look at team structures , look at race structures and try to create an environment for this to not happen again , '' McQuaid said in quotes reported by the AFP news agency .

`` We want to take what we can learn from it and put in place measures to make sure it does n't happen again . ''

McQuaid hinted the UCI might ask teams that participate in cycling 's main competitions to donate more money to the anti-doping fight .

He also suggested the UCI will acquiesce to the Tour de France 's wish not to reassign Armstrong 's seven consecutive victories between 1999-2005 after it was described as a `` lost decade '' by race organizer Christian Prudhomme .

`` It 's up to us to come out of this affair and show everyone that we do see this as a crisis but also as an opportunity , because there is a danger that it could have a fatal effect on the sport , and I do n't want that to happen , '' McQuaid added .

Sky have asked their staff to sign a statement declaring they have had no previous involvement in doping but Julich , who was a teammate of Armstrong in 1995 and 1996 , has admitted to using the blood-boosting agent EPO as a rider .

`` Bobby has shown courage in admitting to the errors he made long before his time with Team Sky , '' Team Principal Dave Brailsford said on the team 's official website .

Is it possible to stop cheating in sports ?
