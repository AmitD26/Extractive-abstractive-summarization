-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On a day of national celebration in Pakistan , the country 's cricket team provided the perfect present for Quaid Day by defeating archrival India in its Twenty20 encounter in Bangalore , India .

The Quaid-e-Azam was the man who helped secure the formation of the state of Pakistan on August 14 , 1947 , and went on to become the nation 's first ever governor general .

`` It is a gift for the whole nation , it is Quaid day back home , '' said Hafeez following his team 's five-wicket victory .

But Shoaib Malik , who is married to Indian tennis star Sania Mirza , hit 57 from 50 balls , which included a giant six to win the game .

It was a game which India had looked set to run away with as openers Gautam Gambhir -LRB- 43 -RRB- and Ajinkya Rahane -LRB- 42 -RRB- put on 77 for the opening wicket .

But a huge collapse , which accounted for nine wickets and just 47 runs , allowed Pakistan back into the contest .

Umar Gul took 3-21 and Saaed Ajmal 2-25 as India finished on 133-9 from its 20 overs .

India 's low total looked less than formidable but an early crisis almost left Pakistan facing an embarrassing defeat .

Bhuvneshwar Kumar produced a blistering spell on debut , taking 3-9 as the top order was ripped apart .

It was only when Malik and Hafeez finally got themselves into the contest with a 106-run partnership that Pakistan finally looked to threaten .

When Hafeez fell for 61 , the tourist needed 16 from the remaining 17 deliveries to win .

And despite a few nervous moments , it was left to Malik to seal victory , smashing the ball for six with three balls to go before sparking scenes of celebrations amongst his teammates .
