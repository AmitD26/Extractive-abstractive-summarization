The question is which of these descriptions of Kim Dotcom , the founder of the shuttered file-sharing website Megaupload , is closer to the truth ?

Megaupload 's lawyers denied the charges , and online activists have rallied to the site 's defense .

As he sits in jail awaiting an extradition hearing in the coming months , attention has focused on the extravagant lifestyle he appears to have enjoyed .

The U.S. authorities say Megaupload generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships .

Judge D.J. McNaughton denied Dotcom bail and offered insights into his different descriptions .

He has prior convictions from 1998 related to computer hacking , from 2003 for insider trading in Germany and from 2011 for failure to disclose the number of shares he acquired in Hong Kong .

Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand , where he employs more than 50 staff , and Hong Kong , where he has a suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel .

His lawyer , Paul Davison , argued the facts demonstrate his commitment to staying in New Zealand , where he obtained residency status in December 2009 . But prosecutors and the judge have expressed concern that if Dotcom were able to make his way to Germany , his German nationality would make him immune from extradition proceedings .

In his judgment Wednesday , McNaughton said he could not exclude the possibility that with his `` business effectively shut down in the United States and his bank accounts and assets frozen and facing prosecution on serious charges with the full weight of the United States government behind it '' that Dotcom `` may take whatever money is still available to him and run to safe haven in Germany . ''

The judge also expressed concern about the existence of a firearm found near Dotcom at the time of his arrest last week .

When the police entered the inner room , they found Dotcom sitting cross-legged on the floor and `` a loaded shotgun in a nearby safe . ''

Dotcom has admitted he does n't hold a firearm license but says he was intending to apply for one . His lawyer argued that the presence of guns on the property was a precautionary measure because his wife is from the Philippines where the kidnapping of wealthy individuals or their children is a common occurrence .
