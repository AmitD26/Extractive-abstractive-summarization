Clemons died at a hospital in Palm Beach , Florida , where he was undergoing treatment after suffering a stroke last Sunday , said a spokesperson for Springsteen and the E Street Band . His fifth wife , Victoria , and other family members were at his side when he died , according to the spokesperson .

`` His loss is immeasurable and we are honored and thankful to have known him and had the opportunity to stand beside him for nearly 40 years , '' Springsteen said in a statement posted on the band 's website . `` He was my great friend , my partner , and with Clarence at my side , my band and I were able to tell a story far deeper than those simply contained in our music . His life , his memory , and his love will live on in that story and in our band . ''

His influence could also be seen in Springsteen 's live shows , where the two men routinely bantered about their beginnings , their life on the road and their music .

The story of their first meeting is musical lore .

As the story goes , Springsteen was performing when howling winds blew the door off . Springsteen was startled by the 6-foot , 4-inch towering figure of Clemons , who invited himself onstage to play .

`` From the first time we saw each other , we stayed together for two weeks , '' Clemons told CNN in 2009 while promoting his pseudo-memoir `` Big Man : Real Life & Tall Tales . ''

Clemons was born in 1942 in Virginia and began playing the saxophone by age 9 . He moved to New Jersey , where he worked as a youth counselor , before joining Springsteen 's E Street Band .

Clemons , whose fusing of blues , jazz and funk with rock on the saxophone put him in demand , recorded with a number of artists over the years , including Aretha Franklin and the Grateful Dead .

Clemons , who was dubbed `` Big Man '' by friends because of his height , made his last musical appearance in May when he took the stage with Lady Gaga on Fox 's `` American Idol '' to perform `` The Edge of Glory . ''

As word of his death spread Saturday night , fans , musical contemporaries and even politicians took to Twitter and Facebook to remember Clemons .

`` RIP CC , you were the heart and soul of the E Street Band . Thank you for all the music , you got me through some dark days . Blessings on your journey , '' one post read .

`` I just ca n't imagine that space on stage not being occupied by the big man . We are all better people having been moved by your huge music . Now go play with Louis , Miles and the rest and have a blast , '' read another .
