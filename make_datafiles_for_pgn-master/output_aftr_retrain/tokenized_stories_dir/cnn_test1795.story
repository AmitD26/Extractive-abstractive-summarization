Beatrice Munyenyezi , 43 , had her citizenship revoked and will face sentencing in June for two counts of lying on U.S. government applications , authorities said .

Munyenyezi , who was not on trial for war crimes , was found guilty of intentionally lying on a refugee questionnaire and naturalization documents about her role in the infamous slaughter in which ethnic Hutu militants butchered their Tutsi counterparts over a three-month period .

Prosecutors argued that Munyenyezi , a Hutu , was a member of an extremist group associated with a paramilitary organization that set up roadblocks and targeted fleeing Tutsis and their sympathizers .

The mother of three is thought to be married to former militia leader Arsene Shalom Ntahobali , who was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to life in prison last year . She is thought to have lived in the hotel and helped pick out those who arrived at a nearby checkpoint to be executed or raped .

Her attorney , David Ruoff , said they would appeal the decision .
