NEW HAVEN , Connecticut -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` We worked hard to get it and we 're going to keep it , '' said Nancy Snyder , one of the protesters attending this summer 's health care town meetings .

Nancy and her husband Robert , retirees from Philipsburg , Pennsylvania , showed up at a town hall held by Sen. Arlen Specter , in State College , Pennsylvania , with signs condemning socialist takeover of their health care , and she was interviewed by Michel Martin on National Public Radio 's `` Tell Me More . ''

When asked how she had insurance coverage , Nancy explained that because her husband was a retired coal miner , they received insurance and care through the United Mine Workers . She attended the town hall because she said she had `` had enough of the government interfering with our lives , after working hard all of our lives , especially to get the health care . ''

In April 1946 , John L. Lewis , leader of the UMW , led the coal miners out on strike around a pioneering demand : employer contributions to a union health and welfare fund . Miners had long suffered debilitating health problems and notorious medical neglect in camps and towns run by authoritarian mine companies . For Lewis , changing the balance of power between workers and owners necessitated independent and guaranteed health security , but the mine owners had no intention of settling .

The Social Security Administration provided technical assistance in designing the union-run welfare program . The settlement was industry-wide , regardless of company , thus equalizing the sharing of risk and the benefits of `` social '' insurance .

The Social Security Administration and the Public Health Service recruited staff for the UMW program . Physicians , public health experts , and industrial health experts came from the Public Health Service and the Farm Security Administration . The FSA had successfully run rural medical programs during the 1930s and World War II . Through the fund , UMW built a network of well equipped , modern hospitals , bringing about a major improvement in living standards .

As employment declined and mining families struggled in the 1960s , mineworkers launched widespread protest demonstrations and traveled to Washington to lobby for federal support of UMW hospitals . Presidents Kennedy and Johnson responded with the Area Redevelopment Administration , the 1964 Economic Opportunity Act , the Appalachian Redevelopment Act , and of course , Medicare .

Government stabilized and expanded the miners ' health system . Miners were proud beneficiaries of Johnson 's Great Society -- today so much maligned by the conservative talk show hosts . Miners continued their pressure , leading to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , marshalling public force to protect their health in the private workplace .

If Nancy Snyder `` did not pay one penny '' for her husband 's cancer treatment or her surgeries , it 's because government subsidized that care since Robert 's early days as a miner .

The thousands of people who poured into the Remote Area Medical care emergency clinic on one August weekend in Virginia have no health insurance . They are suffering like the miners of 80 years ago . Who will tip the balance of power again in their favor ?

The only moments when health security has been achieved in America are those founded on a partnership between empowered citizens and the federal government .

It 's been the American way all along .
