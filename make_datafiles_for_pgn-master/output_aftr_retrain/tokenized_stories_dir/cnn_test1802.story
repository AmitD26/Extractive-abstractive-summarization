Officials are worried that the high water may damage the bridge and are removing steel canopy shades authorities believe add weight and stress to the span , the spokeswoman told CNN .

Officials expect the bridge to be closed for at least three days , Mora Garcia said .

A second crossing , the Colombia Bridge , was closed because the water is cresting there at a higher level , Mora Garcia said . The bridge will be closed until further notice .

It will take about a day to remove the canopies at International Bridge I and another day to reinstall them after the high waters subside , Mora Garcia said .

About 10,000 to 12,000 pedestrians and 12,000 to 14,000 noncommercial vehicles cross International Bridge I each day , Mora Garcia said .

Laredo has a population of about 250,000 , but that typically swells to 350,000 to 400,000 as Mexicans come to the city to shop , visit family or engage in recreational activities , the spokeswoman said . The city is the nation 's No. 1 inland port , Mora Garcia said .

International Bridge II and the World Trade Bridge will remain open . Laredo owns and operates the four bridges , Mora Garcia said .

In addition , buses from Nuevo Laredo will be transporting would-be pedestrians back and forth over Bridge II over the vehicle-only bridge . The arrangement was made between U.S. and Mexican officials and will remain in effect for the duration of the emergency situation , Mora Garcia said .

Laredo was planning to open its emergency operation center Wednesday afternoon . Residents in the 100-year floodplain will be notified to evacuate if necessary , officials said .

The Laredo Civic Center can be converted into a shelter , the city said .

Water service in Laredo will not be affected , but residents in Nuevo Laredo may have water service at 50 percent of the city 's operating capacity , Laredo officials said .

In the city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state , on the border with Texas , 23,000 people were in danger Wednesday because of flooding by the Rio Bravo , the government-run Notimex news agency said .
