-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. team led by envoy Robert King left North Korea on Saturday after winning the release of an American citizen who had been detained there , state media reported .

Jun , a Korean-American businessman , was detained for `` committing a crime '' against North Korea after entering the country , KCNA had reported .

Jun admitted his crime during an investigation , the North Korean news agency said , but it did not specify what crime he had allegedly committed .

His release follows a visit by King , the special envoy for North Korean human rights , and Jon Brause , from the U.S. Agency for International Development . The group went there to assess food shortages that have left thousands starving after floods and harsh weather devastated North Korea 's crops .

The news agency also said former President Jimmy Carter asked North Korea to pardon Jun. .

In King 's discussions with his North Korean interlocutors , Toner said , King conveyed deep concern over the welfare of an American citizen in their custody , but said the purpose of King 's visit was not related to the release of Jun. .

`` It 's important to note and to clearly state that any decisions about food aid are not related in any way to any policy decisions if you will . It 's a separate process all together , '' Toner said Friday .

The assessment team traveling with King will continue its work on the ground and `` when they come back , we will look at their assessments , study it and compare to other assessments by other NGOs , '' and groups that have made similar trips , to make a decision on the amount of aid to extend , Toner said .

It was not known exactly when Jun would leave North Korea , but Toner said he would not be traveling with King .

`` There are a number of things we would like to see North Korea do in improving relations with South Korea first and foremost before we see other steps on other issues , '' Toner said .

The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February , despite North Korea 's warning to the South not to carry them out -- calling the exercises a provocation .

The U.S. suspended aid two years ago to North Korea because it suspected the donated food was being diverted to the military or not reaching those most in need .

North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years , increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington .

In 2010 , Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes , a U.S. citizen who was fined about $ 600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea . Gomes , who attempted suicide while in North Korean custody , was thought to be a Christian activist .

Two American journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , were arrested after entering North Korea in 2009 . They were sentenced to 12 years hard labor before being released in August 2009 after an intervention by former President Bill Clinton .
