-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Large swaths of southern New South Wales in Australia were threatened Wednesday by raging flames , the severity of which has surprised even veteran firefighters .

`` It 's about the worst I 've ever experienced in just-on 60 years of firefighting , '' said Capt. Jim Simpson with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service .

Thanks to firefighters like Simpson , the town of Tarcutta in southwestern New South Wales escaped by a whisker the fate suffered by Frith 's sheep . A blackened line stops just outside the town of 200 residents .

`` The wind change is probably what saved us as well as some pretty hard work from a lot of crews , '' said one firefighter .

There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries related to the fires , which have blackened 350,000 hectares -LRB- more than 1,350 square miles -RRB- of the state . One firefighter received slight injuries to his hands and face , firefighter Matt Inwood told CNN Wednesday . `` The next step in all this is for us to take stock of the devastation and destruction , '' Inwood said .

The average maximum daily temperature of 40.33 degrees Celsius -LRB- 104 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- recorded on Monday was the highest since December 1972 . And during the last four months of 2012 , average maximum daily temperatures were the highest on record since records began in 1910 , the bureau said .

Temperatures reached a peak of 43 degrees Celsius -LRB- 109 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- in Sydney on Tuesday . The intense heat , combined with strong winds , raised fears that even the smallest spark could be fanned into a blaze .

Lower temperatures on Wednesday prompted authorities to rescind a `` catastrophic warning , '' but the risk was still deemed `` severe '' in the northeast section of New South Wales . Higher temperatures are forecast for the weekend .

Fires erupted this week in Victoria as well .
