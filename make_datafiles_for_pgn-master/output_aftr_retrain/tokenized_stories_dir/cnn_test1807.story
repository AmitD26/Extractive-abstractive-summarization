Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A new political reality hits Washington next week , with the first split Congress since 2002 raising questions about whether the bipartisan cooperation of the recently concluded lame-duck session can continue .

Conventional wisdom says the shift from one party controlling both chambers , as Democrats have done since 2006 , to the GOP taking over the House and holding a stronger minority stake in the Senate means increased partisan impasse over the next two years .

But that same conventional wisdom got turned on its head after November 2 , when the electoral `` shellacking '' delivered to President Barack Obama and the Democrats was followed by one of the most productive post-election congressional conclusions in history .

`` There was a responsibility of government that I think the Republicans got in the November elections and they began to understand that responsibility a little bit more in this lame-duck session than they had in the previous , quite frankly , 18 months or so , '' Gibbs said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''

Republicans can no longer afford to `` simply sit and say no , '' Gibbs said , referring to the obstructive posture that GOP leaders generally struck in Obama 's first two years in office . Instead , he called for Republicans to be part of a constructive conversation , at least in 2011 before the presidential campaign of 2012 really heats up .

Some liberals accused Obama of giving in too easily to Republican demands on some issues , particularly in cutting a deal that extended Bush-era tax cuts to everyone after Obama had campaigned on allowing tax rates of the wealthy to return to higher levels .

The tax deal , while giving Republicans the extended cuts they wanted as well as a lower estate tax than scheduled , also provided extended jobless benefits and other tax credits sought by Obama and Democrats , Jarrett noted .

`` We ca n't ignore the realities of the membership and the makeup of Congress and the fact that we are going to need bipartisan support to get things done , '' Jarrett said .

The tax deal was followed by congressional approval of a series of Democratic-supported measures that had been held up by Republican opposition , including a major nuclear arms treaty with Russia and the repeal of the `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy banning openly gay and lesbian service members from the military .

A sweeping deficit reduction plan devised by a bipartisan commission appointed by Obama recommended spending cuts , tax increases , adjustments to Social Security and other proposals normally considered politically taboo . The plan won approval from a majority of the panel numbers , but lacked enough support to require a congressional vote on it .

The tax deal means that hundreds of billions of dollars that would have been raised in higher income taxes and expired tax cuts will instead get spent in the economy , Coburn noted .

`` So I think there is no problem that we could cut $ 100 or $ 200 billion and start making a down payment and come to an agreement '' on deficit reduction , Coburn said . `` There does n't have to be a standoff . What there has to be is real leadership and recognizing the serious nature and the urgency of our problem . ''

He rejected criticism by fellow conservatives for supporting the deficit reduction plan of the bipartisan commission , which included increased tax revenue rejected by many on the political right .

Jarrett indicated Obama sought a middle road , noting he had shown his willingness to work with Republicans but also would `` fight very hard '' for eventually ending the lower tax rates for the wealthiest Americans .

Throughout his presidency , she noted , Obama had taken necessary steps -- `` some of them unpopular '' -- to deal with the financial crisis he faced on taking office and now to reach the tax compromise .
