Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- North Korea said Tuesday that it would release an unspecified number of prisoners in February to mark the birthdays of the two dictators who ruled the reclusive nation for a total of more than 60 years .

The amnesty of `` convicts , '' ordered by a parliamentary decree , will begin February 1 , the state-run Korean Central News Agency -LRB- KCNA -RRB- reported .

KCNA said the move ties in with the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung , the revered founder of North Korea who ran the country between 1945 and 1994 , and the 70th birthday of his son , Kim Jong Il , who succeeded him and remained in power until his death last month .

North Korea tends to grant amnesties to prisoners at five-year intervals after an important date , like the founding of the Korean Workers ' Party , according to Park In-ho , the president of Daily NK , an internet news company that monitors developments in North Korea from Seoul .

But the centennial of Kim Il Sung 's birthday , for which huge commemorations are expected , could result in a particularly large release of prisoners , Park said .

In any year , Kim Il Sung 's birthday on April 15 , known as the `` Day of the Sun , '' is one of the biggest dates in the North Korean calendar . His 100th birthday , combined with the 70th anniversary of the birth of Kim Jong Il on February 16 , is likely to considerably intensify the regime 's commemorative efforts .
