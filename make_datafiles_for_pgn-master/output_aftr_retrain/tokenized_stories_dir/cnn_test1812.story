London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will cut short his trip to South Africa to deal with the nation 's phone-hacking scandal , his office confirmed Monday -- another day of dizzying developments that also saw a second top police official resign and the announcement of a broader police corruption probe .

It has led to the resignations of the commissioner and assistant commissioner of London 's Metropolitan Police , known as Scotland Yard , forced the closure of one of the country 's best-selling newspapers and resulted in 10 arrests . Among those arrested is Rebekah Brooks , the former News of the World editor and News International executive who resigned after the scandal broke .

It also forced the resignation of Coulson , who quit as Cameron 's communications director in January as the scandal began to heat up . Coulson was News of the World editor when one of the newspaper 's reporters and a private investigator were sent to prison after pleading guilty to phone hacking in 2007 .

`` I do n't think anybody anticipated that it would snowball in this fairly dramatic way , '' said Jef McAllister , a London-based lawyer and former bureau chief for Time Magazine .

May said she would ask Her Majesty 's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine `` instances of undue influence , inappropriate contractual relationships and other abuses of power . '' The inspectorate is a division of the Home Office that inspects and reviews police forces in Britain to ensure they operate according to standards .

The allegations are part of a widening scandal that began with revelations that journalists working for the News of the World newspaper had eavesdropped on the phone of a missing girl , Milly Dowler , and deleted some of her messages to make room for more . She was later found dead .

Already , Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson has resigned on Sunday and the assistant commissioner , John Yates , on Monday after being caught up in the scandal .

He was due to be suspended when he quit , the Metropolitan Police Authority said . He denied Monday he had done anything wrong , saying in a prepared statement that he feared the scandal and allegations against him would be a distraction as London prepares to host the 2012 summer Olympics .

`` I carry ultimate responsibility for the position we find ourselves in , '' Stephenson told reporters . `` With hindsight , I wish we had judged some matters involved in this affair differently . I did n't and that 's it . ''

Stephenson stressed Sunday that he had behaved ethically , but decided to resign because increased scrutiny may burden his department and detract from its accomplishments . He also denied Wallis , who was arrested in the probe , was involved in phone hacking when he was brought on as a consultant .

Such denials , though , did n't halt the Independent Police Complaints Commission from announcing Monday that Yates and Stephenson are among four current or former senior London police officials it has been asked to investigate .

The commission said it will look into Stephenson 's overall role in the initial investigation into phone hacking , as well as that of two other unnamed officers .

`` Mr. Speaker , there is nothing more important than the public 's trust in the police to do their work without fear or favor , '' she said .

Parliament is set to meet Tuesday , when hearings scheduled on the scandal . Brooks is due to appear alongside Murdoch and his son James , a News Corporation executive . Earlier Monday , a spokesman for Brooks said the former editor 's Sunday arrest by police would not interfere with her plans to testify . She was released on bail until October , police and her spokesman , David Wilson , said .

Brooks ' lawyer , Steven Parkinson , said Monday she is not guilty of any crime . He warned that police need to consider the damage they had inflicted on her reputation after arresting her and questioning her for nine hours , but not putting any charges or documents before her .

Her husband got swept up in the scandal Monday , with the allegation he 'd been trying to discard evidence after investigators found a bag in a trash bin near the couple 's house . Brooks ' spokesman , David Wilson , told CNN the bag had been brought there by a friend of Brooks ' husband , Charlie Brooks , before being tossed by a cleaner or security guard .

Wilson said he and three others in the apartment building were looking for the bag when police arrived , hoping to collect it . The spokesman insisted that authorities would discover quickly that the material inside the bag is irrelevant to the investigation and `` has nothing to do with Rebekah . ''

Brooks , who resigned Friday as chief executive of News International , is one of 10 people arrested in connection with the phone-hacking probe and the fourth arrested in the bribery investigation , according to police .

News Corporation itself got hacked late Monday , when the hacker group LulzSec claimed credit for targeting The Sun , one of the British papers under the conglomerate 's media umbrella . It redirected those on the paper 's website to a false story claiming Murdoch had been found dead in his garden .

Soon after that link was taken down , those going to the Sun 's website were redirected to LulzSec 's Twitter page .

The FBI is also investigating News Corporation after a report that employees or associates may have tried to hack into phone conversations and voice mail of September 11 survivors , victims and their families .

CNN 's Richard Allen Greene , Laura Perez Maestro , Andreena Narayan , Atika Shubert , Anna Stewart , Bharati Naik and Tom Watkins contributed to this report .
