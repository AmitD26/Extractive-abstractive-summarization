Four months after taking over as General Secretary of the Communist Party , Xi replaces outgoing leader Hu Jintao after a formal vote of about 3,000 deputies at the National People 's Congress -LRB- NPC -RRB- .

The vote , largely a rubber stamp that completes the highly choreographed leadership transition , was unanimous .

`` We could go through a whole list of problems from the structure of the economy as well as the social issues : Health care , housing , education and pollution and retirement and food safety , '' Kuhn added . `` All of these things are all bubbling up together -- and with a billion cell phones in China , everybody knows it , so he 's on the spot . ''

PROFILES : China 's new leaders

During the NPC , it was announced Beijing would strengthen the powers of the State Food and Drug Administration in the wake of widespread health concerns over food safety , such as tainted milk and baby formula scandals , according to Xinhua .

This winter has seen its worst pollution in living memory , angering a population already jaded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals -- including the downfall of the once high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- that have tainted the reputation of the party .

In a speech published by the People 's Daily earlier this month , Xi warned that China faced many risks and challenges , saying that the party 's future was at stake .

The NPC also approved the restructuring of several ministries under the State Council .

The two agencies that regulate and censor media -- the State Administration of Radio , Film and Television and the General Administration of Press and Publication -- will be merged , as will the Health Ministry and the National Population and Family Planning Commission , Xinhua reported .
