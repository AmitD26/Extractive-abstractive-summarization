Philadelphia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the two Philadelphia priests on trial in a landmark child sexual abuse and conspiracy case admitted in 2008 that he allowed a 14-year-old to view pornography and sleep in the same bed with him during an overnight visit in 1996 , according to testimony given to church investigators .

Monsignor Kevin Quirk , the presiding priest over the 2008 canonical trial of Rev. James Brennan , read Brennan 's testimony into the court record on Monday . Brennan is accused of attempted rape in the 1996 incident and is currently standing trial in criminal court .

`` Did I allow it happen ? Yes . I take full responsibility for it , '' Brennan testified in 2008 , adding that the behavior was `` borderline '' inappropriate . Brennan denied touching the 14-year-old or exposing himself , according to the 2008 testimony that Quirk recounted for the court on Monday .

`` I was just devastated , '' Brennan testified in 2008 regarding the allegations of sexual abuse . This is the first time the 2008 canonical testimony has been revealed to the public .

Also on trial is Monsignor William Lynn , the first high-ranking church figure charged with child endangerment . He 's accused of knowingly transferring priests from parish to parish despite allegations of sexual abuse of minors , including Brennan .

Brennan 's accuser , now in his 30s , was a former altar boy who cried on the stand weeks earlier as he described the incident with Brennan . The man , a former Marine , was discharged because of mental health issues .

The witness testified before Common Pleas Judge Teresa Sarmina that Brennan , who he described as a close family friend considered to be like an uncle , viewed online sex-chat rooms with him and suggested they masturbate together before insisting the witness sleep with the priest in the same bed .

`` I was scared . I was afraid that if I said no , he 'd kill me or something , '' he said , crying .

The witness testified that while in bed together and wearing only T-shirts and boxers , Brennan hugged him from behind and pressed his genitals against his buttocks .

He said he prayed he would fall asleep and recalled wetting himself but does not remember anything after that .

During the 2008 testimony that was recounted Monday , Brennan repeated denied having any physical contact with the 14-year-old , in what may be the closest jurors get to hearing directly from the priest other having him on the witness stand .

`` No , nothing happened physically between us -- nothing , '' Brennan testified .

Quirk , who answered in the affirmative , was ordered to testify earlier this month by a West Virginia judge who noted he was a `` necessary and material witness , '' according to court documents obtained by CNN .

Two grand jury reports accused the archdiocese of failing to investigate claims of sexual abuse of children by priests .
