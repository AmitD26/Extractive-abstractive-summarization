-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some die-hard fans are getting all wrapped up in a campaign to defend Paula Deen .

They 're sending cleaned and origami-folded butter wrappers to Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author in the wake of allegations of racism and sexual harassment . Deen later admitted to `` of course '' using the n-word . The wrappers are intended as signs of protest -- physical declarations of `` we 're sticking with Paula . ''

`` She made a mistake 20 years ago , '' he says . `` We all make mistakes . I 've said things I regret . ''

He opted for an empty wrapper on which he wrote in black block letters : `` Where is Paula ? '' and began cooking up a plan .

Deen critics say credit is past due

Wrapping things up

Schmitt created the Facebook page , `` We Support Paula Deen , '' on June 21 and announced the butter wrapper campaign the following week after Deen 's now-famous interview with `` Today '' anchor Matt Lauer .

Schmitt and many others say they have sent wrappers to Food Network , the QVC , Wal-Mart , Ballantine Books and other companies that have dropped Deen . Food Network , QVC , Wal-Mart and Smithfield Foods declined to comment .

Opinion : Half-baked apology is recipe for racial indigestion

`` That 's when I said , ` You know , this is actually perfect , ' '' Ford remembers . '' ` The butter itself is Paula , and these wrappers are void of butter just like these companies are void of Paula . ' And -LSB- Schmitt -RSB- said , ` My God , that 's it . That 's our slogan . ' ''

Soon the page was smothered in posts and comments from users , gushing over the cleverness of the campaign and pledging to send their own wrappers to the list of companies Schmitt had posted on the site .

`` Perhaps somebody somewhere in mail rooms is keeping track , '' Schmitt says . `` I would 've loved to see their face for the first one . Like , ` Ew , is this butter ? ' ''

Schmitt sent his in the first week of the campaign , but he has n't received a formal response yet , just `` canned answers '' from Sears and Wal-Mart . He was n't necessarily expecting one ; the campaign , he says , is more intended for self-expression than for results .

Comfort food , uncomfortable topics

Paula Love-fests

Schmitt says he 's been a Paula Deen fan for years , mainly because it was something he shared with his late mother , Laura Schmitt . They both enjoyed watching the show and shared a deep belief in Deen 's `` goodness '' -- a belief that has not been shaken , even following news of Deen 's alleged racism .

`` In a lot of ways , she reminds me of my mom -- this funny , gracious lady from a different era , '' he says . `` My mom probably used that word and she was n't a racist . ''

He points to Deen 's work with the charitable Bag Lady Foundation and the sweet stories people have shared on the page as intrinsic signs of this goodness .

Dixon says she believes the page grew in popularity so quickly because people were attracted to the `` lovey-doviness '' of the stories , videos and photos shared by fans . Now , the page holds regular `` Love-Fest '' nights for followers to share their Deen stories .

Dixon has been a fan of Paula Deen since 1997 , when she first visited Deen 's Lady & Sons restaurant in Savannah , and there met Deen personally .

Since then , Dixon says the characterization of Deen in the media is `` so wrong . ''

Paula Deen : From the frying pan to the firestorm

Deen supporters from the page argue this `` punishment '' has gone too far . They say Deen has become a scapegoat for media attention -- and Dixon says that is why she dedicates so many hours to a mere Facebook page . She wants to correct the public 's perception of the former Food Network star .
