Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As political comebacks go , Nawaz Sharif 's is among the more remarkable .

After a Pakistani court sentenced him to life in prison for hijacking and terrorism , he managed to negotiate his way into exile in Saudi Arabia , where he remained for seven years , waiting for the political tides to shift and allow his return .

On Wednesday , he completed his long journey back to power and became prime minister for an unprecedented third term .

The Pakistani National Assembly , where his political party secured control in elections last month , elected him prime minister with 244 votes .

Stern challenges

His economic stewardship will be quickly put to the test .

He also has the complex task of resolving the country 's energy crisis , which has resulted in prolonged power outages that hurt businesses and sometimes provoke street protests .

Sharif has floated the idea of holding talks with the Taliban , but some analysts say the country 's powerful military , with whom Sharif has clashed in the past , will hold the final word on key security and foreign policy decisions .

Stance on drones ?

Until Wednesday , when he called for an end to drone strikes , his stance on the United States ' unpopular program in Pakistan 's tribal areas that border Afghanistan was unclear .

`` The campaign of drone strikes should be shut down , '' Sharif said in his acceptance speech . `` We must work together to ensure Pakistan 's sovereignty . ''

Imran Khan , the former cricket star whose young party has become one of the main opposition groups in parliament , has called on Sharif to bring an end to the U.S. program .

Sharif has condemned drone strikes in the past , including the one last week that killed the Pakistani Taliban 's No. 2 leader . But analysts say he had good working relations with the United States during his previous terms in office and is likely to take a similarly pragmatic approach once back in power .

He has said he will pursue closer ties with Pakistan 's neighbor and archrival , India .

It remains to be seen what his third term will be remembered for .
