Lance Cpl. Esteban J. Smith , 23 , died Sunday in a shootout with Texas authorities after going on a two-hour rampage that left one person dead and five wounded , according to investigators .

Authorities do n't know why Smith , an active duty Marine from Bakersfield , California , was 1,300 miles away from his duty station at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , said Tom Vinger , spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety .

`` I do n't know how we survived it , '' Casimiro Solis told CNN affiliate KTAB .

He said he and his wife , Charlotte Feldman , were on their way to work in Brady , Texas , when a man police identified as Smith came up to them with a `` dead blank '' look on his face and started firing .

Authorities counted 16 bullet holes in their truck .

`` I really thought the side of my face was shot off , '' Feldman told the station .

Feldman and Solis suffered only minor wounds in the attack .

Authorities found an assault rifle , a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Smith 's pickup .

Smith 's wife , Rubi Estenania Smith , 21 , was discovered dead Sunday afternoon at a motel near Camp Lejeune , according to police in Jacksonville , North Carolina .

Police did n't describe the evidence .

It appeared she had been stabbed , police said .

He first deployed to Afghanistan from August 2010 to May 2011 , then again from April 2012 until November .
