-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the basis of the evidence currently in the public record , one likely outcome of the case against George Zimmerman is a mixed one : There may be sufficient evidence for a reasonable prosecutor to indict him for manslaughter , but there may also be doubt sufficient for a reasonable jury to acquit him .

Media reports suggest that police found Zimmerman with grass stains on the back of his shirt , bloody bruises on the back of his head and other indicia that may support his contention that Trayvon Martin was banging his head against the ground when Zimmerman shot him .

We do n't know what Martin 's body or clothing show , other than the fatal bullet wound . If there are no comparable bruises or grass stains and if the bullet wound and powder residue establish that the gun was fired at very close range , this too might support a claim of self-defense .

Then there is a recorded cry for help , which , if it turns out to be the voice of Martin , would undercut the defense -- if the voice analysis passes scientific muster and is deemed admissible into evidence .

Though this statute is anything but a model of clarity , it does suggest that whoever `` provokes '' a deadly encounter has a heavy burden of justification in claiming self-defense . But the statute does n't define `` provokes , '' and that ambiguous word may hold the key to the outcome of this tragic case .

If provocation is limited to a physical assault , and if Zimmerman 's account that Martin blindsided him with a punch is believed , then Zimmerman did not provoke the encounter . But if provocation includes following the victim and harassing him , then Zimmerman may well qualify as a provocateur . Moreover , a jury may believe that Zimmerman started the physical confrontation by grabbing Martin . This would almost certainly constitute provocation .

But to complicate matters further , even a provocateur has the legal right to defend himself under Florida law if he ca n't escape and if he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm , as Zimmerman claims he was .

All she needs in order to indict is probable cause that a crime has been committed . A jury that ultimately decides whether the defendant is guilty needs much more : proof beyond a reasonable doubt . But what if a prosecutor concludes that there is both probable cause and a reasonable doubt ?

Moreover , the Florida statute provides an additional layer of protection to a defendant claiming self-defense : A judge must decide whether the defendant is `` immune from prosecution , '' that is , if the judge believes his actions fall under the law of self-defense .

Many people would be unhappy with such a mixed outcome , but it is not the job of the law to make people happy .

He says based on evidence that is public , there could be probable cause to indict

But there may not be enough evidence to remove reasonable doubt of guilt
