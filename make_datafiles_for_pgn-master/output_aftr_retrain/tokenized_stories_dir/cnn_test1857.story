For people who have long suspected that there is some link between violent video games and real-world violence , the statement offered frightening new evidence for why the video-game industry should be more strictly regulated .

Many gamers and columnists , however , rolled their eyes and collectively muttered `` here we go again . ''

`` Norway Killer Played World of Warcraft , Which Probably Means Nothing At All , '' declared a headline on Time.com , which shares a parent company with CNN .

Whether shoot - 'em - up video games can incite violence has been a long-running debate among the public as well as in clinical psychology . This type of discussion tends to come up every time it 's revealed that a high-profile killer also played video games .

Perhaps the most memorable case study was the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado in 1999 , during which experts speculated about the influence of the game `` Doom '' on the teenagers who carried out that crime .

Confusingly , a 2004 U.S. Secret Service and Department of Education report studied 24 cases of school violence and found : `` Over half of the attackers demonstrated some interest in violence , through movies , video games , books and other media . However , there was no one common type of interest in violence indicated . Instead , the attackers ' interest in violent themes took various forms . ''

The always-vocal jury of the Internet , meanwhile , rushed on Thursday to the defense of the video game industry . Here 's a breakdown of the general argument , in case you want to be supercontrarian and appropriate these points for cocktail-party conversation this weekend .

Point 1 : Lots of people play video games and do n't kill people .

Here 's a related point : People who play other kinds of video games do n't usually -LRB- or ever -RRB- act out the things they do in the games . `` Shooters do not create real-life killers . Neither does `` FarmVille '' create real-life farmers , '' another Google + commenter said .

`` If we 're looking for Breivik 's influences and motivations , we 'd better start with xenophobia , fundamentalist Christianity and right-wing ideology before even mentioning what was in his Xbox , '' a commenter wrote on CNN 's story about the trial .

And from Lisa Smith on Google + : `` If there were no violent video games or movies , would Breivek have shrugged off writing his manifesto -LSB- on -RSB- his irrational fear of Islam ? No , then perhaps then if he 'd been unable to watch the news ? Oops , now we have to keep him from using the Internet , was that enough ? ''

Point 3.5 : And anyway , these games would be crappy for training .

`` How can ` World of Warcraft ' be considered ` training ' ? Unless he planned on looting gold and armor . Also , ` Modern Warfare ' is hardly a training tool . Too linear and unrealistic , '' another Google + commenter wrote . `` Could the ` Armed Assault ' series , with its more simulation based approach , have been more useful to create a mass murderer ? ''

From Time.com : `` The most up-to-date research , according to academic and TIME contributor Christopher Ferguson , ` has not found that children who play VVG -LSB- violent video games -RSB- are more violent than other kids , nor harmed in any other identifiable fashion . '

In Ferguson 's own longitudinal studies , recently published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research , he found ` no long-term link between VVG and youth aggression or dating violence . ' And Ferguson references another recent longitudinal study involving German children , published in Media Psychology , which similarly found no links between increased aggression and violent video games . ''

I 'll add this little factoid to the pile : If you search the manifesto that 's attributed to Breivik , you 'll only find a few references to `` World of Warcraft . '' When he does mention the game , he appears to be explaining that by saying if you 're playing `` WoW '' all the time , you can stop family members and friends from questioning what you 're up to .

`` Announce to your closest friends , co-workers and family that you are pursuing a ` project ' that can at least partly justify your ` new pattern of activities ' -LRB- isolation/travel -RRB- while in the planning phase , '' the manifesto says . '' -LRB- For -RRB- example , tell them that you have started to play ` World of Warcraft ' or any other online MMO game and that you wish to focus on this for the next months/year . This ` new project ' can justify isolation and people will understand somewhat why you are not answering your phone over long periods . ''
