-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Satire and mockery are part of politics . Sometimes they attack not the policy but the person , going from nuanced to nasty . But surely not `` everything goes . '' Promoting violence and applauding abuse -- there 's just no excuse for it .

`` As they were bringing the bulls into the chute and prepping them , '' Perry Beam told USA Today , '' ... they bring out what looks like a dummy . The announcer says ` Here 's our Obama dummy , or our dummy of Obama . They mentioned the president 's name , I do n't know , 100 times ... '' Beam was there with his wife and a foreign exchange student who got a lesson in American political `` civility . ''

What are we to make , though , of a Slap Hillary website , suspiciously resurrected by an anti-Hillary PAC ? The PAC sent out tweets to reporters in hopes , I suspect , of stirring up the red meat base , get publicity , and solicit money . It provocatively asked journalists , `` Have you slapped Hillary today ? ''

There 's something suspicious about the `` Slap Palin '' site -- a paucity of comments , just 19 in 2008 and only two last year , indicates a set-up . A little more research revealed that the `` Slap Palin '' is hosted on a computer at the same address in downtown Washington that hosts a `` Slap Clinton '' and `` Slap Obama '' site .

We can perhaps relegate the `` Slap Palin-Clinton-Obama '' anonymous owner to the fringe . But what are we to say when a former administration official and current campaign consultant to one of the major parties promotes violence against public figures ?

It does n't matter if the website -- or rodeo clown -- encourages violence against a Democrat or a Republican , a male or female . It 's wrong . It 's vile . It 's one of the few true evils in politics .

Those who promote or approve `` slapping '' or `` shooting '' or `` running over by a bull '' any public official should be shamed and shunned . Virtual violence needs to be denounced and never justified because it 's political .

Still , given the extent of domestic violence -- 25 % of American women will experience domestic violence in their lives -- encouraging people to slap or abuse female elected officials is particularly pernicious . Slapping women so hard their heads bobble is not a game , not even virtually .

Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman of Texas ' 36th District issued an invitation to the rodeo clown to appear at a rodeo in his district . `` Liberals want to bronco bust dissent , '' Stockman said . `` But Texans value speech , even if its speech they do n't agree with . '' This is n't about liberals or conservatives , Congressman ; it 's about respect for elected officials , and coupling violence with ridicule .

It 's one thing to use free speech to parody or satirize a politician , and another to couple violence with a deliberate showing of disrespect .

When Harry Truman was campaigning in his home state of Missouri -LRB- where the rodeo clown performed -RRB- , he took questions from a high school audience . A teenage boy asked him a question about their town councilman , called him , `` Our local yokel . ''

We have to make our civic discourse civil again . We have to recognize that virtual violence masquerading as ridicule is vicious ; it 's a toxic atmosphere we allow by our silence . We hear a lot about what 's wrong with Washington . What 's wrong is n't Washington . It 's us .
