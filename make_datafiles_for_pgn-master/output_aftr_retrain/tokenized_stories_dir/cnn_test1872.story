Handcuffed and dressed in orange jail jumpsuits , Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov both voiced their not guilty pleas on each of the counts during their roughly four-minute arraignment Tuesday in Boston . They remained in handcuffs afterward , when they were led out of court .

The two 19-year-old roommates and Kazakh nationals began attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth the same semester as Tsarnaev . They were taken into custody this spring along with Robel Phillipos , a friend of Tsarnaev 's from Cambridge , Massachusetts .

`` The fireworks container has been opened and manipulated , '' the indictment says . `` As a result , some of the explosive powder was visible . ''

Kadyrbayev told his roommate that he believed Tsarnaev `` used the Vaseline ` to make bombs , ' or words to that effect , '' according to the indictment .

That day , Kadyrbayev showed Tazhayakov a text message from Tsarnaev that read , in part , `` If yu want yu can go to my room and take what 's there '' followed by a smiley face emoticon .

Either that night or early the next day , Kadyrbayev tossed the backpack in a Dumpster , according to the charges .

`` As Dias ' family prays for the victims , they also pray for justice for their son , a law-abiding college student whose only crime was befriending a fellow student who spoke his more comfortable native language , '' Stahl said later Tuesday in a statement , insisting his client `` fully cooperated '' with authorities right after they approached him .

As for Phillipos , he is free on $ 100,000 bond and being monitored electronically , according to terms set this spring and agreed to by his lawyers and prosecutors .

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev himself is awaiting trial , having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges tied to the bombing and the subsequent pursuit of him and his brother .
