-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The vetting process and the subsequent hiring of Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson seemed like standard procedure . But in recent days he has come under fire for the controversy surrounding his academic credentials .

A graduate of Stonehill College , Thompson earned a bachelor 's degree in accounting . But his official biography at Yahoo and Paypal , where he worked previously , says that he also has a degree in computer science . Thompson probably could have gone further and claimed he had a master 's degree in engineering and no one would have questioned it . Holding these credentials seems very plausible for someone with Thompson 's job history . And since he was a well known and successful executive , a background check was probably put on the back burner . Why ? `` Groupthink '' is a possible culprit .

While we do n't know all the factors that went into the vetting process of Thompson , the executive search committee that was responsible for his review may have engaged in groupthink . Fortunately , in Yahoo 's case , the only bad outcome is that jobs were lost under Thompson 's leadership .

Resume fraud is not uncommon . It is committed to gain a competitive edge in landing a job , but the rationale that people use to justify the fraud is less clear . Some people actually perceive their lies to be 80 % truths and therefore see no problem in fudging their resume . Other job seekers may feel the exaggerated information is permissible as a way to compensate for the many hard knocks they have endured in life . The more times that false information goes undetected , the more desensitized people become to their own deception , and will likely continue with this pattern of behavior .

Research has suggested that the best predictor of one 's future behavior is one 's past behavior . The more pieces of the puzzle that a job search committee can put together about a candidate 's past , the more accurate it will be in assessing that individual .

Vetting a candidate thoroughly can sometimes be costly and time consuming , but it is worthwhile for the long-term health of the organization . I 'm sure this has been an expensive learning experience for Yahoo . Hopefully , others will take note .
