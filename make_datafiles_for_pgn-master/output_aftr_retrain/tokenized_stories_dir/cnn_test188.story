-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Call it a `` Grande '' surprise .

Snakes in unexpected places can startle anyone . For Bruce Ahlswede the unexpected place was a San Antonio Starbucks bathroom , where he had stopped on Tuesday after a business presentation .

He froze for a moment thinking the snake , lying across the toilet , was a toy left by a prankster .

`` I said ` Hey you 've got a snake in your bathroom and she 's kind of freaking out , ' '' Ahlswede told CNN affiliate KSAT . Bruce , his wife and store employees all crowded into the bathroom and watched as the snake , perhaps just as surprised as the rest , slithered around the toilet bowl and disappeared , the station reported . Ahlswede 's wife , Michele , managed to snap a photo . She promptly posted it to Facebook .

`` It had to have crawled up the pipes , '' Michele wrote on her page . `` I have heard of it happening but have never seen it in person . Its a python guess he like coffee also . ''

The couple says despite the encounter they plan on remaining Starbuck 's customers .
