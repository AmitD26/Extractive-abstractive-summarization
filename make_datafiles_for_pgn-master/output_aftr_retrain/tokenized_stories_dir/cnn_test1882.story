-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pfc. Bradley Manning , who provided classified government documents to WikiLeaks detailing , among other things , America 's undisclosed policies on torture , was found guilty of espionage on Tuesday . The verdict comes on the 235th anniversary of the passage of America 's first whistle-blower protection law , approved by the Continental Congress after two Navy officers were arrested and harassed for having reported the torture of British prisoners .

How have we gotten to the place where the revelation of torture is no longer laudable whistle-blowing , but now counts as espionage ?

The answer is that government has not yet come to terms with the persistence and transparency of the digital age . Information moves so fast and to so many places that controlling it is no longer an option . Every datapoint , whether a perverted tweet by an aspiring mayor or a classified video of Reuters news staffers being gunned down by an Apache helicopter , will somehow find the light of day . It 's enough to make any administration tremble , but it 's particularly traumatic for one with things to hide .

That 's why they tried to throw the book , and then some , at Manning .

But prosecuting those whose keyboards or USB sticks may have been technically responsible for the revelations is futile . The more networked we become and the more data we collect , the more likely something will eventually find its way out . After all , a security culture based on surveillance and big data cuts both ways .

These are not launch codes for nuclear strikes , operational secrets or even plans for future military missions . Rather , they are documentation of past activity and officially sanctioned military and state policy . These are not our secrets , but our ongoing actions and approaches .

In such a crisis-to-crisis landscape , there 's no time to implement or even articulate a `` grand narrative . '' A real-time , digital world offers no sense of mission or opportunity to tell a story . There 's no Cold War to win . No moon shot to work toward . There are just emergent threats , one after the other after the other . Things just exist in the present , one tweet - or , actually , many tweets - at a time .

Just as corporations are learning that they can no longer maintain low prices through overseas slave labor without getting caught , a democratic government can no longer maintain security through torture and coercion without being exposed . Betraying our respect for human dignity only makes us less resolved as a people , and less trusted as a nation .

We are just beginning to learn what makes a free people secure in a digital age . It really is different . The Cold War was an era of paper records , locked vaults and state secrets , for which a cloak-and-dagger mindset may have been appropriate . In a digital environment , our security comes not from our ability to keep our secrets but rather our ability to live our truth .
