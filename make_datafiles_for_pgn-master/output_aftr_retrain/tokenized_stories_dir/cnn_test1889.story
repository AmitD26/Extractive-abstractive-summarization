Apple 's strength is its Achilles ' heel : We expect it to reinvent on schedule and when , in our infinite wisdom , we believe it is not , we treat it like the kid who no longer belongs in our clique .

Some of this is to be expected when a company with as incredible a recent track record as Apple 's seems to be resting more on its laurels than finding new battles to win . Since the quixotic introduction of the iMac in 1998 -- reinvigorating the desktop computer well into the age of portables -- Apple has been on a tear :

• The iPod -LRB- 2001 -RRB-

• The iTunes Store , allowing the purchase of single music tracks -LRB- 2003 -RRB-

• The Apple retail store -LRB- 2004 -RRB-

And you can add to list that Steve Jobs ' revitalization of the animated feature film through his acquisition of Pixar .

Call it the Microsoft Curve . Microsoft dominated through the red-hot '90s , the height of the PC era . It is n't going anywhere . It still prints money by selling MS-Office and Windows licenses . But look at a five-year stock price chart , and you 'll see it has gone exactly nowhere . The only people dancing for joy about owning a Windows computer seem to be in those Surface Pro TV ads .

At the bottom of the pile there is the sad tale of Palm -- the hottest tech company on the planet for far too brief a time . Palm Pilots were once everywhere . But the company stumbled by failing to recognize quickly enough that , in the age of the Internet , no one wanted a portable device that could n't get online .

How Samsung is out-innovating Apple

Now Apple is this unfamiliar territory : Successful on paper , products seen everywhere , Macbooks and iPhone placed in seemingly every TV show and movie and yet ... the cool factor is cooling off .

There is a big difference between atmospherics and actuality , of course . But nobody wants to be thought of as a has-been in the making .

The lesson of tech history is that smart companies crash when they believe what they have already done is all they need to do : that doubling-down and trash-talking the competition is what it takes .

Exhibit A ? Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer himself , whose initial public reaction to the iPhone was that business customers would n't want it `` because it does n't have a keyboard , which makes it not a very good e-mail machine . ''

Even Palm 's trajectory might have been different if it had inverted its thinking in time : Imagine a Palm Pilot not as a personal information manager with connectivity , but a connected device with PIM applications , and you have described exactly what the smartphone is today .

There is no reason to think Apple wo n't thrive financially for years to come , just like Microsoft . But its continued reputation as the chief arbiter of cool is being challenged . Apple may still have the best-selling smartphone in the world , but the many others powered by rival Google 's Android operating system -- and especially those made by Samsung -- far exceed the iPhone .

For years , tech writers reviewed each new smartphone on a simple grading scale : Is this the iPhone killer ? None has been , but collectively the point has been made :

We expect the unexpected from Apple , and the company does nothing to tamp down these expectations . So when it does n't dazzle us , ennui begins to creep in . Apple is also burdened by what I called at the time the meaningless milestone of having become the biggest company ever . Where do you go from there ? You are either still the biggest , or slipping . Consolidating your lead is fine and all , but it is n't sexy .

My own prediction of Apple 's prospects is that needs to worry about becoming a mid-packer only after the CEO Tim Cook and designer Jony Ive -- the other tow members of the triumvirate headed by Steve Jobs -- are no longer with the company .
