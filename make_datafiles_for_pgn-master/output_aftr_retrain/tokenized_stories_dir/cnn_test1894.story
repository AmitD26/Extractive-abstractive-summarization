Bale joins the La Liga giants for six seasons , Real said on its website , and he will be unveiled at Real 's Bernabeu Stadium Monday at 1 p.m. local time .

Neither club has disclosed the value of the deal but British media outlets Sky Sports and the BBC reported it was a world-record move worth $ 132 million that was greater than the $ 124 million fee Real Madrid produced to lure Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United in 2009 .

According to a pair of Spanish newspapers , though , Bale 's switch was n't a world record . El Pais put the transfer value at about $ 120 million on Sunday , just as AS did earlier in the weekend .

Whatever the amount , Bale was thrilled while thanking Spurs for some `` special times . ''

Likely in anticipation of Bale 's departure -- and the money on the way -- Tottenham had signed seven players this summer .

`` We have , therefore , with great reluctance , agreed to this sale and do so in the knowledge that we have an exceptionally strong squad to which we have added no fewer than seven top internationals .

The 24-year-old Welsh international has twice been named the Footballer of the Year in England for his outstanding performances for Tottenham , most recently in the 2012-13 season where he scored 26 goals in 44 appearances .

He has made 41 appearances for his country since his debut in 2006 , scoring 11 goals .

`` Tottenham will always be in my heart and I 'm sure that this season will be a successful one for them . I am now looking forward to the next exciting chapter in my life , playing football for Real Madrid . ''

If the British reports about Bale 's fee are correct , it would mark the latest occasion that Real have broken the world transfer record , dating back to the signing of Portugal 's Luis Figo from arch rivals Barcelona in 2000 .

The $ 82.58 million fee remained the record until Los Blancos broke it twice in 2009 , first acquiring Brazil 's Kaka from Milan and then Ronaldo , who remains a key figure at the Bernabeu .

New manager Carlo Ancelotti will be hoping the attacking combination of Bale and Ronaldo will herald a new era of domination for a club who have won the European Champions League , formerly European Cup , a record nine times , but not since 2002 .

Real , then managed by Jose Mourinho , had to play second fiddle in La Liga last season to Barcelona and were beaten in the semifinals of the Champions League by Borussia Dortmund .
