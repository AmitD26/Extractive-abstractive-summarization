Iran 's record supporting terrorism in the Middle East through groups like Hezbollah in Lebanon elevates those concerns .

Is this to be a pre-emptive strike ?

In April , 2006 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad stood onstage , surrounded by dancers holding glowing vials representing enriched uranium and declared : `` I am officially announcing that Iran joined the group of those countries which have nuclear technology . ''

Iran has repeatedly denied it is trying to `` weaponize '' its nuclear program and spiritual leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei has even issued a fatwa in a speech against the production and use of weapons of mass destruction .

The IAEA says it has no evidence Iran is diverting its enriched uranium to make a weapon , but refuses to give Tehran a clean bill because inspectors have been unable to visit a military location where nuclear weapon research could be conducted .

The question is not whether Israel and the U.S. would attack Iran if it developed a nuclear weapon . Both states have said they will not allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons .

The question is at what point Iran 's capability to go nuclear is unacceptable . It is important because it 's relatively easy to bomb buildings and factories , but you ca n't bomb knowledge .

Any strategy that involves attacking Iran to control its nuclear program compels us to ask what the U.S. and Israel hope to achieve ? Will it be enough to shut down the nuclear enrichment process for a year ... two years ... five years ?

In the event of a strike on its nuclear program , it is reasonable to assume Tehran would immediately resume its research in deeper , hidden underground shelters . It may already be preparing to do that . The U.S. can expect Iran would try to rebuild and improve on its past efforts with a vengeance .

A more important question the U.S. needs to ask is whether a military attack strategy will force it into a `` lawn mowing '' ritual that has to be repeated , again and again ?

It all tends to add up to a very major military effort -- not the simple `` one and done '' raid Israel carried out on Iraq 's Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 .

Obama has repeatedly said there is `` a window -- not an infinite period time , but a window of time -- where we can resolve this diplomatically . ''

This week , it became clearer than ever that Netanyahu is growing impatient with the lack of progress that talks and sanctions have achieved .

That 's understandable . Israel and Iran are already locked in a covert war . Since 2007 , Iran has alleged at least five of its nuclear scientists have been assassinated by Israeli agents . There was no official response from Israel .

In July 2012 , a suicide bomber attacked a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Bulgaria . Five Israelis were killed -- along with their Bulgarian driver -- and a Bulgarian investigation established links between the bomber and the pro-Iranian Lebanese group Hezbollah .

So the most important question of all is : When does America give up on diplomacy with Iran ?

Iran is different from other Middle East countries in an important way . For decades , the United States propped up Arab leaders and had , on the surface anyway , warm relations with them . But almost universally , the man in the street detested the U.S. government .

Perhaps the question right now is n't about giving up , but whether it 's time to double down on diplomacy to avoid a conflict that poses serious and unpredictable consequences .
