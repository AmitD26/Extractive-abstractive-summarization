-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lebanon could have no more fitting symbol of its tumultuous history than its national flag .

Situated on the eastern-most lip of the Mediterranean basin -- in a region once known as the Levant -- Lebanon stands at the gateway between Christian Europe and the Arab Middle East and North Africa .

Throughout its history it has been the scene of bitter struggles .

Originally an island city , Alexander spared no effort in taking the Phoenician city state , constructing a 1km-long causeway to connect the island with the mainland as part of his invasion plan .

Part of the Ottoman Empire from the early 16th century , Lebanon became a French mandate after World War I and achieved independence in 1943 .

In the 20th century , it suffered violent shifts in its fortunes .

Once known as the `` Paris of the East '' because of its cosmopolitan nature , Beirut proudly boasted that it was the only city in the world where you could swim in the Mediterranean in the morning and then drive to the mountains to go skiing in the afternoon .

Others compared it with Switzerland as its reputation grew as a financial center in the 1960s .

The country had an estimated 4,125,247 people in July 2010 , according to figures from the CIA Factbook , although no official census has been taken since 1932 because of the sensitive political balance between Lebanon 's various religious groups .

The country is known to have a `` confessional democracy '' and refers to a system of government whereby political and institutional power is distributed proportionally among religious communities . The presidency is reserved for a Maronite Christian , the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament a Shia Muslim .

According to the FCO , Lebanon is home to 18 separate religious sects and several different ethnic groups .

With the formation of Israel in 1948 , thousands of Palestinian refugees flooded into Lebanon altering the country 's finely balanced demographic .

Even with ongoing political tensions and spasms of violence , since 2005 , Lebanon has worked hard to emerge from this bitter legacy , reinventing itself as trendy tourist destination .

Thanks to the rejuvenation of war-torn central Beirut , one of the largest and most ambitious urban redevelopment projects in the region , Beirut is once more laying claim to its as title of the `` Paris of the East . ''
