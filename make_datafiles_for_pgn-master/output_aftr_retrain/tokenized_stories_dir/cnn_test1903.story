Britain 's Prince William has been named `` Hottest Young Royal '' in the world by Forbes magazine .

The magazine used the `` winning combinations of looks , money , and popularity on the Web '' to come up with the list , it says .

Only unmarried royals under the age of 35 were considered .

With his piercing blue eyes and lantern jaw , reminiscent of a movie star , Britain 's Prince William , perhaps unsurprisingly , came in at Number 1 . The magazine describes him as having : `` international intrigue and unparalleled media attention , '' combined with a `` graceful public persona . ''

Although his crown slipped somewhat recently when he was accused of abusing his newly-acquired flying skills by `` joyriding . '' Watch who people on the street think is the hottest ''

Harry has always been known as the `` bad boy prince '' because of some rather unroyal behavior , such as brawling with paparazzi outside nightclubs and going to a fancy dress party dressed in Nazi regalia .

William and Harry 's cousins Zara Phillips and Princess Beatrice also came in at No. 3 and 4 respectively .

The inclusion in the list should be good news for Princess Beatrice , who recently attracted unkind comments from Britain 's newspaper columnists about her curvy figure and her dress sense .

The sight of Beatrice , 19 , pictured on holiday in a bikini proved too much for Daily Mail newspaper columnist Allison Pearson , who wrote : `` Ca n't someone buy that girl a sarong ? For her sake , as well as ours . ''

A controversial princess who raises eyebrows in her homeland with her Western-style clothes and a decision to hold a drinking party to celebrate the end of a chastity decree in 2005 resulted in a beating with a stick .

Fourth in line to the Monaco throne , Charlotte Casiraghi , is the only non-Brit to make it into the top 5 . A style icon , who is known for her impeccable taste in fashion and her good looks -- much like her grandmother , Hollywood icon , Grace Kelly and mother Princess Caroline .

Her brother , party prince Andrea Casiraghi , also makes an appearance on the list at Number 10 . But it seems even his Hollywood lineage -- as well as his sun-kissed surfer looks were not enough to give William and Harry a run for their money in the pin-up stakes .
