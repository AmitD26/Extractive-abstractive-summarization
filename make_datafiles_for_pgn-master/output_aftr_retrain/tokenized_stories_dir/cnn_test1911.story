-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With the season only a third completed , Martin Jol became the third managerial casualty in the English Premier League as Fulham announced Sunday that the Dutchman had been sacked .

The two teams below them , Sunderland and Crystal Palace , have already parted company with their managers after sorry starts to the 2013-14 campaign .

Paulo Di Canio was the first to go at Sunderland , with Gus Poyet taking charge , while Ian Holloway left Palace to be replaced last week by Tony Pulis .

A statement on Fulham 's official website confirmed the 57-year-old Jol 's fate , ending his two and a half year association with the club .

`` Our poor form and results this season are undeniable and Fulham supporters deserve better , '' said Fulham chairman Shahid Khan .

American Khan hired former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen to work alongside Jol last month and he will now take over with `` immediate effect , '' he said .

Current Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas is reportedly under pressure for his job after disappointing recent results , but he may be breathing a little easier after his side fought to a 2-2 draw against reigning champions Manchester United in the early kickoff Sunday .

Tottenham , thrashed 6-0 at Manchester City last weekend , twice led through Kyle Walker and Sandro only for Wayne Rooney to twice equalize for the visitors .

Liverpool 's title challenge suffered a setback Sunday with a 3-1 defeat at promoted Hull City .

They were looking to cut the gap on Arsenal to just four points with a win , but fell behind to an early goal from Jake Livermore , who is on loan from Tottenham .

First David Meyler scored with a low shot after Liverpool 's defense failed to clear and with three minutes left Tom Huddlestone 's shot was deflected into his own goal by Martin Skrtel .

In the late kickoffs , Chelsea and Manchester City scored important victories to keep pace with Arsenal .

Gary Cahill leveled for Jose Mourinho 's men early in the second half before John Terry marked his 400th league appearance for the Blues with a fine glancing header to put them ahead . Demba Ba rounded off the scoring in the final minute .

City , so impressive at home to Tottenham last weekend , took their tally to 29 goals in seven home league games by beating Swansea 3-0 to go up to third .

Alvaro Negredo and Samir Nasri with two second half strikes sealed the points for their side .
