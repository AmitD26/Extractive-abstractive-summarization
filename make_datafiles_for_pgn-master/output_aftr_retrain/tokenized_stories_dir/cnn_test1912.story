-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The lone , tattered page from a decimated children 's book sat quietly amid the rest of the rubble . But the words spoke volumes about the pain and nostalgia in the city of Moore :

`` I remember my old house ,

Its rooms so bright and wide .

`` It more than likely came from a house that had been demolished , '' said fellow volunteer Jared Bowie , who was with Toney at the time . `` Then I thought about how many houses were full of laughter and memories . ''

With everyone missing now accounted for , the daunting road to recovery is underway .

Throngs of volunteers have come to Moore to help . Each has a poignant tale about the breadth of the human condition .

Juan Olivo started searching for survivors as soon as the storm passed . He documented the search on video .

`` Is there anybody here ?! '' he bellowed as he walked past heaps of debris .

In the distance , deep under a mound of shredded lumber , a man 's voice replied : `` Here ! ''

He later told CNN 's iReport he was stunned at the discovery .

`` The odds of me filming and capturing this man cry out for help is one -LRB- in a -RRB- million , and I 'm happy he is alive , '' Olivo said .

Demands for storm shelters

Kyle Davis , 8 , was one of the victims .

`` I am angry to an extent . I know the schools did what they thought they could do but with us living in Oklahoma , tornado shelters should be in every school , '' Kyle 's mother , Mikki Dixon Davis , told CNN 's Kyung Lah .

Her daughter , who was also at Plaza Towers when the storm struck , survived .

`` There should be a place that if this ever happened again during school that kids can get to a safe place , '' Davis said . `` That we do n't have to sit there and go through rubble ... and may not ever find what we 're looking for . ''

`` What we will do is get the stakeholders here in the city ... and we 'll discuss what we think we need to have , '' Lewis said .

`` Anybody that lives in any tornado area should have -LRB- a storm shelter -RRB- , but it 's just the matter of cost . ''

Looking ahead

Insurance claims from the area are likely to exceed $ 2 billion , said Kelly Collins , a representative of the Oklahoma Insurance Department .

As Moore continues its arduous recovery , Bowie pondered the page from the children 's book . It shows a charming yellow house set atop lush green landscape .

`` It reminds me of the laughter and memories yet to come in the new houses that will be built , '' he said . `` The memories are truly found in the heart , not the house . ''

CNN 's Christina Zdanowicz , David Williams and Tom Watkins contributed to this report .
