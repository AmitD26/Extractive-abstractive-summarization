Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was a welcome more suited for a rock star than a wanted man .

A mob of cheering fans surrounded Egypt 's high court on Sunday , chanting Bassem Youssef 's name .

Two years ago , Youssef was a heart surgeon producing satirical YouTube videos from inside his Cairo apartment .

Egypt 's public prosecutor summoned Youssef for questioning on Sunday , accusing him of insulting President Mohamed Morsy and Islam .

He was released on $ 2,200 bail in response to three lawsuits filed against him , the prosecutor general 's office told CNN .

The blue-eyed comedian offered a steady stream of Twitter posts about the experience .

He poked fun at the prosecutor 's office , tweeting that officials could not find a laptop to see episodes from his show .

In recent days , some lawyers filed complaints on behalf of Egyptians making those allegations .

But the prosecutor has provided no details , and Youssef is a practicing Muslim .

It is a crime in Egypt to insult any religion .

`` Basically we are the drama queen of the world , with everything happening . We 're kind of the international political soap opera , '' he said . `` So it 's a great time and era to have a political satire to comment on everything that 's happening . ''

But he noted that some Egyptians had accused him of being anti-Islam .

`` I 'm proud to be an Egyptian and a Muslim , '' he told Amanpour . `` My mom is always concerned every time I go on TV . She 's afraid that I 'm going to be caught and put in prison . But you know , that 's what moms do . But I satirize . The way it goes down with people , many are actually accepting it . And actually , it 's empowering a lot of people that they think that this speaks on their behalf . ''

Recently some people critical of Morsy 's government have been arrested or brought in for questioning , a tactic critics have said is reminiscent of the ousted Hosni Mubarak government . Some have accused the government of trying to stifle free speech .

In January , Morsy told CNN he was committed to allowing free speech in his country .

Social media helped propel Youssef to fame , and social media posts swelled in support of him Sunday .
