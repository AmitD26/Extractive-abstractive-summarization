-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pop superstar Whitney Houston was seen ordering and consuming considerable quantities of alcohol at The Beverly Hilton two mornings last week , said a source briefed on her behavior and activity in the days before her death Saturday .

The source told CNN 's Don Lemon that Houston ordered the drinks before 10 a.m. last Wednesday and Thursday from the bars in the lobby and pool area .

Guests both days overheard Houston loudly complaining about her drinks , accusing bartenders of `` watering down '' or `` putting too much ice '' in them , the source said Wednesday .

The source said other guests expressed concern about Houston 's erratic behavior . Her disheveled appearance , including mismatched clothing , suggested to them that she was intoxicated , the source said . The source said Houston was seen jumping in and out of the pool and doing somersaults in the pool area .

Saturday , the day she died , Houston was seen drinking at the pool in the morning , although the source noted witnesses said her behavior did not appear erratic .

A singer who participated in an impromptu duet with Houston at a party Thursday night said Houston was not behaving erratically , but did have champagne .

The Los Angeles County Coroner 's office has issued subpoenas seeking Houston 's medical records and her prescriptions , Ed Winter , assistant chief coroner , said Wednesday . Investigators are also contacting pharmacies where the prescriptions were filled , he said .

Houston 's death certificate , filed Wednesday , listed her cause of death as `` deferred , '' meaning it was delayed pending more information . Speculation has grown while authorities await the outcome of toxicology tests that could take weeks .

The prescriptions found in the room were in Houston 's name , Winter told Lemon . By contacting the doctors , investigators are attempting to verify the prescriptions and find out if there were any more .

Several doctors have been contacted in California and other states , along with pharmacies , he said . All were cooperating .

`` The doctors I 've contacted so far have been helpful , '' he said , and nothing out of the ordinary was found as long as Houston was taking the medication as prescribed . Some additional information has been gained , he said , and investigators are waiting to see Houston 's medical records .

It does not appear that she was `` doctor shopping , '' he said , but officials are attempting to contact as many doctors as possible to rule that out , along with determining whether Houston was filling multiple prescriptions .

But it was too soon to say whether Houston had any prescriptions she should not have or used an alias , he said .

Although subpoenas have been issued -- a fairly unusual step in a death investigation -- Winter said the federal Drug Enforcement Administration has not been asked to assist .

As part of the investigation following the death of singer Michael Jackson in 2009 , bags and bottles of prescription drugs were found at Jackson 's home . Local and state authorities spent months tracking the pharmacies that filled the prescriptions . One of those pharmacies was the Mickey Fine Pharmacy and Grill in Beverly Hills .

Dr. Shawn Nasseri has treated Houston for throat and vocal problems for several years , said the source , who asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly about it .

Nasseri treats many well-known singers who have vocal problems , and has served as the doctor for `` American Idol '' contestants for several years .

Houston 's battles with drug addiction had cast a shadow in recent years over her impressive singing voice and her talent .

However , a close family friend told CNN on Tuesday that Houston had not used `` hard drugs '' for several years , although she was taking medication for a throat infection and Xanax or a similar drug for anxiety and to help her sleep . The friend said Houston was also known to have a drink if she went out .

Winter said Wednesday his office has asked that Houston 's toxicology results be expedited , saying he 's hoping for a tournaround of four to six weeks , possibly sooner .

`` With respect to Ms. Houston , we have an average of 50 cases a day , '' he said . `` We 've got 49 other cases and families looking for results too . ''

And Houston 's cousin , singer Dionne Warwick , was in New Jersey helping the family with funeral arrangements , Warwick 's publicist said .

Gospel singer and pastor Marvin L. Winans will give the eulogy at the funeral at the request of Houston 's mother , said New Hope Pastor Joe Carter .

Winans officiated Houston 's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown , said Carter . The two divorced in 2007 .

Asked why no public memorial service was planned , Winans told CNN 's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night the family did n't `` want to have a parade . ''

`` I do n't think , knowing Cissy -LRB- Houston 's mother -RRB- and the Houston family ... it was a matter of public or private as it was this is my daughter , this is my sister , this is my mother , this is my friend and we want to do this with dignity . ''

Although the family is not commenting on Houston 's burial location , her death certificate filed Wednesday in Los Angeles lists it as Fairview Cemetery in Westfield , New Jersey . A message left by CNN with the cemetery office was not immediately returned .

A close family friend said Tuesday that Bobbi Kristina was in the care of her grandmother , Cissy Houston , and her father .
