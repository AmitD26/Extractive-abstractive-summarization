-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sen. Marco Rubio was ready for his close-up , and he got it . Now you know what all the fuss is about .

Rubio , a rising star and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful , was picked to deliver the official Republican response to President Obama 's State of the Union Address .

The selection tells you a lot about what the Republican Party has in store for Rubio , and what this 41-year-old son of Cuban immigrants can do for a party that needs to become more user-friendly for Latinos . His remarks were also delivered in Spanish .

LZ Granderson : Rubio missed the year of the woman

Rubio knows that the Republican Party has a reputation as the party of the rich . That happens when you nominate as your party 's presidential candidate someone worth $ 250 million .

`` Mr. President , I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in . My neighbors are n't millionaires . They 're retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare . They 're workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills . They 're immigrants , who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy . The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle-class families . It will cost them their raises . It will cost them their benefits . It may even cost some of them their jobs . And it will hurt seniors because it does nothing to save Medicare and Social Security . So Mr. President , I do n't oppose your plans because I want to protect the rich . I oppose your plans because I want to protect my neighbors . ''

That is the sweet spot . Rubio understands that the best hope of the Republican Party is for it to establish itself as the party not of the rich , but of those who aspire to one day be rich .

GOP 's Rubio rips Obama

This is a kinder and gentler Marco , and also a wiser one . When he entered the Senate , he expressed support for the ghastly immigration law in Arizona , which has served as a recipe for racial profiling of Latinos . He also opposed the DREAM Act , which would have offered legal status to young illegal immigrants who went to college or joined the military .

There was that one awkward moment near the end where Rubio , his voice cracking and his throat dry , quickly reached for a bottle of water . Social media lit up . His critics joked that the gesture was such a terrible distraction that Americans should just ignore the whole speech .

Really ? The water did n't bother me . But Rubio 's remarks did make me thirsty for new leadership in the White House .
