-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The latest controversy over whether North Korea has the technology to fit a nuclear warhead on a missile is not the first time American intelligence agencies have been at odds in assessing Pyongyang 's capabilities . And it is not the first time the Pentagon 's intelligence arm , the Defense Intelligence Agency -LRB- DIA -RRB- has been out front in reaching the most alarmist conclusions about North Korea -- one with which other U.S. agencies have disagreed .

The DIA assessment , disclosed by a Congressman at a hearing on April 11 , was that the DIA has `` moderate confidence '' North Korea has developed a nuclear warhead that can be delivered by a ballistic missile . Within hours , however , James Clapper , Director of National Intelligence , released a statement saying the DIA report did not represent the consensus of the intelligence community , and that `` North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile , '' -- a view echoed by a Pentagon spokesman and the South Korean Defense Ministry .

The sharply different judgments about Pyongyang 's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998 , when a fierce debate erupted within the American intelligence community after U. S. spy satellites discovered an underground complex at Kumchangri , not far from North Korea 's main nuclear facility at Yongbyon .

The DIA insisted that Kumchangri was a construction site for a secret , underground nuclear weapons facility and that its existence proved Pyongyang was cheating on the Agreed Framework , the Clinton administration 's 1994 deal under which the North froze operations at Yongbyon in return for economic and diplomatic concessions from Washington .

On August 17 , 1998 , the New York Times published a story that revealed the intelligence findings , turning what had been an internal intelligence debate into a public firestorm of controversy -- just as the congressman 's revelations did on Thursday .

The Times report , with headline `` North Korea Site An A-Bomb Plant , US Agencies Say '' created major problems . In Washington , the Clinton administration came under attack for Pyongyang 's alleged violations of the Agreed Framework . And , unless the issue was handled with great skill , the tenuous link between the U.S. and North Korea that has existed since the 1994 deal would collapse .

In the spring of 1999 , Chuck Kartman , Washington 's Special Envoy for Peace Talks with North Korea -- nicknamed `` Iron Butt '' for his ability to sit patiently and listen to North Korean envoys spew out venom , bombast and threats across the negotiating table -- engaged in protracted talks with his North Korean counterparts .

In May , Kartman convinced the North to agree to permit U.S. inspectors to visit Kumchangri . In addition , after initially demanding a payment of $ 300 million dollars for a one-time visit , North Korea eventually accepted a shipment of 100,000 tons of potatoes as the `` price '' of permitting the inspection .

Accompanied by a team of experts , Kartman flew to Pyongyang and the North Koreans took them to Kumchangri . To the Americans ' surprise and embarrassment , they found a large , empty underground cave . There was no evidence of a secret nuclear site .

The crisis passed . According to Gary Samore , then the National Security Council 's Senior Director for Non-Proliferation and subsequently President Obama 's Coordinator for Weapons of Mass Destruction , Counter-Terrorism and Arms Control : `` The conclusion was that Kumchangri was not configured in a way that could be used either for plutonium or for enrichment . So , whatever we thought Kunchangri was , it was n't . It was not nuclear-related . ''

Nearly two decades later , the purpose of the construction site at Kumchangri remains unknown . But the episode underscores the complexities of assessing intelligence on North Korea . The rush to judgment in 1998 , driven by the DIA 's aggressive briefings and the deliberate leak of the story to the media , left many officials at the time cautious , if not downright skeptical , about subsequent intelligence findings .

`` DIA hyped their findings unbelievably , '' one former senior Clinton administration official said to me . `` They mis-stated their level of certainty , and the further up the food chain they went , the more they dropped the caveats , and ended up putting us in a terrible position . ''
