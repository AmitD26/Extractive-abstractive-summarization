D.C. Superior Court Judge Gerald Fisher ruled that the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the District of Columbia should release the transcripts of secret conversations between the lawyers and the judge at the judge 's bench in hearings from earlier this year .

The case of Levy , whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002 , is back in court because defense attorneys for the man convicted of her murder have called into question the testimony of a key prosecution witness .

Ingmar Guandique , 31 , was sentenced in 2011 to two concurrent 60-year sentences for murder with kidnapping and murder with attempted robbery in Levy 's death . He was in court Monday wearing an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs .

In February 2009 , police arrested Guandique , who was already in prison for attacking two other women in the park where Levy 's body was found and who had reportedly spoken about killing her .

New hearings in Chandra Levy case add to mystery

Armando Morales , a convicted felon and former gang member , testified at Guandique 's trial that Guandique confessed to him that he killed Levy . Guandique repeatedly said at his trial he had nothing to do with Levy 's death .

A status hearing on the case has been scheduled for September 26 .

The sealed information is from hearings late last year and earlier this year . They are transcripts of discussions that lawyers and Fisher had at the judge 's bench , which observers in the courtroom could not hear .

Condit , who served in Congress until 2003 , is currently on the board of directors of the Phoenix Institute of Desert Agriculture , a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable farming .
