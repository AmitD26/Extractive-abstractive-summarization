Budapest , Hungary -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the world 's most wanted Nazi war suspects , Sandor Kepiro , 97 , went on trial Thursday in Hungary charged with the slayings of 36 Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad , Serbia , in 1942 .

Kepiro , a former officer in the Hungarian gendarmerie , protested his innocence in the Budapest municipal court saying , `` I am not guilty , and I have always lived a decent life . ''

He denied having killed anyone during a raid on Novi Sad , instead claiming to have saved the lives of five people .

Hungary sided with the Nazis early in World War II and in January 1942 , its troops killed about 3,000 Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad , according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia . Hungary had annexed the territory at the time .

Kepiro said he never participated in or saw any deportation of Jews .

When the trial began Kepiro said he could not hear and hardly sees anything , but as proceedings continued he appeared to be able to follow them .

`` This is a show , Sandor , '' he shouted at the defendant when Kepiro arrived in court , suggesting that he was acting more frail than he was .

`` Time does not diminish the guilt of the killers and old age should not protect those who committed such heinous crimes , '' he said .

Kepiro sued Zuroff for libel for calling him a war criminal . A Budapest court acquitted Zuroff this week .

Hungary 's pro-Nazi government resisted deporting its own Jews to death camps , according to the Holocaust Encyclopedia . Germany occupied Hungary in 1944 .
