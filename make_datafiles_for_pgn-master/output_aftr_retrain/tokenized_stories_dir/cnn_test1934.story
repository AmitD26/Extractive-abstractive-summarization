Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa , 48 , began his protest on November 14 , his aide , Harpal Singh Cheema , told CNN .

Those who support Khalsa 's hunger strike say it is long overdue that the cases of those Sikhs be reviewed .

An armed Sikh rebellion operated in Punjab , the heartland of the faith , from the 1980s to the early 1990s , when it was crushed .

Hiding from the massacre : 1984 remembered

Many political leaders were assassinated during the insurgency .

India 's then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984 , the same year she had ordered a military raid on the Golden Temple , the holiest of the Sikh shrines , to flush out militants holed up inside .

Three of the six convicts whose freedom Khalsa is fighting for were arrested in 1995 for their alleged role in the assassination of Punjab 's then-Chief Minister , Beant Singh , in a car bombing . They were sentenced to life in prison .

The others were convicted under a draconian anti-terror law that has since been repealed , civil rights lawyer H.S. Phoolka said .

The six Sikh inmates are lodged in the jails of the federally-administered territory of Chandigarh and in Punjab , Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh states .

`` A number of Sikhs were falsely arrested , charged and convicted . Many of them are still in jails despite their old age . It 's my personal opinion all such prisoners â € '' whichever community they may belong to â € '' should be set free now , '' said Sukhdev Singh Bhaur , general secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee -LRB- SGPC -RRB- , the top Sikh religious administration in Punjab .

`` It 's up to the discretion of those governments , administrations to reconsider their cases . We are trying our best , '' Punjab government spokesman Harcharan Bains said .

In India , state authorities can review a lifer 's case after a prisoner serving that sentence has spent 14 years , Bains and lawyer Phoolka said .

`` But , otherwise , a life sentence means sentence until the last breath of the prisoner , '' Bains said .

Rights attorneys , however , say authorities are selectively rejecting reviews of Sikh inmates incarcerated during the Punjab militancy .

`` There were serious human rights abuses during the Punjab insurgency , '' the human rights group said .

Official figures put the number of those killed in the 1984 anti-Sikh attacks at 2,733 in the Indian capital alone . Human rights activists say the death toll was much higher .

Himself a Sikh and the country 's first non-Hindu head of government , Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh issued a public apology for the deadly events -- 21 years after their occurrence .

`` I have no hesitation in apologizing not only to the Sikh community but the whole Indian nation because what took place in 1984 is the negation of the concept of nationhood and what enshrined in our Constitution . So , I am not standing on any false prestige . On behalf of our government , on behalf of the entire people of this country , I bow my head in shame that such thing took place , '' Singh told India 's Parliament in an impassioned address in 2005 .
