The 879 personnel fighting the fire reported `` good progress '' in bringing the blaze under 20 % control , up from 5 % the day before , authorities said .

The cause of the fire is under investigation .

Fire Chief Martha Karstens of the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade lost her home in the fire , which began Monday .

The loss marked a turnabout in her job , in which she deals with fire damage to other people 's homes .

Several neighborhoods were evacuated , and their roads remained closed Wednesday , but the scenic Pacific Coast Highway , or California Highway 1 , was open , officials said .

`` Crews made good progress containing fire perimeter along the south end , ahead of an anticipated trough approaching the west coast , '' Los Padres National Forest officials said in a prepared statement .

That weather trough was expected to bring strong winds late Wednesday .
