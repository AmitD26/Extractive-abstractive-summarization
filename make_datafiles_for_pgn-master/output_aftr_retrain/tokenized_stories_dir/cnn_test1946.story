Coming in third is Disney 's animated pic `` Frozen '' with $ 19.2 million , down only 15 percent from last weekend . The $ 150 million 3D musical has been in theaters for four weekends and boasts a $ 191.6 million domestic total . `` Frozen '' opened this weekend in Mexico , Italy , Lebanon , Greece , South Africa , Finland , Hong Kong , and Venezuela , and will continue its worldwide expansion in the coming weeks , including a release in China at a date still to be determined . Its current global total is $ 344.2 million .

It would go on to gross $ 132 million domestically , making it the first Russell film to cross the $ 100 million mark . In addition to having the benefit of Russell 's recent successes , Sony 's `` American Hustle '' has the bonus selling points of stars Christian Bale and Amy Adams â € '' both of whom are receiving raves for their performances .
