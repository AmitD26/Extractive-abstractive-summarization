Zintan , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan rebels said Monday they remain in control of a key western town they seized from Moammar Gadhafi forces Saturday , although clashes continued just east of it .

The Libyan government said earlier its forces had retaken Bir al-Ghanam but Jumma Ibrahim , a rebel spokesman in the western mountain region , said the claims were false .

Rebel commander Nasser abu al Qassem told CNN Monday that the rebels are holding firm on the town 's eastern outskirts , squaring off against loyalists just a few miles away at a key road junction the rebels hope to take in the days ahead .

Meanwhile , bombs rained down on Tripoli overnight , the sky lit up by explosives . Multiple airstrikes and secondary explosions could be heard continuously for the better part of an hour .

Entire neighborhoods of the city were already without electricity -- due to shortages of fuel -- prior to the pre-dawn strikes . Parts of Tripoli have been suffering for days from such blackouts .

Al Qassem said NATO forces had informed the rebels that the Gadhafi forces included up to 40 trucks outfitted with heavy weapons , and rebel forces had reinforced their positions Sunday and overnight into Monday . He was confident the rebel lines would hold and said there had been no concerted effort so far by the government troops to try to re-take Bir al-Ghanam .

Commanders said taking the junction where Gadhafi forces remain east of the town would provide a direct route to the coastal city of Azzawayia .
