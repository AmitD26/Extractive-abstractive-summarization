Amid the muddle of speculation , possibilities and blind alleys , are there logical explanations in this mysterious disappearance ? The short answer is yes . But what , of what we know so far , makes sense exactly ?

A double failure ? Not likely , unless there was a serious electronic systems failure -LRB- more on that later -RRB- .

The only other plausible explanation would have been that the crew moved the knob to the off position . No professional flight crew would knowingly turn off a transponder in flight .

It is also possible the airplane flew out of ATC radar range by navigational error . Or as part of its assigned route , Malaysia 370 might have participated in a well-defined procedure for nonradar environments .

Opinion : Conspiracy theories build around disappearance

The North Atlantic track system between North America and Europe is a good example of an area where such a procedure would be used . Airplanes entering the tracks are required to fly at assigned altitudes and air speeds , separated laterally and vertically . Pilots verbally report set latitude and longitude positions on their cleared flight plans to a ground-based service called AIRINC .

The 777 is one of the most advanced electronic airplanes built . Data is constantly being processed and transmitted to regulate internal systems , from flight controls to fuel systems and hundreds more . Much of this data is being transmitted automatically to the airline . This data is used for dispatch computations and maintenance , among other uses .

For argument 's sake , let 's say a major mechanical failure occurred . The crew might have been preoccupied with a serious problem as they progressed through the appropriate electronic checklist . A mayday call might not have been first on their agenda . All pilots are taught to `` aviate , navigate and communicate , '' in that order . Could the mechanical problem have been serious enough for the crew to have lost control of the airplane before a distress signal was sent ?

For the flight time to Beijing , the center tank would most likely have been empty except for residual fuel as a matter of 777 procedure . The main wing tanks would have sufficient fuel for the trip . Could a short that caused a spark within a fuel boost pump have ignited the trapped vapor within the center tank ?

Now that the Chinese satellite image led nowhere , perhaps the rather chaotic search should be conducted over land . A different route may have been chosen if the crew had actually made the decision to return or divert elsewhere .

Let 's keep the speculation in perspective . The accident investigation process can be tedious , if not arduous . But the process is well-organized , especially in the United States ; the NTSB 's participation will be of tremendous assistance .

Airplanes do n't just disappear .

Abend : Although remote , consider the possibility of a fuel tank explosion

He says no debris field has been located in the ocean , time to search land

Abend : If the airplane just fell out of the sky , it did n't happen as a result of only one factor
