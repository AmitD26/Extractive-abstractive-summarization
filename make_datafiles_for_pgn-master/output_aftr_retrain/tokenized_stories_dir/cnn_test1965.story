Security because areas such as Chechnya , Dagestan and Georgia -- all nations close to Sochi 's location on the north coast of the Black Sea -- have ongoing issues with Russia that have a history of violence .

Gay rights because Russia 's government banned what it defined as `` gay propaganda '' in 2013 , a move that has seen widespread criticism from competing athletes and areas of the international media , and has led to some high-profile politicians refusing to attend .

Detractors argue such laws fly in the face of the Olympics charter , which states the Games , like sport itself , should be available to all , regardless of race , sex or sexual orientation and free of discrimination .

Former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov has complained of `` embezzlement and kick backs '' and questioned where $ 20-30 billion has been spent .

Security

Police are at all major sites in good numbers , along all major roads traveled thus far , and are supported by military personnel as well . Vehicle searches are thorough and mandatory for entry into International Olympic Commission -LRB- IOC -RRB- managed territories , even freeways have security atop embankments and escarpments monitoring the traffic drive past .

The much touted `` Ring of Steel , '' on the face of it at least , is in place and high profile .

Venues

Accommodation

Journalists are known to be a vainglorious lot but there is a serious point here that rooms booked for large expense , months in advance , are not ready and their state was not communicated well to those affected .

At best it 's something of a PR disaster . Frustrating those with the loudest mouths is an early own-goal to concede and one that London , which contended with its own doom-mongers ahead of the 2012 opening ceremony , avoided with aplomb .

Transport

The `` World 's Most Expensive Road '' has had its detractors -- the joke doing the rounds is that it would have been cheaper to lay caviar as a surface than the Tarmac used . But the estimated $ 8.6 billion cost for less than 30 miles aside , the road -- as well as the railway that runs parallel to it -- is nothing short of an engineering marvel .

The tunnels are many , the steel bridges are myriad and concrete supports and structures , which hold the transport arteries in the air , creep up the snow-capped slopes like a giant , monolithic ivy . The buses , across the IOC zone , are plentiful and regular too .

Cost

The investment from the Russian government to make the Games a reality is reputed to have risen above $ 50 billion and by anyone 's standards , bar maybe a politician called Putin , that 's a number beyond imagination or moral reckoning .

Could such an expenditure ever be justified ? Well , before any judgment , it should at least be considered that Sochi is very different to the Vancouver , Turin or even London scenario .

Russian officials claim the sporting cost of the Games is $ 6.4 billion , and the vast outlay on transport links , power supplies and sewerage should be seen as regional development and not included in the headline budget . The viability of its legacy will be a story for another day .

The intangible vibe

One of the most striking memories of the London 2012 experience was the feelgood factor created by an army of volunteers who turned out in their droves to help the Olympic effort prove a success .

Sochi looks well-placed to continue this momentum . Many of the temporary workforce , clad in rainbow-colored 2014 Games-themed mountain apparel , stand outside for much of the day -- braving freezing temperatures -- so they can show the way to those who are lost , give advice to those confused and to make the travel-weary feel welcome .
