The question was the latest posed by the jury considering the evidence in the case against Michael Dunn , who says he acted in self-defense when he opened fire on four teenagers in an SUV in Jacksonville in November 2012 .

Prosecutors contend it was an act of murder . Dunn has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis . He also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder . If Dunn is found guilty , he faces up to life in prison .

The questions came during the second day of deliberations in a case that has drawn parallels to the trial of George Zimmerman in the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin , which also had racial overtones and claims of self-defense .

Jury questions

Among the requests from the jury was to see surveillance video from the gas station where Dunn shot Davis .

The video contains 20 minutes of footage from multiple angles , though a shorter version showing only one angle was slated to be shown in court .

The jurors posed another question later in the day : `` Can we get that dummy with the sticks ? '' -- a reference to a flexible mannequin and three dowels used to demonstrate the angles of the bullets as they entered Davis ' body .

Judge Russell Healey said he 'd grant the request if both the prosecution and defense agreed , but after examining the dummy , defense attorney Cory Strolla said he felt the dowels in the body had been repositioned and objected to the jury seeing it again .

Then the jury asked the judge when the letter was written . The answer : June 2013 .

In closing arguments Wednesday , prosecutors said inconsistencies between Dunn 's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot the teen .

His attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty . He pleaded with jurors to find Dunn not guilty .

In testimony Tuesday , Dunn said he fired in self-defense after the teen threatened him with a gun .

`` My intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , '' he said . `` It just worked out that way . ''

` There was no gun '

She noted that Dunn fired 10 shots at the SUV , three of them while the car was fleeing .

Dunn also left the scene of the shooting , went back to a hotel where they were staying and walked his dog , she said .

And he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911 , Wolfson said .

`` This defendant did n't tell anyone because he thought he had gotten away with murder , '' she said , adding that Dunn had no idea a witness had taken down his tag number .

` Rap crap '

`` He got angry at the fact that a 17-year-old kid decided not to listen to him , '' she said , adding that Dunn then pulled a 9 mm gun out of his glove box and shot `` systematically and methodically '' at the SUV . `` Nobody denied that Jordan was talking back . But this defendant took it upon himself to silence Jordan Davis forever . ''

Dunn testified Tuesday that he saw Davis reach down and pick something up , and that he saw about `` 4 inches of a barrel '' from a 12 - or 20-gauge shotgun above the window .

Nine of the 10 rounds hit the car , and three of them struck Davis , one of them cutting through his liver , his lung and his aorta .

Strolla noted that the SUV departed the gas station after the shooting and was gone for three minutes before it returned , enough time for the youths to have dumped a gun .

Detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting , he said .

` You have reasonable doubt '

Witnesses testified that child locks on the SUV were engaged , and that Davis -- who was seated in the rear -- could not have gotten out of the back seat to threaten Dunn . But Strolla said the teen could simply have opened the door by putting his hand out the window , which was open .

`` You have lack of evidence , conflicts of evidence and reasonable doubt , '' he told the jurors .

The court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors , fearing they could be the subject of threats , but a document obtained by CNN affiliate WTLV-TV in Jacksonville showed the makeup of the jury .

It has four white females , two black females , four white males , an Asian female and a Hispanic male , plus four alternates .
