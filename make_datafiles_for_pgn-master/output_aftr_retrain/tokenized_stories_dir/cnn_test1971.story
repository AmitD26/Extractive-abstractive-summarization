Those divisions , for the most part , are accepted and definitely do n't make headlines . That 's not the case for a renowned golf course in the Deep South that 's raising lots of questions about the relevance and fairness of exclusive , male-only clubs in the 21st century .

Since opening in 1933 , Augusta National Golf Club has not allowed women to join , although women can play as guests of members . But conversation swirled around the men-only membership policy at the prestigious Georgia club as it prepared to open the Masters Tournament on Thursday .

When it comes to the famed club -- and the dwindling number of exclusive men-only social clubs around the country -- it 's not about enjoying the company of a single gender , critics say , and it 's definitely not about golf .

Even now , gender-restricted environments start early , when children join Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts or other gender-specific activities . K-12 education has seen a boost in single-sex schools since 2006 , when the Bush administration relaxed regulations on how public schools could implement it .

`` Boys ' and girls ' experiences are different growing up . It 's valuable to have spaces for both girls and boys to explore issues that are unique to their experiences , '' she said .

Girls can participate in the Boy Scouts through its subsidiary group , Exploring , and a Girl Scout troop in Colorado allowed a 7-year-old transgender child into its ranks last year , although some later protested with cookie boycotts .

Adult civic organizations began to open their doors to women in the 1970s and 1980s after a series of lawsuits . The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that Rotary clubs could not exclude women .

Most of the private mahogany-paneled city clubs of New York and Washington , opened membership to women after being sued , said Martha Burk , former chair of the National Council of Women 's Organizations A few men-only social clubs remain , such as New York 's Racquet and Tennis Club , where a manager told CNN `` we do n't respond to any questions '' before hanging up .

Other private golf clubs such as Preston Trail Golf Club in Dallas and Burning Tree Club in Bethesda , Maryland , do n't specifically say `` men-only , '' in their rules , but they only refer to men 's clothing requirements and locker rooms .

Richard Lapchick , director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics In Sport at University of Central Florida , said men-only clubs are fading as professional sports embrace diversity , but change is slow .

`` The no-girls-allowed rule keeps women from accessing that power where they can conduct business and rise in professional development and create their own power networks , '' said Veronica Arreola , assistant director of the Center for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Illinois-Chicago .

The idea of golf clubs as power hubs has become so entrenched in corporate culture that women 's groups have hosted clinics to teach the game to women so they can hold their own on the green , Arreola said .

The same kinds of discussions are n't necessarily happening in women 's book clubs or at the local Curves gym , the ubiquitous franchise marketed to women .

`` Million-dollar deals are not going down at Curves , but they are going down at golf clubs , '' said Terry O'Neill , president of NOW , which has men on its board and among its membership .

`` The world turns on human connections ; when power brokers hang together , they do business together , '' Feldt said . `` It really is a big barrier for women to be excluded from a place like Augusta that is so well-known for being the source of power-brokering opportunities . That 's really different from sweating side-by-side on treadmills . ''

Activists say the Augusta National controversy shows gender discrimination is taken more lightly than racial discrimination .

`` If this was the first black male CEO of IBM , and he was not allowed to join , IBM would not even be considering remaining a sponsor or having any other executives in the club , '' said Burk , who made Augusta 's policy a national issue in 2003 . `` Because it 's sex discrimination , they feel empowered to ignore that or treat it as a lesser evil . ''

Several states , including New York and California , have `` public accommodation '' laws that say no one can be excluded from private establishments that sell food to the public or show films , exhibitions or athletic teams -- or places whose operations affect commerce `` among the several states '' -- like clubs where business meetings over lunch might result in corporate mergers .

`` Of course everyone is entitled to a peer group that they enjoy , '' Burk , who is also the author of `` Your Voice , Your Vote : The Savvy Woman 's Guide to Power , Politics , and the Change We Need , '' said . `` That 's different from keeping out people who are qualified and ought to be included in what is essentially a business club , for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except an immutable characteristic such as race and gender .
