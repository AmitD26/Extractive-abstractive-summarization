But he insisted that no compromising information had been revealed .

Sawers `` was appointed 10 days ago to be the head of MI6 , '' said Miliband , using the common term for the Secret Intelligence Service .

But intelligence analyst Glenmore Trenear-Harvey said the leak was at least an embarrassment and possibly much worse .

`` Have you ever seen the foreign secretary more embarrassed ? '' he asked rhetorically .

`` You could have someone come online and insinuate themselves with Lady Sawers ' daughter , '' who reportedly appeared on the Facebook Web site .

An additional reason for red faces is that Sawers will be in charge of a new British cybersecurity organization when he becomes head of MI6 , Trenear-Harvey pointed out .

The new organization , based at GCHQ , another British intelligence agency , will be `` charged with making sure that all the intelligence services are not vulnerable to hacking , identity theft , or phishing , '' Trenear-Harvey said .

This is not the first time a top British intelligence official 's personal details have been leaked .

When Richard Dearlove became the head of MI6 in 1999 , `` his address in Putney was announced , '' forcing the government to put Special Branch police officers there to protect him , Trenear-Harvey said .

And when Stella Rimington became the first publicly named head of MI5 , the domestic security agency , in 1991 , her north London address was revealed .

`` She and her daughter fled the house and were put into an MI5 safe house , '' Trenear-Harvey said .

Foreign service officers `` are advised to exercise caution '' on social-networking Web sites , a Foreign Office representative said , declining to be named , in line with government policy .

Sawers , 53 , is a career foreign policy expert . He was a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair when Blair was prime minister , then became ambassador to Egypt and briefly represented Britain in Iraq . He was political director at the Foreign Office for four years before going to the United Nations in 2007 , according to his biography on the Web site of the British mission to the U.N. .

He is slated to replace John Scarlett in November as head of MI6 .

`` Known as the Chief of SIS or ` C ' -LRB- after the first Chief , Mansfield Smith Cumming , who signed himself ` C ' -RRB- , the Chief is the only serving member of the Service who is officially named in public , '' according to the agency .
