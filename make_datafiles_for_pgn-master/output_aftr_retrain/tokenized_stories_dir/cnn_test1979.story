-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thomas Corless has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando , Florida , 101 times .

`` The Disney Parks are unlike anything else on the planet , '' he said .

Corless , who runs the Disney fan site WDWNT.com , will be in Orlando this weekend to celebrate the theme park resort 's 40th birthday .

People get married there , they go there on their honeymoons -LRB- more than anywhere else in the continental United States -RRB- , and of course it 's a major destination for families .

For those who go over and over again , like Corless , there is a big nostalgia factor . He counts attractions that no longer exist at the park among his favorites .

`` I think the fascination is partly nostalgia for characters & childhood memories and partly the promise of fun , '' the iReporter said . `` You know when you go to Walt Disney World , you are going to have fun . There are n't many places you can take the family and have that guarantee . ''

For other repeat visitors , like Pete Werner , a visit to the resort can mark an important point in their lives .

`` I was newly sober and only had one day to spend at Disney World while in Orlando for business -LSB- in 1993 -RSB- , '' he said . `` My first park was Epcot , and as a result of that visit , I became enamored with everything Disney . I promised myself for each year I stayed sober , I would reward myself with a visit to WDW . ''

Werner does n't think one thing in particular makes the parks so special . Like him , many who visit the parks have one special memory they take with them .

For hard-core fans like Corless , Walt Disney World history is something that is discussed on the many websites devoted to the parks . Here are some important dates in WDW history :

October 1 , 1971 : Nearly five years after the death of Walt Disney , the resort bearing his name officially opens in an area that used to be swampland , with Magic Kingdom theme park attractions like `` It 's a Small World , '' the Haunted Mansion , the Country Bear Jamboree and the Mad Tea Party . The resort surrounding the park would bring in tourists from all over the globe over the next 40 years .

December 15 , 1973 : Pirates of the Caribbean , one of the most popular rides of all time , opens in the Magic Kingdom 's Adventureland .

October 1 , 1982 : Walt Disney 's vision of the future , EPCOT Center -LRB- consisting of Future World and World Showcase -RRB- , opens with attractions such as Spaceship Earth , The Land 's Kitchen Kabaret and World of Motion . Fan favorites Journey into Imagination -LRB- introducing the original characters Dreamfinder and Figment -RRB- and Horizons would open within the year .

September 12 , 1986 : Michael Jackson stars in `` Captain EO , '' which makes its world premiere at EPCOT Center . -LRB- It would return to the park in 2010 , in memory of the pop star , after a 16-year absence . -RRB-

April 22 , 1998 : A fourth park , Disney 's Animal Kingdom , focused on nature and conservation , opens to the public . A roller coaster , Expedition Everest , would be added in 2006 .

October 10 , 1998 : Journey Into Imagination closes , to be reopened as a completely new ride , Journey Into YOUR Imagination , on October 1 , 1999 . The ride , which contains very little of the character Figment , and no Dreamfinder , is poorly received , and closes on October 8 , 2001 , only to return with major changes as Journey Into Imagination with Figment in 2002 . However , some hard-core fans have campaigned to bring back the original ride , or at least Dreamfinder .

December 19 , 1998 : Epcot -LRB- no more `` Center '' in the name -RRB- opens its first thrill ride , Test Track , replacing World of Motion .

July 7 , 2006 : Audio-Animatronic figures of `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' stars Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush are added to the original ride of the same name .

July 4 , 2009 : A new version of the Hall of Presidents show opens at the Magic Kingdom 's Liberty Square with the addition of President Barack Obama .
