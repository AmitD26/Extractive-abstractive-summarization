Washington , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Steve Bucher knew something was ominous about the weather .

`` The sky was just rumbling for 20 minutes , '' Bucher said on CNN 's `` New Day , '' on Monday , the day after a devastating tornado outbreak destroyed his Washington , Illinois , home and dozens of others in several Midwestern states . `` I told my wife I 've just never heard anything like this in my life . ''

The storm took most of his house down to the decking over his walk-out basement , but neither he nor his wife was hurt .

`` Everything else is rebuildable , '' Bucher said . `` I could n't replace her . ''

The storm that destroyed Bucher 's home was part of a multi-state outbreak of tornadoes and powerful winds Sunday that caused damage in several states , including Missouri , Indiana , Michigan and Wisconsin .

Six people died in Illinois and two men were killed in Michigan , according to authorities . As many as 200 people were injured through Illinois , officials said . Some 120 of those injuries came in Washington , said Jon Monken , director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency . Seven of those injuries were `` traumatic , '' Monken said .

Damage was also reported in the adjacent northern Illinois towns of Diamond and Coal City , in Champaign County in central Illinois , in southern Illinois ' Washington County and in Massac County -- in the extreme southern tip of the state .

Another tornado in Washington County , Illinois , east of St. Louis , left a path of debris that stretched more than three miles , according to a preliminary survey by the National Weather Service .

While the bulk of the storm system had moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean and the threat of severe weather Monday was small , damaging wind gusts of up to 40 mph were still possible in parts of the Northeast , CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said Monday morning . In the Great Lakes region , 50 mph gusts were possible , she said .

` Complete destruction '

The storm struck the town of Washington around 11 a.m. Sunday , when many of its 10,000 residents were at church .

That 's where Curt Zehr was when cell phones started chirping out storm alerts and the congregation headed to the basement . His wife and son , Mike , were at home . Zehr 's wife texted to say they 'd seen the tornado hit Washington , about a mile to the south .

Mike Zehr said it was n't long after they saw the storm hit Washington that they realized it was headed straight for them .

`` The next thing we know , it 's completely quiet and the sun 's just shining through the stairs in the basement , '' he said .

And their house was gone .

Dozens of others had similar experiences .

Resident Michelle Crumrine said the winds swept her home and everything in it clean away .

`` A lot of people have a pile of rubble still , and I do n't have anything , '' she said . `` It 's gone . I do n't know where it went . ''

On Monday , a National Weather Service survey team confirmed the storm had winds of 170 mph to 190 mph , producing EF-4 damage , the agency said . Earlier , the weather service had said such a confirmation would make the tornado the most powerful November twister in the state since at least 1950 .
