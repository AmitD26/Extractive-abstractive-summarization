Brazil , the team which manages to thrill and frustrate almost simultaneously , clinched its place in the quarterfinal of the World Cup following a tension-fueled encounter with Chile .

A 3-2 victory on penalties following a 1-1 draw in Belo Horizonte means Luiz Felipe Scolari 's side 's quest to win the World Cup on home soil remains alive .

Having already scored an own-goal to gift Brazil a 19th minute lead , Gonzalo Jara was to be the fall guy at the death .

With Brazil leading the shootout 3-2 , Jara needed to score to keep his country in the tournament .

As he stood , eyes firmly on the goal , two nations held their breath -- but only one broke out into ecstasy as the ball smashed against the post and rolled away to safety .

As those in red flopped to the ground , their bodies bruised and beaten , tears running down their faces , their opponents danced their way around the field , perhaps more out of relief than happiness .

Brazil , still haunted by its failure 64 years ago when it was beaten by Uruguay in the 1950 final , can not afford anything but triumph .

This was not the showing of a side which appeared ready to become World champion .

And yet , before kickoff , every single historic fact pointed towards a Brazil victory .

Brazil , which had not lost a competitive home game since 1975 , has dominated encounters between the two sides in recent years .

On the 26 occasions Chile had ventured onto Brazilian turf to face the host nation , it had lost 20 and drawn six -- not a record to inspire confidence ahead of a last-16 clash .

Add to that Brazil 's victory over Chile in South Africa four years ago and it 's easy to understand why Scolari 's men headed into the contest as the favorite .

Its victory over world champion Spain during the group stage gave a glimpse of the talent within the squad and led by the prolific Alexis Sanchez , it soon gave notice that it was not about to allow Brazil to simply swat it aside .

The 22-year-old , who had scored four goals in his opening three games , received a kick in the first half which appeared to leave him struggling .

Chile , so disciplined in defense and careful in possession , appeared to be the calmer of the two as nerves began to creep into Brazil 's game .

As those draped in yellow packed inside the Estadio Mineirao began to raise their voices , its players began to respond .

But instead of the goal it so badly craved , Brazil could only find frustration .

Hulk , the man with a comic book hero 's name but with the first touch of a dastardly villain , thought he had found a way through .

As the Brazilians around the world rejoiced , the whistle of English referee Howard Webb could scarcely be heard .

First , there was disbelief . Then there was frustration . Then anger .

Webb 's call looked to have taken the wind out of Brazil 's sails -- and it could have been heading out of the tournament but for a wonderful save by Cesar .

With both sets of players appearing to settle for extra-time , chances were at a premium , although Bravo denied both Neymar and Hulk as the clock ticked down .

Extra time became a war of attrition with both sides guilty of giving the ball away and both sets of players desperate not to lose rather than being desperate to win .

And yet , with a minute of extra time remaining , Chile came within millimeters of dumping Brazil out of the World Cup .

`` If we had scored , we would have made history for ever . It would have been the ` Mineirazo ' . We so nearly won . ''

With the crossbar still shaking , both sets of players were left to confront the dreaded scenario of penalty kicks .

Luiz was the first man to step up -- showing no sign of being overawed by the occasion and coolly firing the ball past Bravo .

Brazil appeared to be coasting but there was still a twist in the tale as Willian and then Hulk both failed and Aranguiz and Marcelo Diaz brought Chile level .

Up stepped Jara -- the weight of a nation upon his shoulders and a sea of yellow shirts which would drown him given the chance .

First , there was silence . Then came the roar -- the outpouring of relief . Then the singing , the dancing , the realization that Brazil 's dream remains alive .

While Chile 's players fell to the ground inconsolable with grief , Brazil 's ran into each others arms and celebrated .
