Three men of Somali origin and one man born in Iraq were seized Saturday in a raid led by a SWAT team and backed by local police in Gothenburg , Sweden , the country 's Security Service said .

A court named them Monday as Kulan Mohamud Abel , Mahamud Abdi Aziz , Mahmood Salar Sami and Mohamud Abdi Weli , and tax authorities confirmed their nationalities . All are between the ages of 23 and 26 .

The legal papers filed by the prosecutor Tuesday do not accuse them of terrorism , only plotting murder .

But Karin Rosander , a spokeswoman for the Swedish prosecution authority , said that should not be interpreted to mean they are no longer suspected of planning terror .

Prosecutor Agnetha Hilding Qvarnstrom said the men might try to go ahead with the attack or hinder the investigation if they are released .

They were arrested Saturday night on `` probable cause '' of plotting attacks , the highest level of suspicion in the Swedish legal system .

`` He says he has no idea what these accusations are about and that he has no explanation to why he would have been arrested , '' she said , adding that she had gotten `` only very basic and sparse information about what he is accused of . ''

She criticized the police for taking so long to inform her and her client about the details of the accusations .

Lawyers for the other three did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment .

Sami , who was born in Iraq and is now a Swedish citizen , has a long criminal record , court documents show . He has been charged with multiple counts of theft , assault and making threats , among other crimes , and has served several years in prison .

Sweden 's Security Service refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip-off , saying the details of the ongoing investigation could not be discussed .

`` Through these arrests , we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring , '' Malena Rembe , head analyst at the Swedish Security Service , told CNN affiliate TV4 Sunday .

The Swedish Security Service did warn last year that several Swedes have gone to Somalia for terrorist training .

Sweden is not raising its terror threat level , which is currently at 3 , with 5 as the highest .

An art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time , police said , but they declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests .

A party was going on at the Roda Sten gallery at the time , with about 500 people attending the inauguration of an arts festival , according to an interview with a witness in Goteborgs Posten , a local newspaper .

Stockholm was hit by a suicide bombing in December . The attack on the capital , Sweden 's first suicide bombing , wounded two people in a district full of Christmas shoppers .

Police arrested two people in Gothenburg on suspicion of plotting a bombing in October . They were later released without charge , police said .
