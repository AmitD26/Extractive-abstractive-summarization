-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Truck driver Kevin Roper has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in connection with the crash last weekend that killed comedian James McNair and injured comedian Tracy Morgan .

The question has arisen : Why was he charged with death by auto and aggravated assault before we even know how he was driving ? In this sort of crash , what makes the difference between an accident and a crime ?

Homicide

There are two elements hidden in that definition . First , causation : The defendant has to have caused the death . It must be shown that the defendant caused the crash , the crash caused the death , and that the victim 's death was foreseeable . The concept of recklessness , however , is a little more difficult to grasp . Recklessness and negligence are often spoken of together , but they are two very different points on a `` mens rea '' -LRB- state of mind -RRB- spectrum .

Recklessness is totally different . Both the negligent person and the reckless person create a risk of bodily injury , but the reckless person does so in conscious disregard of that risk . So , the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant 's driving created a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury . With recklessness , the state must also prove that the defendant consciously disregarded this risk , which was a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would have done .

So how on earth does a prosecutor get into a defendant 's brain to know what he was thinking at the moment of impact ? The truth is that we never know for sure what a defendant actually thought -- unless , of course , the defendant tells us what he thought .

The 24-hour alternative could be proved with circumstantial evidence , such as records , communications , or even witness testimony . Either way , the state would have the burden of proving sleep . If the defendant admits to dozing off , he 's saved the state the inconvenience of its burden . See why criminal defense attorneys are always begging clients to not try to talk their way out of trouble ?

This kind of homicide is a second-degree offense , punishable by up to 10 years in state prison , and there is a presumption of incarceration . This means if he 's convicted , he 's probably going to prison .

Assault

Roper has also been charged with `` assault by auto '' in connection with the other injuries caused . Assault by auto also has the recklessness standard , but here the seriousness of injury also guides the degree of the crime charged . Assault by auto is a crime of the fourth degree if serious bodily injury results .

Ultimately , for both assault and death by auto , the prosecution must prove reckless behavior beyond a reasonable doubt . If Roper made statements or admissions to the police about falling asleep at the wheel , those statements could dramatically alter the course of the prosecution against him , potentially conceding a major part of the state 's case against him .
