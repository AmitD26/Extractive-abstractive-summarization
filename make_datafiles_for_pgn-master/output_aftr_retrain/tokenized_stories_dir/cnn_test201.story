-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We do n't use the F-word in my family . And by F , I 'm not talking about the F-bombs , because those get dropped from time to time . I 'm talking about the word `` fat . '' The word is banned from my house with the same vigilance that racist language would not be tolerated . Extreme , perhaps , but I have a husband who went through a chubby stage and still bears the scars of his prepubescent ridicule . I also have two tween children with very different body types and low thresholds for teasing . Mention weight or body shape among my family and the reaction can be nuclear , unleashing a tsunami of tears , screams and `` I hate you ! ''

Extreme body awareness and the barf-starve-smoke-yourself-to-thinness regimen is hardly new for teenagers and young women . But the age at which the obsession is starting seems to be creeping even younger . Today , according to the Duke Center for Eating Disorders at Duke University , more than 40 % of all 9 - and 10-year-old girls have already been on a diet .

The National Eating Disorders Association reports that 40-60 % of children between ages 6 and 12 are worried about their weight and 70 % want to slim down .

Maybe this is n't so surprising given the aggressively narrow proportions in girls ' clothing these days in trendy skinny jeans , Lycra leggings and unforgiving clingy tops that are all the rage among the under-12 set . It 's no wonder that young girls are more aware than ever of their own mini-muffin tops or `` baby fat '' as grandmas call it . Compound clothes with the omnipresent camera phone , photo stream and `` selfies , '' and it 's a recipe ripe for self-loathing .

In fact , my daughter 's elementary school participated in an amped-up fitness program this year . The program included cardio and flexibility tests , weighing the children and taking a body mass index . The results were printed with color-coded columns that red-flagged danger zones for kids at risk in various categories .

Having just been to the pediatrician for my daughter 's annual physical , she and I knew exactly what she weighed and that she was perfectly healthy . But the number on the scale startled her . On the cusp of puberty , many of the girls ' bodies are changing , and emotionally they are more fragile than ever . I told our school principal that I did n't want my daughter weighed . Even at age 9 or 10 , regardless of the number on the scale , it just felt like a public shaming .

A few years ago there was a public outcry when Dara-Lynn Weiss documented in Vogue the severe diet she put her 7-year-old daughter on . The article was part confessional about Weiss ' own body issues and struggle with food , as well as her yearlong quest to slim down her daughter . Weiss got the mother lode of scorn heaped on her by the blogosphere and even the media . But after Weiss learned that her daughter was obese at 6 years old standing 4 feet 4 inches and weighing 93 pounds , did n't she have to take some serious intervention ?

`` Mommy you 'll be so proud of me , I did n't eat the white dressing . I ate the clear one ! '' she wrote .

The letter had me laughing and a little worried . At 8 years old , had I started the beginning of a life-long eating disorder or am I just making for a conscientious and healthy eater ?

`` As parents you have to set boundaries but you do n't want to make certain foods off limits or shameful . You also do n't want to set it up that every time you have the chocolate cake that it 's indulgent or sinful , '' Mysko said . `` We do n't want kids thinking about calories or fat grams and stoking that fear . And shame is not a motivator of healthy behavior . ''

`` Weight is a fear that so many parents have . But we have to shift the focus away from weight and BMI . It 's less about making sure kids do n't get fat or that fat kids get thin , '' Mysko said . `` The conversation should be about how can we make all kids healthy and feel good about themselves . ''
