In fact , one of his most satisfying and famous wins was against Al Gore , the Democrats and super-attorney David Boies in the contested 2000 election . Olson represented George W. Bush .

The rest , as they say , is history . Olson won , Boies lost . That is except in the movie `` Recount , '' as they both joked to me . Boies won the docudrama .

On Wednesday , the two men won , this time together .

They teamed up to argue against Proposition 8 , which bans gay marriage in California . The legal team won in a stunning and clear decision .

The plaintiffs , U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker wrote , `` demonstrated by overwhelming evidence that Proposition 8 violates their due process and equal protection rights , '' ruling it unconstitutional .

`` Civil rights battles are won by fighting for civil rights . ... We 're representing real people , who are being deprived of their constitutional rights , and we tell them to wait ? For what ? For how long ? ''

It 's interesting , in a way , because opposition to gay marriage increasingly looks like it cuts along a generational divide .

One recent study showed that 58 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 support gay marriage , while only 22 percent of those 65 and older feel the same way . So if the issue will gradually resolve itself , some say , why take it to court now ?

Even some pro-gay marriage groups were skeptical at first , worried that Olson and Boies were setting the cause up for failure . Still other legal scholars say that the two super-lawyers are driven by ego and relish that one last shot at arguing an historic case before the court . Both men cringe at that .

And what about the charge that the two lawyers figure they can game the high court -- even a conservative one ?

Ah , says Olson . `` We 're not taking for granted any votes on the Supreme Court . We have so much respect for the judges that are hearing this case and the justices of the Supreme Court that will hear this case , none of whom have made up their minds . ''

Is he sure ? `` Yes , '' he smiles . `` They have not heard the arguments . ''
