Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson 's health deteriorated so badly in the last weeks of his life that he could n't perform some of his trademark dance moves , according to evidence presented in his family 's lawsuit against a concert promoter .

Show director Kenny Ortega sent Jackson home from a rehearsal that night because of his strange behavior .

`` He was a basket case and Kenny was concerned he would embarrass himself on stage , or worse yet -- get hurt , '' Houghdahl wrote . `` The company is rehearsing right now , but the DOUBT is pervasive . ''

Executives asked : Did Jackson need a straightjacket ?

AEG Live lawyers argue it was Jackson who chose and supervised Murray and that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous propofol treatments being administered in the privacy of Jackson 's home .

Phillips met with Dr. Murray , Michael Jackson and Ortega at Jackson 's home a day after getting the Houghdahl e-mails , according to testimony .

While Jackson lawyers argue that meeting was intended to pressure Murray to make sure Jackson was ready for rehearsals , AEG lawyers contend Dr. Murray assured producers nothing was wrong with him .

AEG 's lawyer showed jurors a clip Thursday of Jackson performing several non-consecutive 360-degree spins while rehearsing his song `` Billie Jean '' on June 5 , 2009 .

Jackson lawyers , in their rebuttal Friday , showed the jurors the side-by-side comparison of the routine in 2001 and the one weeks before Jackson 's death that was seen in the `` This Is It '' documentary made from rehearsal video .

`` Anywhere in the movie does it show Michael Jackson doing multiple 360 spins ? '' Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked Phillips .
