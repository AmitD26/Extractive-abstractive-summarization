Sharapova eventually won it 4-6 , 6-4 , 7-6 -LRB- 5 -RRB- and the two players burst out laughing when they shook hands at the net .

`` The match was a joke , it was like playing a football match in the rain , '' said Li , who came close to her first title since winning the French Open almost a year ago .

`` Even when we were sent off court , you had to still concentrate for every second , it was tiring for both players .

`` You could not relax . It was tense . When we came back out , she was the tougher player . But I take some positives away . It 's getting close to Roland Garros and I think I hit the ball well . I also moved her around the court well . ''

Sharapova heads to Roland Garros with a second clay-court title of the year under her belt . Not traditionally a threat on the slow surface , the world No. 2 has only lost once on clay in 2012 -- to Serena Williams .

`` This is a great win for me going into Roland Garros , '' Sharapova said . `` It will be nice to have a week off now , after playing three tournaments in the last four weeks . I 'll have to time to recover , mentally and physically . ''

Sharapova can complete a career Grand Slam if she wins in Paris .
