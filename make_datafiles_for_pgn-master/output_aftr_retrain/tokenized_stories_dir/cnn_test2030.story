Carrabassett Valley , Maine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Several ski-lift riders fell to the ground and others were trapped in the air Tuesday when a lift a broke down at Sugarloaf Ski Resort in Maine .

Before the accident , high winds had delayed the opening of the lift . Conditions at the time of the accident were windy , but not unusually so following a major snowstorm , a spokesman for the resort said .

More than 200 people were trapped up to 90 minutes and as many as nine were injured , officials said .

Ethan Austin , a spokesman for the resort , said the derailment on one tower of the Spillway East lift happened around 10:30 a.m. ET , when lift 's cable skipped over the edge of a pulley . Five of the lift 's chairs fell 25 to 30 feet and hit the ground , he said .

Winds had diminished by midmorning and resort personnel checked the lift prior to opening , Sugarloaf said in a statement . Austin said conditions were basically what is expected after a major storm .

Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington , Maine , was treating eight patients , according to spokeswoman Jill Gray . She could not provide the nature of the injuries or the conditions of the patients . A ninth person originally was taken by ambulance to Franklin Memorial , but that person had to be taken by helicopter to Maine Medical Center in Portland , Gray said .

Sugarloaf said seven people were injured .

Matt Rolfson , 17 , of Albion , Maine , was on a parallel lift with a friend and shot video from his helmet cam of injured skiers .

He told CNN his lift was unaffected and he skied down later to offer assistance .

High winds were gusting between 30 mph and 50 mph in the area at the time , according to CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras , and temperatures at the resort were well below freezing .

Austin said Tuesday afternoon there were an estimated 220 people on the more than 100 chairs on the lift , and the process of evacuating everyone from the chairs dangling above the resort was under way .

`` You had to slide off the chair lift 40 feet off the ground into a swing , '' Atkinson said . After that , skiers were lowered down to the ground and had to ski to the base of the mountain , he said .

Franklin County Emergency officials contacted Gov. John Baldacci with updates on the incident and subsequent rescues , according to David Farmer , Baldacci 's deputy chief of staff .

`` We 're deeply concerned about those who were injured , '' said Austin , `` and we 're committed to understanding the cause of this incident . We want our guests to have fun , but our first priority is their safety . ''

The resort is located about 100 miles north of Portland , Maine .
