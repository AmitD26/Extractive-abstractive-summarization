Khalifa Haftar said Wednesday that the General National Congress , the interim parliament , had failed the people and that its mismanagement of the country had turned Libya into `` a state sponsor of terror ... and a hideout for terrorists . ''

He made his call for a new , civilian council to take its place during a televised news conference in Benghazi .

This council , he said , would have three main tasks : appointing a caretaker emergency government , overseeing the upcoming parliamentary elections and handing over power to the new parliament .

The country 's electoral commission announced that elections would be held next month , the state news agency LANA reported Tuesday , in what seemed to be a move to try to ease tensions that drove Libya to the brink in recent days .

The declared goal of the LNA is to eradicate Islamist militants from Libya , including Ansar al-Sharia -- the group blamed for the September 11 , 2012 deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi .

This week , Haftar 's so-called `` Operation Dignity , '' which he has described as an open-ended war on terrorism in Libya , seemed to gain more support from military units , officials and armed groups across the country .

The chiefs of staff of the Libyan Air Force and the navy have announced they are endorsing Operation Dignity .

According to LANA , the headquarters of the chief of staff of the air force came under attack by unknown gunmen on Tuesday night , a short while after the announcement was made . There were no reported casualties in the attack , but damage was caused and offices looted and ransacked .

Those who oppose Haftar , including the government and members of the General National Congress , have accused him of a `` coup attempt . ''

His call for a `` civilian '' council to run the country appeared to be a response to these accusations , made amid much speculation about his political ambitions .

Asked whether his movement was receiving support from Arab Gulf states or any other country , Haftar said they were depending only on `` God and the Libyan people . ''

He has since criticized the government for not getting a grip on violence , particularly from Islamist groups .

Reflecting the continuing state of lawlessness and chaos , explosions and gunfire echoed across the capital in the early hours of Wednesday .
