New Delhi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a New Delhi neighborhood , residents line up in the blistering 45 degree Celsius heat -LRB- 113 Fahrenheit -RRB- carrying empty jerry cans and water bottles , waiting for the government water tanker truck to arrive .

` We only get water once a week and each time we have to fight for it , '' one woman yells .

There are no laid pipelines in unplanned areas like this , so tanker trucks are their only source of water .

Some climb to the top of the tanker truck , reaching out for the pipes . Others jostle and argue below , trying to collect every drop .

Minor scuffles ensue . Many have been waiting for hours for their weekly supply and they are visibly angry .

`` With so little water , we do n't know if we should drink it , cook with it , or bathe with it , '' one woman says .

Finding a long term solution will take time , but for now the Delhi government has finalized plans to set up 500 `` water ATMs '' across the city .

The tall cylindrical concrete structures hold solar powered machines that look and function like an ATM . Instead of cash , they dispense water .

Since the pilot project was launched in late 2013 , Sarvajal has installed 15 water ATM 's in a New Delhi re-settlement colony called Sarva Ghera .

For one cent , one can draw up to four liters of water . That 's cheap even by Indian standards .

Though response has been slow , the thousand odd families who use the services say it has made a significant difference to their lives .

Before these so-called water ATM 's , she too had to wake up every morning worrying about where to find water . Her whole day revolved around the water tanker truck 's schedule .

Ground water is purified at localized plants , and distributed through these solar powered ATMs .

The biggest challenge is that everyone expects everything for free , Mishra said .

Mishra and his team have held countless meetings with the community to make them understand the difference in water quality and why clean water is worth paying for .
