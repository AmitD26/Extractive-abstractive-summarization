Jakarta , Indonesia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The cabbie probably thought nothing of it when the young couple left their large hard-sided suitcase in the trunk of his car and went back into the five-star hotel .

They said they needed to find the other person they were with and to pay their bill .

But after a lengthy wait , the young man and woman still had n't returned . Puzzled , the driver called hotel security .

The suitcase in the trunk looked very odd . It was wrapped in a bedsheet . Then the cabbie saw blood .

Two smaller suitcases were found in the St. Regis Bali Resort garden . Both contained hotel towels with blood on them , according to police .

The daughter and her boyfriend were found Wednesday morning at another hotel about 15 kilometers -LRB- 9 miles -RRB- away . The couple 's St. Regis room was `` very messy , '' with clothes still inside .

The couple told police they had been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang , whose members killed Sheila von Weise Mack , but they escaped , CNN affiliate Trans TV reported .

Djoko said that police had n't found anything on surveillance camera footage from the hotel that supported the claim of an attack by an armed gang . He said the footage showed the mother and daughter arguing near the hotel 's front desk on Tuesday .

A lawyer appointed for the couple told Reuters that Heather Mack did n't want to comment on the incident . She repeatedly asked for a lawyer from the United States , he said .

Djoko said Thursday he was looking into whether it was possible under Indonesian law to meet that request .

U.S. officials will offer consular guidance to the two Americans .

Dr. Ida Bagus Putu Alit told CNN that there was evidence -- a broken fingernail and bruises on both wrists -- of an apparent struggle .

For years , the Macks lived in the affluent suburb of Oak Park , Illinois .

`` She was very much involved in the arts so you would see her at concerts , you 'd see her at lectures , '' Allen Parchem told the station . `` I knew that she had a very active arts life downtown too , attending events , so with the move to downtown I think she was hoping to be even more a part of that scene . ''

Sheila von Weise Mack 's husband , James , was a well-known figure in the Chicago music scene , having worked on dozens of albums . The Chicago Tribune reported he died of a pulmonary embolism in Athens , Greece , during a family vacation in 2006 .
