New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the street vendors who alerted police to a smoking vehicle in Times Square that was later found to be carrying explosives says he 's planning to run for Congress .

Duane Jackson , a registered Democrat and Vietnam veteran , told CNN Wednesday he plans to face off against Republican Representative Nan Hayworth in New York 's 19th district in the November election .

In May , 2010 , Jackson and another vendor noticed black smoke coming out of a Nissan Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle illegally parked in a bus lane in Times Square , with the keys still in the ignition . Authorities later discovered a bomb inside the vehicle made up of propane tanks , fertilizer and gasoline . The bomb failed to detonate .

`` I think there 's been so much discontent over the years , both with Republicans and Democrats , '' Jackson , 59 , told CNN . `` I hear it all the time from my neighbors in the Hudson Valley , as well as people in Times Square . ''

Jackson also believes that there is too much bickering and `` nothing 's being done , '' and claims his rival , Hayworth , is `` out of touch with the Hudson Valley values . ''

The vendor was thrust into the spotlight after being credited with helping to prevent what authorities believe was a planned terrorist attack in the heart of Manhattan , even receiving a phone call from President Barack Obama .

Pakistani-born U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad pleaded guilty to the bombing attempt and is serving a life sentence in prison .

Jackson plans to make an official announcement within the next 10 days and is preparing to file with the Federal Election Commission .

Spokesman Josh Schwerin for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not directly comment on Jackson 's potential run , but stated that `` New York voters are looking for a representative who will fight for middle class jobs and protect seniors from the devastating cuts to Medicare being pushed by Congresswoman Hayworth and Washington Republicans .
