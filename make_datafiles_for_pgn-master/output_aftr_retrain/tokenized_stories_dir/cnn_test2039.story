-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tennis and fashion have been inextricably linked since the sport 's early years of organized competition just before the turn of the 20th century .

`` It 's really incredible to be able to bring these looks that I love to so many women , '' the 23-year-old said at its subsequent launch .

Sharapova , who is the hottest property in women 's sport , has always been a dedicated follower of fashion -- and wowed audiences at the 2007 U.S. Open with a stunning red dress , encrusted with no less than 600 Swarovski crystals .

Federer 's fashion faux-pas ?

However , tennis fashion sense is not confined to the female elite , and men 's world number one Roger Federer has certainly provoked a reaction with his Wimbledon collection .

Last year , on the way to his fifth crown at England 's famous SW19 courts , the Swiss superstar sported a special clothing line which brought much comment if not universal admiration .

`` His tennis may be nearly faultless but Roger Federer proved once again that his fashion sense often lands wide of the mark , '' quipped Britain 's Daily Telegraph .

But with respect to Federer and Sharapova , they still have some way to go before matching the sartorial successes of the legendary Fred Perry , and Rene Lacoste , one of the famous `` Four Musketeers '' from France .

After his successful playing career , Perry -- Britain 's last grand slam winner back in 1936 -- was credited with inventing the sweatband . Inspired by his success , he then designed a sports shirt with the distinct self-titled logo .

The brand is now owned by a Japanese corporation , and enjoyed a revival when sported by British ace Andy Murray , although he subsequently signed with Adidas for 2010 .

Like Perry 's brand , it has moved into the wider world of fashion , and for a spell during the early 1980s a Lacoste polo shirt was an absolute-must item in the wardrobe of every young man .

Beware the ` Burberry disease '

Burberry became a must-have fashion accessory of British football hooligans , but in recent years has re-branded itself and profits have flowed .

Frampton , the Global CEO of Interbrand Group , believes the continued success of Fred Perry and Lacoste owes much to their legendary status in the game but also to their brand positioning .

`` They transcended the sport itself and have come to stand for things in their own right , '' he told CNN .

And the key to future success ?

`` They have to position themselves as ` premium brands ' with more emphasis on quality and craftsmanship , '' he said .

A career after tennis

Where Perry and Lacoste forged the brand trail , others have followed , with Bjorn Borg the best example .

Like Sharapova , his endorsement of other brands such as Diadora trainers and Fila sportswear massively boosted their profits and helped establish the companies as major industry players .

Retiring at the tender age of 26 , Borg had some well-documented difficulties , but the fashion line he launched in 1987 has proved a commercial winner , promoting a daring range of underwear plus general sports and casual clothes and accessories .
