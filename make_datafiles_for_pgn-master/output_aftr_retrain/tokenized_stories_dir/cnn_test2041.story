-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I have n't had a single Diet Coke in 2014 . It was a conscious health decision , and the only real side effect , now , is that the world is awful and I hate everything .

Quite frankly , my life was much better when I drank Diet Coke . It had purpose .

Mind you , that purpose was to spend seven hours a day in front of a urinal . But some really good ideas came out of that .

`` Andrew , we should totally build an ark . ''

For instance , I would come home from a jog , tired and dehydrated having just spent a whole 20 minutes mildly exerting myself , and then I 'd take long , deep pulls from a two-liter bottle , fresh and cold right out of the fridge .

It 's called Soda Drinker Pro . And it 's totally real .

I played it .

`` I woke up in the middle of the night and needed a soda , '' he told me via e-mail . `` Unfortunately , I did n't have one , so I decided to make a simulated soda . ''

Amazingly , over the course of one day , Brierly created the first five levels of Soda Drinker Pro . Which is probably why the graphics are what some experts might call complete and utter crap .

So , the game is n't exactly Rome .

It 's more like Tulsa .

You hear the sound of draining fluid , and your soda levels deplete as you hold down the click .

`` SeÃ ± or , usted estÃ ¡ asustando a los niÃ ± os . ''

He proudly boasts that it has Kinect support for Xbox One , and that console will also offer exclusive levels of drinking soda throughout time .

Like the Roaring 20s . Or , say , 1972 .

And Soda Drinker Pro even has Oculus Rift support .

-LRB- Note to Dad : Oculus Rift is that incredible virtual reality software Facebook bought for $ 2 billion . -RRB-

-LRB- Note to Dad : Virtual reality is ... oh , screw it . Never mind . -RRB-

He explains , `` I did n't show anyone except some friends , but last year I did a presentation of Soda Drinker Pro at a soda drinking convention in Providence . ''

You read that correctly .

It 's more like Tulsa .
