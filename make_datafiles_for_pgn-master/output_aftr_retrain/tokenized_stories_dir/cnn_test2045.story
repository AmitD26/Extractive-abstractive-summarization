New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lions may be kings of the jungle , but for nearly two hours , two kittens ruled the concrete jungle as officials halted New York subway service Thursday .

The fearless felines risked all nine lives meandering the subway Thursday , causing part of it to be shut down for 90 minutes as personnel cut the power to begin their search .

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended subway service on the B and Q lines between the Kings Highway and DeKalb Avenue stops in Brooklyn -- about 6 miles of track -- to search for two cats that were reported seen at about 11 a.m. , MTA spokesman Kevin Ortiz said .

MTA had to cut the power to the third rail , which carries 600 volts of electricity .

`` It 's a waste of money . They could have been doing something else . It 's a waste of money . But that 's the MTA for you , '' subway rider and former MTA employee Wilson Burton told CNN affiliate WABC .

Though the sneaky cats were at large on the tracks for more than seven hours , they reappeared around 6 p.m. and were corralled and captured within the half hour , MTA spokeswoman Judie Glave said . They were taken to a nearby shelter , police said .

It is MTA protocol for conductors to stop and call in anytime something is on or traveling on the tracks , so it is in the best interest of customers and MTA to clear the track as soon as possible , Glave said .

The pair was found in the same spot where they were first sighted earlier in the day , despite the running trains and the re-electrified deadly third rail .
