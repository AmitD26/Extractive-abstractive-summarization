-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Year after year Americans ask : When will our economy get better ? Injecting more capital into the economy should work -- in theory -- because capital fuels capitalism .

Yet this capital sits unused on the balance sheets of corporations , and languishes inert in private equity funds .

Capitalists seem uninterested in capitalism , even as eager entrepreneurs ca n't get financing . Businesses and investors sound like the Ancient Mariner , who complained , `` Water , water everywhere -- nor any drop to drink . ''

At the heart of this paradox is a doctrine of finance employing measures of profitability that guide capitalists away from investments that can create growth .

Empowering innovations create jobs for people who build , distribute , sell and service these products .

The second type are `` sustaining '' innovations . These replace old products with new . The Toyota Prius hybrid is marvelous -- yet every time a customer buys a Prius , a Camry is not sold . Sustaining innovations replace yesterday 's products with today 's products . They keep our economy vibrant -- and , in dollars , they account for the most innovation . But they have a zero-sum effect on jobs and capital .

The third type are `` efficiency '' innovations . These reduce the cost of making and distributing existing products and services - like Toyota 's just-in-time manufacturing in carmaking and Geico in online insurance underwriting . Efficiency innovations almost always reduce the net number of jobs in an industry , allow the same amount of work -LRB- or more -RRB- to get done using fewer people .

Efficiency innovations also emancipate capital for other uses . Without them , much of an economy 's capital is held captive on balance sheets , tied up in inventory , working capital , and balance sheet reserves .

Quest : U.S. economy to dominate Davos 2013

Companies like Hewlett-Packard had to hire thousands of people to make and sell PCs . They then deployed workers to make better computers -- sustaining innovations . Finally , the industry began to outsource its operations , becoming much more capital efficient . This reduced net employment within the industry , but freed capital that had been used in the supply chain .

The dials on these three innovations are sensitive , but if set in a recurring circle -- with empowering innovations creating more jobs than efficiency innovations eliminate , and the capital that efficiency innovations liberate being invested back into empowering innovations -- the economy is a magnificent machine .

The belt of circularity in America 's economic engine , however , is broken . The 1982 recovery took the economy 's usual 6 months to reach the prerecession peaks of performance . Getting back to the prior peak in the 1990 recession took 15 months . Our economic machine has been grinding for 65 months trying to hit prerecession levels -- and it 's not clear whether or how we 're going to get there .

U.S. thinker George Gilder brings a useful perspective to this puzzle . He teaches that we should be frugal with resources that are scarce and costly , but can waste resources that are abundant and cheap .

Executives came to use measures of efficiency that focused on the short term , investing in quick wins in sustaining and efficiency innovations instead of funding empowering innovations that pay off in five years , or often even longer .

We face complicated problems , and mine is a simple model . But I hope it helps us understand that policies that were once right are now wrong , and that counterintuitive measures might actually work to turn our economies around .
