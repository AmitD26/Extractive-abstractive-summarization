ANCHORAGE , Alaska -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's husband wo n't comply with a subpoena issued by state lawmakers investigating her firing of Alaska 's public safety commissioner , the McCain-Palin campaign said Thursday .

In a new twist , Comella said Alaska state law bars ethics investigations of people running for elected office .

The law campaign officials cited appears to apply to candidates for state office , while Sarah Palin is seeking a federal job . But another campaign spokesman , Taylor Griffin , said the subpoenas violate `` the spirit of the law , if not the letter . ''

In addition , state Attorney General Talis Colberg told lawmakers Tuesday that state employees would n't comply with subpoenas because the governor `` has declined to participate '' in the inquiry . Colberg said Sarah Palin 's refusal puts them in the position `` of having to choose where their loyalties lie . '' Watch how the trooper probe has become political ''

Palin has said Monegan was dismissed over budget disagreements and denies any wrongdoing . Since becoming Sen. John McCain 's running mate , she has argued that the investigation belongs before the state Personnel Board , whose members are appointed by the governor , though its current three members were appointed by her predecessor .

The resistance was fueled by remarks made in early September by Judiciary Committee Chairman Hollis French , a Democrat . In an interview with ABC News , French said the investigation -- which had been scheduled to wrap up at the end of October -- could present an `` October surprise '' for the GOP ticket .

Palin initially denied that anyone in her administration or family had pressed for action against her former brother-in-law , Mike Wooten , whom she has branded a `` rogue trooper . ''

But in August , just two weeks before her nomination , she acknowledged that members of her staff had contacted Monegan 's office nearly two dozen times about the trooper and suspended one aide whose February call to a state police lieutenant on the matter was tape-recorded .

And Todd Palin was a `` principal critic '' of Wooten and had `` many contacts '' with Department of Public Safety officials about his status , Stephen Branchflower , the former prosecutor hired by the state Legislature to investigate the firing , told lawmakers last week .

But Palin spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Todd Palin 's role in the administration `` has not been inappropriate . ''

`` His role is that he has been in and out of meetings that were appropriate , '' Stapleton said .
