Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is vowing to stay put despite protests against his government that have enveloped the nation 's capital .

At least 8,000 people have rallied in the city 's center after allegations of vote-rigging during last year 's election . Negotiations between Sharif 's government and his opponents , some of whom are calling for his resignation , have reached an impasse .

Sharif announced in a statement on Saturday that he will not resign -- a demand he has called `` unconstitutional . ''

As the protests have grown in size and scope , the army has stationed personnel at government buildings in case protesters try to occupy them . A spokesman for Qadri said that protests tried to enter the road leading to the Prime Minister 's residence .

Asif said that no decision had been made on whether to arrest Khan or Qadri .

`` They violated their original commitment with the government to protest in a designated space like it is done in civilized countries , '' Asif said . `` We can not trust them . ''
