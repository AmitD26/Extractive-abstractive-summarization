The disaster itself raises serious questions . How was it possible the boat could get so close to Christmas Island without the Australian navy being aware of its pending arrival ?

Certainly the navy , which systematically patrols the waters between Indonesia and Christmas Island , was caught napping . It took an hour and half for a small navy boat to arrive to render assistance .

But the bigger questions concern the Australian government 's asylum polices and the arrival of refugee boats . More asylum seekers arrive in Australia by plane than by boat . There is no hysteria about their arrival . They are not routinely detained .

But boat arrivals elicit a different response . Subject to mandatory detention on arrival , more than 5,700 asylum seekers -- including more than 800 children -- are in detention centers , with 2,700-plus on Christmas Island . More than 2,000 have been in detention for more than six months , and that figure is growing .

Refugee boats were a major feature of this year 's federal election . Both major political parties campaigned on being tough with asylum seekers . In the wake of the election , public opinion has shifted against asylum seekers .

But it is the policies of the Australian government that are largely responsible for pushing asylum seekers to get on boats to make the sometimes risky journey from Indonesia .

The tragedy highlights three features of Australia 's refugee policy that must change .

Second , until this year , Australia did not routinely resettle UNHCR refugees from Indonesia . This year , the Australian government said it will take 500 refugees from Indonesia , although , so far , fewer than 100 have been resettled , and the government has not guaranteed numbers for the future .

The lack of any guaranteed resettlement is another powerful incentive for asylum seekers to take the boat journey from Indonesia to Australia .

If Australia were willing to process asylum seekers and guarantee resettlement , far fewer asylum seekers would want or need to take the boat journey . Yet Prime Minister Julia Gillard 's Labor government takes proportionally fewer refugees than was the case under the conservative John Howard government .

Third , the Australian government 's move to criminalize people-smuggling -LRB- and by association asylum seekers themselves -RRB- in Indonesia and Australia also provides a powerful disincentive for asylum boats to contact Australian authorities should they require assistance .

A year ago , the Australian government called on the Indonesian government to intercept a boat of 253 Tamil asylum seekers . After a standoff at the Indonesian port of Merak , the Tamils were imprisoned at Tanjung Pinang , although all but 17 were found to be refugees .

While the extreme weather may have been the immediate cause of the disaster at Christmas Island , just as surely , government policies drove that boat onto the cliffs .

Whether Australia 's political leaders have the courage to make the shift remains to be seen . But the lives of future asylum seekers depend on their response .
