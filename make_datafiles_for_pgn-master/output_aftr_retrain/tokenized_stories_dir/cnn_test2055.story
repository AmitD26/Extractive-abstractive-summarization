A South African newspaper published Friday a cartoon depicting the prophet lamenting that his followers lack a sense of humor , drawing ire from the Muslim community and fear of reprisal attacks just ahead of the World Cup soccer tournament that is expected to draw thousands to South Africa next month .

The cartoon by the acclaimed Cape Town cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro , who is known as Zapiro , shows Mohammed reclining on a therapist 's couch and saying sadly : `` Other prophets ' followers have a sense of humour . ''

Zapiro said he believes all faiths should be subjected to satire . No religious groups , he said , should be able to think they are above society and not respect freedoms afforded to people who live in democracies .

He said there should have been more movement on this score since 2005 , when a Danish newspaper first published a series of Mohammed cartoons that led to riots around the world .

He said the irony is that the cartoon itself is about asking people to think twice before they get so angry .

`` These are times that the enemies of Islam are intentionally causing events to provoke a reaction from the Muslims , '' said a statement from South Africa 's Council of Muslim Theologians , which went to court to try to stop the newspaper from printing the cartoon but lost its bid late Thursday .

The council said it was exploring legal routes to ultimately implement a ban on what it called `` hate speech . ''

Radio Islam discussed the topic on South African airwaves Friday .

`` I understand that for many Muslims any representation of the prophet , no matter how innocuous , is offensive and I genuinely regret any offence that the cartoon may have caused those who hold this belief dear , '' Dawes said in an open letter published on the newspaper 's website Friday .

`` That regret does not , however , outweigh my duty to the principle of freedom expression , '' he said .
