Student voices differ on diversity

She participated in math competitions and also was an accomplished cellist , according to her lawsuit . She was co-president of her high school orchestra and played in city and regional youth orchestras , according to the complaint .

She was also an active volunteer , having worked with Habitat for Humanity , and used her musical skills to play holiday music at a nearby nursing home , among other efforts , the lawsuit indicates .

She included those details in her application to the university , but was nevertheless rejected under a program for students who do n't land in the very top tier academically . Such students are automatically selected for admission .

`` I was devastated , '' The New York Times quoted her as saying in a story published in October , in what the newspaper said was her first interview since the university turned her down .

Affirmative action under pressure

`` I dreamt of going to UT ever since the second grade , '' she said in a video interview released by her lawyers to bolster her case in September . `` My dad went there , my sister went there and tons of friends and family , and it was a tradition I wanted to continue . ''

`` The only thing I missed out on was my post-graduation years , '' the newspaper quoted her as saying . `` Just being in a network of U.T. graduates would have been a really nice thing to be in . And I probably would have gotten a better job offer had I gone to U.T. ''

In the video interview released by her lawyers , she said she does n't like any form of discrimination .

`` If people say anything about me , I hope they say I did n't take this sitting down , '' she said in the interview . `` I did n't accept the process because the process is wrong . ''
