-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- African-Americans deserve reparations . Discuss .

The idea of reparations -- that the descendants of slaves should be compensated by the national government for the wrongs and the legacy of slavery -- has always been controversial .

To me , this reflex is as interesting as the original argument . And it suggests that before America could ever actually do reparations , America would have to first be able to imagine the necessity of reparations . The greatest obstacle to considering reparation is n't practicality ; it 's a dearth of moral imagination .

The obvious example is the latticework of code and custom that we call Jim Crow . But as Coates reminds us , white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation ; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity , like parts of the New Deal , which contained many devil 's bargains with conservative Southern Democrats to exempt African-Americans . And it plays out in today 's criminal justice and incarceration regimes .

But his article is in some ways mistitled . Coates is not quite making a case for reparations . He 's making a case for a discussion of reparations . He does n't pretend to spell out all the operational policy choices that would have to be made to put reparations into effect . The closest he comes to a legislative recommendation is to tout a perennially neglected bill that Rep. John Conyers , D-Michigan , introduces every session of Congress , which calls simply for a public study of the possibility of reparations .

To be sure , every ethnic group that 's not called white has experienced suffering in American life . But the experience of African-Americans is exceptional in its systematic , multigenerational , reverberating effects . And it 's exceptional in its centrality to the founding and building of our nation . No experience reveals more than the African-American experience both the hypocrisy and the possibility of our national creed .

And the point of a hearing on reparations -- and making it a civic experience as profound and prismatic as the Watergate hearing -- is not to get the American public to `` how . '' It 's to get us to `` why . '' For only when we understand why reparations are justified , even if in good faith we can not yet figure out how or even whether they could be feasible , will we have a shot at being `` beyond race . ''

Maimonides said , `` Teach thy tongue to say ` I do not know ' and thou shalt progress . '' On a topic as charged as race , and as woven into the warp and woof of American identity as whiteness , the temptation is always to speak emphatically from fear or pain . But if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say , `` I do not know -- but I wish to understand , '' then we will be making true progress .

He says whether reparations are feasible or not , we should at least discuss the issue
