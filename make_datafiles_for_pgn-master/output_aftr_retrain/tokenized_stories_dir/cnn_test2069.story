Yet as the state 's junior U.S. senator lamented in February , `` I can tell you right now Nevada is nowhere close to a normal economy . '' Nevada 's unemployment remains the second-highest in the nation , nearly 9 % . The housing market there still languishes . New Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen acknowledged to Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller that full recovery for Nevada glimmers `` years away . ''

Nevada 's troubles are more than a local concern . They reveal something important about the condition of the whole U.S. economy .

Nevada makes its living from tourism , the state 's most important industry , and the tourists come -- or came -- for the casinos . Before 1990 , the state of Nevada and Atlantic City , New Jersey , enjoyed something close to a monopoly on the casino industry .

As more states legalized casinos , the Nevada casino industry -- and especially the Las Vegas industry -- responded by moving up-market . Dazzling theme hotels housed lavish theatrical shows and outstanding restaurants . Las Vegas , once a rather seedy place , repositioned itself as a center of glamorous entertainment .

Building the new hotels generated jobs . The people who worked in the hotels needed places to live , and building those homes generated more jobs . All that construction shaped an unusual local economy : Here was a state with low average educational attainments -LRB- only about 22 % of Nevadans have a college degree , 45th in the nation -RRB- , yet a median income higher than the national average .

Nevada 's blue-collar prosperity was built on a faulty premise . All those glitzy Las Vegas hotels and resorts , containing typically up to 5,000 rooms each , depended on a huge influx of high-spending visitors .

Nationwide , the casino industry has more or less recovered from the recession . Americans left behind $ 37.34 billion in casinos in 2012 , only a shade below the 2007 peak of $ 37.52 billion . But they are spending that money in casinos closer to home . Gross revenues of Nevada casinos languish 20 % below their 2007 peaks . Because of the higher cost of Las Vegas-style amenities , a 20 % drop in revenues translates into a 50 % drop in profitability .

Meanwhile , those who do gamble are gambling in new ways that do n't support the style of industry for which Las Vegas is famous . Younger gamblers are attracted to online forms of gambling , which create jobs only for computer programmers . Older gamblers increasingly prefer bare-bones casinos that offer free transportation and cheaper meals .
