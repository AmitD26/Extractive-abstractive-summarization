What confuses people about Russian public diplomacy is that it often veers from a closed fist approach to an open handshake depending on its narrow objective -- all the while testing America as it seeks to build its own popularity around the world .

For years the Russians have worried about how they are portrayed in American media , about Hollywood 's depiction of Russians as mobsters and thugs , for example . Scholars of Russia have written often about Russia 's near-obsession with its place in the world , including a fixation on polls -- like Gallup 's -- about Russia 's popularity with the outside world .

Over the years , Russian officials have looked for opportunities in the media to portray Russia as helpful and constructive -- even when it was not . They attempted to use Russian television , and later the Internet , to brandish a better image in the West -- creating a news agency , RIA -LRB- The Russian Agency for International Information -RRB- which operates 80 news bureaus around the world and Russia Today which boasts a following of 630 million people in over 100 countries . The Russians are also fans of inserting newspaper supplements of Russia Today in American newspapers just to remind readers of their relevance .

Let 's face it . Russia remains relevant but its image in the world has suffered throughout the last decade , for good reason . Think of some of the recent events : the conflict Russia had in 2008 with its southern neighbor , Georgia , over the disputed territory of South Ossetia . Then there was the feud with Ukraine in 2009 which resulted in Russia cutting off gas to Ukraine . There was a series of international corruption scandals around a Russian oil firm , Gazprom , including accounting charges involving U.S. financial firms .

One can not , of course , forget the Magnitsky case which emanated from the arrest , and subsequent death in custody of a Russian lawyer who became a whistle-blower about human rights . That case led to a feud with the United States , congressional sanctions , and the release of a list in April of Russian individuals not allowed into America . Add to that the Russian imprisonment of a feminist punk rock group -- Pussy Riot -- for daring to protest against the Russian government . Oh , and let 's not forget Russia 's hosting of NSA leaker Edward Snowden .

For Americans , there is something emotional about Russia . It inevitably evokes fear and fascination in the United States and the West perhaps because of its long and complex history , its culture , and memories of Cold War days when so much time , effort and money was spent defending ourselves against the Soviet Union .

Russia 's latest attempt to win hearts and minds is intriguing and is likely to be effective if the result is some kind of interim deal over chemical weapons . A positive step by Syria , at the urging of Moscow , to acknowledge its chemical stockpiles and surrender even a portion of them would be a good development -- and Russia will claim credit for saving the day . If the diplomacy fails , and the U.S. decides to strike Syria , Russia will lay the blame for any damage on America . So either way , the gamble makes sense from Putin 's view .

As for the United States , we have no choice but to take Russia up on the offer to press the Syrians to relinquish control over the weapons . Americans like peaceful solutions and we certainly should test the proposition with Russia . But while we are diplomatically dueling with Russia , we must remain mindful of their public diplomacy strategies , watch closely as they maneuver and , in the end , do what is in our own national security interest .
