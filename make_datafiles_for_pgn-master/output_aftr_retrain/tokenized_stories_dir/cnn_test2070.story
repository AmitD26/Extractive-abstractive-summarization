More than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed at Chandrasekhar Sankurathri 's eye hospital .

`` Nobody should go through what I 've been through in my life , '' he says .

`` I used to think maybe they landed someplace . Maybe somebody rescued them , you know , '' he says .

For three years he stumbled through his daily routine as a biologist in Ottawa , not wanting to believe the truth .

`` I was really lost , '' he remembers .

After considerable soul-searching , Sankurathri made a decision few others might -- to turn his personal pain into an opportunity to help those less fortunate . In 1988 , he quit his job , sold his home and returned to India , where he was born , and where he believed he could do the most good .

`` India has so many problems , '' says Sankurathri , 64 .

Since it 's creation in 1992 , Sarada School -- named for the 4-year-old daughter Sankurathri lost -- has grown from one grade to nine . More than 1,200 students have graduated and many of them have gone on to high school and college . Sankurathri keeps in touch with past students .

`` We act like a big family , '' he says .

The same buses that pick up students for Sankurathri 's school in the morning are often used later in the day to bring eye care patients from other rural areas to the Srikiran Institute of Ophthalmology , Sankurathri 's eye hospital , named for the 7-year-old son he lost . Since the hospital 's opening in 1993 , more than 137,000 cataract surgeries have been performed , 90 percent of them free .

`` We see close to 350 outpatients a day and perform 80 surgeries per day , '' he says . `` Our mission is to provide quality eye care with compassion , which is equitable , accessible and affordable to all . ''

`` In India , people are so ignorant . They think cataract blindness is not curable , '' he says . `` They are not aware that it is curable and that it is a simple operation . ''

The goal , Sankurathri says , is not only to help the blind see again , but also to lead a better life . Sankurathri has been back in India for almost 20 years . He insists his work does not make him special .
