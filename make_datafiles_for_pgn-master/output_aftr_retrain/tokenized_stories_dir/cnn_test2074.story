The issue of Breivik 's sanity , on which mental health experts have given conflicting opinions , was central to the court 's ruling .

But prosecutors had asked that Breivik , 33 , be acquitted on the grounds of insanity , in which case he would have been held in a secure mental health unit .

The sentence could be extended , potentially indefinitely , in the future if he is considered still to pose a threat to society . Norway does not have the death penalty .

The court 's judgment that Breivik is sane means that the far-right views he espouses can be confronted in Norway without being dismissed as those of a madman , Ihler said .

`` There are extremist people around , they are not insane , and we have to be able to take a proper debate with them , '' he said .

Asked whether the verdict meant closure for him , Ihler said : `` This case is going to live strongly with me for the rest of my life probably . ''

Reading out the court 's ruling , Judge Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen spoke of Breivik 's `` manifesto , '' a document published online in which he set out his ultranationalist political views .

He described his actions as a pre-emptive attack in defense of ethnic Norwegian people and culture , the court heard .

Breivik trained for his attack by working out in the gym , running with a backpack filled with rocks and practicing at a shooting club , the court heard .

In the course of the 10-week trial , which wrapped up in June , the court heard chilling evidence from some of those who survived Breivik 's shooting spree on Utoya Island , in which 69 people died -- most of them teenagers attending a Labour Party summer youth camp .

Opinion : Does the internet breed killers ?

In his own testimony , given without emotion , Breivik recounted firing more bullets into teenagers who were injured and could n't escape , killing those who tried to `` play dead '' and driving others into the sea to drown .

Breivik blames politicians , and the Labour Party in particular , for promoting multiculturalism in Norway .

The prison 's governor , Knut Bjarkeid , said Wednesday that the institution was ready to hold Breivik securely whether the court ruled him sane or not . `` Our job is to protect the community , '' Bjarkeid said .

Over the past year , Breivik has had three cells for his use , one for physical exercise and another for reading and writing , as well as a separate outdoor exercise space , he said . Breivik can not mix with prisoners from other wings , but does have contact with prison staff .

Norway attacks and multiculturalism

`` As of now , we think there is a need to subject Mr. Behring Breivik to a particularly high security regime , '' Bjarkeid said .

The high security regime `` puts a heavy strain on an inmate , especially if it lasts for a longer period , '' he added , so Breivik 's continued detention under these conditions will be kept under constant review .

Defense lawyer Geir Lippestad has previously said it is important to Breivik that people see him as sane so they do n't dismiss his views .

The court had to consider conflicting opinions from medical experts in reaching its verdict .

An initial team of psychiatrists found Breivik to be paranoid and schizophrenic , following 36 hours of interviews .

However , a second pair of experts found he was not psychotic at the time of the attacks , does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged .

Their report said there is a `` high risk for repeated violent actions . ''

Mark Stephens , a partner at law firm Finers Stephens Innocent , told CNN Friday : `` The general public will think only a madman can commit these offenses , but in law madness is defined very narrowly . Basically it requires a doctor to come to court and say this person has a definable medical illness -- in this case the prosecution said he was a paranoid schizophrenic , and that can be treated with drugs and behavioral therapy .

`` If , however , he had a personality disorder or was just ... motivated , as in this case , by a misguided political belief that this was the only way to stop the Islamization , as he would have it , of his nation , then in those circumstances he has be found guilty because he understood what he was doing was wrong . ''

Disturbing look into mind of Norway shooter

Breivik 's rampage , the worst atrocity on Norwegian soil since World War II , prompted much soul-searching .

Norwegians reasserted their commitment to multiculturalism and tolerance at a series of mass public tributes held in the immediate aftermath of the massacre .

CNN 's Diana Magnay and Per Nyberg reported from Oslo and Laura Smith-Spark from London .
