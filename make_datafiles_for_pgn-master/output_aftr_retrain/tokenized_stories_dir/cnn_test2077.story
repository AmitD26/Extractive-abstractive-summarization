Twitter gave no reason for the refreshed bird , which is less chubby , has fewer feathers and is angled more towards the sky than its predecessor . But jokesters in the Twittersphere , where #twitterbird was trending Wednesday , were only too happy to offer some .

`` Twitter is too young to be changing its logo . Although , now the bird is soaring , '' added Andrew Mager .

`` The new #twitterbird is the Situation of social media icons . He 's all `` Gym , Tweet , Laundry . What , Facebook ?! Want some ?! '' said Sam Killermann .

And Adam McCombs may have spoken for many users when he tweeted , `` Maybe @twitter should spend more time working on performance instead of playing with their logo . ''

In its post , Twitter says the new bird is `` crafted purely from three sets of overlapping circles â € '' similar to how your networks , interests and ideas connect and intersect with peers and friends . '' In rather flowery rhetoric , the post goes on to say , `` Whether soaring high above the Earth to take in a broad view , or flocking with other birds to achieve a common purpose , a bird in flight is the ultimate representation of freedom , hope and limitless possibility . ''

The company on Wednesday was urging developers to switch to the new logo -- although the Twitter icon in Apple 's App Store was still showing the old bird .
