-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been six years -- 2007 , if you 're into counting numbers -- since the once sleepy fishing port of Macau surpassed Las Vegas as the world leader in gambling revenue .

But there 's a slower side to this city of just less than 600,000 residents , one of cobblestone lanes , colonial mansions , art deco buildings and tranquil parks , all done in a fusion of Chinese and Portuguese motifs .

1 . Baccarat is the game of choice

By far the most popular game is baccarat , a relatively simple game with a low house advantage -LRB- less than 1 % -RRB- .

Baccarat tables dominate the city 's 33 casinos .

There are plenty of slot machines as well , but they offer a high house advantage and are n't popular . This is the reverse of Las Vegas where gamblers favor slots .

Today , there are six casino operators : SJM Holdings -LRB- Stanley Ho -RRB- , Wynn Macau , Sands China , Galaxy Entertainment Group , MGM China Holdings and Melco Crown Entertainment .

2 . Macau was the first and last European colony in China

The Portuguese settled in Macau in the 16th century and the island was handed back to China in 1999 .

Today , Macau is a Special Administrative Region -LRB- SAR -RRB- -- as is Hong Kong -- and is governed under the `` one country , two systems '' principal , which was the brainchild of late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping .

Although no longer a colony , Portuguese is still an official language and the Portuguese influence can be seen everywhere from blue tiled street signs to tiled floors and beautiful gardens .

Macau has the world 's highest population density with 20,497 people per square kilometer .

No surprise then that it needed to do something dramatic to make room for new casinos and 30 million visitors that come every year .

The Venetian Resort , City of Dreams , Sands Cotai and Galaxy Macau Resort are all on the Cotai Strip .

4 . Coloane is still chill

This is largely due to strict rules over title deeds that make it difficult to buy property on the island .

The low-rise houses and quiet tree-lined streets that give Coloane its charm remain as they have for decades .

Coloane is home to Lord Stow 's Bakery , birthplace of Macau 's much-loved egg tart . Not too sweet , these tarts with their crispy pastry are worth queuing for .

Another Coloane favourite is Fernando 's . Like the rest of Coloane , it 's super laid-back and the food is reliably good . The garlic prawns and suckling pig are must orders .

5 . Heritage is here to stay

Before the big casino operators rolled into town the Macau government did something clever -- it applied to UNESCO for World Heritage status .

In 2005 , the historic center of Macau was put on the list .

The city 's historic monuments are one of the city 's biggest draws , a wonderful example of the early encounter between Chinese and European civilizations .

6 . Macanese cuisine is fusion food

Macanese cuisine is unique to Macau and combines the best of Chinese and Portuguese ingredients and cooking along with influences from Brazil , Goa and other former Portuguese colonies .

Portuguese influence is seen in the flavoring , with plenty of turmeric , cinnamon , chili and coconut . Dishes are often baked or roasted for a long time to allow the flavors and spices to develop .

Macau 's caldo verde soup is a popular starter and is similar to the Portuguese original , but uses bok choy instead of collard greens .

The national dish is minchi -- minced beef or pork cooked with potatoes , onions , soy sauce and sometimes an egg .

He was once Asia 's most feared gangster , the leader of the 14K triads , and after 13 years behind bars he 's now a free man .

Wan Kuok-koi was born in Macau 's slums and worked his way up triads .

Along the way he broke several teeth in street fights and earned his nickname .

As head of the largest triad society in Macau , he and his crew waged a violent turf war against a rival gang , the Shui Fong , in the years running up to the 1999 handover . It was a time of drive-by shootings and car bombs that came to an end only when he was jailed in 1999 .

8 . It 's a city of longevity

People in Macau live a long time -- an average of 84.4 years .

Only the residents of Monaco -- ironically another place beginning with the letter `` M '' that 's known for its casinos -- live longer -LRB- 89.6 years -RRB- .

When a casino takes on new staff , it checks to see if he or she has family working in the casino and in which section , to avoid the possibility of fraud .

Locals rarely visit the casinos to gamble and government employees are forbidden from gambling here . The overwhelming majority of gamblers are from mainland China and Hong Kong .

It 's on the southeast side of Coloane Island .

The sand is n't as black as it used to be . Erosion was gradually chipping away at the beach so the government decided to top up the beach , but the replacement sand is yellow , which has muted the dark sand .
