-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Luiz Felipe Scolari 's second stint as Brazil manager did n't go nearly as well as the first .

A dozen years after leading Brazil to the World Cup title in Asia , he resigned in the wake of the Selecao 's capitulation in the semifinals and third-place defeat on home soil last week .

`` Luiz Felipe Scolari and his fellow coaching staff surrendered their positions to the board , '' Brazil 's football federation , the CBF , said in a statement on its website , adding that the resignations were accepted .

Without injured talisman Neymar and captain Thiago Silva in the heart of defense , Brazil conceded four times in six minutes in the first half in Belo Horizonte , leaving fans in tears in the stands .

Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola , Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and ex-Brazil striker Ronaldo are also among the big names linked with the job .

Even with a team that was considered far from vintage -- especially compared to previous Brazil sides -- many expected Brazil to win the World Cup after defeating Spain in the 2013 Confederations Cup final .

But the warning signs that Brazil were not exactly buzzing were there in the opening game of the group stages of the 2014 World Cup . Scolari 's side were fortunate to top Croatia , benefiting from a dubious penalty .
