On Thursday , the social site tweaked the way users block others who harass , spam or otherwise bother them . Under the change the blocked user would still be able to see the profile and tweets of the other user , as well as retweet their posts .

Here 's a look at how , and why , it all went down .

The timeline

Users began noticing the update to Twitter 's blocking policy Thursday morning . Tech blogs and other media outlets began reporting the change , as well as the swell of protests against it .

Twitter 's top brass reportedly huddled up as the dissent mounted . And , at 10:44 p.m. ET , the company announced in a tweet that it had reversed course and the old rules would apply once again .

What was Twitter thinking ?

The idea behind the original change was actually an effort to protect users from harassment .

`` We believe this is not ideal , largely due to the retaliation against blocking users by blocked users -LRB- and sometimes their friends -RRB- that often occurs , '' he wrote . `` Some users worry just as much about post-blocking retaliation as they do about pre-blocking abuse . ''

Nothing 's unanimous on a site with more than 200 million registered users . But it became really clear , really fast that lots of folks on Twitter did n't consider the change a move in the right direction .

One petition on Change.org called the new system a `` nightmare . ''

`` This is a huge and very serious problem for people , like me , who have received repeated rape and death threats on Twitter on a fairly consistent basis , '' wrote Zerlina Maxwell , a political consultant and writer for Ebony magazine , who started the petition .

The reversal

`` We never want to introduce features at the cost of users feeling less safe , '' he wrote .

`` We 've been working diligently to strike this balance since Twitter 's inception , and we thank you for all of your support and feedback to date . Thank you in advance for your patience as we continue to build the best -- and safest -- Twitter we possibly can . ''

How unusual was this turnaround ?

In October , Facebook briefly lifted a ban on at least some violent content -LRB- a video of a woman being beheaded was the most prominent -RRB- . The logic was that people use the site to raise awareness about important issues and , sometimes , that involves showing scenes of violence .

But a day later Facebook appeared to have reversed itself , with reinstated videos once again disappearing from the network .

That change was rolled out on a Monday and reversed by Wednesday .

And in 2011 , Netflix infamously angered customers when it announced plans to spin off its DVD rental business into a separate subsidiary called Qwikster . After an outcry from customers , who quit in droves , Netflix reversed itself and killed off Qwikster some three weeks later -- an eternity compared with Twitter 's about-face Thursday .
