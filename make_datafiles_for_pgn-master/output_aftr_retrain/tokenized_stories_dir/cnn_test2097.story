-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gmail does n't cost any money to use , but it 's not free .

With an estimated 500-plus million users , Gmail has grown to dominate the Web-mail world . It has also repeatedly found itself in hot water over privacy . Gmail is facing multiple privacy lawsuits in the United States and Europe , some accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for scanning the content of e-mails .

Google reported $ 16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone . One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users .

`` The basic premise of Gmail is , we 'll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we 're scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant , '' said Eric Goldman , a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law .

Gmail looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context , then matches the e-mail up with related ads . A conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class , for example , might trigger an ad for a weight-loss product .

What many consumers do n't consider is that companies such as Google can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search , maps , e-mail and Google + , its social network .

When people send and receive messages using a free e-mail service , they are sharing details about their interests , who their connections are and what their finances look like . That information might seem mundane on the surface , but when extracted and organized , it 's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers .

All the major e-mail providers , including Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo , benefit one way or another from offering a free service . The provider might serve up general or targeted ads , generate a user base for marketing other services , or just use the e-mail service to build brand recognition .

However , many of the details about how exactly Google 's program works have been kept confidential . And critics say the service does n't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers ' information .

Google has defended its e-mail scanning program by pointing out that it 's automated and handled by computers picking out keywords . Google 's employees are n't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers ' spat .

Google also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam , and for features such as Priority Inbox and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories .

A changing landscape

When Gmail debuted in 2004 , the rules for collecting user information were looser . But the privacy landscape has changed drastically over the past 10 years .

Several U.S. states have passed laws that restrict the use of personal information , the Federal Trade Commission has been more active pursuing privacy violations , and the industry has adopted best practices about what 's acceptable .

One thing that has n't changed is the federal law with the biggest impact on how and when companies can share data with third parties . The Electronics Communication Privacy Act is a dusty piece of legislation passed in 1986 , long before the era of cloud-based e-mail . Many legislators and technology companies -LRB- including Google -RRB- have lobbied to have the law updated to reflect the times .
