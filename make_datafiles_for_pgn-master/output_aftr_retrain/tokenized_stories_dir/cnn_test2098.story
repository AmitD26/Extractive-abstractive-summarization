-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six Baha'i leaders in Iran were seized and imprisoned this week , the religious group said . The act prompted condemnation and concern from the movement and a top American religious freedom panel .

Iranian intelligence agents searched the homes of the six on Wednesday and then whisked them away , according to the Baha'i 's World News Service . The report said the six are in Evin prison and that the arrests follow the detention in March of another Baha'i leader .

The Iranian Foreign Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment , and the incident has not been mentioned in Iran 's state-run media .

The U.S. State Department issued a statement Friday `` strongly '' condeming the arrests , which it said were `` a clear violation of the Iranian regime 's international commitments and obligations to respect international religious freedom norms .

`` Especially disturbing is how this latest sweep recalls the wholesale arrest or abduction of the members of two national Iranian Baha'i governing councils in the early 1980s -- which led to the disappearance or execution of 17 individuals , '' Dugal said .

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom -- a government panel that advises the president and Congress -- condemned the Wednesday arrests , as well as another in March . The commission chairman called the acts the `` latest sign of the rapidly deteriorating status of religious freedom and other human rights in Iran . ''

The Baha'is are regarded as `` apostates '' in Iran and have been persecuted there for years .

`` Since 1979 , Iranian authorities have killed more than 200 Baha'i leaders , thousands have been arrested and imprisoned , and more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs , '' the commission said .

The commission said that since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power a few years ago , Baha'is `` have been harassed , physically attacked , arrested , and imprisoned . ''

The Baha'is say they have 5 million members across the globe , and about 300,000 in Iran .

The Baha'is say their faith `` is the youngest of the world 's independent religions '' and that its basic theme is that `` humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society . ''

They say their founder , Baha'u ` llah -LRB- 1817-1892 -RRB- , is regarded by Baha'is as `` the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham , Moses , Buddha , Krishna , Zoroaster , Christ and Muhammad . ''
