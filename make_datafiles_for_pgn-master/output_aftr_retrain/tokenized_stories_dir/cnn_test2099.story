Rapid HIV test swabs incubate at the Iris House in New York in 2007 .

The Health Department points to the city 's demographics .

`` The populations that bear the greatest burden nationally -- blacks , for example , and men who have sex with men -- are highly represented in New York City , '' Health Commissioner Thomas Freidan said in a written statement . `` Because HIV is more prevalent within those groups , the risk of HIV infection per sexual contact is higher . ''

In June , the city launched a three-year initiative to administer HIV tests to the 250,000 Bronx adults who have never been tested . The program was announced just days after release of a study finding a high rate of `` unsafe sexual behavior '' in the city .

Freidan said the study showed that 36 percent of gay and bisexual New York men who had five or more partners in the previous year did not use condoms consistently .

`` This is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading HIV , '' Freidan said .
