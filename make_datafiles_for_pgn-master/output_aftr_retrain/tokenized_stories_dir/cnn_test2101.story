`` It 's deeply , deeply disturbing to all of us , '' Gap President Marka Hansen said Sunday after watching a video of children at work in a New Delhi , India , sweatshop .

Hansen blamed the alleged abuse on an unauthorized subcontractor for one of its Indian vendors and said the subcontractor 's relationship with the Gap had been `` terminated . ''

She said the garments allegedly produced by the children represented a small portion of a single order placed with the vendor and that the clothes would not be sold in stores .

`` We strictly prohibit the use of child labor , '' Hansen said in a statement . `` Gap has a history of addressing challenges like this head-on , and our approach to this situation will be no exception .

The report first appeared Sunday in Britain 's Observer newspaper . Watch how children worked as virtual slaves ''

One 10-year-old boy told the paper he was sold to the company by his parents .

'' ` I was bought from my parents ' village in -LSB- the northern state of -RSB- Bihar and taken to New Delhi by train , '' The Observer quoted the boy as saying . `` The men came looking for us in July . They had loudspeakers in the back of a car and told my parents that , if they sent me to work in the city , they wo n't have to work in the farms . My father was paid a fee for me , and I was brought down with 40 other children . ''

The children were producing hand-stitched blouses for the Christmas market in the United States and Europe at Gap Kids stores , according to the newspaper . The blouses were to carry a price of about $ 40 , The Observer reported .

The Gap faced criticism for similar practices in 2000 , when a BBC documentary uncovered young girls producing Gap products at a Cambodian factory . But since then , Hansen said , the company has developed comprehensive policies to prevent abuse and protect workers ' rights . Hansen said violations of those policies are now `` extremely rare . ''

The Gap also operates Banana Republic and Old Navy stores . It has 3,100 stores around the world . E-mail to a friend
