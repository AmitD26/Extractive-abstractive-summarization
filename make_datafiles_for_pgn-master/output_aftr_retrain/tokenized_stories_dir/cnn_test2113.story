-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A computer-science detective story is playing out on the Internet as security experts try to hunt down a worm called Conficker C and prevent it from damaging millions of computers on April Fool 's Day .

They 're motivated in part by a $ 250,000 bounty from Microsoft and also by what seems to be a sort of Dick Tracy ethic .

`` We love catching bad guys , '' said Alvin Estevez , CEO of Enigma Software Group , which is one of many companies trying to crack Conficker . `` We 're like former hackers who like to catch other hackers . To us , we get almost a feather in our cap to be able to knock out that worm . We slap each other five when we 're killing those infections . ''

The malicious program already is thought to have infected between 5 million and 10 million computers .

Those infections have n't spawned many symptoms , but on April 1 a master computer is scheduled to gain control of these zombie machines , said Don DeBolt , director of threat research for CA , a New York-based IT and software company .

More likely , though , said DeBolt , the virus may try to get computer users to buy fake software or spend money on other phony products .

Experts said computer hackers largely have moved away from showboating and causing random trouble . They now usually try to make money off their viral programs .

The program 's code is also written to evolve over time and its author appears to be making updates to thwart some of the Conficker Cabal 's attempts to neuter the worm .

Worm program authors often hide in those countries to stay out of sight from law enforcement , he said .

In a way , the Conficker Cabal is also looking for the program author 's fingerprints . DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old malware programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C .

The prospects for catching the program 's author are not good , Morganelli said .

`` Unless they open their mouth , they 'll never be found , '' he said .

Microsoft released a statement saying the company `` is actively working with the industry to mitigate the spread of the worm . ''

DeBolt said people who use other antivirus software should check to make sure they 've received the latest updates , which also could have been disabled by Conficker C .

The first version of Conficker -- strain A -- was released in late 2008 .

That version used 250 Web addresses -- generated daily by the system -- as the means of communication between the master computer and its zombies .

The end goal of the first line was to sell computer users fake antivirus software , said Morganelli .

That process-of-elimination approach is n't likely to be effective with Conficker strain C , Morganelli said . The new version will generate 50,000 URLs per day instead of just 250 when it becomes active , DeBolt said .

The first iteration of Conficker is thought to have grown out of a free function for security programs created by Dr. Ronald Rivest , a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

CA said it recently found a piece of code in Conficker C that says the worm will become active on April 1 . Previous versions of the malicious software launched on specific dates noted in the program code , so the April Fool 's Day launch date is not likely to be a trick , DeBolt said .

`` The best minds in the industry are working on this to protect customers , '' he said . `` We 're trying to reduce the impact of the April 1 date as best we can . But we know ... this malware will continue to evolve . ''
