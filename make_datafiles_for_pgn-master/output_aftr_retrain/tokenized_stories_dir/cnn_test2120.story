New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He called the widow of Roger Maris a few days ago , a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of Bobby Kennedy-George Wallace .

Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do .

Think back , if you will , to September 8 , 1998 , when McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer of the season at Busch Stadium , then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the Maris children . Later , with tears streaming down his cheeks , McGwire told the media how , earlier that day , he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark . `` I touched it with my heart , '' he said . `` When I did that , I knew tonight was going to be the night . I can say my bat will lie next to his , and I 'm damn proud of it . ''

By all accounts , back then Pat Maris thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow , one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark .

Manning Up -LRB- verb -RRB- : When someone is caught cheating and , following a lengthy period of silence and/or denial , has no choice but to vaguely express remorse/regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of Holiday Inn banquet room autograph shows for $ 15 a pop alongside Erin Moran and the robot girl from Small Wonder . The fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms .

So , like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte and Alex Rodriguez before him , Mark McGwire finally `` manned up . ''

Twelve years after shattering Maris ' record , five years after his embarrassing , I 'm - not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony , the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED , and that he was very , very wrong .

Well , pretty wrong .

Well , sorta wrong .

Well , uh , not really wrong at all .

Between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses , McGwire apologized for , ahem , nothing . Costas asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids . `` Absolutely , '' McGwire said . `` I was given this gift by the man upstairs . ''

By using PED , he did n't merely take Maris ' record . No , McGwire made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere . He was selected to All-Star Games that should have featured other players . He won Sports Illustrated 's Sportsman of the Year as other candidates were overlooked . He convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history -- real , honest-to-goodness history -- when , in fact , it was all a WWE-styled illusion .

Pat Maris received her phone call . Will you be getting yours ?

He says steroid user apologies have given a new , ignoble , meaning to `` manning up ''

Even Costas ' questions could n't get McGwire to show grasp of offense , he says
