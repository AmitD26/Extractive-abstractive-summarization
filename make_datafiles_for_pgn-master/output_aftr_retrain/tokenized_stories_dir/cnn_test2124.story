Serato is an Italian chef and the founder of Caterina 's Club , a nonprofit that provides dinner seven days a week to more than 300 children at the Boys & Girls Club in Anaheim , California . CNN asked Serato for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011 .

CNN : Where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero ?

I ca n't express the feelings I had at that moment . I was so happy . I was in tears . I wanted to scream like Tarzan ! It was amazing news .

I do believe that , all together , we can make a big difference . If restaurants and chefs across America worked with their local Boys & Girls Clubs and followed our program , we could feed millions of children .

Serato : It will help me to keep doing what I do and serve more children in need . I also hope to travel to promote the program and make more people aware of our national `` motel kids '' problem .

CNN : What do you want people to know most about your work ?

If you give up one cup of coffee a day , you can feed 10 kids . One bag of pasta costs a few dollars , and that can serve 10 kids .

If I can feed more than 300 kids alone , all together we can feed millions .
