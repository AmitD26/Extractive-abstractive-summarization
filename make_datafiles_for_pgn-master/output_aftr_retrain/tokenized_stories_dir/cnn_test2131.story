No one has so far claimed responsibility for removing the statue but residents and journalists suspect hardline Islamist militants who have in the past branded the nude artwork immoral and called for its removal .

`` All that remains is part of the base , showing that the bronze statue was wrenched off its pedestal , probably by a mechanical digger , '' reported the English-language daily Libya Herald .

The Culture Ministry condemned the act , saying in a statement `` the stealing of the statue is an act of vandalism and is an attempt to obliterate the trace and history of Libya 's landmarks . ''

The statue was hit by a mortar shell during heavy clashes between rival militias in August , leaving a gaping hole in the woman 's side .

One image appears to show a cut in gazelle 's leg , indicating an attempt to saw through the statue . Around that same time , the statue was temporarily covered up by a blue plastic tarp to hide her nudity .

There was plenty of condemnation on social media , but at least one poster on Twitter who sympathizes with the ISIS terror group saw the removal as a good thing .

`` Statue of Italians who brutally killed Libyans for over 20 + years is brought down today in '' #Tripoli . Libya is free , '' tweeted the user who only goes by the name `` Islam , '' later posting : `` Any Libyan who like that statue hates Libya and Islam . ''

Libya has been in the throes of civil unrest since the 2011 revolution and ouster of dictator Moammar Gadhafi , with rival militant factions competing for control over political and economic power and Libya 's vast oil reserves .

There are even two rival governments -- an Islamist-backed , self-installed government controls Tripoli , while a Western-backed government elected in June operates out of the country 's east .
