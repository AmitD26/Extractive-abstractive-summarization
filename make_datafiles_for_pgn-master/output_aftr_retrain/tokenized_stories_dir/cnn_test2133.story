Apple is fine example of a purposeful organization . Its leadership under Steve Jobs at the helm was focused on producing well-designed products , easy to use as tools of productivity or means of entertainment . Everyone in Apple has been focused on this mission . You could say much the same about the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain . Everyone from top to bottom , and that includes maids and wait staff , knows how to deliver a superior guest experience .

Among the ways leaders instill purpose in an organization , according to research conducted my book , Lead With Purpose , Giving Your Organization a Reason to Believe in Itself , is through communicating the vision , tying customer benefits to employee contributions , and linking work to results .

As Nayar wrote in his book , Employees First , Customers Second , `` The role of the CEO is to enable people to excel , help them discover their own wisdom , engage themselves entirely in their work , and accept responsibility for making change . '' Toward that end , Nayar regards himself as a servant of his organization one who holds himself accountable for putting individuals and teams into positions where they can excel .

Purpose is especially necessary in tough times . As Roger Webb , President of the University of Central Oklahoma , told me an in an interview : `` If people do n't feel the purpose , and do n't feel the goal and -LSB- know -RSB- that they are accomplishing things and moving forward , then depressing news can really bring people down . ''

While purpose is the spark that sets up the vision -- where an organization is headed -- and defines its mission , it becomes inert if not practiced . So a leader must `` connect the dots '' between what an employee does and why it matters to the organization .

Employees throughout Ford understand the responsibility they have to deliver on One Ford . If you work in manufacturing you understand that decisions and actions you make complement Ford 's ability to build world-class products . Or if you work in marketing , you know how your marketing plan for the Focus complement the strategic imperative . Put in other way , purpose becomes personal .

Answers to these questions will enable the leader to provide his team with a goals . Ways to deliver on this will include briefings from senior management but it will more importantly involve having conversations about what the team is doing and why it matters . Stories about what is working or what is not can greatly contribute to a greater understanding of purpose .

Leadership is a choice for individuals to make , but the leader must provide his or her team with clear direction founded on purpose and understanding .
