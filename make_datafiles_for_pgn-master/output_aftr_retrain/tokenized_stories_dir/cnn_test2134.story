He then allegedly threatened to do the same to her , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office said in a statement Wednesday .

Diatchenko , who appeared in episodes of `` Sons of Anarchy , '' reportedly made quite a show of the butchery , sending his ex-girlfriend blow-by-blow photos of what he was doing , according to authorities .

The actor told a reporter from CNN affiliate KCAL in a phone interview that it was a hoax , that he did n't really eat the pet .

Instead , he turned the rabbit loose , he told KCAL , and purchased rabbit meat to make her think it was the pet he had eaten .

Diatchenko and his ex-girlfriend had been living together `` for some time '' after the end of their romantic relationship , the statement said .

Diatchenko , 46 , allegedly turned on the rabbit after the woman said they should no longer be roommates , the statement said . The ex-girlfriend was n't identified by prosecutors .

`` Diatchenko skinned the pet , cooked it and ate half of it while sending her step-by-step pictures of what he did , '' the district attorney 's statement said . `` When she returned , the defendant allegedly told her he would do the same to her . ''

Diatchenko , who has also appeared in episodes of `` Bones '' and `` How I Met Your Mother , '' is scheduled to be arraigned on December 30 . Prosecutors said they plan to ask for bail to be set at $ 90,000 .
