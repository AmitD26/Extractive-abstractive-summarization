-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I once stayed at a youth hostel in Copenhagen called Sleep in Heaven . Which sounds quite pleasant until you realize that , apparently , heaven is cold and damp and completely infested with bedbugs .

I guess that 's the part they do n't tell you in Sunday school .

`` No , no . It 's great . Nothing to worry about . Beautiful white robes . Big puffy clouds . Probably a salad bar . ''

Something was rotten in the state of Denmark .

The next day , bitten and disgusted , I literally ran to catch a train to Berlin and have n't had pleasant thoughts about that country since .

This was back in 2003 . The tortured memories persist and still haunt my dreams .

Which is why , the other day , almost eleven years later , I was delighted to learn that the United States finally invaded Denmark , set it on fire , and raised the American flag .

Sort of .

Here 's what happened .

`` Harold , I think Paul next door is constipated again . ''

So , to the millions of fine people who play `` Minecraft , '' I sincerely apologize for oversimplifying your beloved game . It 's all just too complicated , for I have six functioning brain cells , and five of them are dedicated to breathing and blinking .

Really , it was a wonderfully creative and virtuous idea .

Thus , cyber vandals promptly decided to blow it up .

But through their virtual sneak attack invasion , the vandals proudly constructed virtual American flags all over town , and built virtual signs reading : AMERICA .

Initially , it was believed that the virtual damage was virtually catostraphic and virtually widespread . However , Chris Hammeken , an actual spokesperson from the Danish Geodata Agency , explained to the BBC , `` Only a minor area was destroyed . ''

There was no official word on whether or not a virtual Sleep In Heaven youth hostel was annihilated in the process .

I guess a man can dream .

The whole thing was just so absurd and wonderfully American .
