London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you call your office IT department , find someone to develop your website or browse in a computer store , chances are you 'll be dealing with a man .

Maggie Berry , founder of recruitment and career development agency Women in Technology , says employers are crying out for more women in their technology teams .

Almost two-thirds of respondents had more than 10 years experience in the technology sector , yet only 26 % have reached senior management or board level .

Technology recruiters would love to take on more women , but ca n't do so if they do n't see your CV , says Berry . So be more speculative and apply for jobs that stretch you a bit .

`` Women need to grasp the interest and be more ambitious in putting themselves forward for jobs or for promotion . ''

Almost 90 % of the respondents to the Women in Technology survey said they would need to fulfill three-quarters of the job description before applying for a job .

2 . Self-promotion is OK

`` If you look at technology conference lineups , the speakers are almost all men , '' said Berry . `` Women spend a lot of time keeping their heads down and getting their jobs done .

A mentor , someone more experienced in your industry , who can advise you on career choices is invaluable , says Berry .

Even better is finding a sponsor -- someone within your company who will root for you , promote your work and push you for promotion .

Berry said : `` Women tend to be good at finding mentors , but not so many have sponsors , who will speak up for them and actively work to progress their careers .

`` Women can feel quite isolated as they might be the only female in their department or team , so it is very powerful to have people looking out for you . ''

Among the responses given in the Women in Technology survey was that more female mentors and role models were needed in schools and universities to encourage more girls into IT .

4 . Get networking

`` Networking is something you need to do right from the start of your career . It should be part and parcel of your professional life , '' said Berry . `` You could join a professional body , a specific network for your specialism or something locally where you live .

`` You need as many people as you can to call on for advice . ''

5 . Do n't act like a man

Women who responded to the survey were almost equally divided on whether they felt showing male characteristics helped them at work .

`` I would like to think women can progress without having to act like one of the boys . Whatever the culture of a workplace , it 's important to be authentic to yourself . ''

6 . Keep in touch if you have a career break

The technology industries lose a huge number of talented women who find it hard to get back in after a career break with children , says Berry .

`` Technology is changing so quickly with new releases and new software , so it 's really important to keep your skills up to date .

`` There are no easy answers , and it 's a big problem for the industry . I would like to see employers running ` return to work ' schemes to help women get their skills back up to date after a career break .

`` It would help them harvest that talent and would help everyone , but it needs investment . ''
