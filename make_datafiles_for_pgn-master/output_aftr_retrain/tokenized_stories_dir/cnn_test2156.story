-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just like those petite waifs that glide effortlessly down the Rue de Rivoli , seen at first-hand the beauty of Paris can be breathtaking .

The Eiffel Tower is one of the world 's most iconic buildings and is just one of the city 's many highlights .

In recent years the French capital has had its elegant facade ruffled by an explosion of discontent among the city 's disenfranchised underclass .

All this has happened in the city 's ghettoized suburbs -- the banlieues . If you stay in the pristine center , you 'd never know it was going on .

Winding your way along the banks of the Seine near Notre Dame on a spring day can feel like being in beautiful day dream .

Of course , you might find the illusion comes crashing down around you when you sit down at a cafe and discover the rudest man on the planet disguised as your waiter . But what would Paris be without those famously haughty Parisians , regarding you with thinly veiled contempt when you try to order `` deux billet pour le metro '' in a bad French accent ?

The cramped and disease-ridden streets of medieval Paris were torn down in the 19th century . The work commissioned by Napolean III and supervised by the urban planner Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann transformed the center into the city of wide boulevards and grand squares that you see today .

Haussman 's Paris might look like the set from a sumptuous period drama but it 's not untouched by the modern .

Of course there 's only one way to contemplate this and the many other questions the city raises . That 's with a cafe au lait in hand , seated at a terrasse watching the world , and the waifs go by .
