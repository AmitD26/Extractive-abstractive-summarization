Dr. Michael Baden , the former medical examiner for the city of New York , conducted a second autopsy on the 18-year-old 's body after a local medical examiner performed one .

Though the grand jury has until January to make a decision , the prosecutor 's office has said that an announcement on whether it will indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson could come as early as mid-November .

Witnesses to the shooting say that Brown , an unarmed African-American , had his hands in the air as if he was surrendering when he was shot by Wilson , a white officer . Authorities have said that Brown tussled with Wilson and tried to take the officer 's weapon .

Brown was shot at least six times , independent autopsy shows

Legal opinions differ

CNN 's legal experts are offering differing opinions about allowing an expert hired by a party in a case to address a grand jury .

`` Grand juries often hear a variety of evidence from many different sources , '' he said . `` Calling this expert is consistent with the prosecutor 's promise to present all the available evidence to the grand jury . ''

CNN legal expert and longtime New York attorney Paul Callan , who has presented cases to hundreds of grand juries , said it is highly unusual .

`` When a prosecutor says he 's going to present all evidence available , the implication is that he or she is presenting all sorts of objective evidence of non-interested bystanders , '' Callan said .

The Brown family pathologist `` is someone hired by the family and presumably to support a civil lawsuit for money damages later , '' Callan said .

Baden is a high-profile pathologist , having testified in the murder trials of O.J. Simpson , Phil Spector and Drew Peterson . He was also chairman of the committee of pathologists that investigated the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. .

Opinion : What Michael Brown 's autopsy tells us

Grand jurors ' work is done in secret . Only a prosecutor and the jurors are present ; the defense attorney is not privy to the proceedings . The jurors can ask a prosecutor to see anything -- including , for example , an autopsy conducted by an outside expert , Callan said . But -- if it 's legal -- it 's at the prosecutor 's discretion whether to give it to them , the attorney explained .

A prosecutor has to `` be careful '' Jackson said on CNN Wednesday . A grand jury should hear information that is explanatory rather than persuasive , he stressed .
