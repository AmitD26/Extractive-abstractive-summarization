CDC director Thomas Frieden defended President Barack Obama 's $ 6.2 billion proposal to combat Ebola , pointing out that the CDC is working on `` borrowed dollars . ''

Band Aid 's Geldof on Ebola : ` We 're going to stop this thing '

If secured , the funding will be spent in part on increased foreign aid to halt the spread of Ebola in West Africa . Another portion of the money could build new safeguards to help American hospitals respond swiftly to potential future outbreaks .

Currently , not all American medical centers are equipped to treat Ebola . With more funding , officials , say , hospital training can be expanded beyond the four medical centers where patients are funneled .

Obama made his pitch for increased funding just before a meeting with top health officials earlier Tuesday .

In his remarks , the President admitted that media attention over the crisis has ebbed in recent weeks as the number of American Ebola patients has decreased -- but insisted that future risks can be minimized if Congress acts now .

Should cities be reimbursed for Ebola costs ?

For additional funding to be secured , Congress will need to pass a new budget by Dec. 11 before the GOP Senate majority is sworn in -- or risk a government shutdown .
