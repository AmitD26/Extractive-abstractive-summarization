`` I announce today my defection from the killing and terrorist regime and I announce that I have joined the ranks of the freedom and dignity revolution . I announce that I am from today a soldier in this blessed revolution , '' Riyad Hijab said in a written statement read by a Syrian opposition official on Al Jazeera .

Al-Assad appointed Hijab prime minister in June , a month after parliamentary elections that were boycotted by supporters of those seeking to oust al-Assad .

Opposition leaders said Hijab had defected , while Syrian state television said al-Assad dismissed Hijab from his post Monday .

Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said officials had n't `` heard anything from the former prime minister , '' according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency

In July , one of Syria 's most senior diplomats -- Nawaf al-Fares -- defected , publicly embraced his country 's uprising and called for a foreign military intervention . Al-Fares was Syria 's ambassador to Iraq .

Manaf Tlas , a Sunni general in Syria 's elite Republican Guards , also defected last month . Tlas is the son of a former defense minister and a cousin of a first lieutenant in al-Assad 's army .

Hijab , like al-Fares and Tlas , is a Sunni who served in a power structure dominated by the Alawite minority , an offshoot of Shiism .

Opposition leaders hailed the news of Hijab 's defection .

`` We consider the defection to be what is morally right and what is called for at this historic time , '' said Abdulbaset Sieda , head of the Syrian National Council . `` This is a killer and criminal regime , and at this historic moment , there should be no further hesitation . It is imperative to stand by the people of Syria now . ''

There were conflicting reports about the whereabouts of Hijab .

Jordanian government spokesman Samih Maaytah said Hijab had not entered the country 's territories , according to state television . But a senior Jordanian official told CNN that Hijab had defected to Jordan and was with his family .

`` The flight of some personalities , however high-ranking , wo n't affect the Syrian state , '' state-run SANA said Monday , citing the country 's information minister .

Meanwhile , fighting raged in Aleppo , Syria 's most populous city .

Snipers fired from the roofs of buildings and artillery fire rang out in the besieged neighborhood of Salaheddin .

CNN 's Ben Wedeman said drivers had to dodge piles of rubble in the streets . Residents evacuating to safer neighborhoods left their homes with all the belongings they could carry , he said .

A dark plume of smoke rose in the air near Aleppo 's ancient citadel .

At least one rebel-controlled neighborhood was notably calmer , Wedeman said . Shops and bakeries were open , and residents walked the streets .

Clashes raged for hours at various spots near the city center , some close to the presidential palace , said Bashir Al-Hajji , a spokesman for a Free Syrian Army brigade in Aleppo .

As rebels scrambled to fend off regime forces in Aleppo , fighting was reported in other parts of Syria .

CNN can not independently confirm reports of violence , as the government has severely restricted access to Syria by international journalists .

Three Iranian prisoners were killed in the Damascus suburbs during heavy shelling Monday , according to the LCC . The opposition network did not provide additional details .

State media reported over the weekend that `` armed terrorists '' had attacked and kidnapped 48 Iranian Shiite pilgrims on a bus near the capital .

Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict first flared in March 2011 , when government forces began cracking down on protesters , Ban said last month . The opposition put the toll at more than 20,000 .
