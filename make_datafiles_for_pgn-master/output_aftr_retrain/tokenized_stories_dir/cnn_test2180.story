She died at the family home in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , according to a statement released by the family .

`` Today we have lost the comfort of Elizabeth 's presence but she remains the heart of this family , '' the statement said . `` We love her and will never know anyone more inspiring or full of life . ''

Edwards was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her husband lost his bid for vice president in November 2004 . John Edwards , a one-term Democratic senator , was Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry 's running mate .

It was later revealed that she knew before the election she might have cancer , but shielded her husband from the news during the campaign . She immediately underwent treatment , and the cancer was believed to be in remission .

In March 2007 -- at the start her husband 's 2008 presidential campaign -- Edwards learned that the cancer had returned and spread .

The cancer was diagnosed treatable but not curable , Edwards said .

Despite the diagnosis , Edwards said she was ready to go forward with her husband 's bid for the White House .

`` Either you push forward with the things that you were doing yesterday or you start dying , '' she said . `` If I had given up everything that my life was about ... I 'd let cancer win before it needed to . ''

`` Maybe eventually it will win , '' she said . `` But I 'd let it win before I needed to . ''

John Edwards , unable to compete with the attention focused on then-Sens . Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , withdrew from the presidential race in January 2008 .

John Edwards said the affair happened in 2006 while his wife 's cancer was in remission . He claimed he informed his wife at the time and asked for her forgiveness .

The affair appeared to end any future political ambitions the former senator may have had . It also led to the couple 's separation .

Elizabeth Edwards was born Mary Elizabeth Anania on July 3 , 1949 , in Jacksonville , Florida . Her father was a Navy pilot , and in her early years , she attended school in Japan .

The couple was married July 30 , 1977 , the Saturday after they took their state bar exams . They had four children : Wade , Cate , Emma Claire , and Jack . Wade Edwards was killed in a car accident in 1996 .

Mrs. Edwards worked as a clerk for U.S. District Judge Calvitt Clarke Jr. in Norfolk , Virginia , and was a bankruptcy lawyer in Raleigh .

In 2006 , after her initial cancer diagnosis , she wrote `` Saving Graces : Finding Solace and Strength from Friends and Strangers , '' which chronicled the aftermath of her son 's death and her battle with the disease .

When her cancer returned in 2007 , the couple held a news conference to publicize the information and declare their intention to continue with John Edwards ' campaign .

`` I see the father of my children , and that 's very important to me , '' she said . `` Particularly since I have a terminal disease , this is the person who at some point will take over the primary parenting , and it 's important to me that he heals , if he needs too . ''

`` It 's really hard to use a word like forgiveness but we found a new of interacting with one another that is healthy -- and I think for the kids -- and really easy for us , which is great , '' she said .

She said living with stage four cancer `` is like dancing with a partner who keeps changing . ''

On Monday , the Edwards family released a statement saying that further cancer treatment would be unproductive .

In a message posted on her Facebook page , Elizabeth Edwards addressed her family and friends :

`` The days of our lives , for all of us , are numbered . We know that . And , yes , there are certainly times when we are n't able to muster as much strength and patience as we would like . It 's called being human , '' she wrote .
