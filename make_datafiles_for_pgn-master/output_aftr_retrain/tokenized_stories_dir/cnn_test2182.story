-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jacqueline Woodson 's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke .

`` Just let that sink in your mind , '' said Handler , who writes popular children 's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket .

`` I 'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you , Cornell West , Toni Morrison , and Barack Obama saying this guy 's OK , '' Handler said , with a laugh .

Handler responded with several apologetic tweets , including : `` My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes , racist . ''

Handler also pledged to donate $ 10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others ' donations for 24 hours up to $ 100,000 .

Woodson 's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler 's joke . The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident .
