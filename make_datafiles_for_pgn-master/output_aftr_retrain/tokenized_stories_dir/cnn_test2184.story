But Felipe Diosdado said he did n't feel much like smiling Thursday night , even though Obama 's new plan will give him a chance to avoid deportation and find a better job .

`` People are crying , '' he told CNN in a phone interview from Chicago . `` I ca n't celebrate this , because there are a lot of people left out . ''

The White House estimates nearly 5 million people will benefit from Obama 's new executive action . But that 's less than half of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country , Diosdado said .

`` I want to cry tears of happiness , '' said Maya Ledezma , a 32-year-old mom from Mexico who watched the speech at a party in Maryland .

Because her 6-year-old daughter is a U.S. citizen and she 's been in the United States for more than five years , Ledezma is among the millions who Obama said can step out of the shadows if they submit to a background check and pay back taxes .

After years of living in constant fear of being deported , she said Obama 's announcement gave her hope that she will watch her daughter grow up and succeed .

`` This is a great relief , '' she said , `` a victory , an obstacle that we have overcome . ''

` My head hurts '

At another watch party in Washington , Jose Luis Zelaya said his head was spinning . For years , the Honduran immigrant has been on the front lines of immigration activism in the United States , pushing for reforms in Washington while continuing his graduate studies at Texas A&M University , where he also ran for student body president .

On Thursday , he hoped he 'd be able to call his mother and giver her the same good news .

`` My head hurts , because my mother does n't benefit from this . And I am where I am because of my mother . And everything that I do is because of her , '' Zelaya said .

` It 's what we were waiting for '

At first , Mario did n't believe it . Before Obama 's speech , he told CNN he was trying not to get his hopes up .

Mario has been living in the United States for 14 years after leaving his home in Mexico in search of better job prospects . He found them , and he 's worked on farms harvesting onions and packing pine straw for more than a decade .

Still , he said , they know everything could change with the stroke of a future president 's pen .

`` Nothing is impossible . Later they could change their policies and deport us more easily , or something like that . It 's difficult because we do n't know what ideas others will have , '' he said .

After Thursday 's speech , she said she was hopeful things might change dramatically soon .

`` The fear of being separated wo n't be there anymore , and that 's the biggest thing we just want to get rid of , '' she said .

But she 's still waiting .

Group of ` Dreamers ' grows

For one of America 's most well known undocumented immigrants , Obama 's announcement was welcome news he 'd been waiting decades to hear .

Jose Antonio Vargas became an outspoken advocate pushing for an overhaul of the nation 's immigration laws in 2011 , when he revealed he was undocumented in a column for The New York Times Magazine .

Now , he says he 'll finally be able to get permission to return to the Philippines and visit his mother after 21 years apart .

`` It 's one of those things where I 've been thinking about it all day , and it has n't really sunk in , '' he told CNN 's Anderson Cooper . `` I have been here since I was 12 -- 21 years . For somebody to just say , OK , now it is OK . You can get a work permit . You can get a driver 's license . You can travel outside the country . ... It 's a great night . ''
