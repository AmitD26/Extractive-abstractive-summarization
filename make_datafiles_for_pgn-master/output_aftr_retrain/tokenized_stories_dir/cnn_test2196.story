A few years ago , PBS science correspondent Miles O'Brien reported about patients who were receiving modern artificial body parts to help them recover from the loss of the limb .

He talked with CNN affiliate WUSA on Thursday in his first interview after a surgeon removed his left arm just above the elbow . He said he was going to see some doctors over the next few days .

And he tried to look on the bright side of needing technological help with his life .

`` If nothing else , this is a great opportunity for me to buy some really cool new gadgets , right ? '' he told the station . `` I look forward to see what technology can do for me . ''

During surgery , O'Brien 's blood pressure fell to the point where his life was in danger . The doctor made the choice to take much of the arm .

O'Brien , 54 , said his personal doctor studied the charts and agreed that amputation was the best option .

`` He said it probably would have been the same consequence , wherever I would have been , '' he said .

O'Brien , an award-winning science journalist and former CNN correspondent and anchor , said work is a welcome tonic . Thursday , he was moderating a panel on climate change at the National Academy of Sciences in the Washington area .

O'Brien revealed his story in a blog post entitled `` Just a Flesh Wound '' on Wednesday .

`` I wish I had a better story to tell you about why I am typing this with one hand -LRB- and some help from Dragon Dictate -RRB- , '' he wrote .

Pressure builds up

The National Institutes of Health says muscles in the arms and legs are separated from each other by thick layers of tissue called fascia , and each fascia has space in it , called a compartment , with muscle tissue , nerves and blood vessels .

When there is swelling in a compartment , pressure in that area will increase and press on the muscles , blood vessels and nerves .

`` If this pressure is high enough , blood flow to the compartment will be blocked , '' according to the NIH 's MedlinePlus resource . `` This can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves . If the pressure lasts long enough , the muscles may die and the arm or leg will not work anymore . It may need to be amputated . ''

Symptoms of severe cases of compartment syndrome include skin paleness , numbness , tingling , decreased sensation , weakness and severe worsening pain . Early diagnosis and treatment are key for a good recovery .
