Ivo Daalder told reporters late Sunday there is `` no planning going on that 's related to a NATO role in Syria . ''

`` As it relates to NATO planning , a NATO ally has to come forward and request that type of planning . So that 's a circumstance that has n't taken place , '' the ambassador said . `` We 'd obviously take any requests of that nature seriously if it were to be made . ''

`` We 've also decided , however , that a military intervention of the nature that we did in Libya would further militarize the situation in ways that would n't necessarily protect civilian life , '' Daalder said . '' ... Unlike Libya , you do n't have pockets of the country that can be protected by civilian protection zones . You 've got security forces intermingled with the population , and that introduction of greater military intervention from outside or arms to groups within Syria could further militarize the conflict in a counterproductive way . ''

The United Nations says at least 9,000 people have been killed since initially peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011 . Opposition activists put the toll at more than 11,000 .

Syria 's government , meanwhile , said it buried 18 more members of its security forces who died battling `` armed terrorist groups '' around the country . CNN can not independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media .

The fighting has continued despite a peace plan brokered by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan , now a special envoy for the United Nations and the Arab League .
