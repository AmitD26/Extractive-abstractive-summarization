-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New Jersey voters head to the polls on Wednesday in a special U.S. Senate election that 's become a proxy fight over the federal government shutdown and the bitter partisan battle in the nation 's capital over the rollout of the national health care law .

The contest is the first federal election since the start of the shutdown on October 1 , and that fiscal fight and the battle over extending the nation 's debt limit , along with back and forth over Obamacare , have become big issues on the Garden State campaign trail .

Booker , who for weeks has characterized Lonegan as a far-right , tea party conservative , is framing the race partially as a national referendum .

In the second of their two debates , Lonegan , who 's criticized Booker for what the Republican describes as his celebrity status , said that the nationally recognized Booker is a `` Hollywood stand-in '' for President Barack Obama .

On the eve of the special election , Booker led Lonegan 54 % -40 % among likely voters in a Quinnipiac University poll . In two surveys released Monday , Booker held a 10 point , 52 % -42 % , advantage in a Monmouth University poll , and a 22-point , 58 % -36 % , lead in a Rutgers-Eagleton survey .

`` It 's a New Jersey habit electing Democrats to the Senate . The liberal mayor of Newark , Cory Booker , holds onto the double-digit lead over the conservative former mayor of Bogota , Steve Lonegan , that we measured when we first looked at likely voters , '' said Maurice Carroll , director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute .

Low turnout 's expected for a contest that 's being held on a Wednesday and that comes less than three weeks before the state holds a gubernatorial election .

Less than two-thirds of registered voters know that the Senate election is happening , and only a third can name both candidates in the Senate election without prompting , according to Fairleigh Dickinson University data .

`` The timing of the election , combined with everything going on in Washington right now , has really diverted attention from the Senate race , '' said Dan Cassino , a professor of political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University . `` That tells us that we 're not going to see huge crowds at the polls on Wednesday . ''

To help bring Democrats to the polls , Booker 's campaign released a video message Monday from Obama , who urged New Jersey voters to turn out for the Democratic candidate .

`` Cory Booker has spent his entire life bringing people with different perspectives together , regardless of party , to take on tough challenges , '' said the President , in the video .

And Saturday , former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a favorite among grassroots conservatives , campaigned with Lonegan at a high profile event organized by a national tea party group .

The winner of Wednesday 's special election will serve out the final year of Lautenberg 's term . The Democrat died in June .

And questions about Booker 's sexuality arose after he told the Washington Post earlier this year that he did n't care if supporters thought he was gay .

`` It 's something that 's almost fatiguing at this point , '' Booker told CNN 's Carroll . `` At the end of the day , I just believe we should be electing people on the content of their character , on the quality of their ideals , their dedication to their cause , not on who they 're dating . ''
