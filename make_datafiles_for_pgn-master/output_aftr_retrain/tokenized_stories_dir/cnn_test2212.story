Michelle Crumrine was out of town when a tornado tore through her neighborhood .

`` A lot of people have a pile of rubble still , '' she said , `` and I do n't have anything . ... It 's gone . I do n't know where it went . ''

Nearby , rescuers with flashlights trudged through the neighborhood in the dark of night , searching for signs of life in the wreckage .

As a severe weather system slammed the Midwest on Sunday , spawning dozens of tornadoes , flash floods and hail , this town of 10,000 people was among the hardest hit . A neighborhood was flattened , at least one person died and dozens in the area were injured .

In two communities , storms destroyed at least 70 homes , according to Jonathon Monken , director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency . Rescuers were trying to reach people trapped in their basements , he said . One hospital in Peoria was treating 37 patients with injuries .

The outbreak also forced fans to evacuate the stands for nearly two hours during an NFL game in Chicago .

`` It was complete destruction , '' said Anthony Khoury , who lives in Washington . `` There are people in the streets crying . ''

As a tornado neared his home , Khoury prayed and recorded a video of the dark twister churning toward him .

`` The tornado happened in my backyard , and you can hear people screaming , '' he told CNN 's iReport . `` We were freaking out . ''

Video from CNN affiliate WMBD showed one Washington neighborhood where a tornado smashed cars and houses , littering the ground with broken wood beams and flinging furniture and debris onto lawns , sidewalks and streets .

In nearby Peoria , Mayor Jim Ardis said his city was planning to send aid to help storm recovery in Washington , where a tornado hit what he described as a `` very densely populated area . ''

`` We saw trees down , houses with their roofs completely torn off . I saw a lot of people in distress with their homes destroyed , '' he said . `` It was n't a pretty sight . ''

Officials delayed the NFL game between the Chicago Bears and Baltimore Ravens for nearly two hours as storms approached Chicago , warning spectators to leave the stands at Soldier Field and head for covered areas .

`` The rain started coming , the skies got black , the wind was insane , and they evacuated us to underneath the concrete concourse , '' said Jim Arnold , who was at the game with his 11-year-old daughter .

`` We 've been through 15-degree-below weather and winds , but never anything like this , '' Arnold said . `` The winds gusted at 70 mph , and the winds and the rain were horizontal and everybody was running . It was just crazy . ''

Fans returned to their seats and the game resumed mid-afternoon after the storm passed .

`` These storms having been moving so fast today , it 's been hard to keep up , '' said storm chaser Tony Laubach , who spoke to CNN as he watched a tornado touch down outside Lebanon , Indiana .

Monken said there were at least 11 confirmed tornado touchdowns , and officials there expect the number of storm-related injuries to grow .

In Washington County , Illinois , an EF4 tornado packing a peak wind of 166 mph hit , leaving a path of destruction that stretched more than three miles , according to a preliminary survey by the National Weather Service .

At least six trucks overturned on highways about 80 miles west of Chicago due to high winds , the Ogle County Sheriff 's Office said .

In a Twitter post , Indiana State Police shared a photo of twisted metal , piles of debris and the shell of a school building .

Storms damaged a mall and a bank and collapsed the roof of a fire station in Kokomo , Indiana , said Larry Smith , emergency management director in Howard County .

In Missouri , state emergency officials said a tornado may have hit Scott County , where heavy winds overturned three rail cars , blew over four mobile homes and damaged five fixed homes on foundations .

In Michigan , high winds knocked out power to at least 390,000 customers , utility companies said .

And in Ohio , more than 75,000 residents were without power after the storm hit , emergency officials said .

`` On the backside of that , temperatures are dramatically cooler . So that cold air is filtering in behind it , warm air out ahead of it , '' she said . `` And ... we get some twisting motion in the atmosphere . And that 's why we see this tornadic activity . ''
