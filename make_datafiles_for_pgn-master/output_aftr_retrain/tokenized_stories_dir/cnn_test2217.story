North Korea launched three short-range guided missiles into the sea off the Korean Peninsula 's east coast Saturday , South Korea 's semi-official news agency Yonhap cited the South Korean Defense Ministry as saying .

The ministry said it had detected two launches in the morning , followed by another in the afternoon , Yonhap reported .

According to the Arms Control Association , a U.S.-based organization , short-range guided missiles are generally classified as those traveling less than 1,000 kilometers -LRB- about 620 miles . -RRB-

Andrew Salmon , a journalist and author based in the South Korean capital , Seoul , said North Korea 's reported launch of short-range missiles Saturday should not cause the same degree of concern as the launch of a satellite or medium-range Musudan rocket .

The situation is much less tense in the region than it was last month , Salmon said .

`` The North Koreans have significantly de-escalated their bellicosity and their rhetoric since the end of April , '' he said . `` The South Korean government , I suspect , will not be strongly condemnatory of this test because right now they are very , very keen to get the North Koreans to the negotiating table . ''

The recent tensions flared after the North 's long-range rocket launch in December and underground nuclear test in February , both of which were widely condemned .

North Korea is demanding recognition as a nuclear power , something the United States refuses to countenance .

Last month 's crisis resulted in the closure of the Kaesong Industrial Complex , the last major symbol of inter-Korean cooperation .
