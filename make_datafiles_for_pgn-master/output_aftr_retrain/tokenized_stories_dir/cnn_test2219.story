Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are accusing a YouTube co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new `` foundering '' website .

A lawsuit filed Thursday by the celebrity couple blasts Chad Hurley , accusing him of secretly recording West 's surprise proposal to Kardashian in the middle of San Francisco 's AT&T Park on October 21 .

The lawsuit slammed Hurley , 36 , as a failed entrepreneur who leaked the video `` out of desperation . ''

`` Despite his extraordinary financial success in creating YouTube , which was sold in 2006 , Hurley has ever since sought his ` second act , ' '' the lawsuit said . `` This has become exceedingly elusive to Hurley . ''

`` An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21 , 2013 , event featuring West and Kardashian , '' it said .

The video is titled `` PLEEESE MARRY MEEE !!! Congrats Kim and Kanye ! ''

Hurley knows better , the lawsuit said . The terms of service on his own website warn users against posting any video that would violate copyrights , it said .

`` Undeterred by the contractual restrictions to which he had just agreed , Hurley opted to exploit and capitalize upon the extreme public interest he knew would attach to the event , in order to boost the fortunes or his underperforming business venture , '' the suit said .

Hurley and his company did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the lawsuit .
