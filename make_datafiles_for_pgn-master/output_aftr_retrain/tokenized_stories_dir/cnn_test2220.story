Ray Rice , the Baltimore Ravens running back suspended by the NFL for two games after video showed him dragging his unconscious then-fianc√©e from an elevator , told reporters Thursday his actions were `` inexcusable . ''

`` You know that 's not me , '' he said . `` You know that 's something I have to live ... with the rest of my life . ''

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said last week the running back would be suspended without pay for the first two games of the regular season .

He also was fined an additional game check for `` conduct detrimental to the NFL , '' according to a league news release . The total amount Rice loses in pay reportedly amounts to $ 529,411 .

Meanwhile , CNN anchor Carol Costello took to a soap box to ask point-blank : `` What was the NFL thinking ? '' She questioned Coach John Harbaugh 's decision to call Rice a `` heck of a guy '' and the Ravens ' decision to tweet : `` Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played the night of the incident . ''

Costello also invoked many observers ' dismay over the suspension of Cleveland Browns receiver Josh Gordon , who was suspended for a year after testing positive for marijuana .

However , Gordon 's suspension for a second positive drug test is dictated by the league 's 2011 collective bargaining agreement , where Goodell is judge and jury when it comes to suspensions and fines for off-the-field conduct .

Speaking at Thursday 's news conference , Rice said he let down his family , teammates and the city of Baltimore . He said he knows his 2-year-old daughter might read about this on Google one day .

He said violence -- `` especially man on woman '' -- is wrong and should n't be `` tolerated . '' He said he and his wife will speak out about domestic violence .

`` When the time is right we will go out there and help as many people as we can , '' he said .
