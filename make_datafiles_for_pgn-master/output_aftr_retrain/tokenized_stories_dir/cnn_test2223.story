-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Netherlands and Nigeria will begin using body scanners on airline passengers following the attempted terrorist attack on a U.S.-bound flight on Christmas Day , authorities in both nations said Wednesday .

The millimeter-wave body scanners will be in place at Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport in about three weeks and will be used on all passengers traveling to the United States , Dutch Interior Minister Guusje ter Horst told a news conference at The Hague .

`` We 've escaped a very serious attack with serious consequences , but unfortunately in this world there are individuals who do not shy away from attacks on innocent people , '' she said .

Nigeria did not say when it would begin the new scans . `` In combating the new threat of terrorism as unfolded recently , Nigeria will be upgrading its security screening system to 3D Total Body Imaging Scanner , '' the country 's airport authority said in a statement . It gave no further details .

The militant group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the December 25 plot .

Dutch authorities have already said they were confident in the security measures that were carried out when AbdulMutallab transferred to the Detroit flight from an earlier flight from Nigeria .

`` The introduction of these body scanners would certainly have helped in detecting that he was carrying something on his body , '' she said . `` We know that metal detection does not help to detect non-metal explosives , and these millimeter-wave scanners can do this , which would mean that this would be an improvement . ''

Ter Horst acknowledged that the systems currently in place are `` not watertight , '' which is why the body scanners are being introduced .

As to privacy concerns -- namely that the scanners could pick up private features of a person 's body -- ter Horst said the scan results would first go through a computer , which would then flag any suspicious items to a human .

The scanners will be permanent at Schiphol , and any passengers bound for the United States who do not go through them will be body-searched , ter Horst said .

Erik Akerboom , the Dutch national coordinator for counterterrorism , said part of the investigation is looking at whether the explosives were brought into Schiphol by someone else for AbdulMutallab to pick up later .

Asked about reports that AbdulMutallab paid for his ticket in cash and was flying only with hand luggage , Akerboom said neither would have necessarily raised any alarms .

His father talked twice about his son 's extremist views with at least one CIA representative at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and a report was prepared , but the report was not circulated outside the agency , a reliable source told CNN 's Jeanne Meserve on Tuesday .

Had that critical information been shared , the man might have been denied passage on the flight , the source said .

CIA spokesman George Little defended the agency 's actions regarding AbdulMutallab , but also said the agency is reviewing data to ascertain whether more could have been done .

State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said department staff did what they were supposed to by sending a cable to the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington about the matter . Kelly said any decision to revoke the suspect 's visa would have been an interagency decision .
