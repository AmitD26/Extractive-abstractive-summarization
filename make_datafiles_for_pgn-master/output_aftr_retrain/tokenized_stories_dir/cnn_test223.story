Han Lei , 39 , was charged with intentional homicide over the death of the two-year-old girl who died in hospital from brain damage 50 hours after being dashed to the pavement in the Daxing District of Beijing on July 23 .

The court sentenced his friend Li Ming , who helped Han escape after the incident , to five years ' jail .

The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People 's Court heard how Han and Li decided to drive to a karaoke bar after a dinner with several other people . Unable to find a parking space , they attempted to park at a bus stop where a woman , also surnamed Li , was waiting with the 2-year , 10-month-old baby who was named as Sun in court documents .

An altercation began when Han accused the mother of blocking the car 's path with the pushchair . The court heard how Han hit the mother and then proceeded to hurl the baby out of its pram .

The court rejected his defense that he had been intoxicated at the time of the attack , saying that his mental condition had been `` stable '' despite earlier drinking at dinner . Prosecutors recommended that Han , who committed the crime within a year of being released from prison , be given the death sentence .

Relatives of the child asked for a total of 2.73 million yuan -LRB- $ 443,513 -RRB- in civil compensation during the court hearing , according to state-run Xinhua .

`` Although he deserves the death , should n't we give him another chance ? Do we must have people die one after another ? '' said poster Linxidaxuesonglianli .
