The demonstrators have no clear leader . Many say Twitter posts and Facebook groups brought them to the streets of Mexico 's capital and cities around the country .

Local media reports have described it as `` the Mexican Spring , '' drawing a comparison with massive protests pushing for political change in the Middle East .

The surge of student activism has drawn attention at a key time during campaigning in the politically polarized country , where security concerns and economic problems have been top issues for candidates vying for the presidency .

TV coverage of the campaign has drawn sharp criticism from some protesters , who argue that national broadcaster Televisa has provided more favorable coverage to Enrique Pena Nieto , the Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate who leads in polls .

Mexican Interior Minister Alejandro Poire alluded to the protests Thursday .

`` I am convinced that having youth that are enthusiastic , proactive , participatory youth that are demanding of us is without a doubt , a fundamental activity of our democracy , and it is there , and today it is being expressed with great vigor , '' he said .

Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised the protesters .

`` They are touching on a fundamental theme that has to do with the pretension of dominating the country through the almost absolute control of the media , '' said Lopez Obrador , a former Mexico City mayor who frequently criticizes the country 's political establishment . He never conceded after officials declared Felipe Calderon the winner of Mexico 's election in 2006 and has been known to refer to himself as `` the legitimate president of Mexico . ''

`` It allowed me to see the interest there is among the youth to participate in this democratic process . How great that it is this way . It is a strength that we have built between all Mexicans , '' he said Thursday at a forum on security and justice

But Pena Nieto was less positive in comments to CNNMexico immediately after the May 11 event at the Iberoamerican University , where crowds booed and chanted `` get out '' at the candidate .

`` They are not all genuine , '' Pena Nieto said . `` But in the end the free space of the university must be respected and I am totally and absolutely respectful . ''

Officials from Pena Nieto 's campaign quickly dismissed the protests at the event , saying the outbursts were not from students , but from outsiders dragged there by political operatives to cause commotion .

Three days later , a YouTube video featured 131 students flashing their university ID cards , saying `` We are students from Ibero . ... Nobody forced us to do anything . ''

The 11-minute video went viral . It has been viewed more than 1 million times in the past 10 days .

Posts promoting protests throughout the country on social media in recent days have used it as a jumping off point , using the phrase '' #YoSoy132 '' -LRB- `` I am 132 '' -RRB- on Twitter and Facebook .

`` It is probably extreme to say that it is a Mexican Spring , alluding to -LRB- the protests -RRB- in North Africa , but nobody can dare to underestimate an action in which social networks were the catalyst for youth unrest , '' she wrote in an opinion column for CNNMexico.com this week .

`` I believe in the movement . I believe young people , we have great power in our hands . We have information and media that other groups do not have , '' said Paula Diaz , 23 , a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico . `` It is my duty to be here , informing people . I think we can do something great . ''

Some said the group needs stronger organization in order to prosper .
