What could possibly go wrong ? Many things ran through my head . A plane crash . Oxygen deprivation . A panic attack .

Another fear I had was swimming in large bodies of water . I knew how to swim ; I grew up with a pool at my house . I was very comfortable swimming in a pool because I could see the bottom . You ca n't see the bottom of the ocean when you swim in it .

What could possibly go wrong ? A shark attack . Oxygen deprivation . A panic attack .

I came to realize that I was missing out on things because of my fears . I would only vacation in places I could drive to . In fact , last October , my partner Joy and I drove 14 hours to Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , for a long weekend . We could have gotten a sweet rate on round-trip airfare and had more time at the beach , but I elected to drive instead .

I was beyond excited when I was selected for Fit Nation in December . But fear quickly took over when I realized that not only did Fit Nation involve swimming in the ocean but also two trips to California -LRB- somewhere beyond even my driving desire -RRB- .

I was scared . Yet I wanted to be part of Fit Nation so badly that I knew I would have to meet both of these fears head on .

In January , I was scheduled to fly to Atlanta for kick-off weekend . As the days got closer , I grew more anxious . People began to tell me stories about their first flying experience ; some had flown as children , unaccompanied , to visit family . Another friend told me she traveled often for her job ; she flew more than 140 times last year .

I came to realize that I was looking at the worst possible scenario instead of the best-case scenario .

I decided that I had to take a chance . Fortunately for me , my first flight was a short one . I kept telling myself that millions of people fly every day and nothing happens -- except that they get to their desired destinations and go about their business .

Then came our first training session in the ocean . I was nervous -- sweaty palms and all , as I listened to our instructions . But as my coach explained dolphin diving -LRB- a technique used by swimmers to get under a wave -RRB- I began to feel a sense of confidence . It was almost as if I knew what I had to do , and there was n't anything that was going to stop me .

Was my fear of the ocean , or of the unknown ? People who have swum less than me had completed this challenge ; what was holding me back ? One of the lifeguards set a buoy at 150 yards . My teammate and I swam out to it without any problems . I remember treading water , talking to him , thinking : `` I just swam 150 yards out into the ocean . This is n't bad . ''

Over the next few days , I completed four different swims in the Pacific Ocean , including a mock triathlon distance of 400 yards .

Do n't let your fears stand in your way of `` getting '' something more !
