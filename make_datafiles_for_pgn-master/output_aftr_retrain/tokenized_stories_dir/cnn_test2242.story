An autopsy report , made public six months after Miriam Carey was shot dead after leading Washington police on a car chase from the White House to the Capitol , revealed that the 34-year-old woman was struck by five bullets from behind .

Attorney Eric Sanders , who is representing members of Carey 's family in a wrongful death lawsuit against the government , said the autopsy proves the shooting was unjustified .

Lt. Kimberly Schneider , a spokeswoman for the U.S. Capitol Police , one of the agencies involved in the incident , said the department would not comment on the pending litigation and while an investigation is ongoing .

Sanders released the report on the six-month anniversary of the shooting , which captured national attention as the chase unfolded on cable networks and in the following hours when it was revealed the suspect was an unarmed dental hygienist from Connecticut with a 1-year-old in the backseat .

Chase began at the White House

On October 3 , Carey approached a White House checkpoint and was approached by Secret Service officers . She made a three-point turn , striking an officer who was trying to move a barricade into her path , before driving away , according to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant .

Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol , where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle . Carey put the car in reverse , hit a police car and drove away as officers fired at her .

Dramatic video footage by a videographer for Alhurra TV , a Middle Eastern news outlet financed by the U.S. government , showed the black vehicle then speeding around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then heading away . The car crashed into more security barriers a few blocks later , witnesses said .

One shot hit her in the head

The family is suing the Department of Justice , the Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police for $ 75 million .

The lawsuit says Carey was unfamiliar with the area and mistakenly drove past the first guard post . When she tried to make a U-turn and drive away , a uniformed Secret Service officer threw a bicycle rack at her car , the lawsuit claims .

Carey panicked when she was stopped near the traffic circle and surrounded by officers with their weapons drawn , the suit alleges .

The family contends in the document there was no legal justification for officers to shoot her and doing so went against their training .

Carey had passport , foreign currency in her car

Police likely feared terrorism

`` You do n't know if she has a bomb , '' CNN 's Mike Brooks said in October . `` You do n't know if it 's a terrorist attack . The officers just do n't know . ''

`` We live in times of heightened alert as far as terrorist activities are concerned , '' she said . `` The fact that she was not displaying a gun does n't mean anything , because bombers do n't necessarily display anything . They have the explosives around their waist , usually .

`` It 's a matter of a split-second decision that the police officer needs to take before someone explodes himself . It 's all about the larger context . They just push the button , or it could be activated from a remote location . ''

Sister : Carey diagnosed with postpartum depression

`` There was n't a pattern . It was something that occurred suddenly , '' Amy Carey-Jones said . `` She seemed overwhelmed . There was a lot of stress .

`` There were not moments of her walking around with delusions . That was not what was going on . ''
