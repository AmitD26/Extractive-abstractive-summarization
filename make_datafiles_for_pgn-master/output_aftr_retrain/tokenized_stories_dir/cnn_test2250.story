Morganza , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the first of potentially several bays of the Morganza spillway on Saturday afternoon , a move intended to spare some areas from severe flooding while redirecting water into others .

`` We think there is a successful operation going on right now , '' Col. Ed Fleming , the Corps ' New Orleans District Commander , told CNN an hour after the first floodgate was opened .

The move in Morganza , about 115 miles northwest of New Orleans , will lower anticipated cresting levels -- as well as lessen the potential for severe flooding caused by things like overtopped levees and cracks in flood-control structures -- along the rising Mississippi River and divert water from Baton Rouge and New Orleans . But it will flood parts of low-lying south-central Louisiana .

The opening came after several days of warning , as residents in the flood zone prepared to move to save their lives , even if their homes were washed away . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal predicted this week the high water resulting from the Morganza spillway opening could impact 3,900 people and 2,600 structures .

`` Right now , a lot of people are real nervous about it . It 's sad , '' said Larry Doiron , a resident of Stephenville , a town that could face flooding because of the spillway 's opening . `` We need to have protection so that they do n't flood us . ''

He said his subdivision would likely be fine , as it was built at a relatively high elevation , but that his neighbors were building additional levees and putting out sandbags .

Seven Louisiana parishes -- Pointe Coupee , St. Landry , St. Martin , Iberia , Iberville , St. Mary and Terrebonne -- will likely be affected by the first opening of the spillway since 1973 , according to the Corps .

Morgan City , which sits on the banks of the Atchafalaya River , is among those communities expected to see rising water . The Corps has joined with state and local authorities to build-up safeguards in that community of about 11,600 people , according to the U.S. Census Bureau .

Officials believe that the levees will protect the city from flooding , but some are taking preliminary precautions , she said . At Sacred Heart Church , where Bertaut works , people spent the day Friday moving important documents such a baptismal , marriage and financial records to the second floor .

The river 's slow pace has given emergency responders more time to prepare , forecasters said . But while the slow-moving water gives residents extra time to get ready , it also means that land could remain under water for some time .

Louisiana state authorities have been working with federal and local counterparts to combat flooding -- or , in some cases , prepare for it -- in 19 of its 64 parishes .

To help New Orleans , the Army Corps of Engineers said Friday that it will open 52 more bays at the Bonnet Carre Spillway just north of the city , diverting water into Lake Pontchartrain . That will mean a total of 264 bays will be open in the 350-bay spillway .

In Vicksburg , Mississippi , the river is expected to crest at 57.5 feet May 19 . This would be significantly above the flood stage at Vicksburg of 43 feet .

Homes that were built between the levee and the Mississippi River were the first affected .

Residents near Vicksburg counted on a levee for protection . In addition to the mainline levee along the river , starting near Vicksburg and extending northeast for more than 20 miles , a so-called backwater levee offers shelter .

The backwater levee is designed to keep water from backing into the Yazoo River delta and is designed lower than the mainline levee so that water can flow over it . That level is expected to be reached Monday , said Charlie Tindall , attorney for the Board of Mississippi Levee Commissioners .

`` There 's a chance it might not make it through an over-topping event , '' said Mississippi Levee Board Chief Engineer Peter Nimod about the backwater levee . `` There is a risk . We do n't think it will break , but we want people to be prepared . ''

`` It 's hard to plan for a multi-100-year event , '' he said .

Across the South and lower Midwest , floodwaters have covered about 3 million acres of farmland , eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn , wheat , rice and cotton , officials said .

CNN 's Ed Lavandera , Mariano Castillo , Mia Aquino and Erica Henry contributed to this report .
