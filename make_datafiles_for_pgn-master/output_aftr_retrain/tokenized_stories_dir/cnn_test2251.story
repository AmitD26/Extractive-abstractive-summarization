-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` I wo n't even sleep in the same room with them . ''

He takes all of his digital devices -- laptops , tablets , cellphones , anything portable that has a screen -- to another room before he turns off the light . He has come to terms with the fact that the technological gadgets that have so thoroughly insinuated themselves into our lives can become addictive .

So , when it 's time for slumber , he locks them out . He wo n't even let his cellphone charge overnight in the bedroom :

`` If it 's there , I would have the temptation to turn it on and check it . ''

We have learned to celebrate , even revere , the wireless gadgets we carry around and the inventors who bring them to us ; the response to the death of Steve Jobs this month was emblematic of how important our do-it-all phones , our computers , our tablets and related digital devices have become . We say that the technology has changed life as we used to know it .

For guidance on this , I got in touch with Sieberg , who has given as much thought to the subject as anyone of whom I 'm aware . A former CNN correspondent , he is a lecturer , writer and broadcaster on technology issues who , in his own life , became increasingly conscious of the unhealthy hold that digital devices can have . He wrote a book called `` The Digital Diet '' that argues persuasively that there can come a time in a person 's life when he or she is a good candidate for technology detox .

I asked him if `` addiction '' is too strong a word to use in relation to devices that seem to hook their users emotionally , but not chemically .

`` Unfortunately , the word ` addiction ' has become overused , '' he said , and should not be trivialized . Addictions to illegal drugs , alcohol and prescription medication are grimly somber matters . But , he said , the idea of an addiction to digital devices is genuine and is not something that should be greeted with a sardonic wink .

`` One definition of ` addiction ' is when other people and other activities in your life begin to suffer because of something you know you should cut back on , but do n't , '' he said .

Some of his examples are things that many people will instantly recognize :

-- The urge to pull out a cellphone even when someone you 're with is in the midst of a conversation with you .

-- Texting even while your child is telling you about his or her day at school , and realizing later that you ca n't remember the details of what your son or daughter has said to you .

-- Noticing that even when your family is all together in one room at home , each person is gazing at his or her own screen and tapping at a miniature keyboard .

There is , he said , a feeling common among people who are digitally hooked that , when it 's just them and the real world and no screen , they are somehow cast adrift , cut off : `` It 's a sense of , ` What am I missing ? ' '' But in truth , a strong case can be made that when a person lives too many hours a day in the digital universe , that is when he or she is really missing something -- missing the things that are taking place in the flesh-and-blood world .

Like him , we should consider locking all of those devices in another room at night . He promises that it makes a difference :
