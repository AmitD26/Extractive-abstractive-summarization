Qatar has promised laywer Michael Garcia `` full cooperation '' after soccer 's global governing body was engulfed in new scandal following a British newspaper 's damning investigation into the bidding process for the World Cup finals .

The story alleges a Qatari official paid more than $ 5 million in an attempt to secure support for his country 's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament .

Bin Hammam , the former president of the Asian Football Confederation , was a member of FIFA 's powerful 24-person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010 .

Despite the country 's small size , a technical report from FIFA calling its bid `` high risk '' and summer temperatures that can exceed 50 degrees Celsius -LRB- 122 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- , Qatar shocked the world by winning the right to host the 2022 finals , defeating bids by the United States , Australia , Japan and South Korea .

FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce has said he would back a re-vote , potentially opening the possibility of the U.S. staging the 2022 tournament .

When FIFA voted on who should host the 2022 World Cup in 2010 , the organization 's president Sepp Blatter reportedly voted for the U.S. , while a potential rival for the presidency , UEFA chief Michel Platini , voted for Qatar .

` Millions ' of e-mails

The Sunday Times claims to have seen millions of e-mails detailing payments to officials in the Caribbean , Africa and the Pacific designed to secure support for the tiny , gas-rich Middle Eastern emirate 's quixotic bid to host the world 's most popular sports tournament .

`` Bit by bit , we have been unraveling it and finally we hit the mother lode , '' Sarah Baxter , deputy editor of the Sunday Times , told CNN in an interview .

`` You also have a bunch of officials with a bearing on the vote begging favors . They were prepared to sell their influence . What bin Hammam was doing was buying people up who could have influence . ''

`` As was the case with every other member of FIFA 's executive committee , our bid team had to convince Mr. bin Hammam of the merits of our bid . ...

Dogged by allegations

Almost as soon as Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals , the process was dogged by allegations of bribery and corruption .

Bin Hammam was banned from all football-related activities for life after first being accused of offering bribes to soccer officials in the Caribbean seeking support for his doomed 2011 bid to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president .

He was cleared of those allegations after a hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport but was later banned for different `` conflict of interest '' charges relating to his time as AFC president .

The Sunday Times ' allegations come ahead of a FIFA-commissioned ethics investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments .

That two-year investigation has been led by Garcia .

`` We are cooperating fully with Mr. Garcia 's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry -LRB- sic -RRB- will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup fairly , '' the Qatar bid team added in its statement .

But FIFA 's head of media , Delia Fischer , told CNN that Boyce was not speaking to the BBC on behalf of FIFA when he mentioned a rerun of the vote and that the organization would not be making a statement until after Garcia 's meeting with the Qatari delegation in Oman .

The 11-page Sunday Times investigation uncovers an alleged murky world of international payments , favors and junkets .

`` But outside the executive committee and within the bid itself , Mohamed bin Hammam has been a very good mentor to us . He 's been very helpful in advising us how to go about with our messaging and can have the biggest impact .

`` He 's always been advising us and always been by our side . He 's definitely our biggest asset in the bid . ''

The Pacific connection

One of the most damaging claims centers on the fate of the former head of the Oceania Football Confederation , Reynald Temarii .

After Temarii had been caught on camera allegedly offering to sell his vote , he was suspended from the executive committee and had , according to the e-mails seen by the Sunday Times , been preparing to resign , allowing his deputy to vote in his stead .

That move effectively took a vote in the executive committee away the Oceania Football Confederation , which was likely to choose Qatar 's rival Australia .

`` I do n't know whether it is a smoking gun , but the Reynald Temarii allegations are very significant , '' said James Corbett , one of the world 's leading journalists on FIFA 's World Cup bidding process .

`` What it shows is clear manipulation by someone very close to the bid , '' he added .

`` Putting someone -LRB- a soccer official -RRB- from , say , Somalia up in a five-star hotel and giving them $ 5,000 wo n't win you the World Cup bid , '' he said .

Blatter and FIFA to blame ?

The problem , he believes , goes even deeper than corrupt payments from a few individuals .

`` It 's not about bin Hammam or even Qatar , '' Corbett said .

`` It is about a system that is rotten to the core and easily manipulated . There 's also serious questions that need to be asked about Blatter .

The Sunday Times has promised to release more revelations in the run-up to the World Cup in Brazil , which starts in less than two weeks .

`` Qatar itself should call for a rerun of the vote , '' Baxter believes .

The end game ?

The latest allegations come after a slew of negative reports surrounding Qatar 's hosting of the 2022 World Cup finals .

Attempts to move the tournament from summer to winter have angered Europe 's powerful and rich soccer leagues .

Allegations of migrant worker abuse under the so-called kafala system of sponsorship , which has been heavily criticized by international human rights groups , have also tainted what had been greeted as a jubilant moment in Qatar 's short history .

`` This is a turning point , '' said Corbett . `` For the first time we have seen hard allegations regarding manipulation of the bid process .
