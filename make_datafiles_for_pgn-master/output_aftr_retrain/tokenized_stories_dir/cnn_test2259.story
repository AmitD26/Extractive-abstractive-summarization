A federal prosecutor on Monday described a Bosnian immigrant accused of plotting to bomb New York 's subway system as an `` al Qaeda terrorist , '' an assertion the defense said was `` just wrong . ''

Prosecutors allege that Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan 's tribal belt with two friends , where he sought to join the Taliban but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission back in America .

`` These men were al Qaeda terrorists , '' Loonam claimed .

Angry at the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq , the three went to Pakistan 's tribal belt -- `` the center of al Qaeda activity against the United States '' -- to join the terrorist group , according to Loonan .

Once there , the federal prosecutor said , the men were given `` special treatment '' and `` private training by al Qaeda '' because of their coveted status as U.S. citizens .

In his opening statement , defense attorney Robert Gottlieb accused the prosecution of using incendiary rhetoric to inflame the jury .

`` The truth is Adis Medunjanin is not a terrorist . ... In this case , the government is just wrong . ''

Later Monday , Ahmedzay took the stand and described how his former high school classmate Medunjanin turned him on to the teaching of radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki . The American-born Muslim cleric was targeted and killed in a September 2011 drone attack in Yemen .

Zazi , who pleaded guilty last year to a plot to detonate explosives in the subway system in September 2009 , is expected to testify Tuesday .
