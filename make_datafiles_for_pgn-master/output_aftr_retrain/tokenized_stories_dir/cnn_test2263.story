Four-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams was taken to the brink by China 's Zheng Jie before earning a place in the last 16 Saturday .

Williams needed two and a half hours on Centre Court to subdue her 25th seeded opponent , who had reached the semifinals at the All England Club four years ago as a wild card .

On the way she had beaten the American superstar and came close to pulling off another upset after taking the first set tiebreak .

But back came Williams to level before a grueling final set in which Zheng showed her typical determination .

Zheng saved two match points before Williams sealed a clash against Yaroslava Shvedova for a place in the last eight .

Errani restored some pride in the second set but still slipped to a 6-0 6-4 defeat .

Defending champion Petra Kvitova continued her serene progress into the second week with a 6-1 6-0 romp against Varvara Lepchenko of the United States .

Second seed Victoria Azarenka of the Belarus also had an easy passage , beating Jana Cepelova of Slovakia 6-2 6-3 .
