Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for `` a lot of stupid things '' Sunday but said he wo n't resign despite reports that police have video that purportedly shows him smoking a crack pipe .

`` I want to move forward , but I also know to move forward I have to make changes in my life , which I can assure you that I will do , '' he added . `` I love the work I do , and I 'm going to keep doing it . ''

Ford co-hosted CFRB 's `` The City '' with his brother Doug , a member of Toronto 's city council . In response to callers , he said his apology referred to two previously reported incidents where he appeared to have been drunk in public and `` a lot of stupid things , all self-inflicted '' that he did n't detail .

He has repeatedly denied using crack and has not been charged with any crime . In May , two media outlets began to report that Ford was recorded on video last winter using crack cocaine . Thursday , Toronto Police Chief William Blair told reporters that investigators had recovered a video from a computer seized during a drug investigation that featured images `` consistent with those that have previously been reported in the press . ''

Blair said Ford appears in the video but would not detail what he 's doing . Ford said Sunday that he has n't seen the video , and he called on Blair `` to release this video for every single person in the city to see . ''

Toronto mayor says he wo n't resign despite possibly damning video

Ford was elected to a four-year term in 2010 and has touted tax cuts and streamlined government under his administration . He told listeners that he wanted to finish his term and let voters decide whether they want to keep him in 2014 .

`` I am not a hater , and we all make mistakes , and none of us are perfect , '' one woman said . `` I just personally believe that maybe you need some time away and come back fresh . '' Another told Ford , `` I want you to take a medical leave . Just a medical leave . The city will survive . You need it ... Please listen to me . Your family deserves better . ''

In May , the website Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper published stories saying their reporters had seen 90 seconds of a cell phone video showing the 44-year-old Ford , as the Star described it , `` inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe . ''

Later in the video -- as described by the Star -- an `` incoherent '' man both the Star and Gawker claimed to be Ford ranted about a number of subjects . The video , which has never been released publicly , shows a `` clearly impaired mayor , '' two reporters who say they saw the video wrote in the Star .

Then , police recovered video from deleted files on a computer hard drive that was seized during a drug and gang investigation , according to a 465-page report by Toronto police disclosed last week . The report includes hundreds of redacted pages and states that police sources believe the photo of Ford that first surfaced in May is taken in front of a `` trap '' house used to `` chop '' crack .

Police documents also detail evidence used to obtain a search warrant for a man suspected of drug trafficking , Alexander -LRB- Sandro -RRB- Lisi , who police say is the mayor 's friend as well as his driver . Photos collected by police show Ford and Lisi together on a number of occasions , including attending a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game , according to the documents .
