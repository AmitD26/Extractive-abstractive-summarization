Sandy Hook Elementary School probably did everything right . Its staff worked every day to create a climate of kindness over bullying . They had lockdown drills that trained everyone to stay low and quiet in the event of an emergency . A security system introduced this year required visitors to ring a bell , sign-in and perhaps produce a photo ID . After 9:30 a.m. , the doors were locked .

And now it 's the home of the one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history . Twenty children dead and eight adults , including the shooter .

It happened after the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colorado , in 1999 , and again after the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech .

Every school should have crisis teams that review their plans regularly , he said , and staff members who greet and challenge every person who comes to the door . They should have locked doors , safety drills and parents who know where to find their kids , just in case the unthinkable happens .

Is there no safe place ?

`` As they 've cut back on the human element , they 've tried to compensate by leaning on and pointing to physical security measures , '' Trump said . `` They love to say ` We have cameras . ' ''

Shootings happen in places `` exactly like this , '' Newman said -- rural areas or exurbs where violence never seems to be a problem . But the typical perpetrator belongs to the school community , someone staff would easily let in .

You ca n't fault Sandy Hook 's administrators and teachers , said Newman , dean of Johns Hopkins University 's school of arts and sciences . They stayed in lockdown and stuck to plans that might have saved kids ' lived . Stories are emerging about teachers who pulled kids to safety and demanded proof that police were really who they said they were .

`` Kids have to know that they can come forward and what they 'll talk about is confidential , but also taken seriously , '' Newman said . `` They are the ones privy to leakage of intentions and rumors . Trapping that information and getting it to the right place is a very important defensive measure . ''

The kids in elementary school today were n't even born when the Columbine shooting took place , she said . How could they know such a thing is possible , that there 's history behind those lockdown drills and buzzer systems ?

After the Columbine shooting , districts renovating and building schools studied what they could do to make them safer , architect Irene Nigaglioni said , and the changes are clear on some campuses .

They put simpler keyless entry systems on doors to make it less tempting to prop them open . They planned elaborate announcement systems that let police address a shooter without speaking to every classroom .

`` Year by year , they 're trying to do what they can with the money they have , '' said Nigaglioni , chairwoman of the board for the Council of Educational Facility Planners International . `` Anything that is going to make it harder to get through a building . ''

But in recent years , schools also came to value natural light and open spaces that allow classes to collaborate . Walls once made of brick are now made of glass . They fold up and disappear , if they 're there at all . It 's better for learning but tougher for security , Nigaglioni said .

If there 's a shooting , an explosion , an illness , it can sometimes be limited to one room or one hallway . At Sandy Hook , students were killed in two classrooms .

But plenty of schools do n't have even those options . John Kuhn is superintendent of the Perrin-Whitt Consolidated Independent School District , a rural district northwest of Fort Worth with just a few hundred students . He spent Friday afternoon celebrating Christmas with his elementary school students , pretending not to know the news .

`` Oh my gosh , '' he thought . `` I have to take care of these kids . ''

His schools will review their crisis plans and drills this week , he said . But there 's no school law enforcement , and because it 's a rural area , any police response could take a while . His middle and high school students circulate between five buildings during the school day , so they ca n't lock doors .

After Columbine , after Virginia Tech , after Sandy Hook , security experts said that will be the hard reality for every school , politician and parent to accept .

`` There is not a single safety measure that anyone could have put in place at that school that would have stopped what happened , '' said Bill Bond , the school safety specialist for the National Association of Secondary School Principals . `` When you allow absolutely insane people to arm themselves like they 're going to war , they go to war . ''

`` In a school , your only real protection is kids trusting you with information , '' Bond said . `` If they do n't trust you with information and someone is planning to do something , it 's a matter of how many will be killed before you kill him . ''

When it comes to shootings , Bond calls himself a cynic . Over the course of 12 seconds in 1997 , one of his students shot and killed three classmates , wounded five more , then put the gun in Bond 's hand .

Bond was principal at Heath High School in West Paducah , Kentucky , then . The shooter was 14 . Michael Carneal was later sentenced to life in prison .

He 's not in Newtown yet , he said , because , well , what could he say to 6 year olds ? What could he say to their parents to make this better ?

The school in Sandy Hook did a lot right , but the shooting happened despite their efforts

@highlight

Children have to feel safe coming forward with information they may have

@highlight

Such violent incidents occur so quickly that a lot of damage is done before police can respond

@highlight

Since the Columbine shooting , many new schools are designed to make attacks more difficult
