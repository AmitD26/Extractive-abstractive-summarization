-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What Syria asserts is Israel 's launch of two air strikes on Damascus last week presents a marked and dangerous escalation of that country 's involvement in the Syrian war .

There is also a fierce geostrategic rivalry unfolding in Syria between Sunni-dominant Saudi Arabia and Shiite Iran , a rivalry invested and fuelled with sectarianism .

Israel 's alleged deepening involvement in the conflict also changes the dynamics of the political struggle in Syria in two ways . It puts the armed opposition on the defensive , because it shows them that they and Israel are indirectly battling the same enemy -- the Assad regime .

And it reinforces President Bashar al-Assad 's dominant narrative : that the struggle in Syria is not internal , that this is not about a domestic coalition striving to replace authoritarianism with democracy -- but rather this is a wider conspiracy spearheaded by Israel and its regional allies and Western powers .

The Syrian official media has already portrayed Israel 's bombings as an attempt to shore up the armed opposition and reverse the balance of power in its favor .

Although the Iranian leadership has repeatedly stated that it would come to the aid of Syria if it is attacked by Israel , it is unlikely that Iran or its partner Hezbollah would retaliate directly against Israel 's possible strikes .

Opinion : Is Obama failing on moral leadership ?

What Iran and Hezbollah would most likely do is deepen their involvement in Syria 's shifting sands . In an emotional speech last week , Hassan Nasrallah , the Hezbollah top leader , stressed that al-Assad 's allies will not allow Syria to fall . Now Hezbollah and Iran would become more determined than ever to prevent the removal of al-Assad from power .

Bluntly put , the recent escalation of hostilities will not only prolong the deadly conflict in Syria , but has now made it an open-ended war by proxy -- one with major potential repercussions for regional and international security and peace .

Israel 's major goal appears to be the establishment of a red line in Syria , whereby no advanced weapons reach Hezbollah -- its archenemy in Lebanon . Israel 's primary audience was Hezbollah and Iran . Israel is taking a calculated gamble that neither Syria nor Hezbollah would risk retaliation .
