Those and other qualities will be put to the test as he embarks on his most historic role yet .

Cardinal Bergoglio elected pope

5 things to know about Pope Francis

In his first public act , the new pope broke with tradition by asking the estimated 150,000 people packed into St. Peter 's Square to pray for him , rather than bless the crowd first .

`` He is a very simple man , '' said Luis R. Zarama , auxiliary bishop of Atlanta . `` It 's very clear from the way he approached the people and asked them to bless him and pray for him . It 's a beautiful sign of closeness and humility . ''

He was ordained by the Jesuits in 1969 and became co-archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1997 , sole archbishop of that city one year later . He was made a cardinal in 2001 and served as president of the Argentine bishops conference from 2005-11 .

As cardinal , Francis clashed with the government of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives .

He was runner-up in the 2005 papal conclave , behind then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , according to a profile by CNN Vatican analyst John Allen published by the National Catholic Reporter .

His career coincided with the so-called Dirty War in Argentina , which lasted from 1976 until 1983 . It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people were killed or disappeared during the country 's military dictatorship .

The church was seen by some as having not have done enough that period . In particular , Francis was accused in a complaint filed three days before the 2005 conclave of complicity in the 1976 kidnapping of two liberal Jesuit priests , Allen writes . Francis reportedly denied the charge .

He is known for his simplicity and has a reputation of being a voice for the poor .

`` We live in the most unequal part of the world , which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least , '' Allen quoted Francis as saying during a gathering of Latin American bishops in 2007 . `` The unjust distribution of goods persists , creating a situation of social sin that cries out to heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers . ''

` The butt kicker that 's needed '

Francis is fan of the San Lorenzo soccer club in Argentina , and a lover of tango , according to Telam , Argentina 's state news agency .

Telam says the new pope has just one lung , but a Vatican spokesman said he was unable to confirm whether that report was true .

About 480 million of the world 's 1.2 billion Catholics live in Latin America , but no one from the region had ever been chosen as pope . By electing who they did , the cardinals sent a strong message about where the future of the church may lie .

`` From the people I 've spoken to here in the Vatican who know him well , they say he is , pardon the French here , the butt kicker that 's needed , '' Arroyo said .
