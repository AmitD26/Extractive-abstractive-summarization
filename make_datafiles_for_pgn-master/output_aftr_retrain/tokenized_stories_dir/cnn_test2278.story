An explosion rocked Kabul on Saturday , hours after the newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel landed in the Afghan capital .

At least nine people were killed and 14 others injured , police said .

Hagel was not injured , and is in a safe International Security Assistance Force location , according to the U.S. military .

He was in a briefing at the time and `` continued as planned without interruption , '' Pentagon spokesman George Little said .

The bomber wearing a suicide vest approached the ministry on a bicycle , also laden with explosives , Kabul police said . He detonated near its gate .

The ISAF commander , Gen Joseph Dunford , disputed that the attack signified any alert by the Taliban to its reach .

`` I 'm not sure that I would accept that the Taliban knew the secretary was here in time to have planned that particular operation , '' he said . `` We 've been extremely successful in preventing threats to Kabul . There has been violence , there are still people out there who want to conduct violence in Kabul , but I do n't think this sends a message that the Taliban can do what they want to do when they want to do it . In fact , I 'm confident they ca n't do that . ''

Journalists assembled at a separate location , Camp Eggers , heard the blast , which also shook the facility . No one was hurt .

Attendees were initially moved to a safer location , but have since been released and are expected to continue with their scheduled plans .

A loud speaker announcement at Camp Eggers informed the attendees : `` We are not directly under attack at this facility . ''

The camp temporarily went into lockdown mode .

Hagel is the first Vietnam veteran to head the defense department . He is in Afghanistan to thank the troops , he said , and `` to better understand where we are in Afghanistan . ''

`` Pine Bluff ? I think I 've got a bar bill there ! '' Hagel said .

On his last visit in summer 2008 , he traveled with then-Senator Barack Obama .

Hagel told reporters that he 's known Afghan President Hamid Karzai for 11 years and he expects to talk with him about many topics , including the recent restrictions on U.S. Special Operations Forces .

`` We 're still at war in Afghanistan , '' he said , although it was never the United States ' intention to stay indefinitely .

Besides not liking his past comments about Israel and Iran , they bristled at his comments over the years about Iraq and Afghanistan , some of which came after the 2008 trip .
