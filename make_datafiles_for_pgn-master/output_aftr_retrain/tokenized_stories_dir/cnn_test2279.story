MOSCOW , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russia 's new president Dmitry Medvedev wasted no time in knuckling down to work -- naming his predecessor Vladimir Putin as his new prime minister two hours after he was sworn in .

Two months after winning the election , Medvedev , 42 , was inaugurated as president Wednesday at the Kremlin before 2,300 invited guests in a ceremony with marching soldiers and military music . He became the third Russian president since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .

Within hours , Medvedev named Putin as prime minister , according to the ITAR-TASS news agency .

Putin 's new role and his position as head of the ruling United Russia Party raise questions about how much power Medvedev will actually have .

`` I fully understand the burden of responsibility that I will be shouldering , '' Medvedev said in his inaugural speech . `` I want to thank from my heart President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin for his invariable personal support that I have always felt , and I am sure that this will continue . ''

Medvedev won the March 2 election with an overwhelming majority but almost no campaign platform , said Oksana Antonenko of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London . Now that Medvedev has taken office , his real work begins , she said .

During his time in office , Putin created a network of loyal officials on every level of government -- all appointed , not elected . If Medvedev is to prove he is more than just a symbol of Putin 's rule , he will have to start rebuilding those institutions , Antonenko said .

`` That 's the only way for him to build a power base , because the middle class will support a rule of law , will support institutions , will support civil society , will support representational government , '' Antonenko said .

The new president will inherit some lingering foreign policy headaches .

`` There 's no sign yet that Medvedev 's angle on the eastward expansion of NATO and the EU is different from Putin . I am sure he is firmly opposed , '' said Charles Grant , an analyst at the Center for European Reform , a London think tank .

`` If Russians have a way to verify and we really operate these bases jointly -- and we have a couple of other alternatives -- then we will all be OK and Mr. Medvedev , I think , will be perfectly happy with this arrangement , '' said analyst Igor Yurgens .

Medvedev says he is committed to promoting democracy , fighting corruption , and bolstering the rule of law . But Kremlin critics point out Putin made similar promises when he ran , only to be criticized at home and abroad for cracking down on opposition groups .

`` He was always very intellectual , and in general he is from what we called the intelligentsia , '' said Marina Lavrikova , a former Medvedev classmate and colleague at the St. Petersburg School of Law . `` He was always goal-oriented , professional , and with very good organizational skills . ''

Medvedev also differs from Putin in his music tastes : He is a devout fan of '70s rock band Deep Purple , a far cry from the patriotic ballads Putin is said to enjoy .

`` We literally have to avert war , because we see what is happening on the ground and we have all indications that Russia is trying to provoke Georgia to start war , '' Temuri Yakobashvili , Georgia 's state minister of reintegration , told a news conference in Brussels .
