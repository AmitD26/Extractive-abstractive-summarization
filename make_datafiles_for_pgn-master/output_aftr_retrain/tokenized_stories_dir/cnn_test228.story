Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While the Senate passed legislation barring workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity with a significant bipartisan vote on Thursday , the bill faces major hurdles to even start moving through the GOP-led House , and there 's almost no chance it will come up for a vote this year .

House Speaker John Boehner opposes the Employment Non Discrimination Act , known as ENDA , and believes protections for employees already exist under other laws .

`` I hope -LRB- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -RRB- soon addresses the dozens of House-passed bills that have been ignored in the Senate that create jobs , improve education and create opportunity while Americans struggle to find a good-paying job . ''

But Rep. Richard Hanna of New York , one of the five GOP co-sponsors of the House version ENDA , pointed to his party 's loss in the Virginia governor 's race on Tuesday as a reason why the House needs to consider the measure .

`` Certainly what we see in Virginia is a difficulty with women and minorities and that 's something the party needs to reconcile and look broadly and think about , '' Hanna told CNN on Thursday .

Sutter : It 's ` way past time ' for gay rights law

The Republican National Committee found after last year 's loss in the presidential election that younger Americans , who voted disproportionately for Barack Obama , weigh their support for a political party based on its tolerance and inclusiveness , including on the issue of gay rights .

Advocates of ENDA also point to national polls that show a majority of Republicans now support legislation protects gays and lesbians from job discrimination . On Thursday 10 GOP senators joined with Senate Democrats to pass the measure .

Several senior House Republican congressional aides acknowledge the political climate has shifted some since the House last considered ENDA in 2007 , but they also believe most House GOP members would oppose it now .

They say members are n't hearing much about it from their constituents , so there 's little pressure to vote on it this year .

Pennsylvania Rep. Charlie Dent , a five-term Republican whose district has been targeted regularly by Democrats , is another Republican who is pushing for a House vote .

`` I do believe that we have to learn some lessons from the 2012 election , and to me this is one of them . This legislation , ENDA , is one way to reach out to the LGBT community in a way that is fair and reasonable and speaks to our shared values . I think we all agree we should not tolerate this type of discrimination in any form , '' Dent said .

Dent also said passing the measure `` would be an upside to the party , particularly with young voters . ''

Little pressure on House GOP

Even gay rights advocates who sought to pressure GOP Senators are n't sugar coating prospects in the House .

`` It 's an uphill climb . It 's Mount Kilimanjaro , '' Fred Sainz , vice president of communications at the Human Rights Campaign , told CNN .

The House Education and the Workforce Committee , which has jurisdiction over the issue , has yet to announce a hearing on the bill , and does n't plan any action on ENDA at this point , according to a spokeswoman for the panel .

Obamacare still a focus

But GOP aides believe that highlighting problems with the online rollout of Obamacare and focusing on economic issues should remain their top priorities , and say there is little pressure from GOP rank and file to move ENDA , because they largely oppose the bill .

But of that group only a dozen still serve in the House .

Among those who supported that measure was 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan , R-Wisconsin .

But that version of ENDA was drafted more narrowly and Ryan 's spokesman says the Congressman is opposed to the Senate bill at this point .

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner 's move to avoid a vote is part of a pattern , criticizing his decision to spend money backing a court challenge to uphold a ban on same-sex marriage , which the Supreme Court overruled .

Fighting a losing battle in the House

He said ENDA should fit into the House Republican 's economic agenda since it promotes employees keeping their jobs .

Supporters are also looking for other ways to get it to the House floor .

One option is attaching the measure to next year 's defense authorization bill in the Senate and sending that to the House .

By tucking the measure into a must-pass bill that House Republicans support , any effort to oppose ENDA would mean adopting an amendment to strip it out . Advocates believe they could muster the votes to block that .

But he notes this session of Congress does n't wrap up until the end of 2014 so `` they 'll be time over the next 14 to 15 months to make progress in the House . ''

`` There are gay people in every single member of Congress ' district who we will mobilize , '' he said .
