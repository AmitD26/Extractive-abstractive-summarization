A love of horses and thoroughbred racing is ingrained in the House of the Windsor , and Prince George 's great grandmother Queen Elizabeth II is a leading owner with a string of top horses .

`` She adores breeding racehorses , '' her racing manager John Warren told CNN .

`` The British bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the queen . ''

Fittingly , the 87-year-old 's most notable achievement is winning the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot with Estimate , a four-year-old filly guided by 10-time British champion trainer Michael Stoute .

Ridden by Ryan Moore , Estimate stormed to victory in the prestigious Group One race in June , the first time in its 207-year history that the British monarch had owned the winner .

It added to her earlier triumphs in the English Classics , the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas , The Oaks and St. Leger .

`` She has inherited her father King George VI 's love of the turf , '' said Nick Attenborough , spokesman for Great British Racing .

She died in 2002 at the age of 101 , but during her lifetime had 449 winners in her royal colors .

A top race at the Cheltenham Festival , the Queen Mother Champion Chase , is named in her honor .

She was cruelly denied success in the 1956 edition when her horse Devon Loch , ridden by Dick Francis , led on the run-in at Aintree before falling to the turf unexpectedly .

` She strives to have winners '

Her great great grand daughter would surely never be guilty of such unseemly behavior , but as Estimate stormed clear in the final furlong at Royal Ascot she could be seen with the broadest of smiles and maybe a hint of a tear .

`` It 's a special thrill to win this race for the Queen and it will have given her enormous pleasure , '' Stoute said at the time . `` She really loves this game and it 's a great recreation for her .

Her grandson Peter Phillips put it more succinctly . `` This is her passion and her life and she 's here every year and she strives to have winners , '' he was quoted as saying .

That passion extends to a day-to-day involvement with her bloodstock and training operation .

`` She names all her own horses , I believe -- it gives her fantastic pleasure , planning the whole process , '' Attenborough said .

It is a formidable operation with Royal studs at Sandringham and Wolferton in Norfolk and Polhampton in Berkshire , feeding into her training operation with about 25 horses racing each season .

One of the stallions at Sandringham is former Derby winner Motivator , with the queen part of a syndicate using the horse for breeding .

She will doubtless be hoping that one of his offspring can deliver her success at Epsom after the heartbreak of Carlton House 's unlucky near miss two years ago .

For the current British head of state it would represent a monumental achievement to emulate this feat , but it is not for lack of knowledge or trying .

`` She is a very well-informed and keen owner , probably the best-informed owner in the country , '' said leading trainer Andrew Balding , who has looked after a number of the queen 's horses , and knows he has to keep them in peak condition .

While Queen Elizabeth will not hand over the reins of her racing operation anytime soon , Attenborough is confident that she will find a suitable successor .

`` They are a family that understands traditional values and understand the value of succession , '' he said .

`` It can be traced back to Queen Anne 's day . ''

The Queen Anne Stakes , a Group One race that takes place every year at Royal Ascot , is named after the monarch who was so influential in the history of thoroughbred racing .

Attenborough , and the whole of the UK racing industry in the UK , are hoping that the latest edition to the Royal family -- Prince George of Cambridge -- will be just as keen .

They sent a special gift of a teddy bear , dressed in the queen 's racing silks , to the maternity wing of the London hospital where he was born in July .

For now , Attenborough is delighted to have the queen as a figurehead to their sport , particularly as it is now competing for audiences with counter attractions such as the English Premier League and team sports like rugby and cricket .

Attenborough believes the royal connections , with long standing owner breeders like the Aga Khan and the queen now competing against relative new entrants such as Sheikh Mohammed , can only serve to maintain interest in sport of the turf in the 21st century .

`` Their involvement is a fantastic boost for British and European racing , '' he said .
