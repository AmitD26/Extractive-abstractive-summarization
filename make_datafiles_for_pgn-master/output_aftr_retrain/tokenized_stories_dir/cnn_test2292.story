-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Huddled in the hallway of his Alabama home with three of his friends , Tillman Merritt had a gut feeling to jump into a closet as the massive twister barreled into the Tuscaloosa neighborhood .

Moments later , he was the only one to survive .

`` I just heard a voice in my head saying ` go to the closet , go to the closet , '' Merritt said .

The closet walls pushed down on him as a roar surrounded him , followed by the sounds of pieces of the house snapping off . Then the crack of glass was heard , and insulation was flying everywhere .

When it was over , there was just a small hole for Merritt to crawl out of . Except for the closet he was in , the entire house -- and his three friends -- had been flung across the street .

As emergency responders continued to tally the dead on Saturday , stories began to emerge that illustrated the scope of what has become the second-deadliest , single-day tornado outbreak in U.S. history .

Among those deaths is Morgan Sigler , a senior graphic design major from Bryant , Alabama , who was killed when the storm struck Merritt 's house .

She suffered internal injuries and died during surgery , her mother said . The Siglers ' story is one of dozens of similar tales of tragedy in the South .

`` She just lit up our world , she was our baby , '' Vega Sigler said .

Kirk was close friends with Morgan Sigler and knew the two other victims , Scott Atterton and Blake Peak .

Atterton was known for having a kind heart , and was not the kind of person satisfied with a handshake .

He would tell Kirk , `` bring it in for the real thing , '' and give him a hug .

Peak was Morgan Sigler 's boyfriend . He made her really happy , Kirk said .

According to the Alabama Emergency Management Agency , at least 45 people people died during the storms in Tuscaloosa County , more than in any of the other five southern states that recorded deaths from Wednesday 's violent weather .

By early Saturday morning , emergency management officials tallied 249 deaths in Alabama , 34 in Tennessee , 33 in Mississippi , 15 in Georgia , five in Virginia and one in Arkansas .

`` The trees are completely stripped of all of their branches , '' Shamsuzzoha told CNN Saturday morning . `` The ones that are standing just look like sticks rising from the ground . ''

When President Barack Obama visited the city Friday , his motorcade passed street after street of homes reduced to splinters , crushed and flipped cars , and debris strewn all around .

`` I 've got to say I 've never seen devastation like this , '' Obama told reporters .

The storms also wreaked between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion in insured losses across the region , according to the catastrophe modeling firm , Eqecat .

The weather service has so far recorded 11 tornadoes with EF-3 ratings or higher that struck central and north Alabama on Wednesday . Some of the twisters were three-quarters of a mile wide and traveled dozens of miles , experts said .

`` When you put that together , you 're going to see large loss of life and massive devastation , '' Scotten said .

An EF-4 touched down in Hackleburg , killing 29 people in the town of nearly 1,600 residents .

`` It 's pretty much wiped out , '' said Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams . `` It looks like a war zone . ''

Those who survived the disaster thanked God or simple luck .
