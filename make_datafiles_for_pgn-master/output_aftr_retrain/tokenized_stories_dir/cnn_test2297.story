-LRB- CNN -RRB- When you think of the `` Fantastic Four , '' you likely do n't think of grim , dark imagery .

But if a trailer unleashed Tuesday is any indication , Marvel 's first family of superheroes are being rebooted into exactly that .

And the trailer is decidedly darker than the two previous breezy , joke-filled movies -- and many of the Marvel Comics as well .

Fans who have been concerned about the new direction of the `` Four , '' had a lot to say on social media , not all of it good .

`` Taking a light/fun comic and making it dark/serious/grim . ''

`` Feels like a re-cut ` what if fantastic 4 was shot like interstellar ' blog post , '' remarked io9.com 's Meredith Woerner .
