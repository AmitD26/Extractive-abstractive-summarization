If beauty is indeed truth , as John Keats claimed , then this story ought to be true : The logo on the back of your iPhone or Mac is a tribute to Alan Turing , the man who laid the foundations for the modern-day computer , pioneered research into artificial intelligence and unlocked German wartime codes .

And so , the story goes , when two Stanford entrepreneurs were looking for a logo for their brand new computer company , they remembered Turing and his contribution to their field . They chose an apple -- not a complete apple , but one with a bite taken out of it .

Sadly , the evidence now points in a more prosaic direction . In a 2009 interview with CreativeBits , Rob Janoff , the man who drew the logo , reflected on the theories about his work . He dismisses Sir Isaac or the Bible as source material and , while he says he is charmed by the links with the Turing story , he says he was unaware of them at the time .

Janoff says that he received no specific brief from Steve Jobs , and although he 's hazy about how he settled on the simple outline of an apple , the reason for the bite is crystal clear : it 's there for scale , he says , so that a small Apple logo still looks like an apple and not a cherry .

It was n't long before Janoff discovered the first happy coincidence of his design , when a colleague told him that `` bytes '' were the foundation stones of computing . The more romantic myth-making would follow soon behind .

I was disappointed when the Turing story was first cast into doubt , but grew to enjoy the uncertainty . Limbo seemed a fitting , even poetic state , for the tale of a man who lived in the shadows . Even his tribute was now floating between life and death , like Snow White after she swallowed her own mythical apple .

I hope that a similar respect for beauty over cold , hard fact lay behind Steve Jobs ' silence on the matter . He could have dismissed the creation myths inspired by his company , but he chose not to . More than most , he appreciated the value of a beautiful story .
