But ask students in the city today of the significance of the date , and you get mixed responses .

`` I think it was a very important occasion for Lebanon , '' says Noor El-Hoss , a student in West Beirut 's Al Iman School . `` But I do n't know what happened . ''

More than two decades after the end of the country 's civil war , generations of young Lebanese are growing up with little formal education about the conflict .

Home to contesting political groups representing 18 religious communities , Lebanese society contains many deep divisions , and the country 's recent past is widely considered too contentious to examine in depth . To avoid inflaming old hostilities , Lebanese history textbooks stop in 1943 , the year the country gained independence .

The country 's Minister of Education , Hassan Diab , acknowledges it 's all about politics .

`` After more than 20 years ... the teaching of history in Lebanon remains , as it has always been , subject to the interests of various political groups , '' said Diab .

Others caution that failing to teach younger generations a balanced view of their history could reinforce sectarian divisions .

Yahya said that the absence of a comprehensive , authoritative history of the war left events of the period `` open for interpretation . ''

`` The children turn to their families and to their communities to learn very particular perspectives of this contemporary history , '' she said .

`` I think this is in part playing a big role in the kind of sectarian division we 're seeing today . ''

Dr. Reina Sarkis , a psychoanalyst and history researcher , agreed . `` They only have the oral history that their parents told them , '' she said . `` You grow up with deep divisions that become even deeper with time . There 's no sense of closure , there 's no coming to terms with your past . ''

`` This is the repetition ... that you get stuck in when you do n't do your homework , '' she said.Follow the Inside the Middle East team on Twitter : Presenter Rima Maktabi : @rimamaktabi , producer Jon Jensen : @jonjensen , and producer Schams Elwazer @SchamsCNN .
