According to local media reports , the man was identified as a British security consultant from the UK-based private security firm G4S contracted by the oil services company Schlumberger at Iraq 's Rumeilah oil field , the country 's largest .

The man reportedly tore down flags with the images of two of Shiite Islam 's most revered imams -- Imam Ali and Imam Hussein -- that Iraqi staff had placed on a company car on Monday .

The security contractor appeared to be wearing a G4S T-shirt in the video .

Neither G4S nor Schlumberger has responded to CNN 's requests for comment on the incident .

Among the attackers were Iraqi guards from the Canada-based security company Garda World , which has an office in the United States .

`` Garda World employees were not involved in the initial incident , '' Joe Gavaghan , a company spokesman , told CNN on Wednesday . `` But during subsequent disturbance a small number of local national employees took part . ''

`` We take this issue seriously and are well aware of cultural sensitivities ... We do not tolerate inappropriate behavior , '' he said .

A number of Iraqi men , including Garda World guards , are seen later in the video trying to stop the assault by the mob that at times chanted Shiite slogans .

The British Foreign Office told CNN on Wednesday they were aware of `` an incident '' and `` are providing consular assistance . ''

According to a statement by the Basra local government , Gov. Majed al-Nasrawi met with senior local security and oil officials on Tuesday about the incident .

While rejecting what they described as `` violations , '' local officials called on all parties to `` resort to logic and wisdom and allow the security forces and the judiciary to take their natural course in this case , '' the statement said .

For decades under Saddam Hussein and his Sunni Arab dominated regime , the Shiite majority in Iraq were banned from practicing their religious rituals .

CNN 's Ashleigh Cowie in London and Salma Abdelaziz in Atlanta contributed to this report .
