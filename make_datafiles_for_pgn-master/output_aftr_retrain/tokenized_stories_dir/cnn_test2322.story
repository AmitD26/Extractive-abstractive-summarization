-LRB- CNN -RRB- Why stop now ? This must be the question Vladimir Putin is asking himself as he considers the latest European pleas for peace in Ukraine , to be discussed at a crisis summit in Minsk on Wednesday .

Since invading and annexing Crimea almost one year ago , the Russian president has been running rings around the European Union , NATO and the Obama administration .

So as he considers his response to Europe 's ideas for a new cease-fire and a `` comprehensive settlement '' in eastern Ukraine , what will Putin be thinking ? What does he know ?

Francois Hollande , France 's weak and unpopular president , seems to be waving a white flag before hostilities have even commenced .

For its part , the British government splutters impotently on the sidelines . As usual , it is waiting for Washington to tell it what to do . But with a difficult national election due in May , Prime Minister David Cameron figures there are no votes in Ukraine .

But these countries know there is little point relying on help from Brussels , home of the EU 's bureaucracy . Limited economic and financial sanctions on Russia will expire this summer unless all 28 EU governments agree to extend them .

Greece , maneuvering for debt relief , is flirting treacherously with Moscow . Recession-hit economies such as Italy seem to believe business as normal with Russia trumps calls for solidarity over Ukraine .

All of which leaves Germany , the EU 's paymaster , largest economy , and Russia 's biggest European trade partner . Angela Merkel , German chancellor , has taken the lead since the Ukraine crisis erupted . Somebody had to . And she has been widely praised for her role .

The main `` new '' idea on the table seems to be a demilitarized zone embracing September 's cease-fire positions and the current front line . If implemented , it would require the Kiev government to concede control of yet more territory . By freezing the conflict in place , it would increase the chances of a permanent eastern secession .

`` I can not imagine any situation in which improved equipment for the Ukrainian army leads to President Putin being so impressed that he believes he will lose militarily , '' she said .

This seems to be the broad European view . Arming the Ukrainians would mean war with Russia , a war that Putin would win . And it is plain the Europeans will do just about anything to avoid that dread outcome .

But what else does Putin know as he ponders Merkel 's plan to halt the hostilities ?

Putin knows that NATO 's leading power , the United States , did not react militarily when Russia sent its tanks into Georgia in 2008 and subsequently encouraged breakaway separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia to declare independence from Tbilisi .

Putin knows NATO was similarly passive when he took over Crimea by stealth one year ago this month . While Ukraine is not in NATO , this startling violation of international law raised a bigger , potentially embarrassing question : what would NATO do if one of its member states was next ?

NATO answers that in such circumstances it would invoke Article 5 of its founding treaty , which states : `` The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all . ''

But this valiant concept of collective defense has never really been tested . Article 5 has only been invoked once , after the 9/11 attacks . And al Qaeda , luckily , did not have thermonuclear weapons .

Would the U.S. really go to war with Russia to rescue , say , Estonia or Norway ? Putin does not know the answer to this question , but neither , if they are truthful , do NATO 's political masters .

Pressure is growing from John McCain and others in Congress , egged on by jittery east Europeans , to supply arms to Kiev . Last week the administration deliberately leaked news that it was discussing this option to the New York Times . It was a classic pressure tactic .

But so far , the only people who feel scared and pressured are the European allies . Putin has not blinked , while Kremlin spokesmen and propagandists say supplying U.S. arms would confirm their view that Russia is under attack by the West .
