British aid worker David Haines has been executed by ISIS militants , according to a video posted Saturday to a website associated with the group , making him the third Western captive to be killed by the Islamist extremist group in recent weeks .

The ISIS video post showing Haines ' beheading called his execution `` a message to the allies of America . ''

It is produced very similarly to the videos that showed the executions of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff , the last of which included Haines and the threat that he 'd be killed next .

The new video pictures a masked ISIS militant placing his hand on another captive , whom he identified as Alan Henning , a British citizen .

In a tweet , British Prime Minister David Cameron called `` the murder of David Haines '' an `` act of pure evil . ''

Directing his remarks at Britain , the executioner -- who sounds like the man who killed Foley and Sotloff -- says , `` Your evil alliance with America , which continues to strike the Muslims of Iraq and most recently bombed the Haditha dam , will only accelerate your destruction and claim the role of the obedient lap dog .

`` Cameron will only drag you and your people into another bloody and unwinnable war . ''

British officials said after the video 's release that they had sent troops to try to rescue an unidentified British citizen `` some time ago , '' but failed . They released no other details .

`` During this time , David began to decide that humanitarian work was the field he wanted to work in , '' Mike Haines said . '' ... David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles . ''

After working for ScotRail , David Haines went on to get a job as a logistics and security manager for the Paris-based humanitarian Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development .

Another hostage has been publicly killed by ISIS . Another one 's life has been threatened . And fighters for ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State , in a nod to its efforts to establish a vast caliphate in the Middle East under its strict version of Sharia law -- are continuing to kill innocent civilians in Iraq and Syria .

The threat from ISIS has been brewing for some time . Having begun a decade ago as al Qaeda in Iraq -- only to be disowned earlier this year by al Qaeda , the group behind the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , for its heavy-handed tactics -- ISIS has taken advantage of instability in Syria and Iraq to become one of the most prominent and feared groups in the Middle East .

ISIS , which is also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant or ISIL , managed to become one of the most successful rebel groups working to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . It also rampaged through much of Iraq , thwarting seemingly overmatched Iraqi troops and massacring those who did not subscribe to its extreme version of Islam .

It was n't until last month -- albeit before Foley 's killing -- that the American military jumped into the fray .

`` It 's a bit like trying to predict an earthquake : You can see pressure building up on the fault lines but not knowing when it 's going to materialize -LRB- or how -RRB- quickly it can disintegrate , '' Rep. Adam Schiff , a California Democrat , said Saturday night . `` Those things are very hard to predict . ''

Partnering with the Iraqi military and Kurdish fighters , U.S. warplanes have been striking ISIS targets in Iraq regularly since August 8 .

Earlier this week , President Barack Obama announced that U.S. airstrikes would go after the extremist group in Syria , and perhaps beyond .

The President vowed the United States wo n't do it alone . To this end , U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Egypt on Saturday seeking that country 's help in the fight against ISIS .

Britain is one country , at least , that has stepped up -- even before Haines ' killing .

That includes providing `` urgent military support '' at the Iraqi government 's request , including heavy machine guns , body armor and nearly half a million rounds of ammunition to Kurdish fighters known as the Peshmerga .

To this end , 10 Downing Street announced early Sunday that Cameron will convene an emergency meeting of his top security officials to discuss what Britain will do next .

Obama released a statement late Saturday after what he called Haines ' `` barbaric murder , '' offering his support for the aid worker 's family and his native Britain .

`` The United States stands shoulder-to-shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve , '' the President said .

`` We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice , and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries , the region and the world . ''
