-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eighteen-year-old Kaitlyn Hunt , charged with a crime for having sex with a 14-year-old girl , rejected a deal Friday that would have required her to plead guilty to child abuse , according to Hunt 's attorney .

The plea deal from the Indian River County prosecutor 's office would have required Hunt to plead no contest to child abuse , spend two years `` on community control , '' which usually involves strict supervision , followed by one year of probation .

`` Our client is a model citizen . She has been placed in an environment of school with her classmates where they go to school together , have lunch together , and play on the same team and are allowed to have communication and contact without barriers . Then when something develops between the two as a result of this environment created by the state , it leads to criminal prosecution . ''

`` If this incident occurred 108 days earlier when she was 17 , we would n't even be here , '' the attorney wrote .

The parents of the young girl Friday evening said they are prepared to go forward with the case .

His daughter 's innocence was taken away , Jim Smith told CNN affiliate WPEC . `` There deserves some type of punishment for that . ''

The office of State Attorney Bruce Colton said it tendered an `` extremely lenient plea offer in this case which would have ensured that the defendant avoided any term of incarceration and the stigma of being labeled a sex offender .

`` I 'm scared of losing my life , the rest of my life , '' she said , `` not being able to go to college or be around kids , be around my sisters and my family . ''

In response , Charles Sullivan Jr. , the attorney for the 14-year-old girl 's family , said they had been hoping the case would be resolved by now .

Now the 14-year-old girl may have to take the witness stand if the case goes to court , Sullivan said .

The victim 's family said that is n't true ; they are only trying to protect their 14-year-old .

The American Civil Liberties Union has spoken out in defense of Hunt and an online petition by Change.org had attracted some 279,000 signatures by Friday evening . They say the punishment does not equal the crime .

`` Prosecutors get these kinds of cases all the time , and it 's almost always parents who come to them saying that something like this has happened , '' said LaBahn , who worked as a trial attorney in California for 10 years and focused on prosecuting sex crimes for four years .

The amount of difference between the alleged perpetrator 's age and the victim 's age weighs heavily in whether a prosecutor moves forward on a case , he said .

`` If the 17-year-old says it was consensual , that would probably be the end of it and you would n't have charges . ''

But in this case , 18 and 14 is a wide gap , he said . `` According to law in Florida , this is a crime . ''

It does n't matter -- and should n't matter -- what people in an online community who do n't have the investigative details of a case believe , he said .

`` As a prosecutor you can not be influenced by anything other than the facts , '' he said .

While some have suggested this case is being handled differently because it involves two females , Indian River County Sheriff Deryl Loar said that has nothing to do with it .

`` If this was an 18-year-old male and that was a 14-year-old girl , it would have been prosecuted the same way , '' he said .

Parents of girl , 14 , say they are protecting her

At trial , the prosecutor is likely to try to put on witnesses who can show that the 14-year-old was damaged psychologically by engaging in sex at such a young age , and that she would n't have normally done such a thing .

In an earlier interview with CNN affiliate WPEC , Jim and Laurie Smith insisted that the girls ' gender has nothing to do with the case . They are concerned about ages .

`` Our daughter was 14 , and this girl was 18 , '' said Jim Smith .

According to the Smiths , they twice warned Hunt to stop .

`` I had another adult , who is a mother , she came to me and said , ` Ms. Smith , you need to know this . ' She said , ` We told Ms. Hunt to leave your daughter alone but they are in a relationship . And , she 's 18 . ' ''

Laurie Smith said she was shocked . Her daughter was just too young , she thought .

Then one weekend morning the Smiths went to their daughter 's bedroom and discovered she was missing .

But they later learned that Hunt had picked their daughter up , they told WPEC .

`` We had no other alternative but to turn to the law , use it basically as a last resort , '' Jim Smith said .

`` This whole story about you blaming Kate for making your daughter gay ... where did that come from ? '' a reporter asked the parents .

Still , Hunt 's supporters say she is being prosecuted because she was in a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex . A Facebook support page the Hunt family set up called `` Free Kate '' has gathered more than 47,000 names .

LaBahn told CNN that a felony child abuse conviction would mean that Hunt would have to disclose her felony conviction on employment applications and she could never serve on a jury . She would be prohibited from voting for a period of time , though each state has different time frames for that rule , the attorney said . She may not be able to secure student loans either , he said , and she might not be allowed to adopt or obtain a childcare license .
