-LRB- CNN -RRB- On October 24 , 1944 , U.S. warplanes swarmed at the Leviathan of battleships , Japan 's Musashi , splashing down torpedoes or dive bombing it .

And that 's a breakthrough .

`` I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true , '' Todaka said .

But the wreckage matched the ship 's description , and it had a mount for the Imperial Japanese Navy seal , a chrysanthemum which was made out of teak and rotted away in the ship 's 70 years in the sea .

The live tour began with one of the Musashi 's many death blows -- a warped bow . `` What we see here is torpedo damage , '' said Robert Kraft , the expedition 's leader .

Torpedoes usually punctured the hull and exploded inside the ship , belling the metal outward .

The remote operated vehicle puttered past more fatal damage , as Kraft and his team described it . A big dent pushing inward , he explained , was likely from a torpedo that barely missed the ship , exploding outside the hull , pushing it in . `` It 's the concussive force next to the ship , '' he said .

The submersible showed multiple hits right under the Musashi 's main gun , perhaps the most powerful naval cannon at that time . It weighed 270 tons , and gunners had to duck into a blast shelter before firing it to keep from getting killed .

While in the Musashi 's death throes , the gun discharged one time before everyone took cover and blew sailors off the ship 's deck , Allen 's researchers said .

It was one of three such guns followed by rows of other guns . The Musashi was the most heavily armed ship of its time , the researchers said .

But the giant had an Achilles heel . It was very vulnerable to torpedoes . The ship caught fire ; it lost most of its propeller power and began to flail . U.S. warplanes went in for the kill .

Could the small chain have been a necklace ? Pocket watch chain ?

Those wanting to answer those questions themselves will find the recording of the tour archived on Allen 's website .

To finally arrive at the wreck , Kraft 's team scoured historical records from four countries and undersea topographical data before sending down detection devices , such as the Bluefins that have searched for missing airliner Malaysia Airlines flight 370 .

CNN 's Euan McKirdy , Jethro Mullen , Yoko Wakatsuki and Brad Lendon contributed to this report .
