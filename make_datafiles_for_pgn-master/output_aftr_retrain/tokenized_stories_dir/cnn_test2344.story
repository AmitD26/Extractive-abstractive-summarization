â€¢ Transponder data shows that the autopilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 was reprogrammed by someone in the cockpit to change the plane 's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet , according to Flightradar24 , a website that tracks aviation data .

The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 purposely crashed the plane into the French Alps , killing all 150 people on board , officials said Thursday .

`` We at Lufthansa are speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot , '' said Carsten Spohr , CEO of Lufthansa , which owns Germanwings .

It 's unknown whether Lubitz planned his actions , Robin said . But he `` took advantage '' of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit and `` activated the descent , '' which can only be done deliberately .

Transponder data shows that the autopilot was reprogrammed during the flight by someone inside the cockpit to change the plane 's altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet , according to Flightradar24 , a website that tracks aviation data .

The plane 's cockpit audio recorder captured horrific sounds . The captain , somehow locked out of the cockpit , can be heard banging on the door , Robin said .

And screaming can be heard on the audio recording for the final few minutes of the flight .

Who was co-pilot Andreas Lubitz ?

A search is underway for the plane 's second `` black box , '' the flight data recorder , which could shed more light on the plane 's final minutes .

Investigators so far say they 're baffled about why Lubitz would have crashed the plane

Lufthansa does `` not have any clues , '' Spohr said .

The picture of the plane 's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder .

The pilot and co-pilot had normal exchanges during the beginning of the flight , Robin said . When the pilot stepped out to go to the bathroom , he asked Lubitz to take over .

It 's unclear whether the pilot entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit when he returned , or whether Lubitz `` put the lever on lock , '' which would have prevented the code from working , Spohr said .

The most plausible explanation of what happened next is that Lubitz , `` through deliberate abstention , refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot , and used the button '' to cause the plane to lose altitude , Robin said .

Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list , and his religion was not immediately known , Robin said .

He had been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time , the company said . Lubitz had trained at the Lufthansa flight center in Bremen , Germany .

He only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying , but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone , the prosecutor said .

He had passed medical tests , Spohr said . The audio recording showed his breathing to be steady , with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue .

Lufthansa does not have standard psychological testing for pilots once they are hired , Spohr said . The company considers an applicant 's psychological state when hiring , he said .

The co-pilot was `` fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own , '' Robin said .

A man in Montabaur , Germany , who belonged to the same flight club as Lubitz , said he could n't believe it . `` The way I know Andreas , this is inconceivable , '' Peter Ruecker said .

Most are not expected to stay overnight , he said . But in case they do , he said , local residents have offered accommodations for them .

Lufthansa is providing `` financial support '' to relatives of the victims , Spohr said . He declined to go into details .

The bodies of the crash victims will not be released to family members until all DNA identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks , he said .

Germanwings said the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for about eight minutes .
