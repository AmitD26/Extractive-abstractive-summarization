Sanaa , Yemen -LRB- CNN -RRB- A coalition of Middle Eastern forces continued pounding rebel targets in Yemen from the air on Friday , the second day of a campaign aimed at the Houthi group .

While it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction , the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around Sanaa on Friday night suggested that the Saudi-led strikes were taking a toll .

The strikes ' target is Houthi rebels , a Shiite Muslim minority group that has taken over the capital and , on Wednesday , captured key parts of the Yemeni port city of Aden . Aden was where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had moved because of the rebel advance .

Hadi has also ordered the closure of all Houthi-controlled media -- including Yemen TV and Saba TV .

The Houthis , though , responded by raiding two TV channels and the prominent Al Masdar newspaper .

Al Jazeera 's office in Sanaa was also targeted , with Houthis looting security cameras and damaging equipment , the Qatar-based network said .

The Houthis are allied with majority Shiite Iran .

`` What they do not want is an Iranian-run state on their southern border , '' CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona said of the Saudis .

The kingdom says Hadi , who is out of the country , pleaded for military intervention in a letter .

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the United States commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , a senior State Department official said .

The other nations participating in the military action are the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Bahrain , Qatar , Jordan , Morocco , Sudan and Egypt , a Saudi adviser has said .

Saudi Arabia and Egypt have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops .

Saudi Arabia has blockaded the Houthis , effectively cutting off their supply lines . By Thursday afternoon , the Saudis controlled Yemeni airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter Yemeni ports .

Iran denounced the military intervention . Marzieh Afkham , a spokeswoman for the country 's Foreign Ministry , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to Yemen 's months-long internal strife . It also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like ISIS and al Qaeda , she said .

`` This is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , '' Afkham said , according to a report in Iran 's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency .

At least one major player in Yemen besides the Houthis -- the General People 's Congress , which is the party of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh -- thinks the Saudis and their partners should stay out .

Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen , and CNN 's Greg Botelho and Ben Brumfield wrote this story from Atlanta . CNN 's Samira Said , Becky Anderson , Nick Paton Walsh , Anas Hamdan , Salma Abdelaziz and Mustafa al-Arab contributed to this report .
