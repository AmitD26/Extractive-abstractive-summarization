Michelle Wilkins thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes on March 18 in Longmont .

While the attack on Wilkins has shocked her community for its brutality , many have also remarked on the 26-year-old 's strength .

Bleeding and stunned in a stranger 's basement , Wilkins managed to lock herself in a room to prevent any further violence , called 911 and did what she could to stem the bleeding .

`` She was covered from head to toe in blood , '' Sawyer said .

Piotrowski told the station that Wilkins `` saved her own life , '' describing her as '' probably one of the strongest people I 've ever had the pleasure to meet . ''

Wilkins is now out of the hospital , according to a family statement posted on their GoFundMe page , and she 's `` in a safe location '' and `` surrounded by family and friends . ''
