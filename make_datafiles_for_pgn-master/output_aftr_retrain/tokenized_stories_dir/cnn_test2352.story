A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped , the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban , which are both allied to al Qaeda , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein . According to the official , nothing came of those feelers .

The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers , who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held , went door-to-door looking for the American . Nothing came of this search either .

On Thursday , the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a `` counterterrorism operation '' in January , which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes .

According to New America , which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan , CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal , North Waziristan , on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed ; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha , South Waziristan , in which at least five militants were killed ; and on January 4 in Datta Khel , South Waziristan , in which at least eight militants were killed .

Lt. Col. Jason Amerine , a planner on the U.S. Army staff , is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter 's office , which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban . A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein , according to a staff member on Hunter 's committee .

Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure .

As an Army captain , Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States . The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan .

Who exactly carried out Weinstein 's kidnapping from his house 3 1/2 years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear .

According to the Pakistani official , the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev , the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009 .

At the scene of Taseer 's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore , according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official .

The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping .

There Weinstein was given or , more likely , sold to al Qaeda , according to the senior Pakistani official .

Who was Warren Weinstein ?

Weinstein had spent his life helping others , working in the fields of aid and development . He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages .

On September 12 , 2012 , Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda 's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown `` no interest in my case . '' He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from `` one Jew to another '' to intervene .

The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy , which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS , al Qaeda or the Taliban .

The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them .

Should families abuse their clearances , they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones , which is a strong incentive not to abuse them .

Second , President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person , perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council , to oversee the work of the CIA , FBI , State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command , which implements hostage rescues . All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home . That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and `` de-conflict '' any potential issues , such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case .

Third , while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups , there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens , and this should be encouraged , even if there is some quid pro quo involved .

The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria , including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis , and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis , it 's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys .

Curtis ' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband , Canadian Joshua Boyle , who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan .

A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network . The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network , and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple 's release .

The name of the child is unknown .
