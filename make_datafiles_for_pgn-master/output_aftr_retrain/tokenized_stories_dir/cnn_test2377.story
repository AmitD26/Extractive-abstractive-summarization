`` There 's nothing more noble than public service , '' President Obama says .

Obama 's remarks came after a woman from Heidelberg , Germany , asked if he ever regretted having run for president . The question yielded a lengthy response from Obama , who is participating in his first overseas trip in office .

`` That 's a good question , '' Obama said at a packed town hall meeting in Strasbourg , France . `` Michelle definitely asked that question .

The president joked that he was jealous of not only Europe 's high-speed rail but also the fact that campaigns there only last a few months .

Obama announced that he was running for president on February 10 , 2007 , and was inaugurated nearly two years later .

`` So I was away from home all the time , and that was very difficult , because not only do I have a wonderful wife , but I have two perfect daughters , and so , you know , I missed them a lot , '' he said .

The president expressed disappointment about the lack of privacy and anonymity he 's experienced since assuming office .

`` You know , it 's very frustrating now , '' he said . `` It used to be when I came to Europe that I could just wander down to a cafe and sit and have some wine and watch people go by and go into a little shop and watch the sun go down .

`` Now I 'm in hotel rooms all the time . And I have security around me all the time . So just losing that ability to just take a walk , you know ? That is something that is frustrating . '' Take a look at Obama 's European itinerary ''

After a couple of minutes of going over his regrets , Obama paused .

`` But -- having said all that , I truly believe that there 's nothing more noble than public service , '' he said , adding that service does n't mean one has to run for president .

Obama pointed to Doctors Without Borders , the United Nations and community work as examples of other ways to serve .
