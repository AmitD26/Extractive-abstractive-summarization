-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An archeological team is set to break new ground in its excavation of an Egyptian temple where doomed lovers Cleopatra and Mark Antony may be buried .

Taposiris Magna is one of the ancient towns located on Lake Mariut , which is today called Abusir .

`` The discovery of this cemetery indicates that an important person , likely of royal status , could be buried inside the temple . It was common for officials and other high-status individuals in Egypt to construct their tombs close to those of their rulers throughout the Pharaonic period , '' according to the council .

`` Among the most interesting finds is a unique mask depicting a man with a cleft chin . The face bears some similarity to known portraits of Mark Antony himself , '' Hawass said .

The love story of Antony and Cleopatra has been a favorite theme for writers and filmmakers . The 1963 Oscar-winning movie of the couple starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton , who themselves became star-crossed lovers .

Cleopatra ruled Egypt between 51 B.C. until her suicide in 30 B.C. , following Mark Antony 's naval defeat against Caesar 's adopted son Octavian at Actium in the Mediterranean . Mark Antony , once a general in Caesar 's army , killed himself before Cleopatra took her own life , after being falsely informed that Cleopatra already had died .
