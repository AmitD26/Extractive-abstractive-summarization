He is fortunate not just because he has a natural talent for soccer and the dedication to rise through the ranks in his native Gambia and eventually go to the United States to play for the Seattle Sounders . Before leaving the tiny West African nation for America , Nyassi contracted malaria .

`` It 's a killer disease , '' the midfielder , 20 , says . `` You lose appetite . You are throwing up all the time . Your body gets warm . It 's very serious . ''

Nyassi recovered . But nearly a million people -- mostly young children and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa -- do not survive the disease , according to the National Institutes of Health .

On Saturday , before their game against the San Jose Earthquakes , Nyassi and his teammates will mark World Malaria Day by giving a check for $ 20,000 they raised for Nothing But Nets , a U.N. Foundation-sponsored campaign to supply anti-malarial bed nets to some of the poorest parts of the world . Watch how researchers are fighting malaria ''

Even though malaria was been wiped out in the United States , it still rages in countries in Africa , Asia and other developing parts of the world .

Rabinovich , who also contracted malaria during a visit to Gambia , says the Gates Foundation is waging a war against the disease on several fronts .

`` Keeping people from getting bitten by a mosquito , that 's what a bed net does , '' she says . `` Not having the mosquito thrive , that 's what insecticide does . By treating them , you keep someone else from being infected by another mosquito bite . ''

`` The really interesting thing about malaria is that they have n't depended on a magic silver bullet , '' she explains . `` Bed nets protect you about half the time , spraying protects you . It 's been the combination of prevention and treatment that 's effective . When we have a malaria vaccine it will join that toolbox . ''

`` You need to break transmission , you need to break the ability of the parasite to move to the mosquito and from the mosquito back to humans , '' he says . `` This liver infection is a great place to attack . If you prevent infection right there , then humans do n't become infected , the mosquito that bites them the next time can also not become infected and can not bring the disease to another person . ''

The vaccine has already been proven effective 100 percent of the time in studies with mice , Kappe says . Now the researcher will begin human trials of a potential vaccine . Or , as he calls it , taking the difficult leap `` from mice to men . ''

Until there is a vaccine , prevention and remedies as simple as bed nets will be crucial .

Success playing soccer means Sanna Nyassi no longer needs to be wary of malaria , but that has n't made him forget those that do . `` I was born poor , '' Nyassi says . `` But things are getting better for me . I have to look back at the other ones . ''
