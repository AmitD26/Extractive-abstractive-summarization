LAHORE , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's hot and sweaty in a rat-infested room in Lahore 's historic red light district , a neighborhood of narrow alleyways lined with brothels .

A dancer does the `` mujra , '' a traditional dance banned by a judge for being `` vulgar , '' in Lahore , Pakistan .

The dancer , who only gives her first name , Beenish , is performing a kind of Pakistani belly-dance called the mujra .

Her harmonium player , a skinny bald man who squints through coke-bottle glasses , has been performing like this for the past 50 years . But he says the art form is dying out .

`` That spark , the way it was in the past , is no more , '' said Ghulam Sarwar .

Last fall , a judge in Lahore 's high court declared the mujra dance `` vulgar '' and banned it from being performed on stage .

`` It is a gesture of good will to pacify the mullahs and the Taliban , '' said Samia Amjad , a lawmaker in the provincial assembly . Though she is a member of an opposition political party , she said she supported the crackdown on vulgarity . `` I see it as an essential part of Islam . ''

Dancers are n't the only targets of the court censors .

`` If the current circumstances persist in Pakistan , '' said Noora Lal , one of the banned singers , `` then singing will die out in this country . ''

Pakistan is a deeply conservative Muslim nation , where the punishment for blasphemy is the death sentence .

But there is one person in Lahore who openly mocks the conservative establishment : painter and restaurant owner Iqbal Hussain .

Though he said he has received multiple death threats from Islamist fundamentalists , Hussain continues to be Pakistan 's most vocal defender of prostitutes . All of the models portrayed in his paintings are sex workers .

The small , soft-spoken painter has turned the house he grew up in , an old four-story building with ornate wooden balconies , into a popular restaurant for tourists and wealthy Pakistanis . On one side of the house there is a brothel , on the other side , the 17th century Badshahi Mosque , one of the largest mosques in the world .

In his subversive paintings , which Hussain said sell for more than $ 10,000 each , he highlights the overlap between Lahore 's sex industry and its religious community . In one canvas , hundreds of worshippers are depicted prostrating themselves around the mosque , while in the foreground , two women apply lipstick and makeup on a balcony .

Nevertheless , the rising tide of the Taliban in northwestern Pakistan has some residents of Lahore 's red light district worried .
