Although it 's sometimes described as a prequel to `` Alien , '' Scott 's clarified that `` Prometheus '' is n't really a prequel as much as it shares `` Alien 's '' DNA , which in itself is enough to raise audience expectations several notches .

Film fans cherish `` Alien '' now as one of a kind , but critical reaction upon its theatrical release was actually pretty mixed . The New York Times called Scott a `` very stylish director '' but added that `` Alien '' was n't `` the seminal science-fiction film one wants from him . ''

That `` cinematic bastard '' grew legs as the years went by , and has been ranked by the American Film Institute as one of the 10 best science-fiction films ever made .

Part of the success is owed to H.R. Giger 's nightmarish alien , which Scott called in a recent Rolling Stone interview `` one of the best all-time monsters . ''

Without it , he went on , `` I 've got a nice , very well-acted , beautifully art-directed movie , but I ai n't got that f ***** g heart-stopping son of a b *** h that defies logic . '' -LRB- We 'd bet audiences would agree . -RRB-

So while the `` Alien '' franchise moved on without him , Scott was still rolling the story around in the back of his mind , particularly the question of what happened to the mysterious alien pilot , or `` Space Jockey , '' that was seen in the 1979 film .

`` I must have thought about it for three or four years and thought in all of the films nobody had asked a very simple question which was -- who is the big guy in the chair , '' Scott told Empire magazine during a Q&A earlier this year . That turned into four questions , he went on : `` Who are they ? Why are they there ? Why that cargo and where were they going or had they in fact had a forced landing ? ''

Noomi Rapace stars as scientist Elizabeth Shaw , who believes ancient cave drawings suggest the `` engineers '' of humans left the drawings as a kind of map to find them .

Although plot details have been kept close to the vest , `` Prometheus '' holds the promise of a space exploration gone horribly wrong , and reviews have been cautiously laudatory . The Hollywood Reporter acknowledged its technical magnificence while citing a need for more `` adventurous thought , '' while Entertainment Weekly praises Scott 's -LRB- per usual -RRB- command of imagery , but found the movie 's `` origin fable ... unwieldy . ''

Time will likely tell how `` Prometheus '' holds up against Scott 's other films , however , and in the meantime , sci-fi fans can take heart -- he 's already at work on a `` Blade Runner '' sequel .
