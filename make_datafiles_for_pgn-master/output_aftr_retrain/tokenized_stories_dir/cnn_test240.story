The January 22 , 1973 , Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion remains the law of the land , and passions remain high on both sides of the issue , with annual protests on the anniversary . Access to abortion , then and now , is more than just about simple legalities . Social , religious and family values , as well as finances and politics , still play a role in shaping the abortion issue , but many legal and medical experts say the debate has become predictable .

New research from the Alan Guttmacher Institute found the rate of abortions is at its lowest level since Roe , and the total number is also in decline , about 1.2 million in the year 2005 , down 25 percent since the all-time high in 1990 .

For the Supreme Court justices , Roe reflected earlier cases involving the right to privacy . That `` right , '' wrote Justice Harry Blackmun in the main opinion for the court , is `` broad enough to encompass a woman 's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy . ''

After Roe , the high court affirmed the right to abortion in subsequent cases : striking down a provision requiring a husband 's consent for a first-trimester abortion and a provision requiring parental consent for an unmarried woman under 18 ; striking down efforts to expand on laws requiring women to give informed consent before having an abortion ; striking down a 24-hour waiting period ; and striking down a law requiring doctors to inform women of the risks and of assistance available if she completed pregnancy .

But there was one notable victory for anti-abortionist activists : banning use of taxpayer funds to finance abortions for poor women .

The abortion issue has been revisited several times since Roe , most famously in two cases : Webster v. Reproductive Health Services -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and Planned Parenthood v. Casey -LRB- 1992 -RRB- .

Justices William Rehnquist , Byron White and Anthony Kennedy said they would allow restrictions on abortion , but only if the restrictions had a rational basis . More important , the three conservative justices said a compelling government interest need not be required to justify restrictions on abortion . That was a blow for anti-abortion forces .

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not join either opinion , saying there was nothing in it to justify reconsidering Roe . Nevertheless , Blackmun wrote , `` the right to reproductive choice '' was in danger of being overturned .

Another legacy of Roe that remains : The head-counting of justices on the court , a what-if scenario that could lead to the overturning of Roe . The current 5-4 conservative majority could shift significantly in either direction if two or more justices leave the bench in the next few years , as is widely expected .

In the meantime , conservatives in Congress have promised to push for tougher restrictions on the access to abortion , though many political experts say the goal is not necessarily aimed at overturning Roe .

The procedure is typically performed by doctors in the middle to late second trimester . The legal sticking point was that the law lacked a `` health exception '' for a woman who might suffer serious medical complications , something the justices have said in the past is necessary when considering abortion restrictions .

The swing vote , as in previous cases , came from Kennedy . In angry dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the lone woman on the high court since O'Connor stepped down , called the majority 's conclusions `` alarming '' and said they `` can not be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court , and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women 's lives . ''

If there is one last legacy of the Roe decision , it may be that it opened up and expanded the entire debate on the rights of women , sexuality , health care , and medical decisions . Issues like cloning , stem cells , and fetal research have become part of the national lexicon . As significant as it was , Roe v. Wade was only the beginning of the battle . E-mail to a friend
