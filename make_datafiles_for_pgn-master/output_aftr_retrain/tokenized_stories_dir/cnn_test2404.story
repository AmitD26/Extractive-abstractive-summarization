SRINAGAR , Indian-administered Kashmir -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tendered his resignation Tuesday after he was accused of being involved in a 2006 sex scandal , his adviser said .

Omar Abdullah , 38 , delivered his resignation to the state governor after opposition member Muzaffar Hussain Beigh accused Omar of a connection to the prostitution scandal during a session of the state legislative assembly . Muzaffar served as the deputy chief minister in the previous government , when several top pro-India officials were arrested on charges they misused their authority to force girls and women into a prostitution ring in Kashmir .

Omar denied being involved in the scandal , but said he could not `` continue in the office following the allegation '' and would not serve again until he is cleared of the charges .

The governor is consulting constitutional and legal experts before deciding on the resignation .

The chief minister refused to talk to journalists outside the governor 's residence .

Omar came into office in January following elections in late 2008 that saw the highest voter turnout in the region in nearly 20 years , since the eruption of a secessionist insurgency . Voters went to the polls in large numbers , despite a separatist call for a boycott of the voting .

Two people have died and many have been injured in more than 300 violent clashes between Muslim protesters and Indian security forces stemming from the case .

The arrests included the former police chief of south Kashmir 's Shopian district and three of his subordinates , who are accused of `` destruction of evidence '' and `` dereliction of duty '' in connection with the deaths , which occurred in the town of Shopian .

Kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades in which , according to official figures , 43,000 people have been killed .
