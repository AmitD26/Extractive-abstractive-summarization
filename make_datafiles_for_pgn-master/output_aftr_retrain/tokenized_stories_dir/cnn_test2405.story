Mehdi Karrubi says an `` impartial committee '' is needed to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees .

An investigating judge said the popular newspaper , Etemad-e Melli , was ordered closed for what has been described as `` publishing unlawful and criminal material , '' state-run Press TV reported .

Protesters outside the newspaper offices clashed with police Monday , the network also reported .

She and Karrubi 's son , Hossein , said the newspaper had planned to run a firm response from Karrubi to his opponents , who have dismissed the allegations of detainee rapes .

The officials told the employees that they `` were not allowed to come to the newspaper tomorrow , '' Alinejad , who is temporarily in the United States for a reporting assignment , told CNN .

He cited the pending publication of his father 's response to `` the insults '' recently hurled at him for the shutdown .

It was not printed , and its offices were closed , Alinejad said .

The treatment of detainees at Iran 's prisons has increasingly become a high-profile issue , with human-rights groups accusing guards of conducting harsh interrogations , beatings , sleep deprivation , and threats of torture to coerce false confessions .

In an August 8 posting on the Etemad-e Melli party 's Web site , Karrubi said he had heard descriptions of torture and violence that made his `` body shake . ''

`` Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent , repeated rapes of the young women -LSB- in detention -RSB- that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems , '' Karrubi said . `` Others have raped our detained young men with such brutality that they -LSB- the victims -RSB- have been afflicted by depression and are no longer speaking with anyone and refuse to leave the dark corners of their houses . ''

Iran 's influential parliament speaker dismissed the allegations , calling them `` sheer lies , '' state-run media reported last week .

Ali Larijani said a special panel of Iran 's parliament , or Majlis , conducted a `` precise and comprehensive inquiry '' into the treatment at Tehran 's Evin and Kahrizak prisons , and found `` no cases of rape or sexual abuse , '' Press TV reported .

Alinejad questioned the legitimacy of the report , saying Karrubi 's real response would have been in Monday 's edition of Etemad-e Melli .
