Mandy Moore spins in a Chaiken cashmere dress and Ibisco belt .

1 . Start defining your style

`` It all goes back to wanting to be an individual . I have my days of not feeling super-great , but that 's universal . My style has evolved as I 've become more aware of myself as well as what looks good on me -- and what does n't . ''

2 . Find labels that work for you

`` It 's always nice to have a running tally of designers that fit your body well and that you feel comfortable in for any number of events . It makes you feel less limited . ''

`` I 'm not super-picky about color . I 'm more picky about the cut of a garment . I look terrible in anything bias-cut for instance , and I prefer Empire waists . '' Mandy explains other fashion choices ''

4 . Dresses are secret weapons

5 . When in doubt , bring a belt

7 . Some trends wo n't flatter you -- avoid them .

8 . Find a great tailor

`` I 've been having trouble finding jeans lately . So I 've been buying vintage high-waist trouser jeans and having them tailored . My tailor understands my body . She 's always encouraging me to wear stuff tighter . ''

9 . Hoop earrings work on everyone

10 . Give yourself a break

`` You have to take a break and treat yourself . I treat myself by getting massages , manicures or pedicures . I treat myself by having a cookie or frozen yogurt , or whatever it may be , because I know I work hard and I deserve it . '' E-mail to a friend
