Paul and Rachel Chandler set off from the Seychelles for Tanzania on October 21 , according to their blog . They have not been heard from since , but a distress beacon was activated October 23 , according to naval officials .

International military forces are treating the case as a `` potential hijacking , '' Lt. Ian Jones of Britain 's Royal Navy told CNN . `` We have no confirmation that anything has been pirated , '' he added .

There are many possibilities , he said , adding that he was aware of the reports of piracy but that hijacking was `` far from certain . ''

Before setting off , the Chandlers said that the journey could take as long as two weeks and that they would be out of contact for part of the voyage .

Britain 's Foreign Office issued a statement saying it is `` extremely concerned for their safety , '' while pointing out that it had not confirmed reports they were taken captive .

Attacks in the region have significantly increased this year , according to the International Maritime Bureau , which monitors shipping crimes . But successful attacks have decreased as a result of a strong presence of international monitors .

The first nine months of this year have seen more pirate attacks than all of last year , the bureau reported October 21 .

From January 1 until September 30 , pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks , compared with 293 in all of 2008 , it said . More than half of this year 's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden , a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia .

Out of those attacks , Somali pirates successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages . Eight people were wounded , four were killed and one is missing , the bureau said .

CNN 's Adam S. Levine contributed to this report .
