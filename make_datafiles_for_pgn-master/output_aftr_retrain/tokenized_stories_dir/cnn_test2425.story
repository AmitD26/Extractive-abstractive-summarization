George Lucas says he was `` completely surprised '' by `` Star Wars in Concert . ''

But while he 's enthusiastic about the new touring show `` Star Wars In Concert , '' it was n't his idea , and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week , he kept giving the credit to others .

`` Star Wars In Concert '' is built around John Williams ' well-known scores from the films , performed by a symphony orchestra and choir , and accompanied by specially edited clips from all six movies , displayed on a mammoth LED screen . Watch Lucas rave about the show ''

Anthony Daniels , who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid `` C3PO '' in every film and most of the spinoffs , provides live narration -- and another reason for the `` Star Wars '' fans in the audience , especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to Imperial stormtroopers , to cheer mightily , as they did the night I interviewed Lucas . iReporter praises the ` Force ' of the show

Lucas : Howard ! -LSB- Lucas calls over Howard Roffman , the president of Lucas Licensing . -RSB- You 're the man who did the whole thing -- I 've got nothing to do with it . ... We would kid him about how his concert was going and he had to get Johnny -LSB- Williams -RSB- to buy in and me to buy in .

Howard Roffman : Well , he always got it from the beginning , so he was an easy sell .

CNN : But what was it he `` got '' ? How did you sell him on a new concept for his franchise ?

Roffman : I think he understood that the music was so powerful and the images are so powerful that when you put that together with a live orchestra on a big venue , I mean , who would not be thrilled to see that ?

CNN : It 's a very different experience , being live .

Lucas : It 's very powerful . I was completely surprised by it . And I 've seen other live orchestra performances with `` Star Wars '' images , but nothing like this -- I mean this really works , because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion .
