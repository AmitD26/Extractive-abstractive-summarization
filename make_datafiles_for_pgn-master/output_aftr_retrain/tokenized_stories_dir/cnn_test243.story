-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If austerity had been a clinical trial , it would have been stopped . As public health experts , we have watched aghast as a slow motion disaster arose from austerity policies in Europe , while politicians continue to ignore the evidence of their disastrous effects .

In the U.S. , Greece , Italy , Spain , the UK and elsewhere in Europe there were more than 10,000 additional suicides from 2007-2010 , a figure that is over and above historical trends , with the largest rises concentrated in the worst performing economies .

But suicides and depression are not unavoidable consequences of economic downturns : countries that slashed health and social protection budgets have seen starkly worse health outcomes than nations which opted for stimulus over austerity .

Since 2008 there has been a rise of more than 40 % of people who report being unable to access healthcare that they believe to be medically necessary , the majority concentrated in pensioners .

Over 35,000 public health workers , nurses , and doctors have lost jobs . Unemployment rates have hit 27 % and youth unemployment has jumped to near 75 % in some areas .

Were these all inevitable consequences of recession , rather than consequences of austerity ? Of course the Greek financial and political elites have made mistakes . And of course Greece 's fiscal and monetary options were severely restricted as part of the bailout deals . But the suffering of the Greeks was not inevitable .

The timing of many of these health effects coincided not with the onset of recession in 2008 and 2009 , but with the implementation of deep budget cuts starting in 2010 .

Several prevailing myths are commonly offered as alternative explanations for Greece 's devastating health outcomes , including these three :

The first myth : `` Greece 's healthcare system is excessive and inefficient . '' But there are just five hospital beds in Greece per 1,000 people , versus more than eight beds per 1,000 people in Germany .

The second myth : `` Greeks are lazy . '' But in 2011 the average Greek citizen worked 2,038 hours per year -- 600 hours more than the average German , according to the OECD .

What we learned from analyzing past crises is that people do not inevitably get sick or die because the economy has faltered . Fiscal policy can be a matter of life and death .

Tuberculosis rates also fell , but disease rates were substantially reduced in those states that aggressively implemented the New Deal rather than those avoiding its implementation -- a `` natural experiment . '' 1934 , the year after the New Deal started becoming effective , marked the beginning of the U.S. economic recovery .

Another `` natural experiment '' occurred in the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998 . Indonesia , Thailand , and Malaysia all had large market crashes : their currencies plummeted , GDP collapsed , and unemployment soared .

But their politicians responded differently to the crisis , creating a rare laboratory in which we can identify the health effects of economic policy . Indonesia and Thailand turned to the IMF for help , implementing deep cuts to its HIV prevention , whereas Malaysia charted a different path , investing in preventive measures during the crisis .

Indonesia and Thailand suffered large pneumonia and tuberculosis outbreaks , but Malaysia avoided these effects .

Turning to the current recession in Europe , Iceland is another case study revealing that there is an alternative to austerity . Five years ago its three largest banks failed , and their total debt rocketed to over 800 % of GDP . It was the largest banking crisis in history relative to the size of an economy and it forced Iceland to turn to the IMF for help .

Then the president of Iceland took a radical step : asking the people what they wanted to do .

In March 2010 , 93 % of the Icelandic people voted against financing a bailout for foreign savers of Icesave Bank through draconian budget cuts . Instead , Iceland stabilized healthcare spending .

There was no significant rise in suicides or depression . Nor were there any significant infectious disease outbreaks . Indeed , last year GDP growth was 2.7 % , and unemployment rates have fallen below 5 % .

But if austerity is not working , and indeed is part of the problem -LRB- as the IMF has recently admitted -RRB- , why are European leaders continuing its pursuit ?

In the aftermath of that war , West Germany benefited from the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan , whereby America injected $ 1.45 billion in funds to invest in German industry and rebuild vital infrastructure . The Marshall Plan 's stimulus package helped spur recovery , paving the way for decades of prosperity and peace in Western Europe .

Collectively we seem to be losing sight of the lessons from our past . In Greece , austerity packages in Europe are sparking the rising popularity of neo-Nazi parties , such as Golden Dawn .

Thanks to smart investments in `` active labor market programs `` â € '' programs that help people access job retraining and return to work quickly -- Germany , Sweden and Iceland have mitigated rises in depression and suicides from unemployment .

Our research has found that each euro invested in public health can yield up to a three euros return if invested wisely in data-supported government programs .

New York City officials learned this lesson in the early 1990s -- after restricting its TB prevention budget , the city suffered a drug-resistant TB outbreak that ultimately cost $ 1.2 billion to control , about 10 times greater than the estimated price of prevention .

What we have learned is that severe , indiscriminate cuts to vital social protection programs are not only economically self-defeating , but fatal .

They have analyzed how austerity affects health and have found it drives up suicide , depression and illness rates

They say the suffering of Greeks is not inevitable , with history showing stimulus can work better than austerity
