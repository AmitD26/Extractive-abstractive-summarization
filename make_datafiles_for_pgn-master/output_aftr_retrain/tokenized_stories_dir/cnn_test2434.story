Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six Haitian orphans , seized by national authorities last week as they prepared to journey to the United States , will be able to leave the earthquake-devastated country Wednesday .

The women had attempted to leave Saturday when angry Haitians demanded to see their paperwork . Police suspected that a key document the women were carrying -- a permission signed by Haiti 's prime minister -- was a fake , something the women and U.S. officials deny .

The women said Tuesday that they had been given permission to take the children to the United States . The women were staying with the children at a friend 's house in Port-au-Prince .

The incident came nearly a month after the arrest of 10 U.S. missionaries accused of trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country without proper paperwork . Eight of them have been released on bail and have returned to the United States .

The question of Haitian children being removed from the country illegally came to the foreground after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake devastated parts of the country on January 12 . Authorities feared that children left on their own -- because their parents died or they were separated from them -- would be targeted by child traffickers .

CNN 's Gary Tuchman and Ismael Estrada contributed to this report .
