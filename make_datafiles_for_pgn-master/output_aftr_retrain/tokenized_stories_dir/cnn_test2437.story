-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For many graduate students seeking an advanced education degree , obstacles abound . Issues of finance , time management and family logistics often get in the way of students furthering their education and their dreams .

Palestinian Sawsan Salameh is attending an Israeli university after years of negotiations and court proceedings .

`` When I was in high school , it was a dream that I should finish my Ph.D. , '' Salameh said .

The Supreme Court responded by asking the military to lift the ban and allow Salameh to study at Hebrew University , where she is pursuing a Ph.D. in pharmacology .

The criteria include that the potential student clear all necessary internal security checks , that the student pursue a degree in a discipline that would encourage regional cooperation and develop area coexistence , and that the area of study not have the potential to cause damage to Israel , says Maj. Guy Inbar , spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories .

After Salameh 's victory , Gisha , with the support of a number of Israeli academics , further appealed to the court to push the military to ease these limitations .

The Israeli military 's heightened security concerns reflect heightened tensions in the region due to the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict .

In July 2002 , a bomb exploded in the student cafeteria of Hebrew University , killing seven people . The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas claimed responsibility for the explosion , according to Palestinian sources .

Still , some academics at Hebrew University believe qualified students like Salameh pose no security risk , and their acceptance to Israeli universities could even foster better relations in the region .

He believes that the admission of Palestinian students from the West Bank would enrich the academic environment at the university , particularly in the study of law .

`` It 's particularly important for classes to be diverse , for people to have familiarity with Arabic studies and Islamic law , '' he said .

`` My personal feeling is that we should do everything we can to allow Palestinian students to study at Hebrew University , '' said Yaacov Schul , vice rector at Hebrew University .

Salameh is a devout Muslim with a traditional background yet shirks pressure from family members to focus on marriage and motherhood .

`` Everyday I have to hear something about -LSB- not being married -RSB- from relatives and aunts , '' she says . `` It 's become -LSB- the -RSB- usual . ''

Salameh , who also provides valuable resources for young women at a women 's center she opened in her community , says she hopes her pursuit of higher education will open even more doors for young women also wishing to pursue a higher education and achieve their academic goals .

`` I get lots of phone calls every day from girls in the West Bank who ask me how to apply to universities in Israel , '' Salameh said .

`` Maybe they can become more than just a wife and mother and at least finish their first degree , '' she said .

She is considering pursuing another degree after completing her Ph.D. in two years .

`` I would like to help other people , and I hope the political situation will become better and things will become easier , '' she said .
