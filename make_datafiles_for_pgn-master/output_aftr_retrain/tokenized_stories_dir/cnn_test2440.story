Retired Army Gen. Sarath Fonseka faced a panel of three military judges , who are to decide whether he is guilty of participating in politics while still in uniform .

Fonseka 's spokesman Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the former military commander 's lawyers raised two objections : that the judges are biased and that a military court can no longer rule on Fonseka 's case , because he left the army more than six months ago .

Fonseka says the charges against him are false and politically motivated .

The man credited with the military campaign that defeated a quarter-century-long insurgency by the Tamil Tiger rebel movement was arrested last month . He was dragged from his office by armed military police during a meeting with his supporters , they said .

Fonseka 's supporters say the former general was seen as a threat to the government and his arrest was ordered to prevent his participation in parliamentary elections April 8 .

The former military commander challenged Rajapaksa in January 's presidential elections , but lost by a wide margin and accused the government of election fraud .

The Fonseka family has challenged his arrest in Sri Lanka 's supreme court . Those arguments are to be heard April 26 .
