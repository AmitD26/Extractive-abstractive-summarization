She did n't assume last week 's spring break would cool things down . She expected stares , dirty looks and cold shoulders , and passing through the doors was daunting . Over these last two weeks , she said , she 's had a hard time sleeping , can barely eat , feels anxious and -- until she saw a doctor for help -- often felt like she was `` going to throw up . ''

`` I 've been very nervous about all of this , '' the 18-year-old Itawamba Agricultural High School senior said . `` I do n't like being somewhere where everyone hates me . ''

`` We 're in a conservative area of the country , where people tend to think we can do what we like , '' said Sun , who lives in New York but has traveled multiple times to Mississippi for this legal push . `` This case sends a strong message that that 's not going to fly anymore . ''

The only pending issue , Sun said , is the question of damages and the ACLU 's request for attorneys ' fees . An amended complaint to seek a quick resolution on this should be filed in the next 30 days , she said .

In many ways , she stands in an awkward balance . Though there are some people who support her in Fulton -LRB- population about 4,000 -RRB- , the overarching tension and what she described as `` hostility '' that she feels at school and in her community is in deep contrast to the reception and groundswell of support that 's overwhelmed her nationally .

As a poster child for the rights of LGBT students , she 's been asked to jump on airplanes to appear on news programs and talk shows . The Facebook fan page `` Let Constance Take Her Girlfriend to Prom ! '' had attracted more than 414,000 fans as of Friday morning . Wealthy individuals , including Ellen DeGeneres , have offered to pay for a prom for her school . She 's received a $ 30,000 college scholarship from an anonymous donor and Tonic.com , a digital media company in New York that 's also offered her a summer internship . She 's even been invited to high school proms in cities she 's never visited .

`` It means a lot to me , '' she said of the outreach from others . `` The amount of support helps me to continue with the fight . ''

But all McMillen , who came out as a lesbian in eighth grade , ever wanted was to go to her school prom with her class , and with her girlfriend . Going to another school 's prom , while a nice offer , does n't make any sense to her .

Parents at her school are reportedly planning a `` ball '' for the same night that prom was intended . McMillen said she 's still trying to find out if she 's free to attend with her girlfriend . She wo n't go otherwise .

She never meant to be a spoiler for others when she sought approval to bring her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo , she said . She thought she was doing the right thing by asking in advance , since the school had stipulated in a February memo that dates must be of the opposite sex . Rather than give her permission , the school canceled the prom .

Whether she intended to or not , McMillen has inspired others -- not just nationally but in her home state , said Izzy Pellegrine , 19 , a student at Mississippi State University .

McMillen 's actions speak for others who feel unable to speak for themselves , said Pellegrine , who 's a founding board member of the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition , which helped connect McMillen with the ACLU . The grass-roots organization seeks to protect the interests of LGBT youth and will host a `` second chance prom '' on May 8 , an event Pellegrine estimated may attract as many as 500 students , thanks in large part to the way McMillen 's fight empowers others .

As for where life will take McMillen after graduation , she is n't yet sure . She 's still thinking about that summer internship offer in New York and is pretty certain she 'll attend Itawamba Community College for a couple years before going to one of her dream schools , the University of Southern Mississippi or UCLA . What she does know is she 'd like to study and possibly pursue a career in psychology .

`` I like helping people , and I like talking to people about their problems , '' she said . `` I find the human mind and human behavior very interesting . ''
