Oh , and there 's one more thing : I am what is commonly referred to in polite society as `` an unmarried woman . ''

For those valiant , traumatized souls , I present my list of the ten things one must never say , think , or do when dealing with a single woman over the age of 35 .

1 . Hey , cousin Christy , how ` bout we break with tradition and dispense with that bridal bouquet toss ? Believe it or not , it 's actually a touch degrading to be shoved front and center next to your spinster aunt Mitzi from Winnipeg as a roomful of revelers hopped up on Champagne and jumbo shrimp chant , `` You 're next , you 're next . ''

No , I suspect it was your description of his `` slight comb-over '' and `` profound desire to one day shake Dick Cheney 's hand '' that made me release that `` catch '' back into the wilds of New Jersey .

4 . Kindly stop filling every conversational lull by announcing how much you love `` Will & Grace . '' Being single is not the same thing as being gay , just as being married is not proof of being straight ... but I 'll cover that concept more fully in my upcoming `` Uncle Barry 's Very Special Surprise '' article .

5 . Has anybody out there noticed that the institution of matrimony is falling apart faster than Courtney Love on a can of Red Bull ? Now , I honestly do n't care if your marriage is so gothic in its dysfunction that it makes the couple from `` Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? '' look like Will and Jada -- I 'm not here to judge .

All I ask is that you quit judging me . Perhaps we 're not suffering a fear of intimacy as much as a fear of being trapped in a crummy marriage .

6 . Remember that little factoid you used to bandy about -- you know , the one where 40-year-old women have a greater chance of being shot by terrorists than of making it to the altar ? Then you may also recall that Susan Faludi refuted that myth 14 years ago . So , okay , Ms. Faludi is probably rethinking that -LRB- thanks a lot , Osama ! -RRB- , but you do n't have to rub it in .

7 . Enough with the `` constructive '' criticism already . We live in a world of stunning technological advancement , but it remains physically impossible to wear your heart on your sleeve and be emotionally distant , dress like a slut and a librarian , try much too hard and not make any real effort .

For one thing , very few have Manolo Blahniks in their closets . For another , very few have sex with Michael Douglas in their kitchens . They sometimes get lonely , frustrated , they sometimes get flat-out goofy . They are human beings -- tickle them and they laugh , prick them and they bleed , offer them chocolate and they eat ... . In other words , they 're pretty much like all the married women I know .
