Israel has not demonstrated that it will conduct thorough and objective investigations , Human Rights Watch said in a statement .

In September , the United Nations Human Rights Council released a report by noted South African jurist Richard Goldstone . The report concluded that both sides committed war crimes during the conflict , which killed about 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .

In a report , Ban outlines steps Israelis and Palestinians have taken to fulfill a U.N. demand for credible and transparent inquiries into civilian casualties . However , he concludes , `` As such , no determination can be made on the implementation of the resolution by the parties concerned . ''

For its part , the Palestinian Authority said it had created a commission to look into various charges of abuses , but made clear that it did not view the potential wrongdoing on the Palestinian side as seriously as that allegedly committed by the Israeli military .

`` There is absolutely no symmetry or proportionality between the occupying power and the occupied people '' wrote Riyad Mansour , Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations .

In Gaza , the ruling Hamas movement released a summary of the steps taken to investigate wrongdoing , saying it had prevented militants from targeting civilians .

But the rights organization dismissed the conclusion as `` factually wrong . '' Human Rights Watch said it is still reviewing a full Hamas report .

`` Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence , but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located , '' Stork said . `` Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were intending to harm civilians . ''
