-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When a new president strolls into the White House , there 's a kick in his step and a twinkle in his eyes .

This photo illustration projects what President-elect Barack Obama may look like in four years .

Using public information , Roizen looked through medical records of previous presidents back to Theodore Roosevelt . Assessing factors such as diet , blood pressure , physical activity and lifestyle habits , he calculated that the leader of the free world ages more quickly .

Roizen , who is the author of `` RealAge : Are You as Young as You Can Be ? '' has not assessed the `` real age '' of President-elect Barack Obama , who is 47 , because of lack of medical data .

`` Barack Obama is a fairly young guy and does n't have great of a risk , '' Roizen said . `` If he 's president for eight years , he ends up having the risk of disability or dying , like someone who is 16 years older . ''

`` Chronic stress can produce lots of wear and tear on the body , '' said James A. McCubbin , a Clemson University professor of psychology and senior associate dean of the College of Business and Behavioral Science . `` This is what we see in the changes in the appearance in the beginning and end of the presidency . ''

Roizen points to the experience of Ronald Reagan .

`` When Reagan came into office , he stood up absolutely straight . He was joking and incredibly quick-witted about current events . When he left office , he was hunched over . The age signs on face was there . His jokes were those of olden days rather than current events , '' he said . See the toll of the presidency ''

`` Do as many healthy things as you can adopt , '' Roizen suggested . `` The main thing he should do is finding what he wants to do with the rest of his life , which is tough for presidents to find something meaningful to do . ''

`` This is not a broccoli-shunning , pork rind-eating , McDonald 's - popping guy . I mean , this is someone who eats arugula and guacamole and Hawaiian pizza , '' Zinczenko told CNN . Watch a report on presidential aging ''

`` If the worst that happens is that your hair goes a little gray , so be it . ''

`` Maybe he will age better , because he handles stress better , '' he said . `` The fact that he smokes means he still has inner stress . ''

Retaining a close group of friends and confidants is an important way to reduce the isolation of the presidency , Roizen said .
