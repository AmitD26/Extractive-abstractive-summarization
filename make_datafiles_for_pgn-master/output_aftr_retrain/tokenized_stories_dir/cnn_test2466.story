New Orleans , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill that removes limits on financial damages that can be awarded for accidents off the U.S. coastline , such as the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 workers .

Also Thursday , the U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency issued a directive to BP on how the company should manage recovered oil , contaminated materials and waste recovered in cleanup operations from the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .

Among other requirements , the directive requires the oil giant to give the EPA and state agencies access to any waste storage site and to provide specific plans , waste reports and tracking systems for liquid and solid waste .

Waste sampling to date has been done in compliance with EPA and state regulatory requirements , the Coast Guard said .

The EPA on Thursday also released results from its first round of toxicity testing on eight oil dispersants , including Corexit 9500 , which is being used in the Gulf .

The agency conducted the testing to ensure that `` decisions about ongoing dispersant use in the Gulf of Mexico continue to be grounded in the best available science , '' the EPA said .

Of the dispersants tested , Corexit 9500 and one called JD-2000 were generally less toxic to small fish , and JD-2000 and Saf-Ron Gold were least toxic to mysid shrimp , the EPA said .

A ship billed as the world 's largest skimming vessel has arrived in the Gulf of Mexico and was awaiting approval to begin cleaning , according to a spokesman for the Taiwanese company that owns it . The A Whale arrived in the Gulf on Wednesday and was anchored in Boothville , Louisiana , about an hour south of New Orleans .

`` We 're anxious to find out how effective it will be , '' Allen said . He cautioned that the area of the slick in which the ship will be most effective is a `` congested '' site above the ruptured BP well , which could make it harder to operate the 1,000-foot-plus vessel , but added , `` Anything that 's effective we 're looking forward to using . ''

Hurricane Alex hit the Mexican coast , more than 600 miles from the center of the Gulf disaster , on Wednesday night with 105 mph winds . It had diminished to a tropical storm by Thursday afternoon , but it continued to stir up seas of 6 to 8 feet around the site of the 10-week-old disaster and forced the postponement of a planned overflight of the area by Coast Guard Rear Adm. Paul Zukunft .

And the system 's prevailing winds have affected the direction of the oil slick , steering it away from the western Florida Panhandle toward the environmentally sensitive Mississippi and Chandeleur sounds off the coast of Mississippi and Louisiana , Zukunft said .

Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels -LRB- about 1.5 million gallons -RRB- and 60,000 barrels -LRB- about 2.5 million gallons -RRB- of oil have been gushing into the Gulf every day since April 20 , when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana .

In other efforts , the U.S. Navy said Thursday it was sending a silver-colored blimp to aid in oil disaster efforts . The blimp , known as the MZ-3A , will fly slowly over the region in order to view the area where the oil is flowing and how it is coming ashore . It can also direct oil skimming operations . It was on the way to the Gulf region from Arizona on Thursday , the Navy said .

`` This is life for many people , in terms of their financial instability and the need for financial certainty , '' he said . `` We do not have a lot of time . ''

Feinberg said Riley has suggested that affected residents get lump-sum payments for up to six months ' worth of lost income rather than month-to-month payments , and `` That is what we plan to do . ''
