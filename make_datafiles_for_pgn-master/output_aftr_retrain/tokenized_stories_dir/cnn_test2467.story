-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Walk into Lisa Nasser 's kitchen most evenings and you 're greeted by rich aromas that indicate an exceptional cook is at work on a delicious creation .

Colleen Doyle , editor of the `` What to Eat During Cancer Treatment '' cookbook , prepares tuna-bean salad .

Cooking is Nasser 's passion , but she left the kitchen and the cooking to others for six months in 2006 when she , like her mother before her , learned she had breast cancer . Numerous rounds of chemotherapy left her spent . `` I did n't have the energy to go shopping , bring in the food , prepare the food . I needed to rest , to sleep , '' she recalls .

`` One of the things we did was organize recipes by the symptoms that they might be experiencing , '' Doyle says . `` A lot of cancer patients going through chemo -- no surprise -- feel nauseous around those times when they are getting chemo . And so we talk to them about eating foods that are kind of bland ; think about avoiding really spicy foods , any kind of Mexican foods , things with lots of flavors , things with lots of herbs and spices . '' See recipe samples from the cookbook ''

Nasser was fortunate enough to have friends and neighbors deliver meals to her house . Once her nausea started to subside she was able to be more adventurous in what she ate . `` I remember calling a friend saying I wanted grape leaves . I remember wanting that tart lemony flavor and only hers were going to do it , '' she recalls . Watch Doyle cook in the kitchen ''

It turns out that tart , strong flavors help with another nagging symptom of cancer therapy : altered taste perception . Like Nasser , some patients experience a metallic taste that will not go away . For others , food might seem tasteless , as if the taste buds have stopped working .

Patients undergoing cancer treatment can also suffer bouts of constipation or diarrhea . One of the best strategies to ease constipation -- a common side effect of chemotherapy , anti-nausea and pain medications -- is to eat foods high in fiber , such as vegetables , fruits -LRB- including dried fruit like prunes , raisins or apricots -RRB- , beans and nuts .

What if diarrhea is a problem ? `` There 's a real concern about becoming dehydrated . So be sure you 're drinking plenty of fluids and that those fluids do n't have caffeine , '' says Doyle . Broths , diluted juices , sports drinks -- even Popsicles or gelatin -- can help get some liquid into the system . Foods such as applesauce , rice and bananas can help slow down the digestive tract , as can oatmeal and canned peaches or pears . Avoid greasy , fried or very sugary foods because they can be irritants .

Thanksgiving marks four years since Nasser 's days of chemotherapy drips and intravenous needles . Her health today is excellent and neighbors are once again making excuses to stop by during dinnertime in order to bask in the inviting aromas and sample the rich sauces bubbling up from deep pots on her stove top .

Nasser , who did n't have the benefit of the cookbook when she was sick , hopes to use her copy only as inspiration and not as a tool for providing relief from the side effects of cancer treatment . `` Hopefully I wo n't need it for that . And if I do , I 'll now know what to do , '' she says .
