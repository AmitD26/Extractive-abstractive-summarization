Ahead of the publication , many in the intelligence community worried that the stories would disclose too much information about contractors and the classified tasks they handle .

The Post article that appeared in Monday 's edition says its investigation uncovered `` a Top Secret America hidden from public view and lacking in thorough oversight . After nine years of unprecedented spending and growth , the result is that the system put in place to keep the United States safe is so massive that its effectiveness is impossible to determine . ''

Washington Post : Top Secret America

`` Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism , homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States , '' according to the Post , which added that an estimated 854,000 people hold top-secret security clearances .

`` There has been so much growth since 9/11 that getting your arms around that -- not just for the DNI -LSB- director of national intelligence -RSB- , but for any individual , for the director of the CIA , for the secretary of defense -- is a challenge , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Post last week .

`` Look , we know the intelligence community grew significantly and quickly after 9/11 , '' a senior administration official told CNN Monday . `` Some of it was inefficient . But we are looking at those inefficiencies . And remember , we have prevented attacks . ''

Acting National Intelligence Director David Gompert issued a statement saying the Post 's report `` does not reflect the intelligence community we know . ''

Although officials were concerned about the content of the newspaper articles ahead of publication , what troubled them the most was `` interactive '' component of the series , which they said lists the locations where the CIA , the National Security Agency and the other agencies that make up the intelligence community have facilities . Many of those sites are not publicly known , some officials said .

Officials worried about the security implications of such disclosures . As one person put it , `` these are targeted places to begin with . ... Mapping it out presents counterterrorism and counterintelligence concerns . ''

In two communications , officials asked the Post not to publish addresses , the senior administration official said Monday .

`` Because of the nature of this project , we allowed government officials to see the Web site several months ago and asked them to tell us of any specific concerns . They offered none at that time , '' the Post said in a message posted on its website . `` As the project evolved , we shared the Web site 's revised capabilities . Again , we asked for specific concerns . One government body objected to certain data points on the site and explained why ; we removed those items . Another agency objected that the entire Web site could pose a national security risk but declined to offer specific comments . ''

The message from the Mission Support Center of the director of national intelligence that was obtained by CNN told contractors , `` Employees should be reminded that they must neither confirm nor deny information contained in this , or any , media publication . ''

It warned that foreign intelligence services , terrorist groups and `` criminal elements '' might want to use the information .

`` Specifically , we recommend that companies affected by this publication and website assess and take steps to mitigate risk to their workforce , facility and mission , '' including `` re-enforcement of security and counterintelligence protections and steps to enhance workforce awareness . ''
