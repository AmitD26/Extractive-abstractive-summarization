One A Day Men 's 50 + Advantage ads say selenium may cut men 's risk of prostate cancer , a consumer group says .

`` The selenium claims are made by a -LSB- Food and Drug Administration -RSB- - approved qualified health claim . We regularly review the evidence , and we change our claims if necessitated . The emerging science has n't compelled us to change our claims , and the FDA claim is intact . ''

Bayer 's HealthCare division , based in Leverkusen , Germany , researches , manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products .

Bayer promotes One A Day Men 's 50 + Advantage and One A Day Men 's Health Formula multivitamins on package labels , TV and radio ads and on its Web site . In its promotions , the company says `` emerging research '' suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer , the center said .

Both dietary supplements contain 105 micrograms of the trace mineral selenium per daily dose , or about twice the Recommended Daily Allowance , which is 55 micrograms a day for adults , according to the center . Visit CNNhealth.com , your connection for better living

`` It 's astounding that a company such as Bayer ... would make such deceptive claims , '' the center 's litigation director , Steve Gardner , told reporters during the same teleconference .

Supporting the center in its letter of complaint to the FTC are nine researchers , who wrote a separate letter to Mary Engle , associate director of advertising practices . Among the signees are medical professionals from the Harvard School of Public Health , American Cancer Society and University of Illinois at Chicago Division of Pathology Research .

All agree there is scant evidence to support Bayer 's claim .

`` Bayer Healthcare is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer , '' they added .
