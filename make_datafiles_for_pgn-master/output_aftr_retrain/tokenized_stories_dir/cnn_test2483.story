Most people do n't know that Munich is also considered to be a surfing Mecca because of the famous standing wave right in the centre of the city at the Eisbach river .

For me it was vice versa . Through surfing this rapid I discovered the Oktoberfest . And since then I 've been hooked . Even weeks and days before the beer fest starts , the whole city gets crazy .

But also locals from Munich begin to get all excited , start to count the days and get prepared . The stores where you can buy the original Bavarian costumes , the `` Lederhosen '' for the guys and the `` Dirndl '' for the ladies , are so packed that you can hardly enter .

But let 's come back to the `` Wiesn '' -- that is how locals call the `` Oktoberfest '' -- and have a look at what a typical tour should include .

A good Oktoberfest visit usually starts with a fresh `` Mass '' of beer . If the weather is nice , you should have it in the sunshine in one of the beer gardens outside of the tents .

After you have enjoyed your first beer and some good food , you should check out some rides . There are the traditional ones . like Tobogan , a slide that has been at the Oktoberfest for 75 years . To go up , you hop on a conveyer and usually there is a big crowd of people having a blast , just watching who can make it up there without falling .

If you are a tourist you should also take a ride on the Riesenrad -LRB- Ferris Wheel -RRB- . It might look a bit lame but it is 55 meters high and you will get a beautiful view over Munich .

If you feel like competing with your friends , visit the so called Teufelrad -LRB- devil 's wheel -RRB- , a turning wheel where people can jump on . The challenge sounds simple . Just stay on the wheel . It gets tricky when the wheel is spinning faster and faster and punching balls swing by .

After you had fun on the rides and bought your girlfriend a heart made of lebkuchen -LRB- ginger cake -RRB- , it is time to go to where the real party is and help the locals drink more than 60,000 hectoliters of beer .

Visit one of the 14 big beer tents run by six Bavarian breweries . All you want to do now is to climb up on one of the benches and dance and sing with the crowd . Usually , the tents are packed with people . So do n't be shy , just ask some people if you and your friends can join to their table . People are usually in a very good mood and very open . You wonder how many people meet the love of their life at the Oktoberfest .

1 . Do n't wear Lederhosen made of plastic or cloth . You will look like a tourist . If you want to buy traditional Bavarian Lederhosen , make sure that they are nearly too tight . On the third day of wearing them they will just be fine . And once you 've invested in the outfit , you can still use it for Halloween .

5 . Do n't try to get up on stage and sing with the band . It might sound strange to you but they actually do n't like it .

6 . Last call at all the big beer tents is at 10.30 pm , one hour before closing time . If you leave the Wiesn at 10 pm you can avoid the people-traffic-jam on the way to the bus and train stations . Also , Munich is very walkable . You can exercise by burning off some of the beer calories

7 . Open up to people . After several -LRB- or even one -RRB- litres of beer you and everyone else in the tent start losing inhibitions , so it 's really easy to make new friends at Oktoberfest . So once you 've found a seat at one of the tent 's tables and ordered a beer , do n't be shy -- introduce yourself to those around you . Even when you go just by yourself , you 're going to have a blast . But smoking is banned in the tents .

8 . Sleeping is the best way to keep your body fit -- not on the street or the sidewalk , though . Go ahead and sleep your heart out at the place you 're staying . If you remind your body every now and then how it feels like to have more blood than alcohol running in your veins , your time at Oktoberfest will be a lot more fun .

10 . If you get sick , do n't do it close to the river because people might want to go surfing there .
