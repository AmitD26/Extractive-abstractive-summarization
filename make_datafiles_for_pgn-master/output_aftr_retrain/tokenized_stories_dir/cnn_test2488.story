All 130 residents of Condamine , about 185 miles inland from Brisbane , were evacuated because the town was inundated with water , Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts told CNN .

Roberts was in Emerald , an inland city of 15,000 residents that was experiencing some of the worst flooding Thursday . The Fitzroy River there was rising and expected to peak Friday at a record level of 16.2 meters -LRB- 53.2 feet -RRB- , according to Jeff Perkins , a supervising hydrologist at Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology .

`` Emerald is downstream of Fairbairn Dam . We 're expecting the dam to peak overnight tonight and Emerald to peak tomorrow , '' Perkins told CNN .

Many areas around the Fitzroy River will still be at flood stage in 10-14 days ' time , he said .

Parts of northern Queensland , however , were starting to recover from the monsoon rains that started about a week ago , creating the flooding problems , Perkins said . The rainfall has since moved south , flooding southern parts of the state , including Emerald and Rockhampton .

`` There 's been numerous rainfall records both for individual days and for much of the year , and for the month as well for northern and eastern Queensland , '' Auden told CNN .

The rain is now easing , but it has left behind flooded rivers that continue to cause the problems , he said .

Eight areas of the state have been declared disaster situations , Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said . She said the flooding was the worst she 's ever seen .

`` What is unprecedented about what 's happening up here at the moment is just the scale and the number of communities affected , '' she said in an interview Thursday with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . `` I 've certainly seen flooded towns before in Queensland . We have big storms and we have big river systems . But I 've never seen Queensland -- and I think it 's without precedent in our recorded history -- with so many places in so many diverse parts of the state each affected so critically all at once . ''

The government of Queensland said additional police have been sent to many flood-affected areas including Emerald , Rockhampton and Bundaberg .

It asked drivers to be careful when driving over the New Year holiday throughout the state .

More than 100,000 liters -LRB- 26,400 gallons -RRB- of water was being trucked into the town of flooded town of Dalby on Thursday because it was left with only two days ' worth of drinking water supply , Roberts ' office said .

Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster-declared areas across Australia and work with state authorities to provide more assistance .
