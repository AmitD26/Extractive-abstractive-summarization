Argentine striker Tevez is still hoping Manchester United will offer him a new deal at the end of the month .

On Sunday Tevez ran in the direction of Ferguson and United chief executive David Gill and cupped his hands to his ears after scoring in the 2-0 win over Manchester City that left the club on the brink of another Premier League title .

The 25-year-old still hopes for a positive response , but said at the weekend that he expects to leave the club at the end of his two-year loan contract

Ruocco said : `` There was no will from the directors and the coach to sign a new contract . On May 31 , he will have no club and no contract . I do n't know why , but Manchester -LRB- United -RRB- have not asked for any renewal -LRB- of the loan -RRB- nor signing him for next season . ''

However , Tevez 's adviser Kia Joorabchian stressed the striker would not rush to a decision over his future before the season ends .

Although a permanent move to United remains a possibility , Joorabchian is also aware of interest in the former West Ham frontman .

`` There 's a lot of interest in Carlos , but Carlos has always been very focused and very concentrated , '' Joorabchian told Sky Sports News .

`` For the respect of the team , the manager , the club , and the fans , we have to stay focused on finishing the season on a high .

`` This is how he 's always been . He wants to do the best he can . He will let the season finish and then sit down and evaluate the situation . ''

`` What he wants to do is to go to a club which has real ambition , a real focus , to be champions of England , champions of Europe , champions of everywhere , '' Joorabchian said .

`` I do n't want to direct , saying it 's going to be Liverpool , City , Chelsea , Arsenal , Everton , Tottenham -- whoever you can pick out -- Milan , Real Madrid , Barcelona , Juventus .
