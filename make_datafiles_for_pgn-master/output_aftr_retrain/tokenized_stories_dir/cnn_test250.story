Your choice may say something about your culture and your hopes for 2012 -- as might whether you decide to ring in the new year by smashing dishes , respectfully bowing to your elders or feasting on everything from cabbage to sticky rice soup to black-eyed peas .

And yes , underwear is one way to state your intentions -- at least in many South American countries , including Brazil and Argentina .

If you wore yellow , that supposedly enhances your chances for abundance and reaping in more money . If it was red , then you 'll more likely find love in 2012 . And if you were sporting white underpants , preferably new and clean , then peace was your top priority for the coming year .

One New Year 's theme that resonates across borders , ages and ethnic groups is feasting on foods in an effort to boost your prospects for the future . But the menu varies from place to place .

People in the nation of Georgia do n't count on a chef for good luck . Rather , they rely on the first person to come through their home 's door after midnight -- a person who , theoretically , will bring them fortune for the following year . Snacking on candy on New Year 's Eve is another way , in the former Soviet territory , to ensure that 2012 is likewise sweet , and not bitter .

The agenda for fun in Canada depends on where you are , from partying at a `` reveillon '' in Quebec to imbibing Screech rum in Newfoundland to savoring `` beaver tail '' -- a Canadian fried dough treat -- in Ontario .

It may be a small gathering of family and friends , watching the Times Square ball drop on TV , or loudly running through the neighborhood . Some may simply go to sleep early , so they can be energized for an early New Year 's Day hike -- perhaps while wearing underwear that suits their mood , and wishes , for 2012 .
