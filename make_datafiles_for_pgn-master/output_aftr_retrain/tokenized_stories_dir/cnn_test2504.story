U.N. officials requested up to 2,000 more peacekeepers in early January .

The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002 .

More than 25,000 Ivorians have fled to neighboring Liberia since the current crisis began , the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported last week .

Meanwhile , the African Union on Wednesday blamed Ivory Coast 's self-declared president , Laurent Gbagbo , for the failure of talks so far to resolve the crisis in the cocoa-producing West African nation .

`` Gbagbo has to step down to make way for Ouattara , who legitimately won the election , '' said Odinga 's representative , Salim Lone , speaking for the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States .

An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner of the country 's presidential election in November , but Gbagbo , the incumbent , has refused to step aside .

`` He 's still committed to the African Union and ECOWAS will to first and foremost find a peaceable solution to the crisis . Use of force will be a last resort , '' Lone said .

Gbagbo 's foreign minister , Alcide Djedje , said earlier this month that the peacekeepers are `` complicit with the rebellion '' and that the sitting government has `` no more confidence in the U.N. ''

The West African nation was wracked by civil war from 2002 to 2007 , when a settlement left the country divided between north and south . The 2010 elections came with high expectations that they would open a new chapter in the country 's history .
