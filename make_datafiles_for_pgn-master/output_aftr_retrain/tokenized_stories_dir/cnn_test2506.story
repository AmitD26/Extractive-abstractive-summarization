`` I am sincerely troubled to learn about the circumstances surrounding the Nikki Beach St. Bart 's event that took place on New Year 's Eve 2009 , '' Usher said in a statement Monday . `` I will be donating all of my personal proceeds from that event to various human rights organizations . ''

According to U.S. diplomatic cables posted by WikiLeaks , the Caribbean island was the site for a New Year 's Eve party thrown by Mutassim Gadhafi , Libya 's national security advisor and one of the dictator 's sons . Usher , along with Beyonce , were the entertainment in what the cables called a $ 1 million personal concert .

Beyonce said through a representative last week that she had donated the money she received to earthquake relief in Haiti .

The same Gadhafi son on the same island a year earlier paid $ 1 million to hear Mariah Carey sing on New Year 's Eve 2008 , the cables said . She sang four songs .

Carey added in her statement that she plans to donate proceeds from a new song , `` Save the Day , '' to human rights organizations .

`` Going forward , this is a lesson for all artists to learn from , '' she said . `` We need to be more aware and take more responsibility regardless of who books our shows . Ultimately we as artists are to be held accountable . ''

`` In 2007 , I received 1million $ from the Qaddafi clan to perform a 45 min . Show for guests at a hotel in Italy , '' read a tweet on Furtado 's official account Monday . `` I am going to donate the $ . ''

In 2006 , the Gadhafis brought pop star Lionel Richie to Libya to perform . The concert marked the 20th anniversary of a U.S. raid on the North African country .
