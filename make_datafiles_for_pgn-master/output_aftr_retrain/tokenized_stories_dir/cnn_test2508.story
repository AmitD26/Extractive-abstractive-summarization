The same carriage -- called the 1902 State Landau -- has carried previous royal brides on their wedding days . William 's mother , Lady Diana Spencer , rode in it in 1981 after her marriage to Prince Charles , and Sarah Ferguson traveled in it five years later after she wed Prince Andrew .

It was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 to be used at his coronation , and it remains the most-used carriage in the Royal Mews , usually used these days by Queen Elizabeth II when she meets foreign heads of state .

It is an open-top carriage , so if it rains , the new royal couple will instead travel in the enclosed Glass Coach , another historic carriage , the palace announced .

Riding in the two carriages behind them will be the best man , William 's brother , Prince Harry ; the maid of honor , Middleton 's sister , Philippa ; and the bridesmaids . The queen and her husband will travel in the next carriage , with Prince Charles and his wife , Camilla , and Middleton 's parents riding together in the last .

Eighteen horses will pull the five carriages , with the white-looking Windsor Greys , which are usually reserved for the queen , pulling the newlyweds .

Like everyone working in the palace , Martin has his own particular concern : `` If the wheels fall off , then obviously I would lose my job , so that is a bit of a worry , '' he said .

Martin 's key task on the big day will be `` chocking , '' which means fixing blocks of wood under the carriage wheels , so they do n't move as the passengers get in .

As beautiful as they are , state carriages are n't always an easy way for passengers to travel . As the carriages move along , they swing around in a circular motion , which can make passengers feel queasy .

`` I think she will wish to practice getting in and out of the carriages , because obviously , on the day , she will be wearing a dress with a large train , '' Crown Equerry Toby Browne said . `` And it 's a quite difficult event to get into a carriage and get settled so it looks perfect , but I think she 's very excited about it . ''

Middleton will take a more modern mode of transport to the abbey before the service , the palace announced .

In fact , she plans to travel in the same Rolls-Royce used by Prince Charles and Camilla , the Duchess of Cornwall , when they were attacked by protesters in London in December , Buckingham Palace said .

`` It 's actually designed with visibility in mind , so you actually probably get a better view in the Rolls-Royce that she 's using than a closed carriage , '' Palace Transport Manager Alexander Garty said .
