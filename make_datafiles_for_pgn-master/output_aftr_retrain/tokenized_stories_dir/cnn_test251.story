-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Early this month , Jim O'Neill , the former Goldman Sachs economist who coined the term `` BRICs '' -LRB- Brazil , Russia , India , and China -RRB- , appeared on a weeklong BBC series in which he introduced yet another acronym to describe a new group of emerging economies , the `` MINTs '' -LRB- Mexico , Indonesia , Nigeria and Turkey -RRB- .

The BRICs acronym kindled a lot of interest among investors eager to find the next `` big thing , '' while increasing attention to a group of nations that suffered from ongoing economic crisis during the 1990s .

The BRICs vary considerably in their health and educational outcomes . While Brazil and China have relatively successful public health care systems , Brazil 's educational system lacks adequate resources and has n't succeeded at building a skilled work force , while China 's education system is producing a large number of skilled college graduates . Russia and India 's governments are failing to adequately invest in health and education , the product of a lack of political commitment and inadequate funding .

Because of a decline in exports and industrial production , the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- slashed Mexico 's predicted GDP growth rate from 3.9 % in 2012 to 2.9 in 2013 and 3.2 % in 2014 . In Indonesia , the World Bank projected that economic growth will slow from 5.6 % in 2013 to 5.3 % in 2014 , considerably lower than the 6.2 % average in 2012 .

And just as with the BRIC nations , the MINTs exhibit different political institutions . Mexico and Indonesia are presidential democracies with relatively stable political coalitions . Nigeria is also a presidential democracy challenged by political corruption and ethnic conflict . And Turkey has struggled with corruption and a lack of toleration for dissent .

While Mexico and Turkey have succeeded in extending universal health care coverage for the poor and providing medical services , their education system , as well as Indonesia and Nigeria 's , are weak , leading to a low level of college graduates and a small skilled labor force . Indonesia and Nigeria 's health care systems have also had insufficient resources , doctors and nurses .

Adopting the MINTs acronym could lead us to expect too much , too soon . There 's a lot more to an emerging nation than its economy : if citizens lack good health care and access to quality education , the country is unlikely to realize its potential .

Indeed , even Jim O'Neill admits that it 'll take at least 30 years to see if the MINTs become economic powerhouses .

Therefore , let 's give the MINTs a bit more time to nurture their economies , strengthen their political institutions , and more importantly , invest in their people before we make them models for the rest of the world .
