-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The former leader of Ivory Coast may have to face international charges for alleged crimes committed during his time in office , President Alassane Ouattara announced Wednesday , as he outlined his plans to bring peace and security to his nation .

`` Reconciliation ca n't be done without justice , '' Ouattara said in a news conference at the Golf Hotel , where he was holed up for months in the violent aftermath of the disputed presidential election .

`` All Ivorians are equal in the eyes of the law , no matter their politics , their origin , their religion or their race , '' he said .

Former President Laurent Gbagbo has been moved out of the Golf Hotel , where he was held after his arrest Monday , and is now under guard in a villa elsewhere in the country , Ouattara said .

`` He is safe , and we will treat him with consideration , '' the president said . `` He is under house arrest in a villa .

As for charges against Gbagbo , that will be up to the Ivorian justice minister , Ouattara said , adding that international counts would be determined by an international prosecutor .

The president also vowed that even members of the Republican Forces -- the troops loyal to him -- who were found to have committed crimes would be brought to justice .

`` All the soldiers -- even those in the Republican Forces -- identified as being pillagers will be dealt with , '' the president said , in response to a journalist 's question about reports of Republican Forces troops participating in raids and pillaging in Abidjan .

Human Rights Watch published a scathing report Saturday about abuses perpetrated by pro-Ouattara forces on their offensive to Abidjan .

People interviewed by the monitoring agency `` described how , in village after village , pro-Ouattara forces summarily executed and raped perceived Gbagbo supporters in their homes , as they worked in the fields , as they fled or as they tried to hide in the bush . ''

`` Ouattara should fulfill his public pledge to investigate and prosecute abuses by both sides if CÃ´te d'Ivoire is to emerge from this horrific period , '' said Daniel Bekele , Africa director at Human Rights Watch .

Also under investigation is the massacre in the western Ivorian town of Duekoue , where the International Committee of the Red Cross said 800 people were slaughtered . The United Nations blamed many of the deaths on Ouattara 's forces .

Ouattara said the minister of justice has already begun a probe into those killings , the Human Rights Commission would be sending representatives in the next few days to look into the matter as well , and he has scheduled a meeting with the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court .

`` I condemn this massacre , '' Ouattara said Wednesday . `` The people responsible for these killings , whoever they are , will be judged . ''

`` I am revolted , indignant at the number of dead , '' he added .

`` Women and girls are being brutally raped by armed men , often in front of their family members , '' said Liz Pender , an IRC women 's protection expert , who has been meeting with groups of Ivorian women and girls who fled to Liberia in recent weeks to escape the violence in their homeland . `` One woman told me she was forced to watch as several men took turns raping her sister , sometimes with a stick , and that she did n't survive the attack . ''

The refugee women who took part in Pender 's group discussions said fear of rape or sexual slavery were the primary reasons they fled to Liberia , according to the IRC statement . It provided no details on the identities or political ties of the armed men carrying out the assaults .

He 's also demanded that the militia members and mercenaries who worked for the former leader surrender their arms immediately .

Chief among his challenges , said longtime observers , will be to unite the severely divided nation and ensure justice for those who committed grave human rights violations in the nation 's political vacuum -- including those in his own camp who stand accused of heinous acts .

Most of the blame for the bloodshed rests squarely on the shoulders of Gbagbo , whose refusal to cede power plunged Ivory Coast into crisis , said Jendayi Frazer of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for African Affairs under former President George W. Bush .

The International Criminal Court in The Hague , Netherlands , is now poised to investigate alleged war crimes instigated by Gbagbo .

Ouattara will have to delicately balance such a probe with reconciliation . After all , said expert Alex Vines , Ouattara did not win in a landslide .

Gbagbo won 45.9 percent of the vote and as such , Ouattara will have to reach out to his rival 's supporters , perhaps even welcome them into his government without jeopardizing justice , said Vines , head of the Africa program at the British think tank Chatham House .

Though he emerged in the Western media as the good versus Gbagbo 's evil , Ouattara , too , has been accused of having blood on his hands .

In the United States , Ouattara 's critics questioned his right to rule .

Such a probe could answer questions about what amount of control Ouattara exerted over the forces fighting under his name and whether he deliberately failed to stop them , Robertson said .

He hailed from northern lands dominated by Muslim immigrants who came to work in Ivory Coast and eventually grew into influential businessmen and traders .

The U.S.-educated Ouattara quit his International Monetary Fund job to run for president in 2000 and might have met Gbagbo on the ballot then , except that he was marked as an outsider -- his mother was from Burkina Faso -- and barred from participating in the election .

Vines said the rebels who fought in the 2002 civil war , the Force Nouvelles , formed a large part of the pro-Ouattara forces fighting Gbagbo 's troops in the latest crisis .

The United Nations has repeatedly cited the armed group for breaking the arms embargo imposed on Ivory Coast , and human rights groups have sounded alarms about its abuses .

`` After that it gets gray and in the last few weeks , it 's gotten very opaque indeed , '' he said about the recent spate of killings , especially the massacre in Duekoue .
