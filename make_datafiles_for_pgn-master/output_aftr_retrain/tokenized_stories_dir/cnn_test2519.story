Casablanca , Morocco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A few thousand people turned out Sunday to protest in Morocco , saying the king 's proposed constitutional reforms do n't go far enough .

Though many expressed support for their king to stay in power , demonstrators argued that a network of privilege and patronage surrounding him must end , and that he must part with more power than he has proposed .

In calling for the protests on Saturday , a member of the Rabat wing said participants are seeking `` a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy . ''

`` The plan as proposed by the king yesterday does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers , '' the organizer said Saturday .

The revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable , the parliament in Rabat more dynamic and will give the government greater powers , the 47-year-old king said in a nationally televised address .

The reform movement has called for the creation of a parliamentary monarchy , an end to the influence of the king 's inner circle and for a crackdown on corrupt officials . Spain and Britain are examples of a parliamentary monarchy .

In his 30-minute speech Friday , the sovereign described the draft constitution as `` a bedrock of the special Moroccan democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people , '' while describing himself as a `` citizen king . ''

`` It specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches , '' the king said .

Friday 's speech stems from a process that was first announced in March , after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt .

The king instructed a hand-picked committee to consult with political parties , trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch 's political powers and make the judiciary independent . But not all civil society groups were consulted , which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan .

Confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members , the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members .

But King Mohammed will remain a key power broker in the security , military and religious fields , according to the draft . For example , the king would still serve as `` the supreme commander of the armed forces '' and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution . Furthermore , the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court , half of whose members he would have appointed .
