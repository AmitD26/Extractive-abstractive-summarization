Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website 's biggest redesign so far , and only a fraction of the website 's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue .

If you use Facebook , chances are you 're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month -LRB- full disclosure : Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app -RRB- . Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebook 's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week .

So what 's the big change ? Facebook will be switching profile pages , perhaps optionally at first , to a new format called `` Facebook Timeline . '' I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format . I 'm someone who thrives on trying new things , but this change was radical even for me . Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back , so I stuck with it for a few days .

I 'm so glad I did : Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made .

Here 's what 'll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched : Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two , with boxes of text , photos , videos and even maps of your favorite locations . Rather than just displaying your most recent activities , your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life , all the way back to your birth . Facebook will become a record of your existence : All your memories , your victories and your defeats , your loves , your losses and everything in between .

You 'll be shocked , as I was , when this change is made . Suddenly your life is laid out before you , the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebook 's algorithms . You 'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now , and where all your most recent updates went .

You 'll add a big , new `` Cover photo '' to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline , choosing to feature your happiest memories , hide the inconsequential ones , and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments . And you 'll realize , as I did , that Facebook knows you better than you know yourself .

So yes , you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks . Then , like me , you 'll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you did n't even recognize it at first : A meaningful social network . And like any other groundbreaking technology -- the PC , the smartphone , the iPad -- you 'll wonder why life was n't always this way , and how you got by without it .
