It 's so predictable , it 's almost laughable . Almost . That is , it would be if it were n't for the fact that there are real-world consequences for these brazen , ratings-boosting publicity ploys .

Hollywood loves to defend teen sex story lines by insisting , `` Kids are having sex ! We 're reflecting the real world ! '' But the truth is much more sobering and complicated .

Teens are also aware that television influences their behavior . According to one survey , a third of youths age 12 and older say the media encourages them to have sex by making it seem like `` everybody does it . '' And why should n't they get that impression ?

Beyond making teen sex the norm , researchers have found heavy television viewing to be predictive of positive attitudes toward `` recreational '' or casual sex and negative attitudes toward remaining a virgin . Studies have also found the more a teenager identifies with the characters they see on prime time TV shows , the more likely they are to be sexually experienced and to expect higher levels of sexual activity among their peers .

At least half a dozen studies in the past few years have documented a strong correlation between exposure to adult media content as children and the early onset of sexual activity among teens . One study even found that viewing of sexual media content was predictive of teen pregnancy .

If history is a predictor of future behavior , we can expect this trend to continue . A season or two into Murphy 's show `` Nip/Tuck '' on the FX network , he was interviewed for a Bravo network documentary about breaking sexual taboos on television . Murphy stated , `` It 's tough to get that sexual point of view across on television . Hopefully I have made it possible for somebody on broadcast television to do a rear-entry scene in three years . Maybe that will be my legacy . ''

This , ladies and gentlemen , is the self-styled sex-ed teacher to America 's teens . The worst thing parents can do is step aside and let Hollywood do the teaching .

The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Henson .
