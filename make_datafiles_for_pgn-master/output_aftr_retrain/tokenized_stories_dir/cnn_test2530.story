In particular , the Reform Party 's rise split the so-called conservative vote in Canada , helping the Liberal Party win three straight elections to stay in power for 13 years .

Only when Canada 's conservatives came together under one banner , as the Conservative Party of Canada , did they wield the coast-to-coast clout to win enough seats in Parliament to take over the prime minister 's office .

Canada 's parliamentary system differs from the U.S. system , with the party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons forming the government . Political labels such as conservative and liberal do n't always mean exactly the same thing in the two countries .

Still , a look at the Reform Party 's history and influence on the Canadian political system reveals some parallels with the relatively new Tea Party movement south of the border .

The latest could be Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski , who trailed her Tea Party-backed but little-known opponent , Joe Miller , in the Republican primary held Tuesday . Miller led by a hairsbreadth when polls closed , but there are thousands of absentee ballots left to be counted , and the race might not be decided until next week .

`` I 'm very proud of my association with the Tea Party , '' said Marco Rubio , a former Florida state representative who won Tuesday 's Republican Senate primary vote . `` But people misunderstand what the Tea Party movement is in America . It is not a centralized organization or a political party . It 's the sentiment of everyday Americans who think that Washington has it wrong -- they 're taking our country in the wrong direction . And they are looking for voices in American politics that will stand up to that and offer a clear alternative . ''

However , an inherent social conservatism in the Tea Party movement has exposed rifts with more moderate Republicans , much to the delight of Democrats .

A main Tea Party spokesman , Mark Williams , was ousted last month after a controversial blog post about the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , Abraham Lincoln , and the emancipation of the slaves . He resigned , but defended his remarks as satire .

Tea Party protesters outside the U.S. Capitol were accused of using racist and anti-gay epithets against African-American and gay Democrats in March , and spitting on an African-American congressman .

Republican House leaders criticized the alleged incident but said it was an isolated case , and Andrew Langer , one of the organizers of the protest over health care reform , said his `` Institute for Liberty roundly condemns the isolated incidents of intolerance that occurred . ... As a core value , the Tea Party movement believes in the precept upon which our independence was declared and this nation was founded : that all men are created equal . ''

In Canada , Manning 's Reform Party faced similar challenges in the 1990s as he tried to unite it with the Progressive Conservative Party , the traditional home of fiscal conservatives .

Led by Manning , a politician 's son known as a shrewd pragmatist , the Canadian reformers emerged from the Western provinces in the 1980s as a protest movement against the federal government back east in Ottawa , Ontario .

However , Manning 's efforts to expand the party 's support were stymied by a diversity of interests and agendas within its base that ranged from political moderation to extremist vitriol .

In particular , issues such as gay rights and immigration caused public rifts among Reform Party members of Parliament .

In the 1997 election , the Reform Party finished second overall to become the official opposition party in Parliament , but failed to grow beyond its Western roots .

Manning realized it would never win control of Parliament , and therefore the prime minister 's office , without gaining support in Eastern provinces , particularly populous Ontario .

He launched an ambitious campaign to merge with the Progressive Conservatives , in a process that took years and left him on the sidelines when it finally occurred .

The effort led to creation of the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance in 2000 , with Manning defeated by Alberta provincial official Stockwell Day for the group 's leadership .

Day 's fundamentalist Christian beliefs and lack of national political experience proved costly , and the Alliance -- caught off guard by a snap election called by the Liberals -- gained only six more seats in the next national election .

Only when a formal merger of the Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance occurred -- creating the Conservative Party of Canada -- did it achieve Manning 's goal of gaining significant support in the East .

The new Conservative Party forced the Liberals to form a minority government in 2004 , and then defeated the Liberals to form its own minority government in 2006 . Stephen Harper , a one-time Reform legislator who left the party in 1997 , became prime minister .

The idea was to use the democratic process `` to get people to disagree civilly , '' he said .

Could a similar process occur in the United States , driven by the Tea Party movement ?

Manning sounded skeptical . `` These people are trying to build a coalition in a political culture that tends to favor polarization , '' he said . `` That does make it difficult , because people want to go to their corners rather than come together in the center of the ring . ''
