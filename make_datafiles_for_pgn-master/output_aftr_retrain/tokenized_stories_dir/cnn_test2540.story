The subcontinent 's inaugural Grand Prix comes barely a year after India earned international scorn for all the chaos and corruption allegations that plagued the 2010 Commonwealth Games staged in New Delhi .

That event was marred by a host of problems including athletes ' alarm over the shoddy construction and condition of their quarters , while a pedestrian bridge leading to the main Jawarhalal Nehru Stadium collapsed two days before the competitors were due to arrive .

In April this year , India 's federal police arrested the Games ' chief organizer , Suresh Kalmadi , for suspected corruption .

Kalmadi , who was involved in bringing F1 to India through his former role at the Indian Olympic Association , was jailed for allegedly buying a time , scoring and result system from a Swiss company at inflated costs . He was also suspended by the political party with which he was an MP .

A few weeks ago , a fleet of Mercedes-Benz cars whizzed media crews around the 5.125-kilometer circuit , giving them a glimpse of what Indian businesses lauded as a stirring example of their competence .

`` Corporate India is completely capable , and they are capable of executing projects of world class , which has been demonstrated by the F1 track , which looks certainly as one of the best in the world , '' said Ajay Sharma , a senior director with the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India .

`` The contrast between the rich and the poor is very large in India , '' said Arun Kumar , a professor at the Center of Economic Studies and Planning at New Delhi 's Jawaharlal Nehru University .

`` Here , about 40 % of our people live in extreme poverty without even basic facilities . In a sense , it sounds very cruel that the nation is spending a large amount of its wealth on such sports . ''

Critics are questioning the taste of putting up such high-octane shows in a country where a quarter of its billion-plus people still lives on less than a dollar a day .

With organizers struggling to sell out the event , ticket prices for Sunday 's race have already been slashed . The most expensive has dropped from $ 715 to about $ 300 , and the cheapest from about $ 120 to $ 60 . But even the lowest amount is equivalent to the monthly wages of tens of thousands of Indians .

`` And the ruling elite in the country is backing such displays , which shows it 's becoming more callous . ''

`` I do n't think we Indians are much into Formula racing , '' admits Jai Sethi , a New Delhi resident .

`` And I guess how the race is being done , who wins it , what the rules are and who the teams are have to be known to the Indian public . I 'm talking of the masses , not just the elite . ''
