Seattle , Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Instead of the traditional bad guys , it was the costumed , self-styled superhero that ended up behind bars after an altercation Sunday in Seattle .

According to the statement , a group of men and women were leaving a downtown Seattle club at 2:32 a.m. Sunday and `` were dancing and having a good time '' when an `` unknown adult male suspect came up from behind and pepper sprayed the group , '' the statement said .

`` He inserted himself and sprayed them with pepper spray , '' Seattle Police spokesman Mark Jamieson told CNN . Jones was arrested and charged with four counts of assault , Jamieson said .

On a video released by Jones of the incident that led to his arrest , Jones is heard telling the film crew to call 911 , then rushes into a crowd of people who appear to be engaged in an altercation .

A spokesman for Jones said he had no recourse but to get involved . `` The fight was a huge group of people against a smaller group , '' said Peter Tangen . `` It was an unfair fight , he went there to break it up . ''

A chaotic scene unfolds on the 13-minute video after Jones runs toward a man and woman who appear to be fighting . The man walks away and the woman then tries to hit Jones with her purse but instead falls onto the street .

`` What is this , Halloween ? '' another woman calls out to rubber-suited Jones .

Eventually Jones is seen spraying several of the individuals with what appears to be a can of pepper spray .

Tangen asked CNN and other media not publish Jones ' real name , which is listed in his police booking . `` His family is at risk of retaliation from criminals , '' he said . Many , but not all , news outlets were going along with the request .

Tangen said Jones was shoved but was not seriously hurt and plans to keep fighting crime despite his run-in with police .
