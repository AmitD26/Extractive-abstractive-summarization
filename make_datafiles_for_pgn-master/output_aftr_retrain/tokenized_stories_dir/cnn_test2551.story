`` He 's not going to go , '' Cheyenne , Wyoming , attorney Robert Moxley said of his client , Joseph Ozment .

On Thursday , the Mississippi Supreme Court will hear arguments brought by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood challenging the legality of scores of pardons issued by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour .

Ozment was one of four men convicted of murder who were pardoned by Barbour in January and released from state custody . The four had been working as `` trusties '' at the governor 's mansion .

Ozment 's whereabouts were unknown after his release until he was located last week in Laramie , Wyoming , and served with papers telling him to appear in court in Mississippi .

Hood 's office said last week that if Ozment does not comply , a judge has the authority to hold him in contempt .

But CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin had a different opinion on the case as a civil -- not criminal -- matter at this point .

`` He -LRB- Ozment -RRB- probably safely could ignore that piece of paper , '' Toobin said last week on CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 . ''

But if the attorney general succeeds in having the pardons declared invalid , `` his -LRB- Ozment 's -RRB- pardon is no longer valid . Then , the attorney general can get an arrest warrant and -- if -LRB- the attorney general -RRB- can find him at that point -- bring him back . ''

Ozment entered a plea to avoid the death penalty , admitting that he entered the convenience store and after one of his accomplices shot the clerk , Ricky Montgomery , three times , Ozment walked up to Montgomery , who was crawling from behind the store counter , and shot him twice in the head .

Ozment said that he did that so that the clerk could not later identify him .

The Mississippi Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling on whether the pardons can even be challenged . If the court rules against the pardoned criminals , a lower court would be asked to hold hearings on each individual case .

Last week , at a news conference , Attorney General Hood said that if the court finds in his favor , he will have Ozment arrested `` as soon as we can lay hands on him . ''

`` We 'll see what kind of man he is , '' Hood said .
