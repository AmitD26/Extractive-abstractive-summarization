HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The `` humanitarian situation remains serious '' in Zimbabwe amid cholera , starvation and a continuing economic crisis , a United Nations official said Wednesday at a World Humanitarian Day ceremony in Harare .

`` Although Zimbabwe is not facing armed conflict , humanitarian threats such as food shortages and outbreak of diseases such as cholera pose a significant challenge , '' said Agostinho Zacarias , U.N. Development Programme representative in the country . `` The recent -LSB- cholera -RSB- epidemic resulted in 98,592 cumulative cases , including 4,288 deaths between August 2008 and July 2009 . ''

Zimbabwe 's humanitarian situation was worsened by its economic collapse last year . The nation 's coalition government , formed six months ago by former political enemies President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , is seeking more than $ 8 billion to aid its recovery .

A U.N. appeal launched earlier this year has so far raised only 44 percent of its goal of $ 718 million for humanitarian assistance .

But Rueben Marumahoko , a Zimbabwe junior minister and an appointee of Mugabe , said the country is no longer in crisis .

`` There is need for Zimbabwe to move from the humanitarian support stage to the recovery stage , '' he said . `` Zimbabwe is no longer a country in crisis but a country in recovery . '' The comment drew laughter from many journalists covering the event .

Among the nation 's problems is a strike by doctors that is almost a month old . The doctors are demanding housing and car allowances and a monthly salary of $ 1,000 -LSB- U.S. -RSB- -- a sharp rise from the current $ 170 a month paid to all public servants .
