Sure , the movie star charm and warmth is there , but when Owen sits down with a group of reporters , it 's as a father who knows terror .

After being introduced to American audiences in 2000 with `` Croupier , '' Owen has carved out a career in films portraying an intense , if disheveled , man of thought and action in `` Children of Men , '' `` Closer '' and `` Inside Man . '' He 's also shown the ability to be a little less thoughtful with fun , ultraviolent flicks `` Shoot 'Em Up '' and `` Sin City . ''

Along with the online sexual predator film `` Trust '' -- and to some degree the single-parent drama `` The Boys Are Back '' -- `` Intruders '' seems to mark a new chapter of Owen 's career playing fathers who often feel powerless .

Owen sat down with CNN to discuss his portrayal as a father and his own real-life experience as one . He also talks about what terrified him as a child and as an adult , and the power of secrets in families .

CNN : Why do audiences respond to seeing children terrified ?

Clive Owen : Because we remember being terrified , probably . ... Bad dreams and nightmares , when you 're very young , are very intense experiences . I remember it , and I 've seen it in my own children . I think , over time , you learn to process it , and you wake up very quickly and can figure out what 's real and what is n't real . But for a child , it can really throw you off center .

CNN : How important do you think family secrets are ?

CNN : What scared you as a kid ? What scares you now ?

CNN : As opposed to roles where your body has taken a beating , does this kind of psychological role beat up your mind at all when the threat is from within ?

CNN : Can you talk a little bit about how your character growing up has unresolved issues with his mother that affected his parenting skills when he became an adult ?

Owen : Only good things !

CNN : When you 're dealing with a child actor like Ella in these very intense scenes , do you ever have to step aside with her and just check in on her to see if she 's OK ?

It 's usually important that they feel safe before you begin , especially if you want to push it into areas that are uncomfortable , which is an interesting and good thing to do . But the child needs to feel safe and that everything 's OK . ... I actually really love working with young actors because I think they are so responsive and instinctive . And it 's much less honed a craft they 're employing , but it 's very real and reactive .

Owen : No . I am filming a comedy , which is very exciting actually . It 's the first one that I 'll do really . I really like it . It really makes me laugh . So , I 'm excited about that but that 's not for a while , yet .

I think I just instinctively respond to material and , at the end of the day , you look at it , and that kind of shapes a career . There 's no question that `` Trust , '' `` The Boys Are Back , '' and this film are obviously are related because I 'm a parent . I 'm a parent of two girls . There are things within that that I thought , ` this is really interesting to explore ' ... to do it in a very truthful way is something very exciting to discover .

Owen : I think it 's a really well-directed movie . Not just a horror movie , but a movie . I just thought it was extremely well-acted , and it still holds up today . It 's disturbing . My 12-year-old daughter has heard about it and says , ` Dad , I want to watch `` The Exorcist '' . ' Sweetheart , you 're not watching that for 10 years . Do n't even think about it . I had it in the house and got rid of it because I 'm paranoid that she was going to think , ` I 'll just have a little look , ' and get traumatized for the next four years .
