Take time to wander through Brussels ' other excellent museums . The Ancient Art Museum , featuring Flemish and Belgian art , has a dazzling collection of masterpieces by Van der Weyden , Breughel , Bosch and Rubens . The Museum of Modern Art next door also makes for an enjoyable stroll .

Brussels has its silliness , too . Its mascot is the Manneken-Pis , a fountain statue of a little boy who lives up to his name . You 'll find him three blocks off La Grand Place , possibly wearing some clever outfit . By tradition , countries send him costumes from around the world . Cases full of these are on display in the City Museum on La Grand Place .

Do n't call fried potatoes `` French fries . '' Belgian fries -LRB- `` frites '' -RRB- taste so good because they 're deep-fried twice -- once to cook , and once to brown . The locals dunk them in mayonnaise , especially delicious if the mayo is flavored with garlic .

To get a budget hotel deal , visit in peak season without a reservation , when the city 's fancy business-class hotels rent rooms for half-price . Normal hotel prices are high , but if you arrive in July , August or on a Friday or Saturday night any other time , three-star hotels abound with amazing summer rates -- you can rent a double room with enough comforts to keep a diplomat happy , including a fancy breakfast , for about $ 85 .

Go through the tourist information office to get the best price . If you 're nervous about traveling without advance reservations , contact the tourist office by email -LRB- info@visitflanders.be -RRB- and ask which business-class hotels will have special rates during your visit .

Bone up on bonjour and s ` il vous plait . Brussels speaks French . Though the city -LRB- and country -RRB- is officially bilingual and filled with foreign visitors , 80 percent of the locals speak French first and English second , if at all .

While the Belgians debate their unity , Brussels is the administrative center of the European Union . It hosts business people from around the world -- only Washington , D.C. , has more lobbyists . When Europeans have a gripe , this is where they demonstrate . The European Parliament , a towering complex of glass skyscrapers , has 785 members representing 28 countries and more than 450 million citizens . Take the audioguide tour . It 's exciting just to be here -- a mouse in the corner of a place that aspires to chart the future of Europe .

Brussels is one of Europe 's great secrets . A trade boom 500 years ago left this city with striking art and stately architecture . And it 's once again a trade and cultural center of Europe .
