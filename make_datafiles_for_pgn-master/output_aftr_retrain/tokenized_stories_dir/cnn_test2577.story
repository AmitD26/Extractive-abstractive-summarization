Fabian Zanzi , who said he was assigned to be Travolta 's personal attendant , accused the actor of `` harmful and offensive contact '' by `` removing his bath robe , grabbing plaintiff 's hand , and forcing his naked person and erect penis against plaintiff 's person , '' the complaint said .

Another lawsuit , filed by two male massage therapists in April , accused Travolta of sexual assault at hotels in Los Angeles and Atlanta . Those plaintiffs withdrew their suit after firing their lawyer and hiring Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred to handle their case . Allred said at the time she was considering refiling their complaints in another court .

Zanzi 's suit , filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , claims the sexual assault happened on board the Royal Caribbean Cruise ship Enchantment of the Sea in June 2009 .

`` Travolta proceeded to forcefully embrace plaintiff , '' it said , `` causing plaintiff to continue to experience pain , shock , embarrassment , distress and fear . ''

When Zanzi asked to be released from the embrace , `` Travolta maintained a hard and painful grasp on plaintiff 's hands , '' the suit said .

Travolta offered Zanzi $ 12,000 for his `` discretion and silence , '' telling him to return to the suite later that night to collect the money , the suit said .

Instead , Zanzi -- `` in a state of pain , shock , embarrassment , distress and fear '' -- immediately reported the incident the the ship 's director , human resources manager and a staff captain , the suit said .

The human resources manager told him to fill out a report , but she `` refused to allow plaintiff to write down any information regarding the nudity and/or sexual contact '' with Travolta , the suit said .

She told him `` unless he was bleeding and bruised , he did not suffer any injuries and thus could not obtain treatment or any other type of attention , '' it said .

Instead of taking action against Travolta , the cruise line ordered Zanzi `` restrained '' in `` a segregated room '' for five days , until Travolta was off the ship , the suit said .

Travolta 's lawyer said the actor is confident he will `` prevail on the merits and that he will be completely vindicated in court . ''

`` The lawsuit 's ridiculous claims are completely contradicted by what Mr. Zanzi told his employer back in 2009 when he was being disciplined for his own violations of company policy , '' Singer said . `` In his handwritten report three years ago , the only physical contact he claimed occurred was allegedly touching my client 's neck . The inappropriate conduct he alleges in his lawsuit is absent from his written report he submitted at the time . That glaring omission speaks volumes . ''

The fact that Zanzi continued to work for the cruise line for years after `` his employer supposedly restrained him in a room on the cruise ship for five days '' calls his credibility into question , Singer said .

Zanzi told his story in tabloid reports published in May , soon after the suit was filed by the two massage therapists .
