-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 1 Rory McIlroy lost his cool in the midst of a heatwave at the BMW PGA Championship as Luke Donald stepped up his challenge to usurp the 2011 U.S. Open champion at the top of the rankings .

McIlroy , from Northern Ireland , struggled to a two-over-par round of 74 on the opening day at the Wentworth course while Donald , the defending champion , sits within striking distance of the leaders on four-under .

Scotland 's David Drysdale and Ireland 's Peter Lawrie lead on six-under after day one with England 's Justin Rose and Alavaro Quiros , from Spain , in a group of five players one shot back .

McIlroy 's round included a run of four bogeys in five holes and at one stage he hurled a club to the floor in frustration after a poor shot .

`` It 's a bit of deja vu from last year , '' he told reporters . `` I kept getting off to good starts and sort of making a few bogeys around the turn and not getting any momentum back .

`` Two under through seven , feel like I 'm playing well , then I make four bogeys in five holes . It 's pretty disappointing and I feel like I 'm playing pretty well , I just need to go out there and shoot a score . ''

`` I was aware of it and asked for it to be looked at . The rules are there for everybody 's protection . ''

Former world No. 1 Lee Westwood , who was beaten by Donald in a playoff at last year 's tournament , birdied the last to finish two-under .
