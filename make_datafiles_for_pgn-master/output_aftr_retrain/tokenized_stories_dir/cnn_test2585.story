`` I 'm , like , 60 % there , '' she says about her use of organic products . `` I would say I 'm in the middle , because there are still lots of moms who just do n't care . ''

As a surrogate mother , she 's carrying fetuses formed by her brother 's sperm and her sister-in-law 's egg .

CNN 's `` Sanjay Gupta , MD '' is profiling the legal and emotional issues surrounding Burke 's surogate pregnancy .

Burke 's interest in natural and organic products began when she was expecting her first child and read the best-selling pregnancy book `` What To Expect When You 're Expecting . ''

Some passages suggest that chemicals and pesticides in our food and cosmetics , although legal , may nonetheless be causing harm .

Burke wanted to know more .

`` I would just Google and hope for the best . I 'd just keep going and going until I saw enough evidence that to me said , just avoid it . Just do n't put that in your body , '' she says .

Lucich was overjoyed .

Surrogate sisters : The ultimate gift

The FDA says common chemicals like BPA , phthalates and pesticides are safe , but research shows they pass from mother to child , and may be neurotoxins in the womb .

So Burke is like her own regulatory agency , learning as much as possible about the safety of every product on the shelf . She says she does n't want to take any risks .

Artificial food colorings linked to ADHD in children have been banned from Burke 's home . She stores food in glass containers , not plastic .

Burke brushes with Tom 's of Maine toothpaste , she does laundry with Seventh Generation detergent and she loves `` Organic wear '' makeup by Physicians Formula .

Ken Cook , president of the Environmental Working Group , says Burke is smart to be proactive .

`` We 've come to understand that if you take some reasonable steps you can dramatically reduce your exposure to a lot of different chemicals , '' says Cook .

With the joy of surrogacy comes the burden of responsibility for Burke .

If anything goes wrong with her pregnancy , she says she could n't help asking herself , `` What did I do ? ''

She felt good about buying BPA-free sippy cups for her toddler until she came across an article explaining that manufacturers can replace the BPA in plastic with similar chemicals like Bisphenol-S , and still label their product `` BPA-free '' .

She found a statement saying , `` We continue to work diligently with our vendors and supply partners to find a can lining without BPA . We are also exploring other package solutions . ''

`` Boooo , '' Burke says . `` It never crossed my mind . Why would there be BPA in cans ? ''

`` Eating less canned food , which comes as a surprise to a lot of people , is an important first step , '' he says .

`` People are beginning to understand that the environment is not something that 's just external to us ; it 's not polar bears and wilderness and ice floes in the Arctic or forests . It 's something we metabolize day in and day out . ''
