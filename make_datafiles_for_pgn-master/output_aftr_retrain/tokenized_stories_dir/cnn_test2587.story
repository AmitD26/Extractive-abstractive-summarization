`` The great lie has been laid bare . The truth has been brought home at last , '' the republican political party Sinn Fein said in a statement Sunday .

Sinn Fein seeks for Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland , rather than the United Kingdom .

In June , the British government released a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings .

The paratroopers who killed 14 people had no reason to believe they were under threat from the victims , gave no warnings before firing and lied to the far-reaching official inquiry into the seminal event , the inquiry concluded .

Its report was a comprehensive rejection of the British government 's official account of the killings , which had stood for 38 years .

`` Some members of our armed forces acted wrongly ... and for that , on behalf of the government -- indeed , on behalf of our country -- I am deeply sorry , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said after the release of the long-awaited report .

Bloody Sunday took place in the single bloodiest year of a conflict that claimed about 3,000 lives over a three-decade period known locally as The Troubles .

The killings strengthened the Provisional Irish Republican Army , increased Irish Catholic hostility towards the British army and `` exacerbated the violent conflict of the years that followed , '' its report found .

British troops fired more than 100 rounds on Bloody Sunday , in violation of orders issued to every soldier serving in Northern Ireland at the time , the report found .

CNN 's Richard Allen Greene , Phil Black and Melissa Gray contributed to this report .
