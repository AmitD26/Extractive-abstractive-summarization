Anton Caluori , 31 , was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way , a Seattle , Washington , suburb , Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit .

Caluori is charged with making threats against the president and assaulting a federal officer , according to the affidavit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Seattle .

Molnar wrote that the e-mail , received by the FBI earlier Tuesday , said , `` I will kill the president !!!!! '' and `` You ca n't afford to call my bluff . ''

The message said that dying `` is n't frightening ... it 's peaceful ... you will see ... '' and spoke of a `` cop killing spree ... just over the hill , '' Molnar said . The e-mail included an address and challenged authorities to `` come and get me . ''

`` Caluori was wearing a black bandoleer filled with 12-gauge shotgun shells around his torso . Attached to the bandoleer at chest level was a large black fixed-blade knife . On his ankle , Caluori was weaving a revolver in an ankle holster . Caluori 's right hand was placed out-of-view behind his back , '' the affidavit said .

At first he did n't comply . But then he `` moved his right hand from behind his back revealing a stockless black pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip , '' the affidavit said .

After he raised the firearm , the officers scuffled with Caluori .

The shotgun Caluori pointed was `` loaded to capacity , including a round in the chamber . The safety was not engaged , '' the affidavit said .

The pistol on his ankle was loaded with `` five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds , '' it said , and about 50 12-gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer .

Caluori 's mother , identified as R.B. in the affidavit , said Caluori `` spends a lot of time on the computer '' but she `` does not know what he does on it . ''

According to the affidavit , R.B. said Caluori has `` negative views of President Obama and in the last few days , most recently that day , has made negative statements about the president . ''

After reading Caluori his Miranda rights , Molnar asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene .

`` I think I do , but I do n't want to say it , '' he said .

Asked if he had any `` issues with the president , '' Caluori replied , `` You do n't have a high enough security clearance . Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command , '' Molnar said .

`` The United States Secret Service takes all threats against its protectees seriously . This situation is indicative of how a routine investigation can very easily turn violent , '' said James Helminski , special agent in charge of U.S. Secret Service in Seattle . `` We appreciate the professionalism of the Federal Way Police Department in defusing this potentially volatile situation and in the ongoing investigation . ''

Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac , Washington . A detention hearing has been set for Monday , the U.S. attorney 's office said .
