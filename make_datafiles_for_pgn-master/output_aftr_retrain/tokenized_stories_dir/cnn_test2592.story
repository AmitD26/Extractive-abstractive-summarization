Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We were somewhere down South in the back half of October 1996 . I believe we were in a theater . I remember thinking how terrible the lighting was , how small and deflated the crowd .

I remember the look on the candidate 's face .

Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole was on stage with Heather Whitestone , the first deaf Miss America . She signed , `` I love you '' to the crowd . Then he signed it , too .

They said what they were supposed to say , but there was something wordless encapsulated in that moment .

I remember for the first time thinking , `` Dole knows he 's going to lose . ''

I have covered campaigns since 1984 . It is the losing ones I remember most .

As it turns out , late October is about when Dole and company knew the game was lost but not over . One top aide tells stories of a dispirited Dole who said during a West Coast swing that he was done and wanted to go home . The source says Dole was eventually persuaded to keep moving with a nonstop , cross-country trek to gin up some campaign excitement and try to help down-ballot Republicans .

But a senior Dole strategist told me this week that it was the candidate 's idea to lead this last hurrah .

` Kinda says it all about the man '

`` We knew we were going to lose ... and Dole came up with the selfless idea to do the 96-hour fly-around and to help save the Congress . Kinda says it all about the man . ''

We flew crazily around the country , visited bowling alleys and diners in the dead of night , Dairy Queens and factories by day , interrupted by `` hygiene stops '' at various hotels . It all led to a final sentimental stop in Dole 's hometown of Russell , Kansas , where he voted on Election Day .

The Senate and House stayed in Republican hands . It was perhaps some solace for Dole , who exited the political scene on November 5 , 1996 . He opened his Election Night speech in typically wry , painfully truthful fashion : `` I was thinking on the way down in the elevator -- tomorrow will be the first time in my life I do n't have anything to do . ''

`` With the ' -LRB- on the -RRB- right track ' number in the country dropping to 6 % and the stock market diving , we were the incumbent party . The blame would default to the Republicans . We knew at that point it was not survivable . ''

`` I never said anything to him , '' Schmidt says , `` and he never said anything to me , but everyone was reality-based . ''

However long a candidate or his staff has to prepare mentally for defeat , it is still a blow of surprising proportions . Those who have been through it liken it to having a terminally ill loved one -- you know what 's coming , but it does n't help .

Opinion : What 's really at stake in election 2012

Schmidt describes Election Night with McCain like this : `` When you are at that moment in the suite ` we lost Ohio . We lost North Carolina . ' You know it 's over . We lost . It 's so hard . ''

If there is something worse than campaigning for weeks without hope , it may be losing in overtime .

Politics : If Romney wins ...

Elated by early exit polling on Election Night , Camp Kerry was both stunned and devastated . But the candidate insisted he did n't want to drag things out since there was no chance of winning : He ended his campaign at Faneuil Hall in Boston just hours after a meeting of close aides .

`` I 'm sorry , '' he told the crowd , `` that we got here a little bit late and a little bit short . ''

Politics : If Obama wins ...

Coulda , shoulda , wouldas and a world of hurt

One source in a losing campaign called the concession speech `` the highest point of acting , but the lowest point of sincerity . ''

In saluting Dole , Gore , Kerry and McCain , Schmidt explains , `` You have people who were all senators deeply rooted in the best aspects of that institution , duty-bound to play their part in ensuring a smooth and peaceful transition of power . ''

Think about it -- the first person who addresses the winner as Mr. President-elect is the loser . It is the loser who offers the first legitimization of the election with a concession speech , beginning a series of events that ends in the swearing-in of a president in January .
