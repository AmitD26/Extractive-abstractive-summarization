Athens , Greece -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed solidarity with Greece Tuesday on a trip to Athens , even as tens of thousands of Greeks rallied to show their anger toward her over the hardship their country is suffering .

Police estimated that as many as 25,000 people turned out to demonstrate in central Athens , despite a ban on protests in certain areas amid beefed-up security for Merkel 's six-hour stay .

Merkel , who was making her first visit to Athens in several years , spoke of Greece as a partner and a friend to Germany as she addressed reporters with Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras .

`` Germany and Greece are going to work very closely together , '' she added , as fellow members of Europe and the euro single currency .

Thousands protest austerity measures in Greece

`` The Greeks are proud and they know how to show support for their friends , and we welcome a friend here today , '' Samaras said of Merkel .

Greece would show those speculators who had wagered on its collapse and exit from the eurozone that they were wrong , he said .

`` They have nearly exhausted how much they can take . And of course we need to think of measures that will give hope to these people that are suffering , '' he said .

The crowds of protesters who gathered in Syntagma Square , by the Greek parliament building , had largely dispersed by Tuesday evening . Earlier , a number of people were arrested after objects were thrown at riot police .

Many protesters , some of whom belong to labor unions and Syriza , the radical-left opposition party , carried anti-Merkel banners .

Before her visit , Merkel told CNN she knows the austerity measures have been hard on some .

`` It 's very bitter obviously , sacrifices need to be made , '' she said . `` But I think these are necessary measures that have to be taken , I think it was not easy for anyone to impose those measures on them , but these , I think , have been made on the background of great experience . ''

Analysts say that for Merkel , who faces a general election next year , the Athens trip also sends a message back home that she views Greece as an integral part of Europe .

While some within her own governing coalition have spoken of the need for contingency plans for a possible Greek exit from the euro , Merkel has signaled that she would view that outcome as extremely risky . However , many German taxpayers are opposed to committing more European funds to Greece .

In return for international bailout funds , Greece has agreed to the austerity program and labor market reforms -- measures that have led to violent street demonstrations in the past .

Speaking in Syntagma Square , Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras said Merkel had come to Athens in support of Samaras and his ministers `` while the people are on their knees ahead of new , barbaric measures . ''

`` The democratic tradition of Europe will not allow a European people , the Greek people , to be transformed into a crisis ` guinea pig ' and for Greece to become a vast social cemetery . We will win in the end , because we are right and we are many , '' he said .

As of May , 53.8 % of Greeks younger than 25 were unemployed , according to Eurostat , the statistics division of the European Commission .

Many of the protesters were retirees , a group that has lost , in many cases , more than 30 % of its income since the crisis hit . Retirees are also among the groups that will be most affected by the new measures to which Greece must agree in order to receive the next tranche of its international bailout loan .

Stella Gianakopoulou , a 56-year-old schoolteacher who lived in Wupertal , Germany , for 18 years , said : `` Merkel will cause the eruption of Greek society , and then this will spread throughout southern Europe . This may lead to a eurozone collapse . ''

German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told Bild newspaper last week that Greece deserves `` fairness and respect . '' He suggested that Merkel 's visit represents a show of eurozone solidarity between nations that are fiscally healthy and those that are debt-ridden and battling savage cuts and social unrest .

However , Wolfango Piccoli , director of Eurasia Group , says that the risk of a Greek exit from the eurozone remains `` marginal '' at the moment and that the so-called troika -- the European Commission , European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- will provide Greece with the next tranche of bailout funds to meet its debt obligations .

`` The vast majority will come from an additional round of cuts to wages and pensions . It 's going to be almost 8 billion euros of the 13.5 billion euros coming from that . The total cut is 11.5 billion euros and then 2 billion euros of additional taxes , '' he told CNN .

On Monday , the Eurogroup -- a meeting of eurozone finance ministers -- convened in Luxembourg to give the green light to the European Stability Mechanism , the 17-nation currency bloc 's permanent bailout fund .

Spain is expected to be the first country to make a request for financial aid from the ESM .
