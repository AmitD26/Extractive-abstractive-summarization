Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chinese President Hu Jintao wrapped up his U.S. visit Friday with a trip to Chicago , the hometown of his counterpart , U.S. President Barack Obama .

He visited a Chinese-owned auto parts firm , a Chinese wind energy company and the Confucius Institute -- a Chinese language and cultural education center housed at Walter Payton College Preparatory High School .

Hu wrapped up his three-day visit to the U.S. capital Thursday , telling an audience of American business leaders that Beijing is seeking closer ties and greater trust with the United States on a range of issues .

He sought to assuage concerns about China 's rising economic and military power , declaring that his country `` will never seek hegemony or pursue an expansionist policy . ''

The Chinese leader was unapologetic , however , about Beijing 's position on the politically sensitive status of Tibet and Taiwan , calling it a matter of Chinese territorial integrity and a `` core interest . ''

We are building `` a socialist country under the rule of law , '' he asserted . He said relations between Washington and Beijing need to be governed by a belief in `` equality '' and `` mutual respect . ''

Earlier Thursday , Hu traveled to Capitol Hill , where congressional leaders used the occasion to raise strong concerns about Beijing 's commitment to human rights and economic issues such as the protection of intellectual property . He met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , and House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , among others . Neither man attended Wednesday night 's White House state dinner in honor of the Chinese leader .

Earlier in the week , Reid called Hu a `` dictator , '' a word that was later recanted by both the senator and his spokesman .

Boehner said that concerns about tensions on the Korean peninsula also were raised during Thursday 's talks .

Disagreements over human rights -- including China 's treatment of imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo -- were `` raised very strongly , '' according to Rep. Howard Berman of California , the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee .

The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights but pledged to keep working on the matter in a `` frank and candid way , '' according to Obama .

Footage of anti-China protesters near the White House was similarly blacked out .

Hu declared the relationship between the two powers to be one of `` strategic significance and global influence . ''

CNN 's Alan Silverleib , Ben Rooney , Tom Cohen and Aaron Smith contributed to this report .
