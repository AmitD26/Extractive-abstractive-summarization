-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four servicewomen who have done tours in Iraq and Afghanistan filed a suit against the Defense Department Tuesday challenging the military 's longstanding policy against women in ground combat .

Some of the plaintiffs led female troops who went on missions with combat infantrymen , according to the American Civil Liberties Union , which is representing the women .

`` Their careers and opportunities have been limited by a policy that does not grant them the same recognition for their service as their male counterparts , '' the ACLU said . `` The combat exclusion policy also makes it harder for them to do their jobs . ''

Two of the plaintiffs led Marine Corps `` female engagement teams '' in Afghanistan , according to the ACLU . They lived with and conducted missions with combat infantrymen . Another plaintiff was sent on similar missions in the Army , accompanying combat troops in Afghanistan , the ACLU said .

Women make up more than 14 % of 1.4 million active military personnel , the ACLU said .

The ACLU and others who represent the woman said the policy denies training and recognition for service , puts women at a disadvantage for promotions or moving up in rank and prevents them from competing for jobs that they 've shown they 're capable of .

Pentagon spokesman George Little took questions about the suit Tuesday , saying that he could n't comment about pending litigation , but he added that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta `` remains very committed '' to examining role of women in the military .
