This is n't the first time King Abdullah II has responded pre-emptively to a possible Arab Spring-inspired demonstration in the country . But it could foreshadow the seriousness of the rally , which is likely to echo the push for democratic reforms that have swept North Africa and the Middle East .

The government , the king then promised , would `` take practical steps , quick and concrete , to launch a process of genuine political reform '' and `` comprehensive development , '' according to a letter from the king to al-Bakhit . The government would act to strengthen democracy , the letter said .

On Thursday , government spokesman Samih al-Maitah framed the king 's latest decision as a move he was planning as a part of his promised reforms .

`` This was not a surprise decision , '' al-Maitah said .

Parliamentary elections will be held , at the latest , early next year and will be overseen by an independent commission , the spokesman added . The parliament was elected almost two years ago .

Several protests calling for change have been held in Jordan in the past year .

Loyalists to the king told reporters that , to keep the peace , they would not hold a counter-demonstration as originally planned .

`` It 's been expected to have the parliament dissolved by the king , '' said Nimer Assaf , the deputy general secretary of the Islamic Action Front , the Brotherhood 's political wing . `` As far as we are concerned this is not the right step forward . ''

`` Through that we can fight corruption , which is really high in Jordan , '' he said .
