As the name implies , when you click for a random article , you never know what you 're going to get . It 's random . But it 's always the start of a fascinating ride down the giant time-wasting wiki wormhole where , as you click on more and more associated articles , an hour later you find you 've somehow gone from , say , learning about electromagnetic radiation to reading up on Guns N ' Roses .

And then you eventually leave the wormhole because your brain has gone far too long without porn or cat videos .

So , anyway , this week , for a little change of pace , instead of writing about a trending topic in social media , I 'm going to click the `` Random Article '' button just once and write about the very first thing that pops up . No matter what it is . Because , you know , if it 's on Wikipedia , it matters . Sort of .

OK , here we go . `` Give me a click , Vasily . One click only , please . ''

According to Wikipedia , Ondracek is a 24-year-old professional ice hockey player from Havirov , Czech Republic . Which is nowhere near Pittsburgh . I looked it up . You 're welcome .

So let 's learn !

A quick visit to his team 's website does n't reveal anything overly interesting about Ondracek other than the fact that he 's a forward who 's 185 centimeters tall and weighs 82 kilograms . I 'm an American so , clearly , I have no idea what the hell that means . For all I know he 's 5 feet 3 inches and built like a Buick . Or as they call that on Internet dating sites : `` Curvy . ''

So , I used Google 's metric converter and learned that he 's actually about 6 feet tall and weighs roughly 180 pounds . Which sounds just about right for a real professional hockey player . By contrast , I played one season of club hockey my freshman year in college , but was 5 feet 9 inches and built like a malnourished fifth-grader . So I quit , took up sleeping in as my new club sport and decided to concentrate on pork rinds .

But back to Ondracek . His current team hails from the town of Zlin , which is in the southeastern part of the Czech Republic . It 's OK . You 're allowed to not know where it is . So do look at that map . And maybe even plan a visit . Zlin actually sounds rather interesting .

In 2007 , New York Times writer William Shaw called Zlin `` an architectural gold mine '' and mentioned that people used to joke about it being `` a piece of America , somehow misplaced here in the Czech Republic . ''

The architectural history of Zlin has roots in America , and dates back to the larger vision of a local shoemaker in the early 1900s . His name was Tomas Bata and , according to the article , he made several discovery trips to the United States , and even toured Ford factories to learn more about the intricacies of mass production .

But Bata wanted to do it in style . So , the article says , he enlisted the help of some of Europe 's most radical architects .

`` No walls . Just fresh air . And we 'll surround the exterior with open flames to symbolize the warmth of healing . ''

Eventually , Bata 's dream fizzled , but most of the buildings made it through the great wars and are still intact today . Thus , the `` architectural gold mine . ''

And the best part : No Nickelback !
