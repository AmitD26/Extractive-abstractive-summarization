-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Bruce Willis ' return as John McClane , A Good Day to Die Hard , topped the box office over the Friday-to-Sunday period , but with a weaker-than-expected $ 25 million . Fox 's $ 92 million thriller , which also stars Jai Courtney , earned $ 8.2 million on Thursday , its first day of release , and after four days , it 's earned $ 33.2 million . That 's a substantially weaker start than 2007 ′ s Live Free or Die Hard , which started with $ 33.4 million in its opening three-day weekend .

Die Hard 's middling performance is n't a total surprise . This has been a remarkably tough winter for male-driven action vehicles , many of which star members of The Expendables . Arnold Schwarznegger 's $ 45 million entry The Last Stand has earned just $ 12 million after five weekends . Sylvester Stallone 's Bullet to the Head , which reportedly cost $ 55 million , has only earned about $ 10 million after three . The Jason Statham thriller Parker cost about $ 35 million but has only grossed $ 17 million after nearly a month in theaters . The Mark Wahlberg/Russell Crowe shoot-em-up Broken City has languished with $ 19.5 million against a $ 35 million budget . -LRB- Meanwhile , 2013 ′ s top four highest-grossing movies -- Identity Thief , Mama , Warm Bodies , and Hansel & Gretel : Witch Hunters -- all feature women in leading roles . -RRB-

Obviously , A Good Day to Die Hard has already earned more than each of those aforementioned flops , though , and it should n't be written off as a misfire . The film 's $ 7,036 per theater average from 3,553 theaters was strong , and with a `` B + '' CinemaScore grade , it may benefit from word-of-mouth in the weeks to come . Prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend , and it remains to be seen whether it can match Live Free or Die Hard 's $ 134.5 million finish , but Fox can rest easy thanks to Die Hard 's strong international performance so far . The film earned a tremendous $ 61.5 million overseas this weekend , bringing its international haul to $ 80.1 million and its worldwide cume to $ 113.4 million . Those overseas results may keep John McClane Yippee-Ki-Yaying for years to come .

Last weekend 's champ , Identity Thief , dipped only 32 percent to $ 23.4 million in its second weekend . The Melissa McCarthy/Jason Bateman laugher has now earned $ 70.7 million against a slim $ 35 million budget , and , for Universal , it 's the latest in a hot-streak of sensibly budgeted hits that almost -LRB- almost -RRB- make up for the fact that the studio spent $ 209 million on Battleship , which earned only $ 65.4 million , last year . With the exception of The Man with the Iron Fists , every Universal film since the fall has been a profitable venture : Pitch Perfect -LRB- $ 65 million vs. $ 17 million budget -RRB- , This is 40 -LRB- $ 67.4 million vs. $ 35 million budget -RRB- , Les Miserables -LRB- $ 145.5 million vs. $ 61 million budget -RRB- , Mama -LRB- $ 68.3 million vs. $ 15 million budget -RRB- , and now Identity Thief . Next up on the studio 's plate ? The surefire smash Fast & Furious 6 .

Rounding out the Top 5 was Summit 's Warm Bodies , which fell only 20 percent to $ 9 million , giving it a $ 50.2 million total . While the YA adaptation has n't become the next Twilight , positive word-of-mouth has helped Warm Bodies , which cost about $ 35 million , avoid the steep drops that usually plague films aimed at teens . It could finish with about $ 65 million .

3 . Identity Thief -- $ 23.4 million -LRB- $ 70.7 million total -RRB-

4 . Escape from Planet Earth -- $ 16.1 million -LRB- $ 16.1 million total -RRB-

6 . Beautiful Creatures -- $ 7.5 million -LRB- $ 10 million total -RRB-
