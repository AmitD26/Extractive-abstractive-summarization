More than 5,000 people have died in Syria since President Bashar al-Assad began a brutal crackdown in mid-March on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster , the United Nations said earlier this month .

In his Christmas morning speech , Benedict also urged the international community to help those suffering hunger and insecurity in the Horn of Africa , a reference to famine and violence in Somalia and Kenya .

The pope 's reference to the Philippines came as the death toll from flooding there last week topped 1,000 , with more than 1,000 more missing .

`` Today Christmas has become a commercial celebration , whose bright lights hide the mystery of God 's humility , which in turn calls us to humility and simplicity , '' the pope said during Mass on Christmas Eve . `` Let us ask the Lord to help us see through the superficial glitter of this season , and to discover behind it the child in the stable in Bethlehem , so as to find true joy and true light . ''

The 84-year-old pope , presiding over his seventh Mass as pontiff , also conjured up an image of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem , explaining that visitors must bend down to enter its low opening , drawing a tie to what followers of Christ must do to find their faith .

The pope started off Saturday 's celebrations by lighting a peace candle in the window of his study during the unveiling of a larger-than-life Nativity scene in St. Peter 's Square . The scene , at 23 feet high and 82 feet wide , is dedicated to the Virgin Mary , according to the Vatican 's news agency .

Thousands poured into the square and St. Peter 's Basilica ahead of the midnight Mass , which was actually held at 10 p.m. this year . Before his homily , the aging pontiff rode down St. Peter 's long aisle on a wheeled platform , waving to worshippers .
