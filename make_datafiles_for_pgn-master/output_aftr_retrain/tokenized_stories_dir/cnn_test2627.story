Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In many ways , the debate over taming the nation 's spending and deficit beasts can be compared to a family 's hand-wringing over what to cut , and what to keep , in tough times . It may be easy to nix `` luxuries '' like vacations and eating out . But should `` essentials '' like a car or a home be downsized or gotten rid of to save money ?

Tough choices about what to keep , kill or cut back on are the kinds of things the nation 's lawmakers are considering as they try to trim a $ 14 trillion debt .

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan laid out the Republican plan last week . It would radically overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering top tax rates .

President Obama on Wednesday laid out his plan for long-term deficit reduction , renewing his call for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for families making more than $ 250,000 while strengthening Medicare and Medicaid .

FreedomWorks , another prominent Tea Party group , echoed similar sentiments .

Adam Brandon , a spokesman , told CNN , `` The first thing you have to do is roll back entitlements you ca n't afford . Second is moving them towards solvency . One of the best ways to do that -- especially for younger workers -- is through some kind of voluntary personal accounts . ''

And yet , Brandon acknowledged that his and other Tea Party support organizations would have a tough time selling such ideas to everyday Americans .

`` It 's part of our job to get out there and to educate and make sure that voters have a choice and understand what we 're talking about , '' Brandon said . `` We 're not talking about throwing Grandma out on the street . What we are talking about doing is making hard , difficult decisions that are going to get the country , the fiscal house in order . ''

The poll finds that while Americans are nearly evenly split on whether Republican proposals to cut spending go too far , only three in 10 think the GOP budget treats all groups in society fairly , while seven in 10 believe that Republican proposals favor some groups over others .

Specifically naming the departments of Housing and Urban Development , Education , Commerce , Agriculture and Energy , Brandon said , `` I think you could pretty much do away with the entire departments ... just eliminate them . ''

Norm Ornstein , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , does n't think that will happen .

`` I do n't think you 're going to find much appetite for that , '' he said .

Ornstein also criticized calls for dramatic overhauls of Medicaid and Medicare , especially as seen in the Ryan plan .

It `` does n't take a dime from Defense , or takes very little from Defense . And cuts taxes for the wealthy and for companies , even as it takes a lot out of Medicare and Medicaid . So it becomes a question of whether this is seen as fair , '' Ornstein said .

As many lawmakers frame the debate around protecting future generations , one noted historian says it 's worthwhile to look at the past .

`` If I asked you , ` What did -LSB- President -RSB- Grover Cleveland do with his budget ? What did -LSB- President -RSB- Benjamin Harrison do with his budget ? What was -LSB- President -RSB- Taft 's budget ? ' -- you would n't know . Because 100 years from now , people wo n't think about budget fights so much . But they 're going to know , 100 years from now , that America pushed through civil rights acts in '64 and ' 65 , America created Medicaid and Medicare ... NASA sent a man to the moon . Big stuff that happens in history is being done by the federal government , not by people just carping about it all the time . ''

Calling Medicaid and Medicare `` wildly successful programs , '' Brinkley said that the Republican Party has been trying roll them back for decades .

And Brinkley had a warning and prediction .

`` Not just Congressman Ryan , but if the main Republican candidate for president said he wants to shut down Medicaid and Medicare , if that happened , welcome to the second Obama term . ''
