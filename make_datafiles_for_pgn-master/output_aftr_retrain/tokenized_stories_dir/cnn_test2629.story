The half sailboat , half plane uses technology known as supercavitation -- sailing just above the water 's edge .

Langman , a shipyard owner and yachtsman , is intent on beating the French-set record within the next few weeks , with the `` Wot Rocket , '' a canoe-style pod with a nine meter-long rigid sail .

The Wot Rocket is waiting for confirmation from the World Sailing Speed Record Council to attempt , once again , an unprecedented technology known as `` supercavitation '' -- sailing just above the water in a gas bubble created by the deflection of water . This is to to reduce the drag which is around 1,000 times greater in the water than in the air .

`` Wot Rocket is so exciting as we push to sail up to three times the speed of the wind , '' Langman told CNN .

In October last year Langman and his co-pilot crashed when they lost control of the vessel at 42 knots -- over 60 miles per hour .

But after re-building and perfecting the vessel at a cost of half a million dollars , Langman is ready to try again . `` The exhilaration of sailing/flying is so big , you do n't think about danger , '' he told CNN .

In case the pilots crash again , Langman says the most thing is to remain calm . `` Last time I felt a mild panic as we were underwater . I just hoped the paramedics would get there in time .

The idea for Wot Rocket was conceived four years ago by Langman after he was inspired by the story of Burt Munro , the New Zealander who set a world land speed record on his modified Indian Scout motorcycle in 1967 -- played by Antony Hopkins in the 2005 Hollywood movie `` The World 's Fastest Indian . ''

`` I came up with the idea in the shower . So I presented it to a group of engineers and said ` this is what I believe . ' Most said I 'm a lunatic but one said ` I want to work with you ' . ''
