Paris , France -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hurling insults against French President Nicolas Sarkozy , crowds of demonstrators marched through the boulevards of eastern Paris to protest his anti-crime measures .

Referring to France 's contentious role in World War II , protesters held up signs such as `` Sarkozy , son of Petain , '' referring to Marshal Philippe Petain , who led the pro-Nazi Vichy regime .

Organizers said about 130 cities in France are seeing similar protests against Sarkozy 's so-called crime-busting proposals which have led to the expulsion of more than 8,000 Roma , commonly known as Gypsies .

Saturday 's protests erupted after the recent raids against camps in Lyon and other cities that forced out a total of 8,300 Romanian and Bulgarian nationals of Roma origin . Close to 10,000 were expelled in 2009 .

But the Roma are not the sole targets of the recent anti-immigration security measures proposed by the French government , protesters claim .

After recent anti-police attacks , the country 's parliament is considering new laws to take away French citizenship from naturalized immigrants guilty of crimes like attacks on police , polygamy or female circumcision , traditions associated with some immigrant groups .

Some believe Sarkozy 's approach of blaming immigrants for security problems flies in the face of France 's democratic fundamentals -- liberty , equality and fraternity .

When he announced the proposals in July , Sarkozy said French citizenship was a privilege .

`` One must earn French nationality and be worthy of it , '' he said . `` Anyone who fires on an agent enforcing order no longer deserves to be French . ''

child , Frances immigration ministry said .

In his July speech , Sarkozy said France needs better immigration regulations .
