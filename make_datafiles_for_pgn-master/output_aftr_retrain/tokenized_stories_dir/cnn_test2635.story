Baghdad -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the last U.S. soldiers exited Iraq Sunday and debate was raging about the nation 's future , political crisis erupted in Baghdad that raised fears of more sectarian strife to come .

Iraqiya , a powerful political bloc that draws support largely from Sunni and more secular Iraqis , said it was boycotting parliament , a move that threatens to shatter Iraq 's fragile power-sharing government .

Iraqiya contends al-Maliki is trying to amass dictatorial power and many believe al-Maliki was simply waiting for the Americans to leave before making his move .

Al-Maliki , Hill said , is a man who perceives concessions as weakness . He 's a tough guy who knows what he 's doing , Hill said .

His rivals say that al-Maliki still controls the country 's security ministries and all decisions go through him . They also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in October for backing terrorism and supporting the banned Baath Party are Iraqiya supporters .

Iraqiya spokesman Haider al-Mulla said the bloc has always warned about power-sharing and deal 's risks that al-Maliki 's State of Law Alliance party has been violating the law .

Al-Maliki is asking lawmakers to withdraw confidence from his deputy after Saleh al-Mutlaq made controversial comments this week over American forces withdrawing from Iraq , state media reported late Saturday .

In a CNN interview , al-Mutlaq had accused al-Maliki of amassing dictatorial power .

`` There will be a day whereby the Americans will realize that they were deceived by al-Maliki ... and they will regret that , '' said al-Mutlaq , a leader within the Iraqiya movement .

Al-Mussawi dismissed the notion that linking al-Hashimi to terrorism was politically motivated . He would not confirm whether an arrest warrant had indeed been issued , saying that was a matter for the judiciary .

There had been fears of renewed bloodshed between Iraq 's majority Shiite and minority Sunni populations and that prompted U.S. officials to work out a power-sharing agreement , bringing the Iraqiya movement into the government .

He said he was `` shocked '' to hear U.S. President Barack Obama greet al-Maliki at the White House on Monday as `` the elected leader of a sovereign , self-reliant and democratic Iraq . ''

`` America left Iraq with almost no infrastructure . The political process is going in a very wrong direction , going toward a dictatorship , '' he said . `` People are not going to accept that , and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country . And this is going to be a disaster . Dividing the country is n't going to be smooth , because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that . ''

`` The problem is that Maliki is n't sharing any security decisions with Iraqiya , he does n't trust them and this is a big problem , '' he said . `` Power-sharing was never power-sharing . We are in a government of conflict . Power-sharing was never successful .

`` The Kurds do n't want to take sides , we want them -LRB- Iraqiya and State of Law Alliance -RRB- to get together to solve their problems . ''

He is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between Sunnis and Shiites or violence against the government .
