Finally , nearly two decades after the crime , the men were allowed to walk free last month , the result of a complicated plea agreement requiring them to plead guilty even while declaring their innocence .

`` I had n't seen daylight in almost a decade . I had n't been exposed to sunlight ... for almost 10 years , '' Damien Echols told Morgan about his life on death row , where he lived in isolation in a concrete cell , his food passed to him through a slot in a solid steel door .

`` The only thing you can do to maintain your sanity is to not think about the case and not think about what 's happening to you , '' Echols said .

`` You have to create your own world in there or you 'll go insane from that stuff . ''

Echols still squints in bright light , the result of living for years in a dimly lit cell . When he left prison and saw daylight for the first time in a decade , Echols said , `` it was like having a spotlight turned right in your face . It was extremely bright . ''

Baldwin , Echols , and a third man -- Jesse Misskelley , who declined to take part in the interview -- were imprisoned for the slayings of second-graders Steven Branch , Christopher Byers , and Michael Moore .

The boys ' mutilated bodies were left in a ditch , hogtied with their own shoelaces . Prosecutors argued that the defendants -- teenagers at the time -- were driven by satanic ritual and that Echols had been the ringleader .

Critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied them to the murders , and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys ' wounds .

Echols said their support was `` uplifting '' and brought attention to their case , ultimately leading to their release .

Now , the men are having to get used to elements of modern life such as computers , the internet , and cell phones , things that most others take for granted . Even ordering a simple cup of coffee is different now .

The two have been out of prison for a month and a week . Baldwin says he now works for a construction company that 's helping him get on his feet again , and he 's learning how to drive .

Echols says he has n't yet found a job but is interested in pursuing visual art . He got married while in prison to Lorri Davis , a woman who took up his cause and started writing him letters in prison .

She said they are still fighting for the real perpetrators to be brought to justice .

`` We want to discover who did this , '' Davis said . `` That 's the most important thing . ''
