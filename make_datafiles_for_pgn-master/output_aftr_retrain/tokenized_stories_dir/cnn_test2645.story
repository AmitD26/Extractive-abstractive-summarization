WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was billed as a `` coming out party '' for one of the GOP 's most promising young stars .

Gov. Bobby Jindal seemed `` over-coached and over-rehearsed , '' CNN 's Candy Crowley said .

But after nearly universal criticism was heaped on Gov. Bobby Jindal 's high-profile response to President Obama 's address to Congress Tuesday night , the Louisiana Republican may be wishing he had stayed home .

The criticisms came from all sides of the political spectrum , including from those in conservative circles who have promoted the 36-year-old governor as the GOP 's most likely advocate to bring the party back from the brink of irrelevance .

Republicans who have followed Jindal 's upstart career from standout congressman to popular Louisiana governor know him to be an articulate and confident spokesman for the party 's fundamental principles of limited government and fiscal responsibility . Watch `` Is Jindal prime-time ready ? '' ''

Many conservatives say Jindal appeared at best off-balance and at worst downright amateur in his national debut .

The contrast between the settings could n't be more stark , a challenge that even the most skilled politician would have difficulty confronting .

`` So much about it is perception , '' said Eliot Shapiro , partner with EMS Communications , a firm that specializes in public speaking . `` The response is one person , face-to-face with a camera , and you can never generate the same kind of buzz and energy as when there are 500 people in a room applauding . ''

`` Everybody thinks -LSB- the response -RSB- is a great launching pad , '' said CNN political contributor and White House veteran Ed Rollins , `` I would n't recommend to any of my clients , whatever you do do n't take the honor . ''

The Louisiana governor may also be a victim of overhype and outsized expectations . Jindal 's impressive resume and compelling background have been touted to make him a natural fit to compete against Obama and rescue a Republican Party that many fear is in danger of becoming confined to the South .

But if conservatives are looking for Jindal to compete with the president stylistically , they should think again , sad Matt Lewis , a conservative blogger for AOL 's Political Machine .

`` Conservatives are looking for the conservative version Obama , a great orator , '' Lewis said . `` Bobby Jindal is many things -- an intellectual , a son of immigrants and a policy wonk . But if conservatives are looking for someone who is going toe-to-toe with Obama , he 's the wrong guy . '' iReport.com : Jindal 's tone ` insulting '

Some Republicans praised the content of the speech itself : namely a vigorous defense of conservative principles and an optimistic can-do outlook on the future .

They also say the speech laid out a cogent rebuttal to the Democrats massive stimulus bill , articulated a way forward for the GOP and rightly refrained from overly criticizing the president himself .

`` Jindal on Tuesday was likable , his personal story was compelling and he offered a positive vision of conservatism for America , '' Lewis said .
