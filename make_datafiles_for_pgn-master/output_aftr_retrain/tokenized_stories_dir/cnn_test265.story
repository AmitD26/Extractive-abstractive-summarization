London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Moments after Michael Adebolajo had nearly decapitated his victim , the British soldier Drummer Lee-Rigby , he turned to one of the numerous cameras trained on him and his accomplice Michael Adebowale , and said :

`` The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers . And this British soldier is one . It is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . We swear by the almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone . ''

Here Adebolajo was , perhaps unwittingly , following one of the oldest philosophies in modern terrorism : the propaganda of the deed .

Thus , Rigby 's killers did not attack the shocked and curious passers-by in Woolwich who began to film them , and instead invited the curious gaze of their smart phones .

This murder was not an irrational act of madness , but a calm and calculated effort both to strike a blow for what they see as Muslims oppressed by Western forces around the world , and to publicize the cause of the global jihad far and wide .

In order to maintain a presence in the West , the global jihad movement that was sparked by al Qaeda on September 11 , 2001 requires effective propagandists . Such individuals help to define grievances , as well as formulate responses and offer motivation . In doing so , they are able to offer a version of global jihadist ideology that resonates with the experiences of Muslims living in the West .

While Adebolajo should not be seen as a key leadership figure or propagandist , his act should be regarded in the same light .

Indeed , Adebolajo was also known among members of the extremist group which radicalized him for giving sermons on street corners , where he would emulate well-known propagandists , seeking to replicate their work on a smaller scale .

In a 2009 video which emerged after Rigby 's murder , he is shown leading his group 's protests against an anti-Muslim organization that was calling for the shut-down of a mosque in north London .

`` They are pigs , '' he shouted , referring to the anti-Muslim demonstrators , while also encouraging his audience to `` not be scared of the kuffar -LSB- unbelievers -RSB- . ''

Some believe that this violence only has a place in warzones involving Muslims , while others add to their target list the home soil of the Western countries involved in these conflicts .

The details behind why he was not charged or extensively monitored after attempting to join a proscribed terrorist group are unknown , but British authorities have faced some awkward questions about this revelation .

In future , an attempt to join up with a global jihadist group abroad , while not necessarily an indicator of a desire to take part in violence back home , should nonetheless be regarded as a step in the wrong direction .

When looking at how authorities can respond to the wider problem of homegrown radicalization and the role of propagandists , one should begin with accepting the limitations of what can be done .

What Adebolajo and Adebowale did last spring is , at least in a planning and execution sense , incredibly easy to replicate and difficult to detect and protect against . Thus , no government should be expected to fully guarantee against similar attacks in the future .

In order to protect against this , Western countries could seek to pursue legislation that curbs free speech or censors the web . The question is how much do we want our society to change in response to this ongoing threat ?

Civil society is key here , and we must seek to further cultivate strategies that help to delegitimize illiberal ideologies such as global jihadism in the eyes of vulnerable Western Muslims .
