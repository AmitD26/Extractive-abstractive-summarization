Abdulaziz died after a severe beating left him with swelling and bruising of the brain and fractured ribs and neck . He also had bite marks on his face , ears and arm .

The prince had not denied killing Abdulaziz , but said he had not intended to do so . He did not take the stand in his own defense .

To do that , jurors had to determine the prince 's state of mind and his intent at the time he killed Abdulaziz . They took just over an hour and a half to reach a verdict .

Prosecutors said the prince 's systematic mistreatment of the victim had a sexual element .

The two men were in London earlier this year as Al Saud took in Morocco , the Maldives and other European cities on a long global holiday with Abdulaziz as his companion .

Al Saud 's lawyer , John Kelsey-Fry , said in his closing argument Monday that Al Saud `` must live with the consequences '' of having killed Abdulaziz , but he never intended to harm him .

He also disputed suggestions from the prosecutor and several witnesses that the prince and his aide had a gay relationship .

During their visit to London , the two men shared a hotel room , went shopping together and stayed out late in bars and nightclubs .
