New Delhi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- India 's scandal-tainted government has come under fresh attack from opposition parties after a leading newspaper ran a front-page report alleging that auditors had found that the awarding of coal fields to private companies had deprived the treasury of $ 211 billion .

As lawmakers from across the spectrum of opposition parties criticized Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's administration over the Times of India story on Thursday , his office issued excerpts of a letter to him from the federal auditor that described the news report as `` exceedingly misleading . ''

One of the country 's most respected dailies , the Times of India cited what it said were the Comptroller and Auditor General -LRB- CAG -RRB- 's draft estimates from the awarding of 155 coal blocks to some 100 firms without auction between 2004 and 2009 .

The report claimed the loss to the government was six times the size of the amount lost by the allotment of telecommunications frequencies in 2008 at below market value . The telecommunications scandal , the result of a CAG report , put tremendous pressure on Singh 's government , leading to the resignations of top officials and fueling a powerful grassroots protest movement against corruption .

`` The details being brought out were observations which are under discussion at a very preliminary stage and do not even constitute our pre-final draft and hence are exceedingly misleading , '' read a portion of the CAG 's letter made public by the prime minister 's office .

`` This is the worst scam , '' said Prakash Javadekar , spokesman for the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party . `` This government has lost , forfeited its right to continue in power , '' he said .

He asked why the government had not awarded the coalfields through an auction process .

Before releasing the letter from the CAG , the government issued cautious comments on the matter .

He insisted that no coal blocks had been granted during the second term of Singh 's government , which began in 2009 .

`` If the CAG has raised any objections over any such allocations before that , we will be able to make a comment only after studying them , '' Jaiswal said .

Singh 's government has been hit by a series of corruption allegations , including a damning 2010 CAG report about the underselling of the cell phone permits . It put the cost to the government coffers of that affair at around $ 31 billion dollars in lost revenues .

Singh 's Congress Party , headed by Italian born Sonia Gandhi , paid a political price this month when it suffered a heavy defeat in a key regional vote .

Seen as a litmus test for the popularity of the national coalition , the recent elections in India 's most populous state , Uttar Pradesh , gave a decisive majority to a provincial grouping . That was despite a rigorous campaign by the Congress Party to try to revive its fortunes in the region .
