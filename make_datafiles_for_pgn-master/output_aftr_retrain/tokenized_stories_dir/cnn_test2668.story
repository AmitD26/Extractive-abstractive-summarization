-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yeah , yeah . We know . You just watch the Super Bowl for the commercials .

Here at CNN Tech , most of us also enjoyed what turned out to be a pretty competitive game . Not to mention an excuse to obsess over Twitter for a few hours .

In no particular order , here they are , with a little tech-world analysis about what , if anything , they achieved :

The `` Parks and Recreation '' and ex - `` Saturday Night Live '' star rattles off rapid-fire consumer tech questions while playfully sexually harassing a Best Buy clerk -LRB- but in a really cute way -RRB- . And saying `` dongle . ''

Is it enough to get tech-obsessed shoppers to forgo online retailers for a good , old-fashioned brick-and-mortar store ? We 're not sure . But it was a valiant effort . It also showcased the store 's emphasis on selling mobile gadgets instead of TVs or home electronics .

Some of our favorite one-liners :

• `` Can I use a dongle with this ? Does it make you uncomfortable when I use the word ` dongle ' ? ''

• `` Will this -LRB- a tablet -RRB- read ` Fifty Shades of Grey ' to me in a sexy voice ? Will you ? ''

Go Daddy

At least race-car driver Danica Patrick left her clothes on this time . Everyone did , in fact , but that likely did n't appease many critics of GoDaddy 's lad-mag-style commercials . Who was the smart one again ? Not the woman ? Gotcha .

All that said , how many more domain-registration companies can you name without a Google search ?

Samsung

Instead of focusing on a single product , Samsung used funnymen Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd basically to say `` Samsung '' a lot while pretending to fight over who will get to be in the commercial .

And to let the world know Rogen would wear a diaper for Samsung .

Fresh off unveiling its BlackBerry 10 operating system and two new phones , the company tried to keep its badly needed momentum going with a 30-second spot in which a guy uses the new BlackBerry Z10 to set himself on fire , grow elephant legs and magically turn an out-of-control big rig into an exploding pile of rubber duckies .

The point ? In 30 seconds , it 's easier to show you what the phone ca n't do than all the things it can .

We get it . And the important thing is to get people talking . But when Gizmodo asks if it 's `` the dumbest tech ad you 've ever seen , '' maybe it was n't exactly the 108-yard touchdown run of advertising .

Once the darling of the Android world with its Droid phones , Motorola has faded as Samsung 's Galaxy S III has become arguably the chief rival to the iPhone . So , how to get back in the spotlight again ?

Apparently by putting Megan Fox in a bubble bath .

She wonders what would happen if she posts a nudie shot using a Motorola Blur .

Cue montage : Among scenes of a power line exploding and construction workers looking distracted , there 's a stereotypically sassy gay couple slapping each other and some implied ... well , masturbation .
