The fitness industry is constantly coming up with similar tricks to get more of us off the couch , Daikeler said .

The result is a rotation of incoming and outgoing trends -- from Jane Fonda 's VHS tapes in the early '80s to Beachbody 's DVD programs that are popular today .

Daikeler compares fitness to fashion . `` Somebody starts wearing a certain shoe in Milan or Japan and suddenly everybody wants to wear it , '' he said . `` It does n't just solve the problem -- like shoes cover your feet . It makes you feel like it 's -LRB- a part of -RRB- your identity . ''

Starla Kay teaches youth video classes at the Indiana Black Expo in Indianapolis . She has a 19-month-old son and not a lot of time for a workout program that does n't work .

She tried kickboxing , aerobics and just going to the gym , but nothing really stuck until she got one of this year 's hot trends , P90X .

`` This is the first actual program I 've done , '' she said . `` I feel stronger . I feel like I have more energy . I 've lost 9 pounds so far . ''

The American College of Sports Medicine publishes a yearly survey of the top worldwide fitness trends . The top 10 list for 2011 includes boot camps and programs aimed at older adults .

Trends depend on many factors , said the survey 's lead author , Walt Thompson . Take Pilates , which dropped off the survey 's list from No. 9 last year . Thompson believes the economy made Pilates equipment and specialized instructors too expensive for clubs to maintain . He 's not sure if Pilates will make a return to the top 20 , but he does n't expect a few of this year 's trends to stick around long .

`` The problem with the high-intensity kind of programs is that they deliver a punch like severe weight loss programs do , but they 're difficult to comply with in the long haul , '' he said .

Behrend cites classes like Zumba , body pump and spinning as success stories . They 're consistent , easy to follow and include that always important element of fun .

`` They make people feel successful , '' IDEA Fitness Journal Editor-in-chief Sandy Todd Webster said . `` That 's a huge key in good programming is to make people feel like ` Wow , I get it . ' ''

IDEA is the world 's largest association for fitness and wellness professionals . It also does a yearly survey of fitness trends . This year , aerobics , water fitness and martial arts-based classes had the largest decline in popularity . Dance and boot camp classes showed the largest growth .

It is the beauty and curse of the industry , Behrend said . Old trends evolve into new ones , forcing gyms to stay cutting edge , but keeping customers excited about working out .

`` The trick only lasts so long , '' Daikeler said , going back to his fashion analogy . `` The best designers are n't looking for trends ; the best designers set the trends . Will this capture a market audience or is this like Lady Gaga 's meat dress ? ''
