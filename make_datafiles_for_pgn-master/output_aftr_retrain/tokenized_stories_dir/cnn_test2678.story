-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Another day , another English musician getting upset over his compensation from a streaming service .

Following in the footsteps of the gentlemen from Pink Floyd , Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke took umbrage with the amount of money paid to artists who allow their music on Spotify .

Yorke engaged in a Twitter exchange with his longtime producer and collaborator Nigel Godrich , who tweeted , `` We 're off of Spotify . Ca n't do that no more man . Small meaningless rebellion . ''

That means that Spotify customers can no longer stream Yorke 's 2006 solo album `` The Eraser , '' the first album from Godrich 's Ultraista project , or the Atoms For Peace album `` Amok . ''

More and more musicians have been speaking up about streaming services , who continually swear that their compensation packages are fair . In the eyes of Yorke and Godrich , services like Spotify -LRB- or Pandora , another frequent adversary of musicians -RRB- devalue the product created by artists .

Yorke drove that point home in his most recent tweet : `` For me ` In Rainbows ' was a statement of trust . People still value new music , '' he wrote , referencing the album his band released as a pay-what-you-want download back in 2007 . `` That 's all we 'd like from Spotify . Do n't make us the target . ''
