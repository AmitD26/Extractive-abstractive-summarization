-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As a lifelong resident of South Central Los Angeles , I refuse to be part of the social system that breeds problems rather than solutions . South Central is a `` food desert '' where the lack of healthy food alternatives leads to obesity and preventable disease .

I have raised my sons in South L.A. , and it is heartbreaking to see so many young kids on a trajectory to nowhere , potential high school dropouts prey to gangs , drugs , violence and incarceration .

So where do we start to create positive change ?

I believe that change starts from within , and unless you want to take the first step , change will never happen .

TED.com : Ron Finley 's talk on gardening in South Central

So instead of waiting for others -LRB- the city or other units of government -RRB- , I decided to take my shovel , my weapon of change , and start gardening .

Change begins with youth and healthy role models . Gardening takes care of both . It builds community .

My vision is that gardening can do that -- and my organization has been planting gardens in South Central , including ones on city-owned land .

When kids learn to grow vegetables , they learn not only how to eat in a healthy way but how to be productive and are armed with a value system that will help them to navigate in their lives -- values such as patience , appreciation , sharing , honesty and respect .

But gardening 's therapeutic effect is not only for kids . I have been to homeless shelters to install gardens . People will come around and will start telling stories of gardening with their mothers and grandmothers . I see hopeless faces light up ; I see the seed of hope where none existed before , and this is for me a great reward .

Our society -- not just South Central -- suffers from social corrosion . Due to the economic crisis , parents have to work long hours -LRB- if they are lucky enough to have a job -RRB- , and often , kids are neglected . In many cases , kids grow up with their TV set as parent .

Technology offers more ways of nominal communication , but our society tends to promote actual isolation . It is crucially important to cultivate nourishing relationships and human connections , and gardening can definitely do that .
