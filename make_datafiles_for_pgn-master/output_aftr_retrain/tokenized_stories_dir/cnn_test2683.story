-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Third seed Maria Sharapova was stunned on her return to action at the Western and Southern Open , losing to American starlet Sloane Stephens .

Former world No. 1 Sharapova looked on course to make a victorious comeback in Cincinnati when she took the first set 6-2 against her 17th-ranked opponent .

But Stephens bounced back , recovering from 2-6 0-2 down to take the match 2-6 7-6 -LRB- 7-5 -RRB- 6-3 and register her second career victory over a top-three ranked player .

`` I did n't continue what I was doing well for the first set and a half , and that hurt me , '' explained the 26-year-old . `` I stopped being patient . I started making a lot more errors , especially off the first ball . Just errors I should n't make .

`` Obviously I have n't played in a long time , but I 've got to be ready from the first match . So it 's disappointing , but that 's how it goes in this game . ''

Belarus ' Azarenka missed last week 's event in Toronto with a back injury , but showed she was in good shape by recovering from 0-3 in the second set to take the match in one hour and 41 minutes .

Azarenka and Sharpova both entered the tournament at the second round stage .

`` I think the beginning of the second set was n't very good for me , '' Azarenka said after advancing into the third round .

`` There were quite a few unforced errors and just really fast mistakes that did n't happen in the first set . It went kind of quickly , but I was glad that I could turn it around there and come back even stronger .

`` Then there was competitiveness . She was already in the game and playing at a much higher level than before , and going for her shots . So I had to stay with her and just take my opportunities , and I did .

`` There was a little bit of inconsistency today , but first matches can be tricky . I just want to think about what I need to improve for my next match . That 's the most important thing for me going forward . ''

Meanwhile 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer began his defense of the men 's title with a battling 6-3 7-6 -LRB- 9-7 -RRB- win over Germany 's Philipp Kohlschreiber .

The fifth seed , playing for the first time since losing to Kohlschreiber 's compatriot Daniel Brands at a clay-court event in Gstaad , Switzerland , is bidding for a record sixth win at the Ohio event .
