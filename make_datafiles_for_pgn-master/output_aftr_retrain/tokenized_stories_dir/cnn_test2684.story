International naval patrols have been stepped up in the Gulf of Aden following increased pirate attacks .

The warning came shortly before a U.S.-flagged ship was believed hijacked early Wednesday off Somalia .

`` They -LSB- pirates -RSB- are going where we are not , they are looking for targets where there is limited coalition presence , '' according to a U.S. military briefing document shown to CNN .

Coalition ships mainly patrol in the busy sea lanes of the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and northern Somalia as ships come out of and head toward the mouth of the Red Sea .

`` Despite increased naval presence in the region , ships and aircraft are unlikely to be close enough to provide support to vessels under attack . The scope and magnitude of the problem can not be understated , '' according to a news release from the U.S. Navy .

In March , attacks in the same area spiked to 15 , according to the bureau , and the attacks have continued into April .

The U.S. Department of Transportation 's Maritime Liaison Office also issued a warning to mariners April 1 .

The warning suggests ships traveling along the coast of Somalia and Kenya move to the east side of the Seychelles Islands and Madagascar , hundreds of miles east of those coastlines .

Pentagon officials say pirates are holding 15 ships off the Somali coast . And according to U.S. Navy statistics , pirates attacked four ships between Saturday and Monday .

The area involved -- off the coast of Somalia and Kenya as well as the Gulf of Aden -- equals more than 1.1 million square miles , roughly four times the size of Texas , or the size of the Mediterranean and Red Sea combined . The length of the Somali coastline is roughly the same length as the entire Eastern Seaboard of the United States , according to U.S. Navy statistics .

`` We continue to highlight the importance of preparation by the merchant mariners and the maritime industry in this message , '' Vice Adm. Bill Gortney , commander of the Combined Maritime Forces , said in a statement .

This year , the U.S. Navy started Combined Task Force 151 , a multinational coalition that uses naval ships to fight piracy in the Gulf of Aden region . Navy officials say about 12 to 15 coalition ships are patrolling in the Gulf of Aden and the off the coast of Somalia .
