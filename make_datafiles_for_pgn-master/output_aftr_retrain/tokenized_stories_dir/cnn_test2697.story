The group 's organizers were expecting trouble . They were marching on Tuesday without a government permit .

Barely 200 yards up the road , the crowd encountered a squad of armored Turkish riot police and a big police vehicle blocking the road .

Without any verbal warning , the vehicle lurched forward and unleashed its water cannon on the crowd . The demonstrators huddled behind their banner for a moment , until riot police unleashed a volley of tear gas canisters into the crowd .

As stinging , acrid smoke engulfed the neighborhood , the middle-aged Kurdish demonstrators quickly gave way to masked youths hurling stones and fireworks at the police .

The next day , Turkey 's chief prosecutor announced he was launching an investigation into the secularist gathering .

The crackdown during Republic Day in Ankara highlighted how powerless Turkey 's once dominant secular establishment has become . It has also led to accusations by long-time supporters in Turkish newspapers that Turkey 's Islamist-rooted prime minister is adopting the same authoritarian tactics of the secularist ancient regime .

The conflict developed a disturbing new dynamic in recent weeks as a mass hunger strike has spread through the Turkish penal system . According to the Turkish government statistics , at least 680 Kurdish prisoners are now starving themselves , some for nearly 50 days .

Last weekend , Turkey 's semiofficial Anatolian Agency reported a police officer was killed in an apparent rebel attack in southeastern Turkey , the main battle ground in the conflict .

`` Of course we are worried , '' said Feride Akdogan , whose 26-year old daughter Sehnaz had been on hunger strike for the past 15 days .

Ebu Bekir Polat and his wife , Behiye , were participating in the sit-in for their daughter Ciyan . She was arrested two and a half years ago at the age of 18 , Polat said , and accused of membership in a terrorist organization , though she had yet to be convicted in court .

He insisted the hunger strikers were staging their potentially lethal protest in the interest of peace .

`` These kids have given their bodies to the fire of hunger ... not just for the Kurdish people , but for the future of Turkey . So that this war can end , so that neither soldiers , police or guerillas in the mountains die , '' Polat added .

Last week , Turkey 's Justice Minister made a televised appeal to prisoners to stop their hunger strike .

But on Tuesday , riot police in Istanbul had little sympathy for relatives of the prisoners .

As squads of riot police and armored cars chased stone-throwing Kurds through the streets of Okmeydani , a police vehicle rounded a corner and started firing its water cannon at the tent where at least 20 mostly middle aged Kurdish women sat on carpets .

A lawyer for the Kurds rushed forward , arguing that the sit-in by the Kurdish mothers was peaceful and had nothing to do with the nearby street clashes .

`` They are throwing Molotov cocktails at us , '' a police commander answered . `` They can have 15 minutes to leave the area . ''

But less than five minutes later , armored police officers began ripping down the tent . Another officer popped open a tear gas canister and tossed it into the tent , at the feet of the increasingly panicked women inside .

As women stumbled to their feet half-blind trying to escape , a Kurdish man kicked the canister out of the tent . A police officer in a suit and gas mask then picked it up and threw it back into the tent .

`` Get the mothers ! Get the mothers out of there ! '' yelled a silver-haired Kurdish man named Ali Riza Bilgili , as he struggled to help a woman out of the tent .

`` Enough ! '' another Kurdish man screamed . `` What has this woman done wrong ? You 're only doing this because I do n't have a gun . ''

Moments later , the police withdrew . Reinforcements were arriving in the neighborhood . But the protests were also growing . A kilometer away , young Kurdish men momentarily blocked a major commercial road ... intimidating drivers by laying rocks on the pavement .

Turkey 's Kurdish conflict is still very far from over .
