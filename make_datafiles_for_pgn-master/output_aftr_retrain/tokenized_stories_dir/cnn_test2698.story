There 's no doubt that Obama has had his fill of dealing with Karzai 's on-again , off-again negotiations over how many troops would remain in the country after 2014 . And there 's no doubt that the relationship continues to deteriorate , CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said .

`` You can talk to senior officials going back into the Bush administration , they would tell you dealing with Karzai is sometimes like dealing with a child -- he 's unpredictable , he changes his mind -- so that 's part of it , '' King said .

Obama strongly considering complete pullout from Afghanistan

U.S. and Afghan officials had been discussing a residual force in the country post-2014 to fight insurgents and train Afghan security forces .

But the relationship between the two countries soured further last month after the United States and the Taliban planned peace talks and in response , Karzai cut off negotiations .

The Pentagon said no decision has been made and talks continue .

`` There 's also a big debate about this within the Pentagon . The generals are debating how many troops to leave behind , what 's the composition of the force . So the president is also serving notice to the Pentagon here -- ` I 'm going to keep the zero option , ' '' King said .

The Pentagon clearly would like to leave some troops in the country and that has been the plan all along , CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr said . `` But if Karzai wo n't negotiate an arrangement , then they simply ca n't stay . ''

Logistically , it is possible to get all U.S. troops out of the country by the end of 2014 but those decisions would need to be made now .

`` We need to know sooner rather than later , '' a U.S. Army official told CNN .

If Obama were to order a complete pullout , then the Army would have to establish schedules for troop withdrawals , shutting down bases , and shipping home equipment over the next 18 months , said an Army official who asked not to be identified because no decisions have been made .

It would also change schedules for troop rotations -- the Army is getting to the point that it would need to even out its schedule so that there are n't troops headed to Afghanistan late in 2014 only to come home a few months later , the official said .

Ultimately , the United States will make it 's decision based on its own national security interests , Labott said .

`` They are n't going to make a decision like that based on whether Karzai is more frustrating than usual - especially since they always find him frustrating , '' she said . `` Not having any troops in Afghanistan -- particularly special forces -- adjacent to Pakistan and Iran , among others would put the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage .
