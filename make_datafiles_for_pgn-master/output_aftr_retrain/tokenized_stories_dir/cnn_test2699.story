Quite what Gareth Bale 's $ 134 million journey to Real Madrid brings is open to conjecture , but with his painfully protracted transfer now concluded , the hard part really begins .

The spotlight on a British footballer on a global stage has never been greater , with the 24-year-old having eclipsed Cristiano Ronaldo as the world 's most expensive player of all time .

`` Why are there over the last 40 years only about five English players who have done well abroad ? '' said Dutch great Johan Cruyff , who both played for and coached Real 's rivals Barcelona . `` There 's something going on there , something strange . ''

Herbert Kilpin was the first British footballer to ply his trade overseas professionally in 1891 and he was a founding member of Italian club AC Milan eight years later .

But for the successes , there have been under-performances and failures , ranging from Ian Rush , who was famously but falsely quoted as saying his spell in Juventus was `` like playing in a foreign country , '' to fellow striker Mark Hughes , who managed just four goals in 28 games at Barcelona .

The language barrier is often given as the main reason for the initial struggle for Brits who have failed to settle .

It is no surprise that among those to shine were the players who swotted up on the lingo early on . David Platt began Italian lessons while still at Aston Villa -- a move to Bari then just a possibility -- while Steve McManaman mastered Spanish quickly to become at ease almost instantly with Real Madrid teammates and fans alike .

One of the current crop of Britons on the continent is Kris Thackray , currently with German side Alemannia Aachen , who has also had spells with Italian sides in five seasons away from home so far .

`` The language is the most important thing , not knowing it isolates you and stops you from expressing your personality and prevents you from understanding simple messages on and off the pitch . ''

Rush used to get his family to bring over digestive biscuits while former England goalkeeper Scott Carson , who spent two seasons in Turkey with Bursaspor , repeatedly bemoaned a lack of baked beans .

Jamie Lawrence is a young English player who has been in Holland since the age of 16 . He initially joined Ajax in the Dutch capital of Amsterdam and now , aged 21 , plays for RKC Waalwijk 's under-23 team .

His advice for Bale would be to immerse himself in the Spanish culture , which in turn will help him settle into the Madrid way of life .

For others , the issue was of being the virtual alien in the midst of a new bunch of players .

Kevin Keegan was a huge success story abroad with a spell at Hamburg , which resulted in two Bundesliga titles and with him twice being named European Footballer of the Year .

But things started far from well , with reports that some players would not even pass to him in training , unhappy he had been brought to the German club .

Making sure he does not fall by the wayside particularly with the size and variety of expectation -- from what he does on the field to off it -- is the big trick .

`` Is this a top three player and can he drive that commercial momentum ? Can he operate in the same side as Ronaldo ? Is he Ronaldo lite ? Will he have physical weaknesses ? It is unique opportunity and unique challenge .

Calvin , though , also makes the point that Bale is no innocent bystander in all this .

`` The whole scorpion dance of a big move comes in , '' added Calvin . `` He understands his clout . He is not an innocent . People in his situation are n't innocent . They are products of an occasionally brutal world . ''

Already , Bale has made about a third of Spanish newspaper Marca 's front pages in August alone .

On the issue of the media spotlight , Calvin said : `` His parents are model parents and helped him get through an academy system , which is predisposed to producing bad Dads and mad Mums .

`` That value structure will come under unprecedented scrutiny and he will have to quickly get used to the current absurdities of that world . That 's where he is going to have to readjust and recalibrate his life . ''

It could go a number of ways .

He could become Charles , nicknamed the gentle giant and voted Juventus ' greatest foreign import above Zinedine Zidane and Michel Platini , or else McMamanan , who is still talked favorably about by the Madridistas after winning the Champions League in his first season with Real .

Or else he could do down the Woodgate route , of being reviled rather than revered . The eyes of the world will be watching which way it goes .
