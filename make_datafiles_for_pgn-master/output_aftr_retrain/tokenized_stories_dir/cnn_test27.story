The suspect -- identified by the sheriff 's office as Anthony Giancola -- was taken into police custody after being tracked down by K-9 unit members . He has been arrested and formally booked on two counts of first-degree murder , sheriff 's spokeswoman Cecilia Barreda said .

Authorities said they first learned around 10:45 a.m. that four people had been stabbed at the group home in Lealman , a community just north of St. Petersburg .

One man , later identified as 27-year-old Justin Lee Vanderbergh , was pronounced dead at the scene , the sheriff 's office said .

After talking with witnesses , authorities identified the suspect as the 45-year-old Giancola .

The suspect fled the scene and headed toward a motel in nearby Pinellas Park , where a man and woman were assaulted , authorities said . The sheriff 's office said the man 's injuries `` appear to be life-threatening . ''

The sheriff 's office said the suspect then drove west and struck another person , this time a 13-year-old boy . The child suffered only minor injuries .

The suspect ended up at the Egg Platter restaurant in Pinellas Park , where he left his vehicle , entered another vehicle and fled . He was detained shortly after 1 p.m. , the sheriff 's office said .

In February 2007 , when he was a principal at a middle school in Hillsborough County , he was caught buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer -- an exchange captured on video that happened inside his principal 's office while school was in session .

`` Before I could ever hope to go on and help anyone again , I need to help myself , '' Giancola told CNN . `` I 'm very thankful I was arrested , and it kind of brought that crazy train to an end . ''
