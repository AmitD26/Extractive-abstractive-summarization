-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A decade after Angola emerged from devastating civil war , the sea front road that winds around the bay of its capital , Luanda , is now dotted with multi-million dollar condominiums , exclusive clubs , and boutique stores catering for the country 's elite .

Most of Luanda 's population , however , live in the nearby slums , where health facilities are non-existent and children must work , not study , to survive .

Africa 's natural resource wealth has certainly fueled a decade of rapid growth , but most Africans have still not seen the benefits . More urgently , rapid population growth combined with deepening inequality could one day prove explosive .

The challenge is to translate this wealth into meaningful benefit for African citizens .

Among our recommendations for African policy makers , the international community , and the private sector , five major themes emerge .

But there is still plenty of work to be done .

The international community must do more to tackle the issues of money laundering and anonymous shell companies , which facilitate corruption by hiding the true recipients of corrupt payments . This is a global challenge which requires multilateral solutions .

These issues may have been on this year 's G8 political agenda , but G8 leaders did little to legislate against anonymous company ownership in their jurisdictions . The world will be watching Australia 's G20 leadership next year for meaningful progress on this issue .

Second , African countries must secure a fairer share of natural resource revenues for their citizens .

Africa has too often received an unfair return on its mineral resources . At the beginning of this century , for example , half a million Zambians in the mining sector were paying a higher tax rate than the multinational companies they were working for .

Inevitably , some African governments have been at a natural disadvantage when negotiating with companies whose experience stretches over many decades and different continents too .

But fairer deals can be good for multinationals . Companies prefer a stable business environment and fairer deals tend to last much longer .

Between 2000 and 2011 , for example , Equatorial Guinea grew an average 17 percent per year , making it the fastest growing economy in the world and propelling it into the league of high-income countries . But three quarters of its population still live in poverty and its child mortality rates are among the highest in the world .

By using resource flows to eliminate malnutrition , African policymakers could eliminate the greatest barrier to Africa 's social and economic progress , which blights the lives of 40 percent of Africa 's children .

Governments must require extractive companies to procure more goods and services locally . But policy makers can also use extractive industries as a base for diversifying their economies .

Ultimately , it is in all our interests that Africa succeeds . We all benefit from an Africa that is prosperous , fair , and stable .
