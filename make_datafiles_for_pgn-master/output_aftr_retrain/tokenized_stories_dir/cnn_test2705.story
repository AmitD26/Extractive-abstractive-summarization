-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The news that Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge , is pregnant is being celebrated throughout Britain , the British Commonwealth and beyond . As well as wonderful news for the royal couple , it has positive implications for the future of the British monarchy .

Although we ca n't know what the child 's name will be , we can be sure that he or she will have a lot of them : Some heirs to the throne had as many as seven or eight . Should they have a girl , it would be surprising if the names Elizabeth , after her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II and great-great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother , and Diana , after her paternal grandmother , are missing from the list .

Any concerns that Prince Harry might one day have ascended the British throne -- he was third in line and will soon be fourth -- have been allayed by this announcement . Granted , he was a brave soldier who saw action fighting against the Taliban in Afghanistan , but he was not really considered suitable material for a king . The knowledge that Catherine can have children removes the danger that a future King Harry might embarrass the nation with his naked hijinks and Las Vegas antics .

What we do know is that the child will be brought up in the harshest of media spotlights and will remain in its full flood for a lifetime . Bookmakers already are taking bets on the color of the baby 's hair .

News : Royal baby announcement marks dramatic break with tradition

The British state is far more protective toward its royals than it was in the days of Prince Charles and Princess Diana , and it is fully conscious of the disasters that can arise when the paparazzi are in full pursuit . The public , too , despises those who invade the younger royals ' private lives , although admittedly that has not stopped people from buying the newspapers and visiting the websites responsible for the worst excesses .

Although 1992 was an `` annus horribilis '' for the queen , when Windsor Castle suffered a terrible fire and two of her children 's marriages collapsed , 2012 has been a wonderful 12 months , more than making up for it two decades later .

The Diamond Jubilee was spectacular , proving yet again how much the British people love her . The London Olympics were a huge success . And the future of her dynasty seems on the verge of being confirmed throughout this century and beyond .

There will be talk , inevitably , of whether the queen or perhaps the future King Charles III might abdicate , to avoid a situation in which the next three monarchs will be advanced in years . This will not happen .

Abdication is not in her job description : She considers it a dereliction of duty , something that disgraced her uncle King Edward VIII with the family . If she lives as long as the Queen Mother , she will still be on the throne in 2027 , which will almost inevitably mean that her successor King Charles III would have one of the shorter reigns , as he would be nearly 80 when he acceded .

Part of the lottery of monarchy is that one can not predict the future , and the job only makes sense if it is for life . One of the strengths of having a family serve as successive heads of state is that when a bad chapter ends , a better one can begin .

With the birth of what would have been her first grandchild , the shade of Princess Diana 's era is forever behind the House of Windsor , and the British people can look forward to a new generation of royals . Small wonder that Britain and the world are celebrating with William and Kate .
