The primary risk with Ryan , from what we currently know about him , is that his controversial budget plan and tough line on Medicare could energize liberals and alienate elderly voters in key states like Florida . He also lacks foreign policy expertise and has spent most of his career in the city that conservatives hate , Washington . In recent decades , the record of vice presidential running mates who have come right out of the House is not very good .

The risk of making the wrong choice for vice president was highlighted in 2008 by Sen. John McCain 's selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , a decision many believe helped torpedo the Republican nominee . Palin struggled before the media , appearing inexperienced and unprepared for the Oval Office . She also used aggressive conservative rhetoric that undercut McCain 's appeal to independents .

But for all the talk about what can go wrong with vice presidential nominations , it is important to remember how many of these picks have helped the ticket . Very often vice presidential running mates have proven to be excellent on the campaign trail . They have compensated for the weaknesses of the person at the top of the ticket , they have played the role of attack dog and they have complemented the presidential candidate 's strengths .

Although a scandal involving a contribution fund Nixon maintained as senator almost caused him to be dumped from the ticket , Nixon turned the table on Democrats by going on television and delivering the famous `` Checkers Speech , '' in which he turned public sympathy in his favor . After hearing the speech , Eisenhower met with Nixon and said , `` Dick , you 're my boy . ''

A few years later , Nixon fell victim to a good vice presidential pick when he ran for president against John F. Kennedy in 1960 . Though he was disliked by many liberals , former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson gave the Democrats strong appeal in Southern states and also helped bring an impressive level of Washington expertise to the ticket .

In 1968 , Nixon picked Maryland Gov. Spiro Agnew , who certainly brought his fair share of problems . Agnew was mocked by his opponents as a little known politician and uttered his share of gaffes as well as ethnic slurs . Yet Agnew did contribute to Nixon 's victory by simultaneously appealing to the center , given his moderate record as governor in most policy areas , and to Southerners , given his increasingly hard line on racial issues such as school busing and law and order . Like Nixon in 1952 , Agnew served as the attack dog and allowed Nixon , who had remade himself from an avid Cold Warrior into a foreign policy expert , to maintain his new image .

Tennessee Sen. Al Gore proved to be a pitch-perfect running mate for Bill Clinton in 1992 . Clinton wanted to convey the impression that Democrats were no longer the old `` tax and spend '' party Republicans had enjoyed attacking . Clinton was a Southerner and part of a new generation of Democrats . Gore , a hawkish centrist who agreed with Clinton , complemented the party message .

Together , Clinton and Gore counteracted the ability of President Bush , and then in 1996 Sen. Bob Dole , to draw on the familiar campaign themes of the GOP . Simply the image of the two youthful men and their families generated excitement among voters .

It is possible that Ryan could help Mitt Romney in the coming months -- and he could use a boost , since he 's 7 points behind Obama in the latest CNN poll .

Anything more probably wo n't work , anything less will be a bust .
