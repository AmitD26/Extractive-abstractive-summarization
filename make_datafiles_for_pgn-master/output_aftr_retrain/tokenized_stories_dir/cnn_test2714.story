Top seed Del Potro , who will be a dangerous outsider in the British capital , won 7-6 2-6 6-4 in two hours 20 minutes , denying former World No. 1 Federer his sixth title in the event and repeating his 2012 victory over him in the title match .

The Argentine won a tight first set which saw them exchange breaks before it went to a tiebreaker which Del Potro took 7-3 .

Federer , who recently parted with coach Paul Annacone after a disappointing 2013 , hit back to level the match as two breaks of service gave him the second set .

`` I 'm sorry again to beat you here , '' he said apologetically at the trophy presentation . `` He 's the hero here and for me my biggest inspiration .

`` You make history at every tournament you play . I 'm proud to be playing at the same time as you . ''
