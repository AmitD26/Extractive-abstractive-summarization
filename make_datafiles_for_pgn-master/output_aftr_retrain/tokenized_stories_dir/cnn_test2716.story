Sandusky , 69 , a former defensive coordinator , was convicted last year of sexually abusing 10 boys he met through his charity . He is serving a 30-to 60-year prison term .

But the sanctions against Penn State mostly revolved around an alleged cover-up by the university 's former president , vice president and athletic director .

All three men are facing trial in the spring on charges they lied to authorities and never reported an incident of sexual abuse witnessed in 2001 in the Penn State locker room facilities .

The gradual restoration of scholarships was recommended to the NCAA board by former Sen. George Mitchell , the athletics integrity monitor for the university , for the school 's `` groundbreaking work '' and `` strong commitment to restore integrity '' in the last year .

Mitchell said Tuesday that the school has consistently cooperated with the NCAA since the sanctions were imposed . Mitchell said more than 120 reforms have been implemented , and Penn State has become a model for reform at other schools .

The NCAA has never before rescinded sanctions imposed against a university .

Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the change represents `` significant efforts over the past year to make Penn State a safer , stronger institution . ''

NCAA President Mark Emmert , who has been widely criticized for relying on the university 's independent report instead of launching his own NCAA investigation at Penn State , said the board was `` pleased '' to make this decision .

The role of Paterno , who died in January 2012 , in the cover-up has been widely debated . In an internal investigation done for the university , FBI director Louis Freeh concluded that Paterno played a role , but former state prosecutors handling the case said they found no evidence of that .
