-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Fox chose an auspicious moment to greenlight a Batman prequel show .

The same day the network announced `` Gotham , '' eternal rival Marvel saw its multi-punctuated `` Avengers '' spin-off `` Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. '' deliver a dominant series-premiere ratings performance .

`` S.H.I.E.L.D. 's '' success is proof-of-concept for a new Superhero-Adjacent genre : A show set in a familiar super-universe that focuses on the less-super -LRB- and decidedly cheaper -RRB- heroes .

1 . It will probably have a strong narrative foundation from `` Batman : Year One . '' Although less famous than Frank Miller 's other grim-and-gritty '80s Caped Crusader adventure , The Dark Knight Returns , Miller 's four-part origin-story collaboration with artist David Mazzucchelli has arguably been more influential . Year One provided the structural backbone for Batman Begins and strongly influenced the grounded portrayal of Gotham City through Christopher Nolan 's trilogy .

The new series might be Batman-free , but Year One is just as much an origin story for Jim Gordon . A younger Gordon arrives in Gotham as a Chicago transplant with a pregnant wife and discovers the Gotham police department is filled with corruption . He becomes a kind of Elliot Ness figure , a hero cop who refuses to take money ; meanwhile , his personal life falls into shambles . Since Gotham is on network TV , the rampant corruption will probably be toned down , but do n't be surprised if Gordon becomes a great-at-his-job / bad-at-his-life procedural protagonist .

4 . But the show 's ambitions could grow , as it explores the history of Gotham . Batman 's hometown has probably the most substantive history of any superhero city . Over the years , various writers and projects have used Gotham 's dark-side-of-America persona as a chance to explore just about every bleak thing that has ever happened in the history of the American City . Will Gotham feature anything about the history of the Wayne family ? Or the tangled families of the Gotham underworld ? Could we ever get a trip to Wonder City , a prototype utopia fallen into disarray that appeared in Arkham City ? Could season 5 of Gotham just be a long Batman-free retelling of the incredible earthquake-apocalypse story arc of `` No Man 's Land '' ? Remember : Heller also produced Rome , HBO 's proto-Game of Thrones , which constantly set its characters ' struggles against the history of their society .

5 . Clearly , the Riddler should be the Big Bad . Has any Batman villain had a rougher go of it in the modern era ? He 's the most famous Bat-baddie to not get a Nolanized reinterpretation -- which means that his most prominent appearance in the last two decades of pop culture was Jim Carrey 's green-tights performance in Batman Forever . But the Riddler could make for a great antagonist in a procedural : His whole existence is based around coming up with ever-more-elaborate mysteries . Also , if the creators of Gotham want to slowly back up into the crazier aspects of the Batman mythology -- no Mr. Freeze , no Clayface -- the Riddler is a real-ish psychotic . They could even play around with the Riddler 's iconography : Maybe , in this retelling , he 's Gordon 's main nemesis . Or maybe he 's initially working with the Gotham PD in some kind of expert capacity , like Hannibal in Hannibal . Come on guys , the Riddler ! He makes riddles !
