Last month , a suicide bomber blew up a car in Egypt 's Sinai , killing four security officers and wounding four others . And a bombing that targeted a military intelligence building bordering on the Sinai , wounded at least six soldiers .

No claim of responsibility has been reported in Wednesday 's attack .

Islamist militants have become more active in the Sinai in recent years .

The Egyptian revolution of 2011 that toppled strongman President Hosni Mubarak brought a resurgence of Islamists whom his military regime had repressed for decades .

This included more moderate factions like the Muslim Brotherhood , which swept into power when Mohamed Morsy became President in Egypt 's first democratic elections .
