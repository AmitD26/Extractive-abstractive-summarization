Here are five things that will help you contribute to the morning buzz about television 's biggest night :

You 're forgiven if you said , `` Who ? '' when the `` Nurse Jackie '' actress was announced as the Emmy winner for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy . Unless you 're a fan of the show , you may not have been aware of Wever or her smart turn as nurse Zoey Barkow on the Showtime series .

But thanks to what host Neil Patrick Harris called the `` best speech ever , '' plenty of people are now talking about Wever . After receiving the first award of the evening , Wever took to the stage and hastily said , `` Thank you so very much . Um , I got ta go , bye . ''

2 -RRB- Neil Patrick Harris , we wanted to love you more .

3 -RRB- Michael Douglas loves innuendo .

The actor scored a best actor in a movie or miniseries Emmy for his role as Liberace in the HBO movie `` Behind the Candelabra , '' and he used the moment as an opportunity to tease co-star Matt Damon , who played Liberace 's lover .

Calling his Emmy statue a `` two-hander , '' Douglas quipped , `` And Matt , you 're only as good as your other hand . ... You were magnificent , and the only reason I 'm standing here is because of you . So you really deserve half of this . Do you want the bottom or the top ? ''

Cue Damon laughing .

Yes , we lost some stars this year , and the decision to pay homage to some of them -- including James Gandolfini and Cory Monteith -- seemed like a lovely idea .

`` I really felt like Larry Hagman should have been honored in that group of five actors that passed this year that were honored in a very heartfelt and moving way , '' Hagman 's `` Dallas '' co-star Jesse Metcalfe told CNN . `` I thought he deserved to be singled out as well . ''

5 -RRB- Will Ferrell and his kids are way funnier than most of Hollywood .

Ferrell presented the last two awards of the evening -- best comedy and best drama -- with an assist from his three sons : Magnus , 9 , Mattias , 6 , and Axel , 3 .

`` Unfortunately Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith dropped out at the last second , and they called me literally 45 minutes ago and I could n't find child care , OK , '' Ferrell explained . `` We had a soccer game ; there was a neighbor 's birthday party , a nut allergy , I did n't have time to do my hair . It does n't matter , it 's great to be here . ''
