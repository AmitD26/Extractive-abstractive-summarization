The mall , normally a calm refuge in an often turbulent city , is itself a tourist draw in the Kenyan capital , and suspected Islamist militants may have targeted it partly for that reason .

`` It 's a really international place , '' Isha Saini , a Nairobi interior designer , told CNN .

`` Lots of expats and other foreigners go there on the weekend for lunch .

Foreigners among dead

Among those killed in the mall siege were three British citizens , two French nationals and two Canadians , their governments said .

Several American citizens were among the wounded . The attack is the latest of several incidents in the past few years to have hurt the country 's tourism image .

In late 2011 , a British man , David Tebbutt , was killed and his wife held hostage for 192 days in an attack by Somali pirates on the couple 's luxury resort near Kenya 's Lamu Island .

In October of the same year , an elderly French expatriate was kidnapped from her home on Manda island , in the Lamu archipelago , and died shortly afterwards owing to her fragile health .

In March this year , the month of national elections , tourists were warned to stay away from Kenya over fears of a repeat of the violence that followed the country 's last such poll , in 2007 , when more than 1,200 people died .

A few months later , in early August this year , a huge fire destroyed large parts of Nairobi 's Kenyatta International Airport , a major African transport hub .

In a statement on the Nairobi mall attack -- which latest reports suggest authorities are close to resolving -- Kenya 's tourism and commerce secretary , Phyllis Kandie , condemned what she called `` a despicable act of cowardice intended to instill fear among Kenyans and our visitors . ''

Tourist facilities throughout the country were `` operating normally , '' she said , and the government had `` scaled up security '' in these and other `` social places . ''

Two tourism conferences -- one on hotel investment and another on eco-tourism -- were due to go ahead in Nairobi this week , Kandie said .

She also noted that the British government had not changed its official travel advice on Kenya .

At the time of writing , the U.S. state department 's advice also remained unchanged .

Tourism boost

Yet from 2008 to 20011 tourist arrivals in Kenya climbed from approximately 1.2 million to 1.8 million , according to Kenyan government figures -- a 50 % increase .

For decades , wildlife safaris have been Kenya 's top tourism draw .

Kenya 's Indian Ocean beach resorts are another big attraction , as is the dramatic landscape of cliffs and gorges in Hell 's Gate National Park .

Despite the weekend attack and the city 's generally edgy reputation , the cafes and nightlife of Nairobi also offer one of the liveliest slices of urban existence in Africa .
