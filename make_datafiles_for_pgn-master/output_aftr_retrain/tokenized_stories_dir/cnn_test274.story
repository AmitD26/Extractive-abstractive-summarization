-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have unveiled their itinerary for their visit to New Zealand and Australia next month -- but it 's unclear whether Prince George will be attending engagements with them .

Announcing the royal couple 's planned engagements on the April 7 -25 visit , the Prince 's private secretary identified occasions at which the youngest royal might be present , but kept an element of suspense :

`` George being just a little over eight-months-old by the time they travel , I 'm sure you will appreciate that the couple will have to make a final decision on those moments much closer to the time . ''

One of the engagements earmarked for a potential appearance for Prince George is the opening of the Bilby Enclosure at Taronga Zoo in Sydney .

Last month , Australasian media seized on reports Australia 's incoming governor general had apparently let slip that George would make his first official visit Down Under .

The royal couple were looking forward to their trip to both countries `` immensely , '' Kensington Palace said .

`` There 's no hiding the enthusiasm for the visit by both the Duke and the Duchess . The Duke , because he has been before ; and the Duchess because she has never been to either country but has wanted to do so as long as she can remember .

Kensington Palace said the Duke and Duchess were `` just a little competitive '' and some of the events on the itinerary will pit husband against wife .

`` Again , I think we can expect some pretty competitive outbursts , '' the palace said .

A century after the outbreak of World War I , the tour will also see William and Kate paying tribute to both countries ' war dead and visiting military bases .

Their last day will be April 25 -- ANZAC -LSB- Australian and New Zealand Army Corps -RSB- Day , which originally marked the landing of soldiers from both nations at Gallipoli , Turkey , in 1915 . In the eight-month campaign fought there , 2,721 New Zealanders and 8,709 Australians died , before the allied forces withdrew . The day is now a tribute to those who have died in all conflicts .

The Duke and Duchess will plant a seed from a pine tree at the site of the battle at the Australian War Memorial in Australia 's capital city , Canberra , before returning to London .
