-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I turned 18 years old a week before Election Day in 1982 and was excited to exercise my newly earned right to vote . The first ballot I ever cast was for United States Senate . The race pitted a popular veteran Congresswoman against a political neophyte businessman who was the decided underdog . The underdog won . His name was Frank Lautenberg .

Lautenberg was unabashedly liberal on social issues such as abortion , the environment , and gun control . His major legislative legacy , though , centers on transportation issues . He was a strong supporter of improving the country 's mass transit infrastructure including funding Amtrak .

Memories of his father 's early death attributed to unhealthy working conditions , though , kept Lautenberg fighting on the environmental front . In fact , he used transportation-related legislation to further his larger health and safety agenda . This included a smoking ban on airplanes , which was the first widespread limitation on using tobacco in public . He also created a de facto national drinking age by reducing federal highway funds for states whose minimum age was lower than 21 .

Some observers thought that the octogenarian met his match in 2010 . That was when recently-elected New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- hardly a shrinking violet himself -- cancelled plans to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River to New York City . Lautenberg came out swinging , calling Christie 's decision one of `` the biggest public policy blunders in New Jersey 's history . '' The feud escalated , but Lautenberg would not back down . The two did n't really patch things up until they worked together to get federal aid for Hurricane Sandy recovery .

Lautenberg leaves tricky political question for Christie

Republican Gov. Tom Kean , who had won the closest gubernatorial election in state history only a few months before , opted to appoint a placeholder as a gesture of goodwill . As a result , it was Lautenberg who was able to squeeze out a come-from-behind 4-point win over Congresswoman Millicent Fenwick .

If the election is held this year , whoever runs as the GOP standard-bearer for the remainder of the term could appear on the same ballot as the extremely popular Chris Christie . Considering the coattails potential of his almost certain re-election bid , there is no better time for Republicans to take this seat . If they win now , they will have a voter-tested incumbent running for a full term in 2014 .

Christie can also call a special election for the senate seat before the gubernatorial election in November . This could be a free-for-all with many Democrats and Republicans getting into the fray , although Democrats would have a greater chance of holding onto the seat in this scenario .

None of the possible contenders , though , can claim the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps , Greatest Generation personal story that shaped Frank Lautenberg 's years of public service . Regardless of who fills the seat , one thing is clear : We will not see another `` swamp dog '' in the U.S. Senate .
