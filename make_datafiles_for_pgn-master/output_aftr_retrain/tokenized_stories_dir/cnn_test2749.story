Peshawar , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seven teachers abducted last week for supporting a polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan 's tribal Khyber Agency have been released by militants , their school principal said Tuesday .

Anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants in Pakistan since U.S. intelligence officials used a fake vaccination program to help in their hunt for Osama bin Laden in 2011 . Under cover of the program , the CIA sought to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad .

Since July 2012 , at least 22 polio workers have been killed .

Last year , a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continued its campaign of drone strikes .

At least 16 cases of polio have been reported this year in Khyber Agency . Law and order problems in Bara have left it particularly vulnerable to the disease , which has been declared eradicated from adjacent India .

Polio , which can cause permanent paralysis in hours , remains endemic only in Pakistan , Nigeria and Afghanistan .

As of November 19 , it has seen 63 cases this year versus 54 cases as of that date last year , he said last week in a telephone interview .

A second concern is spread of the infectious viral disease from Pakistan to other parts of the world -- cases diagnosed this year in Afghanistan have been linked directly to virus from Pakistan , he said .
