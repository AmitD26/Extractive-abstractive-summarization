Mexico City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After awaiting reforms that may or may not come , thousands of young undocumented immigrants have abandoned their American Dream voluntarily or because they were deported . They still consider themselves DREAMers , but now they dream in Mexico .

`` I returned -LRB- to Mexico -RRB- because in the U.S. I always wanted to study dentistry . When I graduated from college , I ran into the problem that my great hope , the DREAM Act , still had not been approved , '' said Pedro Hernandez , who lived in Los Angeles for eight years .

The DREAM Act -- Development , Relief , and Education for Alien Minors -- would remove a roadblock to education and a future in the United States for such youths .

In general , undocumented immigrants in the United States can not get a driver 's license or credit cards , and can not travel freely in the country .

`` I could n't move around like I wanted , and to go to school I had to drive with fear , '' said Moises Zarco , 27 . Originally from Mexico 's east-central state of Hidalgo , Zarco lived in Georgia for eight years . Six states recently approved laws that allow the undocumented to have driver 's licenses .

`` Everything seems nice on the surface , but you do n't really belong to that place and you 're never going to be American even if you have your papers , '' said Samantha Hernandez , who voluntarily returned to her city , Tijuana .

Only 5 % to 35 % of those who returned to Mexico during the past five years and remained there did not go back voluntarily , the Pew Hispanic Center estimates . The range is wide because `` data on who is sent back and what happens to them are sketchy , '' it says on its website .

The majority had experienced a lack of educational and job opportunities , and increases in anti-immigrant policies , the center says , citing government data from both countries .

In Zarco 's case , police stopped him on the state line between Georgia and Florida , and he was detained for being in the country illegally . He spent three months in a detention center in Miami and later returned to Mexico City , where his mother awaited .

`` When I arrived I was very happy to see my family , but at the same time very sad because I had left everything behind , '' he said . `` All my dreams had collapsed . ''

`` My mother was living in the U.S. and she decided to take me there , '' Zarco said . `` I did n't want to go because I did n't want to leave my friends and my relatives . ''

`` I never felt like a U.S. citizen , I always felt like a Mexican , '' said Daniel Arenas , who lived in the United States for 14 years .

` From here and from there '

While it is true that the obstacles the youth face depend on individual circumstances , `` 100 % go through traumatic events because of the separation and lack of belonging , '' according to Jill Anderson , author of a book called `` The Other Dreamers . ''

`` It 's hard to understand that they can be both from here and from there , '' she said .

`` You belong to a country that you have not lived in , that you do n't know , '' said Marco Antonio Castillo , president of the Popular Assembly of Migrant Families , a Mexico City-based group that helps advise migrants .

The loneliness and confusion in dealing with the new environment can push many youths to join organized crime , Castillo said .

Anderson leads a group that shares the name of her book , whose members insist on finding the Mexican Dream and seek opportunities in their country . The group , formed by youth immigrants who returned to Mexico , was born out of the impact they suffered upon their return , feeling lost among the legal paperwork and social customs . They used a Facebook page to orient themselves on how to maneuver through the Mexican bureaucracy .

Many do n't speak Spanish well and the Mexican system does n't have programs for social reinsertion .

`` The migrants do n't know how to do the paperwork and to what agencies to go to , '' Anderson said .

`` Returning to Mexico and not speaking Spanish or dressing a certain way , or liking a certain type of music , also creates conflict , '' Arenas said .

Sometimes , a lack of family support or economic resources keep needed paperwork from being completed .

In most cases , the young immigrants left their families in the United States . They dream of returning to see them or to earn a livelihood in Mexico to bring them over . The loneliness and emotional exhaustion can bring feelings of not belonging to any place .

But that is not true in every case .

`` It 's true , I am achieving my Mexican Dream now in this moment , but my life is incomplete , '' said another youth , Pedro Hernandez . `` I am far from my family . ''
