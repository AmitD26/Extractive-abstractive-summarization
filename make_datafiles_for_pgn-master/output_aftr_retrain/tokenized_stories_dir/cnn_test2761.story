Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan government and rebel officials offered wildly disparate views of the situation on the ground Sunday , as gunfire and explosions continued to rock Tripoli not far from the home of embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi .

Saif al-Islam Gadhafi , the ruler 's son and a top official in his regime , insisted on Libyan state-run television that the rebels were losing every battle -- saying so hours after his father told supporters that the `` traitors '' and their NATO allies were lying and nearing their end .

Faithi Baja , political affairs chief for the rebel 's Transitional National Council , said early Sunday in a video statement that rebel fighters freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is `` going easily '' and they are inching toward Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound .

`` Most of the neighhoods in Tripoli are rising up , '' Jumma Ibrahim said .

`` A great thing , anyway , that despite the Christian air raids , you continue to be up in Tripoli , '' he said , an apparent reference to those who listened to his speech from Green Square . `` March forward , march forward , march forward .

`` They have lost and used everything , and their last resort is their lying campaign . Now , this is the ending , '' he added .

The rebel spokesman , Jumma Ibrahim , claimed opposition fighters control the main intelligence operations building in Tripoli . He also said some Libyan army personnel had defected and joined the rebels in the vicinity of the capital 's airport , which he claimed the rebels were able to take over with their newfound support .

Musa Ibrahim , the government spokesman , denied that the airport had switched hands -- insisting , as with the rest of Tripoli , it was safe and under the control of Gadhafi 's forces .

Jumma Ibrahim , the rebel spokesman , said the clashes in Tripoli were `` planned by rebels inside Tripoli in the neighborhoods of Fashloum , Souq al-Juma , Ben Ashur ... and other places . '' This came after coordination with other anti-Gadhafi elements , added Baja .

Musa Ibrahim confirmed that armed men had entered those three neighborhoods in the capital , but said they were confronted and defeated in a matter of minutes .

Hours earlier , Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim rejected rebel claims that the governments of Egypt , Morocco , Tunisia and Algeria have been asked to accept Gadhafi and his family . And Gadhafi , in his speech early Sunday morning , stated unequivocally that he is still in Libya .

Officials from the United States and NATO , whose forces have launched scores of strikes on Gadhafi 's forces , also said they have no indication the Libyan leader is making preparations to leave .

A U.S. official said Friday that Gadhafi might be preparing for a `` last stand '' in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances .

The officials , who have knowledge of the situation on the ground , did not want to be named because of the sensitive intelligence matters .

`` Impossible to say when he 'll go , but it 's clear that he will go , '' Toner told CNN .

The fighting continues , meanwhile , on a number of fronts , including in the west , where fighting has raged for days over the strategic city of Zawiya , about 30 miles west of Tripoli and a major supply route to the capital .

On Saturday , it appeared the rebels had taken control of all of Zawiya after pushing Gadhafi 's forces beyond the east gate , according to CNN 's Sara Sidner who is in the city . Artillery fire could be heard , and mortars were launched toward Zawiya on Saturday , she reported . Rebel fighters told Sidner that NATO had warned civilians to leave the main part of the city . NATO has not yet commented on that statement .

Musa Ibrahim , the Libyan government spokesman , said late Saturday that Gadhafi 's forces are surrounding Zawiya and still control it .

Earlier , the rebels seized a major oil refinery in Zawiya and controlled only the western part of the city , said Hobab Jomaa , a rebel fighter .

But Saif al-Islam Gadhafi sarcastically laughed at the idea the opposition would take Tripoli . And he was emphatic that he , his father and their supporters would not surrender .
