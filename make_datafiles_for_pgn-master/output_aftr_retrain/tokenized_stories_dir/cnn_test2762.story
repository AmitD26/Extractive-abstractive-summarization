-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky has applied for a Swiss visa , less than a week after his pardon and release from a Russian prison , authorities said Wednesday .

Schengen visas entitle citizens of the European Union the right to travel , work and live in any EU country without special formalities and enable their holders to move through participating countries without being subjected to border checks .

Pavel Khodorkovsky said his father applied for a regular visa and there was no discussion of asylum for now .

A spokesman for Khodorkovsky , Christian Hanne , told CNN the former oil tycoon 's application for a Swiss visa did not mean he has made long-term plans to settle in Switzerland . Hanne said Khodorkovsky 's twin sons attend school in Switzerland and their father hoped to see where they go to school .

Russian courts will take a second look at cases against Khodorkovsky , state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported .

The Supreme Court ordered the review Wednesday , citing the European Court of Human Rights criticism of the tax evasion and fraud case in July .

The latest developments in the Khodorkovsky case , which observers said harmed foreign investment because it smacked of political repression , come less than two months before the world focuses on Russia for the Sochi Olympics .

`` They will then have one more hurdle -- securing exit visas in their passports -- before the non-Russians are free to leave the country and be reunited with their families , '' Greenpeace said on its website . `` A meeting with the Federal Migration Service is scheduled for later today . The Arctic 30 are expected to leave Russia in the coming days . ''

The so-called Arctic 30 , charged initially with piracy but later with hooliganism , were released on bail in November after spending more than two months behind bars for protesting oil drilling in the environmentally sensitive Arctic region , RIA Novosti reported .

He became both a political and economic threat to Putin by wanting to create a commercial oil pipeline that would break the government monopoly on the industry and by funding opposition politicians , according to observers .

Khodorkovsky , who was due for release next year , wrote Putin a letter from prison that asked for early release because his mother was ailing . He insisted the letter contained no admission of guilt , and Putin said the pardon was on humanitarian grounds .

Upon his release , Khodorkovsky left the country . He has said he wo n't continue his political activities against the Russian government .
