As observers try to determine what time it is in American politics , they arrive at opposite conclusions .

To some , said Tulane University political scientist Thomas Langston , Obama is like Jimmy Carter , and the nation will soon hammer the nails into the coffin of a dying Democratic coalition just as voters , tired of the Carter `` malaise '' era , handed the White House to Republicans in 1980 .

To others , Obama has come to usher in a new understanding of the relationship between the government and the people . To them , Langston said , it 's the dawning of a new age , as depicted in a famous 1984 Ronald Reagan campaign ad that declared , `` It 's morning again in America . ''

`` With Carter himself , there was a sense of a kind of national renewal in some ways that people have said has been true after the very difficult years of the Bush presidency , '' said Russell Riley , chair of the Miller Center 's Presidential Oral History Program at the University of Virginia .

The comparison to Carter , Gergen said , is more of a danger sign for Obama than it is a reality because it shows how the storyline has changed .

When Obama first came into office , observers likened him to some of the most successful presidents in U.S. history , such as Franklin Roosevelt , Gergen said . Now , Obama 's also being compared to a president who did n't live up to expectations .

The Carter comparison shows how much polarization has occurred in the country since the election , Gergen said .

Under Carter , there was also a sense of polarization -- but it was in the president 's party . The liberal wing of the Democrats felt abandoned to the point that Sen. Edward Kennedy , one of the top liberals in Congress , challenged Carter in his 1980 re-election bid . Kennedy came up short , but his bid severely weakened Carter and contributed to his eventual defeat in the 1980 election to Reagan , Riley said .

While the similarities are not lost on Riley , what 's more telling is the `` most important mistake that -LSB- Obama -RSB- did n't make . ''

That move was critical , Riley said , `` because if you 've got seasoned people in these positions , they 're much more likely to make adjustments and to know Capitol Hill in a way that will allow them to weather the kinds of problems that were common to both Carter and Obama . ''

John Geer , a Vanderbilt University political scientist , said the comparisons to Carter are weak .

`` Jimmy Carter is a very rare exception in American history . Most first-term presidents get a second term , '' he said , adding that it 's especially rare since Carter 's term came on the heels of previous Republican rule .

The more analogous comparison so far , Geer said , is to Reagan , who also entered the White House with a full plate of foreign policy problems -- mostly surrounding the Cold War -- and a major economic crisis at hand .

Reagan was a gifted politician , Geer said . He was known as an inspiring communicator , and his appeal crossed party lines . Like Obama , polls showed that Reagan was more popular than his policies . More than 20 years after he left the White House , Republicans still look to him as the last great face of the party .

`` Reagan spoke to America 's longing for order , our need to believe that we are not simply subject to blind , impersonal forces but that we can shape our individual and collective destinies , so long as we rediscover the traditional values of hard work , patriotism , personal responsibility , optimism , and faith , '' he wrote .

Gergen , who was director of communications for Reagan , said the comparisons to Reagan are strained because of their opposite governing styles . Where as Obama tries to draw consensus , Reagan drew lines , he said .

Faced with an economic crisis , Reagan 's strategy was to reduce taxes , let the American people figure out what to do and then find out what went wrong , Anderson said .

After Reagan cut taxes in his first year , there were no immediate changes . `` It looked terrible , and it did n't look very good during the second year . And then it began to catch and it worked ... and it was really terrific on the third and the fourth and the fifth and so on , '' Anderson said . As for Obama 's approach to country 's economic woes -- it 's too early to tell what will happen , he said .

But within weeks , Reagan was back at work -- with a positive attitude and good sense of humor .

As tragic as the 1981 assassination attempt was , Reagan 's quick recovery -- and the sympathy from Democrats -- provided momentum for the president 's agenda .

`` The first year is a very tough year for any president , '' Anderson said , noting that each year thereafter is `` dramatically different . '' Asked what he thinks about comparisons to Carter and Reagan , Anderson replied , `` You know who he looks like ? Obama . ''

Looking to administrations past , Obama can learn a valuable lesson , Gergen said .

`` Do n't spend time wallowing in arguments about who you might be -- spend time worrying about who you are and worrying about governing . ''

`` There is no exact historical parallel to what we are looking at right now . There are bits and pieces here and there , '' he said . It 's impossible , however to take those similarities and `` piece out from them a guaranteed scenario that he is going to end up in the same place . ''

That idea , he said , is perhaps best summed up in a quote attributed to Mark Twain : `` History does n't repeat itself , it rhymes . ''
