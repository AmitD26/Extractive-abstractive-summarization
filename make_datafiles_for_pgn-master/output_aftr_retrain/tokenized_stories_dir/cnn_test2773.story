I have been an industry analyst following the wireless industry since its beginning . I have have followed and commented on many companies and technologies over nearly 30 years . I have learned quite a bit over this time .

One of the key points I have learned is this : The wireless industry reinvents itself every few years . And the smartwatch revolution is getting ready to sweep across and transform the wireless industry once again .

Suddenly the marketplace leaders have changed . Today they are Apple with the iPhone and iPad , Google Android and Samsung with the Galaxy smartphones and tablets .

The Samsung smartwatch is not a stand-alone device . Rather it connects and communicates with the Galaxy phones and tablets .

Why do we need a watch ? Well the smartphone is growing in importance to many of us . Yesterday we would n't leave the house without taking our keys , wallet and smartphone . Tomorrow all we 'll have to grab is the smartphone .

It will open our doors and start our cars , it will have credit card information and drivers license and pictures and all sorts of other goodies . It will let us communicate with our doctors , our car , retail stores and so on .

You 'll have access to your calendar and all sorts of apps based on what you want to see on the watch . It 's up to you . But it all works together over the cloud .

The smartwatch will be your remote control for your smart phone . And your smart phone will be your remote control for your life . What a beautiful world .

So let me ask you a question . If you have all these devices , where do you store your data ? We used to synch everything with our laptops , but going forward we 'll synch to the cloud .

Sure there are risks . You have to protect your data like you do on your laptop . And you have to hope the bad guys do n't invade the cloud services that will start popping up all over the place .

So Samsung wants you to buy a Samsung smartwatch to talk with your Samsung Galaxy smartphone that talks with your Samsung Galaxy tablet and you can store all your information on the Samsung cloud or Google cloud .

The benefit to Samsung and Google is the more pieces of the puzzle you buy from them , the more they 've got you . And they want to get you .

What about Apple ? They reserved the name iWatch a while back and we expected them to introduce their new device first . This time however Samsung beat Apple to the punch .

Will Apple introduce their iWatch ? I say yes . Whether it 's next week or in the near future I do think Apple will jump into the same smart watch space . It 's the next wireless frontier .

Is this a gamble on Samsung 's part ? Well , on one hand , every new innovative idea is a gamble . But I think this will be a big success and get bigger over time . Just like with the tablets .

The whole idea here is for companies like Samsung , Google and Apple to build an environment that both captivates and captures their audience . The cloud will be the core technology that will tie all these innovative ideas together .

I think customers will love this smartwatch , the same way they love the tablets , smartphones , computers and the cloud . This is just one more piece of the puzzle that attracts and retains more customers . And companies will love it as well because it creates a tighter relationship with each customer .
