Sunday also marks the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 's death . Forty-two years ago , an assassin 's bullet took his life as he struggled to secure the promises of American democracy for the children of slaves . His sacrifice , along with countless others , helped usher in a new chapter in American life -- one that prepared the way for the election of our nation 's first African-American president .

Every now and again , the convergence of significant historical moments occasions a time for serious reflection . How might we think about the significance of the resurrection of Jesus and the martyrdom of Martin Luther King , Jr. to the lives we currently live as Americans ? What lessons does Easter hold for us ? And what does remembering King 's death teach us ?

This view holds off the notion that life has no meaning or is doomed to end in shipwreck . The fact that so many have lost their jobs , their homes , their dreams in these difficult times confirms for us that life carries with it a ` Good Friday ' experience -- that darkness and disappointment can be constant companions .

`` But thank God the crucifixion was not the last act in that great and powerful drama , '' King preached . `` There is another act . And it is something that we sing out and cry and ring out today . Thank God a day came when Good Friday had to pass . ''

Easter ultimately demonstrates that `` love is the most powerful force in the universe , '' said King . And this insight reaches beyond Christians to all of us , no matter what we believe .

Here , love is n't some sentimental notion ; instead , it involves risks , daring and growth -- a surrender to that feature of human personality that can cause us to sacrifice our lives in defense of it . Love conquers cowardice . It shatters hubris and crushes the illusions of death . It fortifies the soul amid the darkness of the hour ; it calls us to bear witness and to suffer , if necessary , the consequences .

The mindless chatter of today distracts us from the power of love . Instead , we are mired in the sundry politics of Washington , or we are content to spew venom at our opponents . Mean-spiritedness carries the day . But Easter , if I understand King correctly , teaches us to love and to witness the miracle of the resurrection before the powers that be , no matter the consequences .

`` It says to us , '' King preached , `` that love is the most durable power in the world '' and is stronger `` than all of the military giants , all of the nations that base their way on military power . '' Such a conviction led him on April 4 , 1967 , a year before he was killed , to condemn the Vietnam War and to say that America was `` the greatest purveyor of violence in the world . ''

Our lives , if we are to be saved , must stand as a testament to that legacy which , beyond our doing , is inescapable . Cowardice and complicity must die in us . And we must rise again to `` love '' a new world into existence .
