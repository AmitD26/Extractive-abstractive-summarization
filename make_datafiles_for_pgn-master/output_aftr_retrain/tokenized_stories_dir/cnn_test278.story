Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A controversial assertion by convicted Robert F. Kennedy assassin Sirhan Sirhan to win his freedom was challenged this week by the California attorney general who said `` overwhelming evidence '' exists against Sirhan 's claims .

Sirhan 's attorneys have said that a second gunman actually assassinated Kennedy in 1968 and that Sirhan was hypno-programmed to fire a gun as a diversion .

`` In sum , -LRB- Sirhan -RRB- can not possibly show that no reasonable juror would have convicted him if a jury had considered his ` new ' evidence and allegations , in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting the convictions and the available evidence thoroughly debunking -LRB- Sirhan 's -RRB- second-shooter and automaton theories , '' Attorney General Kamala Harris said in federal court papers filed this week .

Sirhan , the sole person convicted of killing Kennedy , is seeking a new trial or freedom from his life sentence based on `` formidable evidence '' asserting his innocence and `` horrendous violations '' of his rights , defense attorneys said in federal court papers filed last year .

Harris , who is asking a federal court in Los Angeles to dismiss Sirhan 's request , conceded in court papers filed Wednesday that his lawyers may be able to show two guns were involved in Kennedy 's assassination . Kennedy was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was killed .

But even if Sirhan 's lawyers can show 13 shots were fired in the Kennedy shooting , Sirhan should n't be released from prison , Harris said .

Harris said Sirhan is relying on acoustic expert Philip Van Praag 's analysis of a tape recording of the Kennedy shooting that concludes 13 shots were fired during the murder and `` demonstrates the existence of a second shooter because -LRB- Sirhan -RRB- only fired eight shots . ''

The attorney general argues that even if there were a second gunman involved in the Kennedy shooting , Sirhan has n't proven his innocence .

Authorities have said eight bullets were fired in the kitchen pantry of the former Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles , with three bullets hitting Kennedy 's body , a fourth passing harmlessly through his suit coat and the rest striking five other victims , who survived . Kennedy , younger brother of the assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy , was shot shortly after midnight on June 5 , 1968 , only moments after the presidential candidate had claimed victory in California 's Democratic primary election . He died the next day .

Harris said that even if it could be proven `` that a second gunman successfully shot Senator Kennedy , -LRB- Sirhan -RRB- would still be guilty of the charged crimes . '' She said that under California 's vicarious liability law , `` an aider and abettor ` is guilty not only of the offense he intended to facilitate or encourage , but also of any reasonably foreseeable offense committed by the person he aids and abets ' . ''

`` The theory that a person could be hypnotized into planning and committing a murder against his will is a controversial -LRB- if not fantastic -RRB- one and has not been adopted by most of Brown 's peers , including the American Psychological Association , '' Harris wrote .

`` Thus , even if -LRB- Sirhan -RRB- could show that some psychologists believe in mind control or hypno-programming , his showing of actual innocence is nevertheless based on a debatable theory that is not universally accepted in the psychology community , '' Harris said .
