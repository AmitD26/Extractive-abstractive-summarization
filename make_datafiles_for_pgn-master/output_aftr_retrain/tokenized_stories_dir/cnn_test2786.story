The vehicle weathered three months of rain , blizzards and sun , and arrived in Shanghai with no major problems , according to researchers tracking its progress . The van even stopped to pick up hitchhikers outside of Moscow .

The van , designed by Italian tech company Vislab , featured 12 refined sensors , including cameras , a carbon dioxide sensor , a GPS device and an off-road laser scanner .

`` This driverless trip to China shows how science can capture people 's imagination through achievements that would recently have been unthinkable ... -LSB- and -RSB- provide major environmental and economic benefits , '' said Maire Geoghegan-Quinn , head of research , innovation and science for the European Commission .

As for human intervention during the van 's three-month journey , `` We had to intervene manually only on limited occasions , such as in the Moscow traffic jams and when passing toll stations , '' said lead researcher Broggi , who also is a professor at Italy 's University of Parma .

Two engineers rode in the van to prevent dangerous situations . The vehicle was part of a four-vehicle caravan , which included a leading van that was occasionally driven by two engineers , but mostly operated without human guidance .

From Italy to Russia to China , the driverless van baffled onlookers . During a special demonstration on the outskirts of Moscow on September 10 , a police officer approached the vehicle as it maneuvered in a pedestrian zone , only to find a driver missing .

Other challenges along the way included replacing a 430-kilogram battery in Moscow , lengthy and complicated border crossings due to customs clearances , and several frigid nights camping along the van 's route in Siberia .

`` We were n't worried about not making it , '' though , Broggi said . `` This big trip was an intermediary step in a longer process . We have something new planned for 2012 . ''

More than 1.2 million people die annually in auto crashes , according to the World Health Organization .
