-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fifty years ago this weekend , a four-piece guitar band from Liverpool touched down at Kennedy airport in New York and changed the course of popular culture in the twentieth century .

That much we can be sure of , and since the days of Beatlemania that guitar band has been credited with changing music , fashion , culture and everything else that really counted in the sixties .

The run-up to this anniversary feels a little like the preparations for the Beatles arrival in 1964 , when there was a continual stream of tidbits , teasers and promotions which announced `` The Beatles are Coming ! ''

But instead of radio bulletins , high-school gossip , and those flyers that Capitol records distributed to record stores nationwide , this time the news comes to us on mobile phones and lap tops , in web casts and posts on the internet .

If you miss the rebroadcast of the Ed Sullivan show this weekend you can easily retrieve it from numerous sites on the world wide web , but back in 1964 you had to wait a whole week for the next Ed Sullivan Show . This of course added to the tension and increased the expectation of another television event which could not be missed .

If a note of self-congratulation enters into the celebrations , you can hardly blame the record and television companies for waxing nostalgic for a time when Americans were locked into watching three channels and still buying records .

In the fractured and endlessly expanding digital world , nobody will be able to recreate the excitement of Beatlemania because it is no longer possible to completely command the media as the Beatles did back in 1964 .

The triumph of Beatlemania was essentially a triumph of the record -- the seven inch vinyl disc -- and a demonstration of its potency in diffusing culture and creating value .

The anniversary of Beatlemania will doubtless see more praise heaped on the musicians and their timeless music . But who were the architects of Beatlemania ?

Brian Epstein planned the campaign , perfected the look and made the deals -LRB- some strokes of genius , others not -RRB- . Above all he saw the American market as the pinnacle of success : `` We knew that America would make us or break us as world stars ... In fact , she made us . ''

How ironic that what began as an exercise in American exceptionalism ended in a `` British Invasion '' of imported music , fashion and design that swept all before it and made the sixties look and sound like the sixties .

Beatlemania marked the ascendancy of British-based television producers who created a new type of music program -- live , frenetic , engaging -- and made the Beatles its most able practitioners .

Those tiny transistor radios that the girls carried with them connected them to a larger community of Beatle lovers , a radio family who dressed alike , thought alike and shared the same obsession .

Fifty years on that community sees Beatlemania as a special moment in time . There was an air of expectation in the crowd awaiting the Beatles at Kennedy : `` At the airport you could really feel that something was happening ... you felt like this was the beginning of the earthquake . '' And it was .
