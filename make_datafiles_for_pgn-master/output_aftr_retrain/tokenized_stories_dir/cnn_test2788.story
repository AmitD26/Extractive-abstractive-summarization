-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Keeping up with the changes in coaching personnel on the men 's tennis tour can be difficult these days . Just ask Goran Ivanisevic .

`` When I came into the locker room , I see the guys , '' explains the 2001 Wimbledon champion . `` I thought I might be mistaken . Are we on the Champions Tour ?! ''

The Croat 's tongue-in-cheek remark made at the start of the Australian Open serves to illustrate a novel situation where former grand slam winners are suddenly all the rage with today 's top players .

Ivanisevic -- coach to compatriot Marin Cilic since 2010 -- and Ivan Lendl -LRB- who has been with Andy Murray since 2011 -RRB- are old hands compared to the likes of Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg , who surprised everyone at the end of last year when they accepted roles with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer respectively .

Pat Cash , a former rival of both and host of CNN 's Open Court , admitted to `` surprise and disbelief '' when he got wind of Becker 's appointment . He was n't the only one .

`` When Novak announced that Boris was going to be working with him I was honestly very surprised for a couple of reasons , '' two-time U.S. Open champion Tracy Austin told CNN .

`` Novak had such a strong fall -- he was undefeated since the final of the U.S. Open where he lost to Rafael Nadal . He was 24-0 in the fall , so he was playing so well , '' she added .

`` The other thing that came to mind was that I was surprised Boris wanted to do it . He seems to have such a full life with family and commentary . It 's a big commitment to travel on tour with a player full-time . But it seems like Boris is really , really excited about doing it . ''

`` I 've been in 10 grand slam finals , I know exactly what a player feels like when he 's in the later stages of a tournament , '' Becker told reporters .

Djokovic has retained the services of long-time coach Marian Vajda , but will be hoping to learn from Becker 's much feted skills at the net , Austin thinks .

'' -LRB- Djokovic -RRB- already has that from the baseline -- great defense , great offense -- but maybe he wants to round out his game a little bit more and be more forceful at the net , maybe have some better technique at the net , '' she says .

Retired doubles ace Mark Woodforde is more familiar than most with Djokovic 's game . The Australian , who won 11 grand slam doubles titles with his partner Todd Woodbridge , coached the world No. 2 for a time in 2007 .

`` I just wonder whether in the back of Novak 's mind is the way Boris played -- trying to finish points a little more cleanly than what he 's been doing in the past .

`` Maybe he 's trying to pick up on the style that Boris brought to the court himself -- the knowledge , the hustle bustle . You 've got to think that the elongated points that he has to play these days , it 's got to mount up . ''

Long points inevitably lead to long games , as Djokovic 's fans in Melbourne are all too aware .

In 2012 he clinched his third title beating Rafael Nadal in a match lasting five hours 53 minutes -- the longest grand slam final ever -- and last year he took just over five hours to get past Stanislas Wawrinka in the fourth round .

`` He needs strict discipline and a certain modesty . It wo n't be easy for him but he has no choice .

`` He should not give too many interviews , must be restrained and do his work quietly . Above all , he must understand that he is not more important than the player . It will be an interesting experiment . ''

Can Ed help Fed ?

`` That one did n't surprise me , '' says Austin . `` He looks up to Stefan . He was one of his idols . Roger , when he first came on tour , to me , would serve and volley and infrequently chip and charge , and now he does n't do that as much .

Edberg , now 48 , has agreed to a part-time coaching role , spending 10 weeks with Federer this season , but is confident he can help the 32-year-old Swiss to an 18th grand slam title .

Woodforde is relishing the prospect of watching the partnership evolve .

`` We all liked to watch Stefan Edberg play . It 's almost when we watch Roger play now , everyone covets to see him . They always want him to win , '' Woodforde said .

With the business end of the year 's first grand slam approaching , Federer will hope he can execute the strategies discussed with Edberg as he takes on Andy Murray -- his successor as Wimbledon champion last year -- in Wednesday 's quarterfinals .

`` These are all champions that we are talking about , they 're already top players , but they are looking for any different margin to set themselves apart .
