-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Army announced Tuesday that a sergeant first class assigned to an assault prevention program at Fort Hood , Texas , is under investigation for sexual assault .

The soldier , who was not named in an Army statement , has been suspended from all duties .

No charges have been filed .

`` This is so contrary to everything upon which the Army was built , '' Secretary of the Army John McHugh said during testimony before the House Appropriations Committee Defense subcommittee , according to the statement . `` To see this kind of activity happening in our ranks is really heart-wrenching and sickening .

Army investigates trend in military sexual assaults

The solider was assigned as a Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention program coordinator when the allegations surfaced .

`` There is a distinct possibility , '' that some sort of prostitution-related activity was involved , an administration official told CNN . But investigators have not yet determined the scope of that possibility or the potential criminal misconduct .

He met with McHugh and directed him to ensure that `` all of those who might be involved are dealt with appropriately , '' according to Pentagon spokesman George Little .

`` To address the broader concerns that have arisen out of these allegations and other recent events , Secretary Hagel is directing all the services to retrain , recredential , and rescreen all sexual assault prevention and response personnel and military recruiters , '' he said .

According to a Pentagon report released last week , the number of service members anonymously reporting a sexual assault grew by more than 30 % in the past two years .

The Defense Department estimated that more than 26,000 troops experienced an episode of `` unwanted sexual contact , '' a huge jump from 19,300 in the 2010 report .

Military rape victims : Stop blaming us

The allegations of abuse come soon after an Air Force officer was charged with sexual battery stemming from an incident in Northern Virginia .

Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski , a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan , was arrested this month and accused of grabbing a woman 's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County not far from the Pentagon .

Krusinski , who has since been removed from that position , made an initial court appearance last week . He did not enter a plea .

She plans to unveil legislation this week that would remove chain of command influence from the prosecution of such offenses .

`` We have the best and the brightest serving in our military . We have the greatest military in the world . And we ask everything of them . We ask them to even die for their country . We should not be allowing them to be subject to sexual assault and rape , '' said Gillibrand .
