-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With such events as men 's downhill and women 's slopestyle , Sunday 's competition at the Sochi Winter Games may best described by the Olympic motto : Faster , higher , stronger .

As those who follow the sport know , it only takes one bobble , one skid , one miscalculation on the 2.2-mile course at Rosa Khutor , and it could be all over .

Miller 's competitors in the downhill are n't going to just let him walk away with a medal , he 's going to have to fight for it among a fast field .

Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway , who took silver in the men 's downhill and the gold in the super-G during the Vancouver Games in 2010 . He put up the second-fastest time on Saturday 's training run behind Miller , according to Bleacher Report .

Switzerland 's Didier Defago , who took the gold in the event in Vancouver , and Austria 's Matthais Mayer , whose training run Friday on the course eclipsed Miller , also are likely to be in the medal hunt .

At age 23 , Jamie Anderson of the United States is considered one of the pioneers of women 's snowboard slopestyle . -LRB- Think downhill obstacle course with rails and jumps . -RRB-

So perhaps it is fitting that she is one of the odds-on favorites to medal in the event , making its Olympic debut at the Sochi Games .

But do n't count out Austria 's Anna Gasser , who qualified for the event semifinal and final with the highest-scoring run . Anderson finished second .

Who else to watch :

Australia 's Torah Bright , the 2010 Olympic gold medalist in the halfpipe , is a force to be reckoned with after putting in a solid qualifying run .

Figure skating team finals

It 's the final day of the Olympic debut of the team figure skating competition , and the field of 10 has been narrowed down to five teams .

The team with the highest overall score wins the gold , second highest gets the silver , third highest . ... You get the idea . No ? Tune in to watch it .

Ski-what-a-thon ? Skiathlon , or in everyday language competitive cross-country skiing .

Think of it this way . It 's a 30-kilometer race where skiers switch out their classic cross country skis after 15 kilometers to skating skis , where they ski for another 15 kilometers .

Switzerland 's Dario Cologna , a dominant force in the sport , is considered the favorite going into the race .

Who else to watch :

Petter Northug of Norway , who won two gold medals in Vancouver in 2010 , is known for his sprint finishes , and Martin Johnsrud Sundby of Norway , who finished second at last year 's World Championship Skiathlon , are expected to be in the hunt for medals .

Men 's individual normal hill ski jumping finals

Ski jumping seems like an adrenaline junkie 's dream , strapping on a pair of skis , flying down a ramp and launching into the air .

And it 's pretty cool to watch , too .

If the qualifying rounds are any indication , the finals on Sunday should not disappoint .
