The controversy began last week with a lab report suggesting that the presence of 10 heavy metals in a strand of her hair was evidence of a poisoning death four years ago .

A forensic pathologist told CNN last week that the poisoning conclusion was `` ridiculous '' and `` baseless . ''

It 's erupted into a public name-calling battle this week between Murphy 's father , who sent the hair strand to a private lab for testing , and her mother , who wrote a scathing response published Monday in The Hollywood Reporter .

`` I have no choice now but to come forward in the face of inexcusable efforts to smear my daughter 's memory by a man who may be her biological father but was never a real father to her in her lifetime , '' Sharon Murphy wrote .

She said Angelo Bertolotti 's claims `` are based on the most flimsy of evidence and are more of an insult than an insight into what really happened . ''

`` They want to do a documentary and write a book , and this whole stunt is merely publicity to fuel their aspirations , '' she said , referring to Bertolotti and a partner .

Her father was not part of her life past her first year , she said . `` He certainly was n't around during the 12 years he spent in prison on three criminal felony convictions . Throughout her childhood , I was Brittany 's only parent and sole support . ''

Murphy 's father , in a response to CNN , said the mother 's `` ghostwritten piece is riddled with mistakes . ''

`` I am at the very end of my life , '' he told CNN Monday . `` Money means absolutely nothing to me . ''

It 's Sharon Murphy , not him , who has used the death to make money by starting a foundation and announcing a book , Bertolotti said . `` I have nothing to gain here , while Sharon has lived a life of luxury . Before Brittany supported -LRB- still does -RRB- her mother , I was supporting Sharon . ''

The Los Angeles County coroner ruled pneumonia killed Murphy , 32 , in December 2009 , and that her husband , Simon Monjack , 39 , died from the same illness five months later . The similarities between their deaths -- in the same bedroom of their Hollywood Hills home -- prompted a search for answers beyond natural illness .

CNN obtained the report by forensic toxicologist Ernest Lykissa , who concluded that the hair from the back of Murphy 's head had higher than recommended levels of 10 heavy metals .

The director of forensic medicine at the University of Florida , who is also the president of the American Board of Forensic Toxicology , reviewed the lab report for CNN and was very critical .

The private report also showed a normal level of arsenic , which would have been elevated if rat poisoning was involved , he said .

`` She was a beautiful woman and likely had numerous hair treatments , '' Goldberger said . `` Chemicals in the hair treatment would alter the chemistry of her hair sample . ''

The Los Angeles coroner `` has no plans to reopen the inquiries into the deaths of Miss Murphy or Mr. Monjack , '' Craig Harvey , the chief of operations for the coroner , said last week . `` We stand by by our conclusions and opinion . ''

Murphy 's mother said she suspects a toxic mold found in the house may have killed her daughter and son-in-law .

`` There were no indicators that it was from mold , '' Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told CNN in July 2010 .

`` We will never know for sure , '' Sharon Murphy wrote in Monday 's story . `` However , we do know the Los Angeles County Coroner did extensive tests and found that she died of natural causes . ''

Murphy died December 20 , 2009 , from a combination of pneumonia , an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication , a coroner said . The drugs involved were legal and are used to treat respiratory infections , according to an autopsy .

She was an often bubbly , free-spirited actress who appeared in films such as `` Clueless , '' `` 8 Mile , '' `` Do n't Say a Word '' and `` Girl , Interrupted . ''
