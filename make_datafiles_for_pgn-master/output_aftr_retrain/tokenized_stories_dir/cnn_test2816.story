-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Virginia is a cautionary tale for conservatives this year . And those Republicans who always argue that their party wins when it moves further to the right are going to have a lot of explaining to do after Election Day .

Polls show that `` teavangelist '' Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is going down to a decisive defeat in the governor 's race against an exceptionally flawed Democratic candidate , Terry McAuliffe , the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Clinton fund-raiser .

The reason is simple : Cuccinelli is too extreme for swing voters in Virginia -- and that neatly symbolizes the GOP 's problem as it looks to the congressional midterms of 2014 and the presidential campaign of 2016 .

A tea party favorite and self-described `` Second Amendment-supporting Christian right-to-life home-school dad , '' Cuccinelli has built a political career on a foundation of strident social conservatism . Proclaiming `` homosexuality is wrong , '' supporting abstinence-only sex education and devoting himself to abortion restrictions as a matter of faith and law , Cuccinelli has been eager to use political office to advance an ideological agenda .

As attorney general he sued to stop the implementation of the Affordable Care Act , challenged the Environmental Protection Agency 's fuel-efficiency standards , backed the controversial Arizona illegal immigration law and issued a legal opinion that sexual orientation should not be included in nondiscrimination statutes for the University of Virginia .

Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is polling a respectable 10 % -- an indication of the political costs that come from such strident social conservatism , even among fellow travelers on the center-right . Women voters are supporting McAuliffe by 20 % -- a cavernous gap that reflects Cuccinelli 's social conservative obsession . Against almost any other Republican , McAuliffe would be vulnerable , but not Cuccinelli .

Cuccinelli 's problems must be seen side by side with the success of another Republican running for governor -- Chris Christie . The New Jersey incumbent is cruising to re-election by a broad margin in a state where only 20 % of voters are registered Republicans . He is narrowly winning nonwhite voters , and winning women by a 20-point margin .

The difference between the two candidates is self-evident -- Christie has governed as an unapologetic centrist Republican with a no-nonsense focus on fighting for fiscal discipline rather than an obsession with social conservatism . He has built cross-aisle coalitions , even on controversial policy proposals , and reached out beyond the base . He puts problem-solving ahead of partisanship or ideology . In other words , Christie is pretty much the opposite of Cuccinelli , and that 's why he is winning in an otherwise ugly year for Republicans .

Conservatives will come up with lots of reasons why a swing state such as Virginia seems to be slipping away . But let 's cut to the chase -- candidates who specialize only in playing to the base and pushing ideological absolutism lose . Extremes are always ultimately their own side 's worst enemy . And Cuccinelli 's last desperate attempts to present himself as a bipartisan problem-solver or a libertarian are really just evidence of the political bankruptcy of his position .
