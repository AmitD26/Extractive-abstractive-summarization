I first noticed this philanthropy trend while enjoying a new limited release IPA from Sweetwater Brewery called Second Helping . The name implies having more , and the compelling flavoring of juniper berries and chocolate malts had already sold me on that proposition .

But then I read the beer 's label and learned that it was crafted to benefit a charity called The Giving Kitchen , which helps people in the food industry going through hard times . This initiative was inspired by Atlanta chef Ryan Hidinger , who brought the Atlanta restaurant community together when he fought and ultimately lost his battle with cancer . His wife and friends decided to take the generous funds that were raised to help Ryan and pay it forward by creating this charity . I admit that it got me when I read that the juniper berries were added for Ryan , because he so enjoyed cooking with them .

Steve Farace , Sweetwater 's Director of Marketing , says that 100 % of the profits from this beer will be donated to The Giving Kitchen . `` We saw it as an opportunity to help the folks in the hospitality industry that helped build our brand through word of mouth . ''

Sweetwater already knew their customers ' thirst for a cause-worthy beer . Each summer they launch a Save Our Water campaign with the release of Waterkeeper Hefeweizen . Bar patrons annually show their support for this by purchasing paper fish that decorate the walls and ceilings of bars throughout the Southeast .

Beer lovers looking for a charitable ale available year round , can head to Minneapolis and ask for a Finnegans . The brewery boasts an Irish Amber and a Blonde Ale which both come with a prepared toast on the label : `` Here 's to doing good . ''

100 % of the profits of the Finnegans beer company goes directly into their nonprofit , the Finnegans Community Fund . This initiative purchases food from area farmers , which is distributed to food bank partners in Minnesota , Wisconsin , North Dakota and South Dakota .

Finnegans ' CEO Jacquie Berglund sums it up this way : `` At Finnegan 's we turn beer into food . That is our mission . ''

Berglund says their community 's response has gone beyond just drinking beer . `` A lot of people follow us for our social mission . We have 1500 volunteers that come not for beer , but to help pack food at the food banks . ''

OKRA 's Lindsey Brown explains , `` When you buy a beer or some food , you are given a ticket . You then drop the ticket into one of the four voting boxes , whichever charity you choose . ''

If you do n't want a vote to decide where your donation goes , then travel to Portland and choose one from a special menu at Oregon Public House . After ordering food or drink at this bar , patrons then pick one of the six nonprofits detailed on their Charity Menu . 100 % of the profit from each sale goes to the selected organization .

However this disclaimer is warranted : All of these organizations offer ways to help , donate and make a difference that does not require alcohol , and donating through drinking does not excuse alcohol abuse or irresponsibility . If you wo n't take my word for it , take heed from this satirical warning from Stephen Colbert .
