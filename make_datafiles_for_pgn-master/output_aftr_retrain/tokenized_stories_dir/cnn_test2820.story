-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The technology industry often finds itself pontificating about the future , but the busy news cycle this year gave us plenty to discuss .

The seeds of Hewlett-Packard 's mobile strategy , Google 's plans for Motorola post-acquisition , Intel 's 3-D silicon transistors and mobile payment systems like Google Wallet were planted this year . But those stories were left off of this list because their products did not reach a mass market in 2011 . Look for those to make big splashes in 2012 .

1 . Steve Jobs dies

At Apple , Jobs helped create the personal computer industry , and built a team that worked with him to design mega hits like the iMac , iPod , iPhone and iPad . He also found time to lead Pixar Animation Studios , the `` Toy Story '' creator that the Walt Disney Co. paid $ 7.4 billion to acquire in 2006 .

The fast-paced tech industry halted for a moment after Jobs ' death this year , prompting business and world leaders to speak publicly about his impact . It may never be the same after .

2 . Social media 's role as a tool for protestors

Much praise was heaped on Facebook , Twitter and YouTube after they played a role in the Arab Spring , a series of protests in the Middle East that started late in 2010 .

In London , participants in riots used BlackBerry Messenger .

Micro reports from Occupy Wall Street and other U.S. protests frequently popped up on Twitter .

Perhaps in a nod to those events , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said onstage at his conference this year , `` We exist at the intersection of technology and social issues . ''

The Guy Fawkes mask , a stark white symbol of political upheaval , can be seen at many Occupy protests , but the accessory from the movie `` V for Vendetta '' was adopted earlier by an online group called Anonymous .

Members of the loosely organized group emerged from the Internet underground this year with a series of politically fueled computer attacks on churches , e-commerce and banks . A sister group called Lulz Security staged its own hacks before quickly vanishing .

After Sony 's online networks had been hacked , researchers discovered a file planted on one of its servers containing the Anonymous chant , `` We are legion . '' The word `` hack '' was so ingrained in people 's vernacular after all of these incidents that it became a catchphrase anytime a site was down or an account password had been stolen .

4 . Tablet market gets dozens of new entrants

Amazon.com may have cracked the formula with its $ 199 Kindle Fire . It has been selling about a million devices each week since it debuted in November . Hewlett-Packard only managed to attract meaningful sales to its TouchPad when it ran a $ 99 fire sale to clear inventory .

5 . Facebook and partners add ` frictionless ' sharing

Facebook calls it `` frictionless , '' and companies that have implemented the feature , including some music-streaming services and news publishers , have found a great promotional vehicle .

Still , many are opposed to their private reading habits being broadcast instantly to their Facebook pages . Zuckerberg is convinced people will continue publishing more about themselves online each year -- now , whether they actively choose to or not .

These companies have filed lawsuits and countersuits in countries around the world to seek licensing agreements or block the sale of rivals ' products . Google has said that its $ 12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility was to gain the phone maker 's stockpile of patents .

7 . Google +

People are spending more of their time on social networks than searching the Web . In other words , more Facebook and less Google .

Google + got off to a promising start , but Facebook has had a long lead . Google asserts that its social network is key to the future of the company . That 's a big bet .

8 . Apple becomes the most valuable company in the world

When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 , he said the company was weeks away from bankruptcy . Over the next decade , he orchestrated a masterful turnaround that culminated in Apple briefly becoming the world 's most valuable company by market capitalization .

Exxon Mobil has reclaimed a sizable lead , but that should n't undermine how effective Apple has been in creating a lust for gizmos . The ultra-thin iPad 2 has done gangbusters , and the iPhone 4S , with Siri , has introduced voice-command services to a wider audience this year .

However , as the world had learned when IBM 's Deep Blue defeated chess champion Gary Kasparov , computers are n't clueless . Watson proved that two smart men , Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter , were no match for banks of servers running artificial-intelligence software .

10 . Spotify and Facebook take on digital music

With iTunes and iPod , Apple had a strong formula for dominating the digital music industry . Amazon and Google have n't made a dent .
