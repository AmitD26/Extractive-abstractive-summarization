-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Silence is golden . Or at least that was the plan .

Indie band Vulfpeck hatched a scheme to earn a big payout from Spotify . But they 'd have to be clever ; the music streaming service pays artists less than a penny a play .

Vulfpeck racked up about $ 20,000 , according to reports . At the half-a-cent per play rate the band says it gets from the service , that 's 4 million plays .

But not so fast , Spotify told the band : The album violated its terms of content .

When contacted , Spotify 's Graham James had little to say .

There 's no word on whether Vulfpeck will get paid .

On the first track , '' #Hurt , '' Keyboardist Jack Stratton spills his guts about the situation .

`` The gist of it was that , while they enjoyed ` Sleepify ' and thought it was funny and clever , that it violated their terms of content , '' he said .

`` So I do n't know what 's going to happen with it -- it 's very uncertain at the moment . And in light of that uncertainly I want to take 30 seconds silence to ponder the uncertainty . ''

That ushers in the second track , '' #Reflect '' -- 31 seconds of silence .

Sound familiar ?

Can lightning strike twice ? We 'll see .
