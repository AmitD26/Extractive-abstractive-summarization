`` I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group 's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office , '' Caldera said in a letter to Obama .

`` Moreover , it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president . After much reflection , I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office . ''

The White House also released a photo of the flyover and a report on the incident on Friday .

Caldera did not open an e-mail about final plans for the flyover until after it had happened , the report said , noting Caldera had been suffering from severe muscle spasms and had left the office early on several days .

Although recommendations by several parties involved in the flyover had been made that White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina be informed of the plans , the report said , that job was left to Caldera , who did not pass the information along .

But they said `` the hours would have been flown regardless , and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission . ''

Mayor Michael Bloomberg was visibly angry last week . `` I 'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I was n't told , '' he said , adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were `` ridiculous '' and `` poor judgment .
