`` George Zimmerman got away with murder , but you ca n't get away from God . And at the end of the day , he 's going to have a lot of questions and answers he has to deal with , '' Juror B29 told ABC , according to an article posted on the network 's website Thursday . '' -LRB- But -RRB- the law could n't prove it . ''

The juror , who used only her first name of Maddy out of concerns for her safety , told ABC that she and others on the panel felt Zimmerman was guilty , but that was n't enough .

`` You ca n't put the man in jail even though in our hearts we felt he was guilty , '' she said . `` But we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence . ''

`` It is devastating for my family to hear the comments from juror B29 , comments which we already knew in our hearts to be true . That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder , '' Sybrina Fulton said in a written statement . `` This new information challenges our nation once again to do everything we can to make sure that this never happens to another child . ''

She and other jurors also have identified themselves by their numbers from the jury pool .

Opinion : What if both were white ?

Last week the woman known as Juror B37 told CNN 's `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' that Zimmerman `` did n't do anything unlawful '' and was `` justified '' in shooting 17-year-old Martin last year .

He fatally shot Martin in the Sanford , Florida , neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin 's father lived in February 2012 . Zimmerman , who is Hispanic , had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person , and he said he shot Martin in self-defense .

Maddy , 36 , is Puerto Rican and a mother of eight children , ABC said . She was the only minority to deliberate in the case . She told ABC that the case was never about race to her .

At the beginning of deliberations , she told ABC , she wanted to convict Zimmerman of second-degree murder . But she realized on the second day of deliberations that there was n't enough proof to convict him of murder or the lesser charge of manslaughter .

Juror B37 told CNN that the jury was initially split -- three and three along the line of guilt . Juror B37 was among those who believed Zimmerman was not guilty from the start .

`` I do n't want people to think that we did n't think about this , and we did n't care about Trayvon Martin , because we did . We 're very sad that it happened to him , '' she said .
