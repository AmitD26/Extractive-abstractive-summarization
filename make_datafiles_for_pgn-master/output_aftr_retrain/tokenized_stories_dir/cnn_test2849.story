-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Assuming you 've got two ears and a heart , chances are you loved The Colbert Report 's star-studded `` Get Lucky '' dance party video -- which Stephen Colbert debuted after explaining that Daft Punk 's skittish Frenchmen had abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on his show .

Almost immediately after Colbert 's exuberant clip premiered Aug. 6 , Internet naysayers began speculating that Daft Punk 's `` cancellation '' was nothing more than an elaborate ruse . Their evidence : The same episode containing the `` Get Lucky '' montage also featured Robin Thicke performing his hit `` Blurred Lines , '' purportedly in Daft Punk 's place . But according to Billboard , Thicke 's performance was taped July 31 , days before Daft Punk supposedly told Colbert they were out . Pitchfork picked up the story , wondering if the whole segment could have been a publicity stunt meant to promote the duo 's upcoming appearance on the VMAs . -LRB- Viacom owns both MTV and Comedy Central . -RRB-

EW : Stephen Colbert Daft Punks us anyway with a star-studded ` Get Lucky ' dance party

Colbert addressed the Pitchfork post on his show Aug. 7 , sarcastically `` admitting '' that the site was right all along . `` You got me ! '' he said , adding that Colbert had flown in `` the disco Decepticons from Paris '' just to fool everyone -- and `` to help someone else 's show on another network a month from now . ''

But that was n't his last word on the subject . During a recent out-of-character guest spot on comedian Paul Mercurio 's podcast , the Comedy Central host admitted that many of the Daft Punk show 's cameos and Robin Thicke 's performance were filmed in advance . He also explained that they had to be -- because while Daft Punk had agreed to an appearance , they were refusing to perform or be interviewed on the show .
