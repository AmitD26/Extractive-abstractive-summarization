-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the chips are down , the world may one day owe a debt of gratitude to a group of potato farmers high up in the mountains of Peru .

Not small potatoes : Preserving potato varieties in Peru is vital to global food security .

Thanks to a new $ 116 million global fund established this summer , the Quechua Indians are being paid to maintain their diverse collection of rare potatoes and ensure that they will be available to help the world adapt to future climate change .

Other countries involved include Cuba , where they will be focusing on maize and beans , as well as oranges in Egypt and wheat in Tanzania .

But the world 's valuable diversity is disappearing incredibly fast .

Over the millennia , humans have relied on more than 10,000 different plant species for food . Today , we have barely 150 species under cultivation -- and of those only 12 species provide 80 percent of all of our food needs . Four of those -- rice , wheat , maize and potatoes -- provide more than half of our energy requirements .

As global markets have grown and seed production and agriculture become more commercialized , the old system of farmers saving their own seeds - and by doing so a myriad of different crops , often closely adapted to local conditions - has almost disappeared .

`` They 're gone ; they 've disappeared forever , '' said Dr Bhatti . `` From a food security point of view this makes the world 's farmers much more vulnerable to pests ... and increases the vulnerability of some poor countries to price shocks in global commodity markets . ''

The ITPGRFA has two major aims : to prevent the loss of underused crops and ensure the full diversity of common crop species is maintained . It has already enabled the establishment of a seed bank containing 1.1 million varieties that opened in Svalbard , Norway , in 2008 . But now the focus is on crop varieties than can not be stored in this way -- such as potatoes .

Historically , both the 19th century Irish Potato Famine and the Bengal Famine , in India , are hard lessons in what happens when we rely too much on a small range of species that are hit by disease .

`` If it reaches South Asia and China then millions could face a major threat to food security , '' says Dr Bhatti .

In southwest Australia years of drought , believed to be linked to climate change , have had a huge impact on rice production .

`` It has almost wiped out the sector , '' said Dr Bhatti .

Although the ITPGRFA was agreed in 2001 , and came into affect in 2004 , but for the last five years signatories have been locked in negotiations over how the scheme would be financed . It was n't until a conference in Tunis in June 2009 that the deadlock was broken with the new $ 116 million benefit sharing fund , which will fund the 11 projects .

So successful is the model established by the ITPGRFA that the World Health Organization is looking at it as a way of sharing information on viruses , including influenza ; there are also plans for a bank of animal genetic material .

`` I must say I have been so delighted by the Tunis conference this year , '' said Dr Bhatti . `` To a certain extent we were at a crossroads , but we completely came through . It was a quantum leap ; a major thing . We are moving forward . ''
