-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forensic tests on a woman found hanging from a tree in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have so far failed to find evidence of rape , a local police chief said .

More tests are being done , amid claims from the woman 's family that she was gang-raped and murdered by five men , including her brother-in-law .

Her family told police she went missing around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night , and her body was found Wednesday morning , Bahraich district police chief , Happy Guptan , said .

`` We are not commenting how it all happened until our investigation is complete , '' Guptan told CNN .

The 23-year-old 's horrific injuries made headlines and started a national debate about how many rapes were happening and why .

Call to stop ` politicizing rape '

`` I appeal to our political leaders that we should not carry out psychological analysis of rape ... Is it correct to make a statement always ? Why ca n't we just keep quiet . Respect and security for women should be the topmost priority of the entire people , '' he said .

His comments came after observers seized on statements made by Babulal Gaur , the home minister of Madhya Pradesh , that rape was a `` social crime '' -- `` sometimes it 's right , sometimes it 's wrong . ''

Other politicians were also accused of trivializing the crime with comments including an observation that rapes `` happen accidentally , '' while another suggested `` boys make mistakes . ''

Ban made the comments while launching a video campaign on ending sexual violence through gender equality .
