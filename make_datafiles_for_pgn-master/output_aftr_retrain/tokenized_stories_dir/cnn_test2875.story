Unless you 're on the West Coast , odds are the weather outside is frightful and complex . To make sense of it all , let us take you on a national tour .

Harsh weather continued Saturday evening , with a risk of thunderstorms in Louisiana , Mississippi , parts of Arkansas , Alabama and Tennessee .

Isolated storms that form ahead of these bigger storms could become supercells , which means the possibility of tornadoes . One tornado hit Friday night in Mississippi .

By midday Saturday , there were two tornado watches in effect . Saturday night , the National Weather Service in Jackson , Mississippi , said damage in that area -- four semi trucks overturned , five houses heavily damaged and 15 others with minor damage -- was likely due to a tornado .

Saturday night , the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency reported one death in Coahoma County , along the Mississippi River . There were no further details .

The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning late Saturday afternoon just west of Memphis , Tennessee , and there were reports of some semi trucks overturned on Interstate 40 in that area , according to CNN affiliate WREG .

In Hughes , Arkansas , the St. Francis County sheriff told WREG a possible tornado touched down in that area . A spokesperson for the Arkansas Emergency Management Agency tells CNN the storm destroyed two homes and damaged three others . Three people were hurt in the storm , one of with serious injuries .

Heavy rain , damaging winds and lightning were forecast to continue Saturday night into Sunday morning . These storms will spread , bringing downpours to Georgia , Florida , South Carolina and up the East Coast on Sunday .

Midwest : A flood of wet worry

Central Plains : Slammed with ice and snow

Power outages , falling tree limbs -- if not trees -- and treacherous roads are in the forecast for a large part of Oklahoma . An ice warning has been issued for the northern and central parts of the state , including Oklahoma City . Residents there are being encouraged to hunker down at home , CNN affiliate KFOR reports . They 're even being warned not to park their cars beneath trees .

In Kansas and southeast Nebraska , snowfalls will total 3-6 inches . And those cold temps will keep folks shivering .

So far there have been no flight cancellations or delays at that airport , Valencia said . But Whitney Eichinger of Southwest Airlines told him the company is looking out for the safety of travelers .

`` We are allowing customers to rebook their trip with no penalty through tomorrow , '' she said . `` That has more to do with traveling to the airport , not flight cancellations . ''

Mid-Atlantic/Northeast : Weirdly warm

If there is one present being handed out on this first day of winter , it is the well-above-average temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic , with record highs up to the 70s anticipated .

Farther north , however , the situation is less cozy . In Maine and across New Hampshire , Vermont and into New York , winter weather -- including ice storm warnings and freezing rain -- are in effect .

CNN 's Jennifer Gray , Nick Valencia , Todd Borek and Matt Daniel contributed to this report .
