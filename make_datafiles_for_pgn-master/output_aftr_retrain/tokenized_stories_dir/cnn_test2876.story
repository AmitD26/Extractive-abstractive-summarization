-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's going to take two to three weeks for thoroughbred California Chrome to heal from a nasty injury to his hoof , his trainer Art Sherman said Sunday .

As to what went wrong for a horse who many thought would win Saturday , Sherman alluded to the amount of racing California Chrome did leading up to the Belmont Stakes .

Eleven horses competed in the Belmont Stakes .

Sherman suggested Sunday that , as with any athlete , rest is just as pivotal as racing and training .

`` I think you need a little more time between races , '' he said .

Jockey Victor Espinoza seemed optimistic that Chrome would recover . `` Thank you to everyone for your support on this journey , you are awesome ! I hope California Chrome gets better soon , '' he tweeted Saturday evening .

Those horse owners took `` the coward 's way out , '' Coburn blasted .

On ABC , he was asked whether he regretted his rant .

`` Not only no , but hell no , '' Coburn answered . `` I do not regret it one bit . It 's the truth . ''

`` Yes I do , I mean think of it this way . OK , it says Triple Crown . You nominate your horse for the Triple Crown -- that means three . The Triple Crown trophy has three points on it . So when you earn enough points to be in the Kentucky Derby , those 20 horses that start in the Kentucky Derby should be the only 20 allowed to run in the Preakness and the Belmont , for the Triple Crown . ''

At a news conference , Sherman was asked what he thought of Coburn 's comments at the race .

CNN 's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report .
