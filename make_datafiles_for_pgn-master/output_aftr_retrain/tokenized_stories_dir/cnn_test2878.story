-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- `` Star Trek Into Darkness '' opens on a primitive planet , where the natives are restless and a volcano , in mid-eruption , traps First Officer Spock -LRB- Zachary Quinto -RRB- over a boiling ocean of lava .

Kirk , who never met a regulation he could n't trash , guides the starship up into the air and over to where his comrade is about to perish , and the white-mud-caked warriors stare at the ship as if it were a god . It 's a sensation that the movie transmits to the audience , since the Enterprise , emitting an awesome thrummm , never looked quite so massive or looming .

Four years ago , director J.J. Abrams rebooted the `` Star Trek '' franchise with great swagger by treating the launch film as a unique pop culture origin story . The movie was all about how the Enterprise crew first came together , but really it was about how Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto rose up to become those superheroes of yore , Kirk and Spock , by echoing the looks , voices , and personalities of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy just enough , while still making the roles their own .

Like Abrams ' first `` Trek '' movie , this one is positioned as a prequel to the original TV series and subsequent films , though it also lifts -LRB- and twists -RRB- elements from that sacred text , 1982 's `` Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan . '' Kirk and Spock , each following his own nature -LRB- one 's a hothead , the other a detached brainiac -RRB- , are usually at loggerheads . Even when they wind up coming to the same conclusion they ca n't stop arguing about how they got there , and that 's part of the movie 's texture of cocky one-upmanship .

The whole Enterprise crew has become a collection of colliding egos . ZoÃ« Saldana 's Uhura , who 's in the middle of a lovers ' quarrel with Spock ; John Cho as the so-stoic-he 's - cool Sulu ; Simon Pegg 's frantically funny and resourceful Scotty -- these characters pop out at us with a new dynamism . And they all confront a villain who has been brilliantly retrofitted to throw everyone , including the audience , off-guard .

Intergalactic fashion finds

`` Into Darkness '' is a sleek , thrilling epic that 's also a triumphantly witty popcorn morality play . It 's everything you could want in a `` Star Trek '' movie .

Grade : `` A ''
