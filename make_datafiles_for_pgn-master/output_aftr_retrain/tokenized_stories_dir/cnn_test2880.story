-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has sent a letter to the National Basketball Association telling the league he wo n't pay his $ 2.5 million fine and rejecting his lifetime ban , a source close to the situation said Friday .

The letter also threatens the NBA with a lawsuit if Sterling 's punishment for making racist remarks , handed down by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver in April , is not rescinded , the source said .

In an exclusive interview with CNN 's `` AC 360 '' this week , Sterling repeatedly denied he is a racist despite remarks made in a private conversation with his friend V. Stiviano that were released online .

In the recording , which drew widespread condemnation from fans , players and the league after it appeared on TMZ , Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans , including NBA legend Earvin `` Magic '' Johnson . He tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games .

`` In your lousy f ** ing Instagrams , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , '' he said during a different portion of the recording .

The league 's 29 other owners have taken the initial steps to force Sterling to sell the franchise he has owned for 33 years , with an advisory committee meeting three times so far .

Sterling has hired Maxwell Blecher , an antitrust lawyer , to represent him with the NBA , Sports Illustrated and USA Today reported .

Blecher represented the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in its lawsuit victory against the NFL that allowed the Raiders to move to the city from Oakland without approval from other owners before the 1982 season . The Raiders returned in 1995 .

CNN reached out to Blecher and the NBA on Thursday night but did n't hear back immediately .

Blecher reportedly argued that Sterling was being denied due process rights and he had n't violated the NBA constitution .

At a post-game news conference , Clippers coach Doc Rivers said he did n't think the team could use the controversy surrounding their owner as an excuse for bowing out of the playoffs .

`` Obviously , it 's nothing that anybody wants to go through -- nothing I want to go through -- but overall , I thought our fan base , I thought the city , and I thought our guys really hung in there ... very proud of them , '' Rivers said . `` None of us signed on for this , but this is what happened . ''

Clippers point guard Chris Paul was in no mood about Sterling after the game .
