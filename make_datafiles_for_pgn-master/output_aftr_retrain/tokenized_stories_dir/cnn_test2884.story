Philbin , sitting in for Piers Morgan , in his return to hosting after leaving `` Regis and Kelly '' gets Letterman to open up about fatherhood , politics , his career , his friendship with the late Johnny Carson and more .

Three years later , in 1978 , Letterman appeared on `` The Tonight Show . ''

Letterman recalled Carson 's early influence on him .

`` He was , I think , the biggest star in television . And I was just a kid who has followed ... the beacon of his light coming out of Burbank . ''

Letterman called Carson 's friendship `` a tremendous blessing '' and said he made a point of telling him the way he felt . Letterman recalled the last time he saw Carson .

`` The way life is , '' Letterman said , `` you do n't know that that will be the last time , but it turned out to be the last time , and it could n't have been a lovelier evening . And I cherish that because it was unusual . It was not going to happen under any other circumstances . And it was my wife , myself , Johnny and his wife on Johnny 's yacht that he had anchored in the Hudson .

Carson passed away in 2005 .

`` It was a cheap , easy way to refill a category and get some laughs most nights , '' Letterman said . When Philbin asked if coming up with the lists was `` a chore , '' the `` Late Show '' host joked , `` Not for me . ... I 'm not even in the building . I 'm an old man with a facial . ''

Letterman also said that his favorite guests -- besides Philbin , of course -- were `` people who really come and do a great job for us . '' He counted Tom Hanks , Bill Murray , Brian Williams , Tom Brokaw and Don Rickles among the `` handful of people who are really , really strong . ''

`` If a guy drops his dog or a guy straps his dog to the roof of a car or if a guy gets a shoe thrown at him , well , this is where the material is going to be , '' Letterman said .

Philbin also asked Letterman about fatherhood . The comedian 's son , Harry , is 8 .

`` Life is no longer solely about you , '' Letterman said . `` It 's about him . ''

Philbin asked if Harry knew what his dad did for a living .

`` No , '' the comedian joked , `` he thinks I have a job in a metal shop . ''

Letterman said he and his son took up skiing four years ago and very much enjoy the sport . Harry also loves animals , Letterman told Philbin , and likes to visit his father at work when `` Late Show '' does its `` Stupid Pet Tricks '' segment or has zookeeper Jack Hanna as a guest .

When Philbin asked whether Harry was a `` mama 's boy '' or a `` daddy 's boy , '' Letterman answered , `` He 's a mama 's boy , for sure . ''

`` I 'm old enough now where if I see trouble down the road , I 'll probably be dead by then , and it will be his stepfather 's problem . ''
