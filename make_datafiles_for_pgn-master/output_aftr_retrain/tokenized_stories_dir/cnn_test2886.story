A social-networking site for the world of spying officially launches for the U.S. intelligence community this month .

The program is called A-Space , and it 's a social-networking site for analysts within the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies .

The new A-Space site has been undergoing testing for months and launches officially for the nation 's entire intelligence community September 22 .

Wertheimer demonstrated the program to CNN to show how analysts will use it to collaborate .

`` One perfect example is if Osama bin Laden comes out with a new video . How is that video obtained ? Where are the very sensitive secret sources we may have to put into a context that 's not apparent to the rest of the world ? '' Wertheimer asked .

`` There was the question , ` Was that a dot that failed to connect ? ' Well , that person did this via e-mail , '' Wertheimer said . `` A-Space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that . ''

Even though Facebook , MySpace and other social-networking sites that inspired A-Space are predominantly the domain of young people , there apparently is no such generational divide on A-Space .

`` We have found that participation in A-Space crosses every conceivable age line and experience line . People are excited , no matter what age group , '' Wertheimer said .

`` We 're building -LSB- a -RSB- mechanism to alert that behavior . We call that , for lack of a better term , the MasterCard , where someone is using their credit card in a way they 've never used it before , and it alerts so that maybe that credit card has been stolen , '' Wertheimer said . `` Same thing here . We 're going to actually do patterns on the way people use A-Space . ''

Yes , analysts can collect friends on A-Space the way people can on Facebook . But nobody outside the intelligence community will ever know -- because they 're secret .

CNN 's Barbara Starr and Pam Benson contributed to this report .
