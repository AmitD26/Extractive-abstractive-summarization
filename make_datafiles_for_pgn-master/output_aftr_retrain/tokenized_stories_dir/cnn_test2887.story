-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , delivering Thursday 's commencement speech at Harvard University , criticized what he described as a disturbing trend of liberals silencing voices `` deemed politically objectionable . ''

`` This spring , it has been disturbing to see a number of college commencement speakers withdraw -- or have their invitations rescinded -- after protests from students and -- to me , shockingly -- from senior faculty and administrators who should know better , '' Bloomberg said .

`` In each case , liberals silenced a voice -- and denied an honorary degree -- to individuals they deemed politically objectionable . This is an outrage , '' Bloomberg said to applause .

An even more glaring example of failing to listen to the opposing side , Bloomberg said , was the longstanding impasse between Republicans and Democrats in Washington , where every major question facing the nation is decided `` not by engaging with one another but by trying to shout each other down . ''

`` What are they afraid of ? '' he asked .

`` Let 's get serious : When 85 Americans are killed with guns every single day , and shootings regularly occur at our schools and universities , including last week 's tragedy at Santa Barbara , it would be almost medical malpractice to say anything else , '' Bloomberg said .

The former mayor , who received honorary degrees from Harvard along with seven others -- including former President George H.W. Bush and music icon Aretha Franklin -- spoke of the role of universities as places where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely debate ideas without that `` sacred trust '' being threatened by the `` tyrannical tendencies of monarchs , mobs and majorities . ''

`` We protected their right to protest , '' Bloomberg said . `` But they could not have been more wrong . And we refused to cave in to their demands . The idea that government would single out a particular religion , and block its believers -- and only its believers -- from building a house of worship in a particular area is diametrically opposed to the moral principles that gave rise to our great nation , and the constitutional protections that have sustained it . ''

Bloomberg compared the intolerance of ideas prevalent in the country today to `` McCarthy 's Red Scare '' in the 1950s and its destruction of thousands of lives . In the 2012 presidential race , he said , the overwhelming majority of campaign contributions from Ivy League faculty went to Barack Obama .

Harvard Law School graduate Jared Nicholson said the speech was `` a great message ... about tolerance of different ideas and diversity of opinions . ''

Greg Silverberg , an engineering school graduate , said he welcomed the former mayor 's viewpoint .

Before the speech , Cary Williams , president of the Association of Black Harvard Women , questioned why Bloomberg was selected as speaker , because , she said , the NYPD 's stop-and-frisk program `` disproportionately has targeted people of color in New York . ''

`` It 's basically racial profiling , '' junior Keyanna Wigglesworth said of the New York policing policy under Bloomberg . `` And so it 's unsettling to me , -LRB- for -RRB- someone to speak who advocates a racist policy when you want students of color on campus to feel comfortable . It 's confusing and I do n't think its what Harvard stands for . ''
