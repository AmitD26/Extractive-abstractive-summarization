Then , Marroquin finally heard word about two weeks ago : she received a phone call from an `` immigration '' official in Texas who desperately sought the mother 's voice in order to calm her two sobbing children , who were apparently in a detention facility .

At last , Marroquin knew they were at least alive . She soothed her children , but then the June 8 phone call went dead .

Since then , Marroquin has been unable to track down the detention facility in Texas that called her , and now the angst of her children 's absence goes on , day after day . Her son told her a painful rash was stinging his body .

Marroquin has now been waiting a total of one month for an official notice about her children 's status .

It 's a high-risk mission that imperils a family 's most precious asset -- and an experience shared by other parents and relatives of tens of thousands of Central American children . Many children become victims of crime or sex abuse during their unchaperoned journey .

If the child successfully enters the country illegally , the reward for families and parents such as Marroquin is an emotional reunion of a high order .

The mother has n't seen her two eldest children in person during those six years . She kept in touch with them online , through video chats on Skype .

At the same time , the U.S. government is providing several million dollars in additional support for the three main Central American countries -- El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras -- to receive and repatriate migrant children and other deportees , the White House said Friday .

Besides the peril of crossing the desert or waterways along the border , the children are finding their eventual arrest and detention as equally distressful : U.S. processing and detention facilities are designed more for adults than minors and offer poor living conditions for children .

`` It is also hazardous to send a child into South Texas to a processing center , '' Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson stated last week . `` A processing center -- and a number of us here have seen them ourselves -- are no place for children , and to put a child into hands of a criminal smuggling organization is not safe either .

`` I would encourage no parent to send their child or send for their child through this process , '' Johnson said .

But Central American families take the risk any way , with private hopes that somehow they can obtain legal residency some day -- though the Obama administration warns that the unaccompanied children or mothers with children wo n't benefit from any proposed immigration reforms or a deferred deportation policy for young immigrants called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals .

Often fleeing drug and gang violence in their home countries , the children take buses from El Salvador , Honduras and Guatemala , and when they reach the U.S.-Mexico border , they cross alone , with siblings or in groups of children , according to families .

In Marroquin 's case , her children were chaperoned by a relative on the bus rides from Chimaltenango , Guatemala , but when they reached the U.S. border , the two children joined a group of other minors , some with mothers , and crossed the Rio Grande River , Marroquin said .

To reduce the inflow , the U.S. government is providing millions of dollars in aid to the three Central American countries to combat violence at home : $ 40 million for Guatemala , $ 25 million for El Salvador , and $ 18.5 million for Honduras , the White House said .

In the meantime , U.S. agencies are taking a disaster-like approach to what the White House calls the `` urgent situation '' of unaccompanied minors crossing into the United States .

A Salvadoran mother 's wait

On average , apprehended child migrants under age 18 spend 35 days in U.S. custody and holding facilities , said Kenneth J. Wolfe , a deputy director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , which provides the care and placement for such children .

But some parents , such as one El Salvador immigrant mother in Los Angeles , had to wait so long that they began to wonder if they would ever see their child again .

Her 12-year-old son , Henry , and 9-year-old daughter , Estefania , left El Salvador with their grandmother in December , and the three arrived in Mexico on December 24 , Ana said .

In early January , the grandmother hired a smuggler in Mexico to take the two children to the Rio Grande River and point them to Texas , Ana said . The grandmother last saw her two grandchildren in the company of other children , some with mothers , near the river , Ana said .

It 's unclear how far the smuggler may or may not have accompanied the children across the Rio Grande , Ana said .

Two weeks later , Ana received a phone call from a U.S. immigration official .

The good news was the official had Ana 's children in custody .

The bad news was her son was crying , and the federal worker asked the mother to speak to her son .

`` All I told my son is to calm down , that everything will be okay , '' Ana said .

Said son Henry in a recent interview : `` When I talked to my mom , I told her where I was , and she said not to worry and the phone got cut off . ''

`` This was the longest wait for my life . I did n't know nothing -- how they were , if they ate or not , '' the mother said . `` When I saw them , I felt happy . They ran and hugged me and my daughter cried and I did , too , and that was it .

`` Ever since I 've been here my mom has taken us to different places , she has bought us toys , and she has taken us to really cool places , '' Estefania said . `` I 'm happy to be here because it 's different . ''
