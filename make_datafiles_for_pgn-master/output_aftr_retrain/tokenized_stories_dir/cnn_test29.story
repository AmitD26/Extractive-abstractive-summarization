`` Look , the situation has affected us , '' Santos told CNN .

`` What I have asked them to do is to try to forget about that when they play and to focus just on football to show they are real fighters . ''

But Santos told CNN that his players had to keep their emotions in check against Germany .

`` As far as the players are concerned , they can have extra motivation and more passion in this game against Germany but they ca n't lose focus , '' he said .

`` We need to think during this game , and if we are led just by our hearts and our emotions , we will be in trouble . ''

German coach Joachim Low is also trying to keep politics out of the last-eight clash as his side bid to bag a first major trophy since Euro ' 96 .

`` Angela Merkel and the national team are on very good terms , '' Low told a press conference earlier this week .

`` We have reached an agreement where she does n't interfere with my tactical instructions and , in return , I do n't deal with her political agenda .

Euro 2004 success

Santos ' men have already shown the fighting qualities which marked Greece 's surprise triumph at Euro 2004 , snatching an unlikely qualification after winning a single point in their opening two games .

`` I always believed we could make it out of the group , '' Santos said .

`` Even after our first two games did n't go well I still had faith because I know this team very well and the players always do well in situations of adversity . ''

But can they beat one of the favorites for the competition and go on to repeat that 2004 success ?

`` We all believe we can beat Germany , why not ? We have our weapons as well and if we use them to our advantage we can make our dream of advancing to the next stage come true , '' he said .

Germany favorites

But they needed a late winner to beat Denmark 2-1 , and Low was unhappy with some aspects of their performance .

`` We left a few enormous gaps in midfield for the opponent to exploit and I did n't like that . The solutions are just as clear as the challenges . ''
