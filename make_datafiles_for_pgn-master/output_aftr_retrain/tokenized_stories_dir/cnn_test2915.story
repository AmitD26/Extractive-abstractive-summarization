-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At the annual rattlesnake roundup in Sweetwater , Texas , in early March , Jaycee sponsors and volunteers slaughtered 3,890 pounds of rattlesnakes . The event is billed as `` Fun for the whole family , '' and children take their turns to skin a snake , and afterward , press their hands covered with snake blood onto a wall of handprints .

For weeks or even months , rattlesnakes are stored in crowded barrels until it 's roundup time . The snakes that have not suffocated under their kin arrive hungry , dehydrated , and sick from gasoline that was sprayed into their burrows to flush them out .

After a tour of the roundup , Michael Smith wrote an article for `` Cross Timbers Herpetologist '' in which he recalls noticing '' ... an unusual smell ... like bad cologne and also like something gone bad . '' Throughout the tour the smell keeps coming back to him , he writes , until he realizes what it is : '' ... the musk , feces , and blood of a thousand terrified snakes , half-covered with sprays of deodorant from Jaycees working the pits . ''

In the `` research pit , '' snakes are weighed , measured , and probed to determine sex . Many have their venom extracted in the `` milking pit , '' ostensibly for scientific research and antivenin production . However , according to the Kentucky Reptile Zoo , which specializes in venom research and education , abused or gassed snakes `` are not viable ... Considering how dangerous gasoline is , venom produced from snakes collected this way should never be used in any product that might be used in humans ... ''

One might add that it is unwise to eat these snakes at the popular snake-meat-eating contest and barbecue cook-off .

In the `` safety and handling demonstration pit , '' a Jaycee walks among hundreds of snakes , carelessly kicking them aside , trying to provoke them to rattle and strike . When this fails , the Jaycee may select a snake for special treatment .

Finally , in the `` skinning pit , '' snakes are held down on a tree stump and decapitated with one or more machete blows . Schoolchildren watch from the galleries above . According to Smith , `` each machete blow brought a mixture of exclamations and laughter . ... Blood from this and other killing sessions covered the floor and the skinning table in clots of gore , and twisting rattlesnake bodies were hung to be gutted and skinned , still moving as if trying to get away . ''

The traditional roundups of Sweetwater need to end . The Jaycees could create a festival that raises money for the community and celebrates the rattlesnake as an icon of the American West . In other states where rattlesnakes live , the transition from roundup to wildlife festival has already happened .

One crucial purpose of rattlesnake and wildlife festivals should be to show children that all animals must be treated with kindness and respect . With young people being drawn to environmental science , conservation and wildlife biology , festivals provide networking opportunities and contact with professionals in these fields of interest .

There were demonstrations of the proper and humane technique for extracting venom . And children could leave their handprints in bright , colorful paint rather than snake blood . One visitor said , `` It was very nice to be in a comfortable and safe environment with venomous animals so close by . And to be around so many people who truly appreciated them . The -LRB- traditional -RRB- roundups are tense and stressful , but this was really nice . ''
