All airports in the south are operating normally -- albeit with some delays -- so there 's no excuse to stay away .

With that in mind , CNN Business Traveller has compiled a guide for visitors to the city . It is still wise to bring an umbrella , but this week you may want to throw in a couple of ski poles .

Time zone : London is currently on Greenwich Mean Time -LRB- GMT -RRB- , five hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time and eight hours behind Hong Kong .

From the airport : Non-stop train services link Gatwick , Heathrow and Stansted aiports with central London . The Heathrow Express takes 15 minutes to Paddington Station and costs from $ 24 -LRB- £ 16.50 -RRB- for a single journey . The London Underground costs only $ 6 -LRB- £ 4 -RRB- but takes an hour .

A breakfast meeting : Visitors with a healthy budget and appetite might want to start the day at the Grand Café in The Wolseley -LRB- 160 Piccadilly , W1J -RRB- where you where you can buy a traditional fry-up or `` The English '' for just shy of $ 20 -LRB- £ 13.50 -RRB- .

For dinner : Impress with a table at one of London 's most famous restaurants , Le Gavroche -LRB- 43 Upper Brook Street , W1K -RRB- or Gordon Ramsay at Claridge 's -LRB- Brook Street , W1K -RRB- .

For a cheaper option try a traditional pie and mash shop , the once staple of working class East London life . One of the oldest is M Manze -LRB- 87 Tower Bridge Road , SE1 -RRB- that sells jellied eels as well as pie and mash amid the traditional decor of tiled walls , wooden benches and white marble table-tops .

For a drink : Two of the oldest London pubs include Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese -LRB- 145 Fleet Street , EC4A -RRB- in the City of London and The Prospect of Whitby -LRB- 57 Wapping Wall , E1W -RRB- a short walk along the Thames from Canary Wharf .

For one of the best hotel bars try the Lanesborough -LRB- Hyde Park Corner , SW1X -RRB- and One Aldwych -LRB- 1 Aldwych , WC2B -RRB- . High-flyers can also take in the view over a drink at Vertigo 42 , the champagne bar atop Tower 42 -LRB- 25 Old Broad Street , EC2N -RRB- .

On a fine afternoon -LRB- they do exist -RRB- : Visit St James 's Park to seek out its pelicans and to catch a view of Buckingham Palace from the bridge on the lake . Then walk via Westminster Abbey to Waterloo Bridge for spectacular views of The Palace of Westminster , Somerset House and Victoria Embankment . Finish with a ride on the London Eye .

Opening hours : Most shops and businesses are open from 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Larger stores in central London stay open till 7 p.m or 8 p.m. and later on Thursdays .

Do n't miss in February : In 2009 the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew -LRB- Richmond , TW9 -RRB- is celebrating its 250th anniversary with a `` Tropical Extravaganza '' of exotic plants in one of its conservatories .

The Natural History Museum -LRB- Cromwell Road , SW7 -RRB- is commemorating the bicentenary of Charles Darwin 's birth and 150th year of the publication of On the Origin of Species with a major exhibition .

A number of star-studded plays have also just opened in London 's theatreland . Imelda Staunton , star of Harry Potter , is in Joe Orton 's Entertaining Mr Sloane -LRB- Trafalgar Studios until April 11 -RRB- . James McAvoy is in Richard Greenberg 's Three Days of Rain -LRB- Apollo Theatre until May 2 -RRB- .

What to pack : February is a particularly bleak and cold month in Britain so pack an umbrella and warm clothes . For a handy keepsake of the city , buy an umbrella on arrival from James Smith & Sons -LRB- 53 New Oxford Street , WC1A -RRB- . The shop has hardly changed since it opened in 1830 and offers an impressive range of umbrellas and essential gentlemen 's accessories . Oh , and do n't forget to pack thermals and some decent footwear .
