But there was additional controversy when a prominent film critic suggested it could be a good movie to introduce one 's teenage daughter to . In a blog post on The New York Times website about a theater in New York that chose to flout the MPAA rating , critic A.O. Scott said that `` in some ways , because of its tone and subject matter , ` Blue ' is a movie that may be best appreciated by viewers under the NC-17 age cutoff . '' His 14-year-old daughter had seen it twice at the Telluride Film Festival .

My take on his comment -- as a sex researcher , a university professor and a mom who has seen the film -- is : `` Are you kidding ?! '' I would not recommend anything so vivid portrayed by a same-sex or opposite sex couple to any young person , particularly one who was not already sexually experienced .

If you have not yet sat down with your kids to look through pictures of sexual positions and intercourse , having them watch this movie would be a strange place to start . `` Blue Is the Warmest Color '' is not family entertainment . Its athletic , rough and tumble sexuality can look aggressive , even frightening , to an inexperienced young person , and it is hard to explain to many teens why that might also be loving .

In a perfect world , one would want one 's child to go through stages of experiencing sex , from kissing to fondling to an intimate connection with a first lover . Perhaps this is idealistic , but at least their exposure to vivid images of sexuality might occur over time , graduated according to what they are ready to see and understand .

In any case , it 's certainly not something they 'd want to watch with their parents , although it 's not clear whether Scott actually accompanied his 14-year-old to the Telluride screenings . I am also mystified that Scott talks about the movie as a realistic depiction of young love that teens will identify with . Huh ? This is not a realistic depiction for most teenagers . Approximately 40 % to 50 % of them will not have had intercourse until they have graduated high school . Very few of them will have had a relationship of this caliber or impact .

Of course , there should be lots of conversations between parent and child on all these topics -- lesbian love affairs , affairs with older lovers , sexual desire when you are young -- before a child is launched into the adult world . But a parent exposing a child to deeply intimate sexuality -- people having oral sex together , slapping and grabbing each others ' butts and bringing each other to orgasm -- is neither necessary nor desirable .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz .
