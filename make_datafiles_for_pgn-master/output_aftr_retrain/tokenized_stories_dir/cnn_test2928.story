The sudden lightning strike at Venice Beach caused panic as people tried to get out of the water and off the beach .

The Los Angeles County coroner 's office confirmed one man in his 20s died at a local hospital after he was rescued from the beach .

`` The day started out clear , but there were storms in the forecast for the region on Sunday , '' CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said of the isolated thunderstorms that swept through the Los Angeles area .

The lightning hit the water and the beach at 2:51 p.m. PT -LRB- 5:51 p.m. ET -RRB- , according to spokeswoman Katherine Main of the Los Angeles Fire Department .

One was listed in serious conditions and six were listed in fair condition by late Sunday afternoon

Witnesses tweeted they saw a huge bolt of lightning strike the area , with one Twitter user describing an explosion that blew off nearby roof tiles .

Lightning also struck Catalina Island on Sunday . Los Angeles County Sheriff Sgt. Robert Berardi said a man was hit by a lightning strike near a golf course . He was taken to a local hospital , treated and later released .

Lightning fatalities are pretty rare in California . Between 1959 and 2012 , 31 people died after they were struck by lightning , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . In comparison , there were 468 deaths from lightning strikes in Florida during the same time period , followed by 215 in Texas .

The National Weather Service has compiled a list of lightning safety tips on its website .

When visiting the beach , where there is limited shelter available for taking cover during a thunderstorm , the weather service advises people to run for their cars at the first sign of thunder or lightning in the distance . The agency also warns against taking cover under the beach picnic shelters . It says water , wet items , like ropes and metal objects , including fences and poles , are big dangers during lightning storms because water and metal are both great conductors of electrical currents .

The weather service also offers these tips for minimizing the risk of getting struck by lightning : Avoid open fields and hilltops , stay away from tall , isolated trees or other tall objects , set up camps in lower lying areas and remember tents do not offer protection from lightning .
