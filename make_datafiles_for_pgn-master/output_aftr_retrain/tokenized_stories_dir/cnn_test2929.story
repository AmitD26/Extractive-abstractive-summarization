Although the vessels were once viewed as a quirky sideshow in the drug war , they are becoming faster , more seaworthy , and capable of carrying bigger loads of drugs than earlier models , according to those charged with catching them .

The boats are built in the Colombian jungle . They sail largely beneath the surface of the water but can not submerge completely like a true submarine .

But they are the latest escalation of a tactical race between smugglers and the U.S. Coast Guard .

Diplomatic agreements give the U.S. Coast Guard drug-interdiction jurisdiction in partner countries ' waters .

Encounters have become so frequent -- and the dangers of boarding the vessels so pronounced -- that the Coast Guard is pushing for legislation that would make the use of `` unflagged '' semi-submersibles in international waters a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison , even if authorities ca n't recover drug evidence because the smugglers scuttle the transports .

`` There 's really no legitimate use for a vessel like this , '' Allen said .

An unflagged vessel is one not registered with a government .

`` We 're seeing an evolution in the construction , '' he said . `` Early on we saw fiberglass and now we 're seeing steel . ''

Early semi-subs were capable of carrying 4 or 5 metric tons of cargo ; newer ones can carry 12 metric tons , Allen said . Their speed has increased to 12 knots , which is `` a pretty good speed on the ocean . ''

But Frankie Shroyer , deputy chief of the DEA 's Office of Enforcement Operations , called the use of semi-subs `` an emerging threat and we are attacking it through our investigations and working with the interagency community . ''

The DEA 's main focus , however , `` is to dismantle entire organizations , '' he said . `` So we are looking at the organizations that are building these things . ... These are the same organizations that are using containers , the same organizations that are using airplanes , same organizations using go-fast boats . ''

The semi-subs are `` another adaptation ... that we 're going to have to adapt to ourselves , '' Allen said .

Last year , the Coast Guard seized a record 355,000 pounds of cocaine worth an estimated $ 4.7 billion -- a 2 percent increase over 2006 .

The Coast Guard 's largest cocaine bust ever came in 2007 -- 42,845 pounds stacked in large bundles on the deck of a freighter off the coast of Panama . E-mail to a friend

They 've been around awhile , but now more sophisticated , carry more cargo
