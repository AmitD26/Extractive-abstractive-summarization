-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The only two baby mountain gorillas in captivity -- orphaned two years ago after their mothers were slain in massacres -- will soon be getting a lush , new playpen , Congo 's wildlife authority announced Friday .

Ndeze and Ndakasi will be romping in a special sanctuary , the Senkwekwe Center now under construction in Virunga National Park , where about 200 of the world 's remaining 700 mountain gorillas live .

`` This is paradise for them , '' said Samantha Newport , the park 's communications director . `` They will be able to play around , climb trees and eat forest food . ''

The babies were found in 2007 when they were 2 months old , one on her slain mother and the other on the back of her brother , who was alive when the baby was found .

Authorities do n't know who killed the mothers , but they suspect that the perpetrators were those engaging in the park 's illegal charcoal industry , in which people cut down trees for fuel so they can cook and boil water .

Newport does n't know whether the two will be moved out of the center and into the wild when they get older .

The center will have a 40-by-40-meter interior holding facility , visitation platforms , an education center and veterinary facilities . The wildlife authority is raising $ 100,000 for the completion of the center , and donations will be matched by the United Nations Foundation .

Gorillas have been caught in the middle of the civil warfare in recent years , and fighters had occupied large swaths of the 8,000 -- square-kilometer park . The gorilla section is in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda .
