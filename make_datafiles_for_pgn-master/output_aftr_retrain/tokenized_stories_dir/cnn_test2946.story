No matter who wins the presidency , we need to see more principled problem-solving centrists elected from both parties .

Centrism is one of most misunderstood and maligned political identities in our polarized hyper-partisan environment . Its advocates have been hunted into near-extinction on Capitol Hill by party-first conformists , angry ideologues and special interests .

But a look over this list shows a deeper philosophic consistency beyond party labels -- a commitment to generational responsibility and individual liberty that can be fairly described as fiscally conservative but socially liberal .

That 's why we need them in the next Congress -- to break the fever of division and dysfunction , define the common ground that exists on the urgent issues we face and then build on them . Their success in the 2012 election would be a healthy step forward for the nation .

2012 ballot initiatives : Voter-run or special interest-hijacked ?

Angus King

This independent 's Senate campaign in Maine is the biggest nonpresidential race in the nation for many independent voters -- a gutsy challenge to the two parties that looks like it will prove successful . King has described himself as `` too fiscally conservative for the Democrats and too socially liberal for the Republicans -- like 75 % of the American people . ''

He proved his effectiveness in two terms as a popular independent governor of Maine in the 1990s . Now he is the odds-on favorite to succeed retiring centrist Republican Olympia Snowe in the Senate . If the Senate is closely divided , he could be the deciding vote .

King has told me about his vision to bring together a coalition of senators in the vital center to break gridlock .

`` What if two or three other people like me around the country were elected who said : ` I do n't care about the parties -- I just want to solve the problems ... We 're going start talking to each other in a grown-up and civil way . '' Here 's hoping .

Bob Kerrey

The Medal of Honor winner , Nebraska governor , senator , presidential candidate and college president would return to Washington as an elder statesman committed to building bipartisan coalitions . He is one of the most respected and best liked political leaders of recent decades .

His opponent , social conservative state senator Deb Fischer , rode to victory in the Republican primary thanks to endorsements by the likes of Sarah Palin and Jim DeMint .

`` Somebody has to go back there and change Congress . Somebody has to stand the middle ground , '' Kerrey says . `` I want to be the person that makes that change happen . '' This election is close in a center-right state , and former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel 's endorsement of Democrat Kerrey on Thursday provided another boost . Having Kerrey back in the senate would be a win not just for the people of Nebraska , but for the entire country .

Heather Wilson

So , Wilson is flying against stiff headwinds . But she 's a big-tent , pro-life Republican -- fiscally conservative , centrist on social issues and strong on defense -- with a demonstrated ability to win over independent voters . Her biggest problem is the rightward drift of the GOP and the consequent alienation of the Hispanic vote in a presidential year . But she would make a great senator that New Mexico would be proud of for decades to come .

Hoosiers do n't seem to want an embarrassing advocate of extremism in the Senate . They 'd do better with Donnelly .

Linda Lingle

It takes an impressive person to win Hawaii 's governorship as a Republican , but former Maui Mayor Linda Lingle managed to distinguish herself as a successful and popular leader during her two terms , while breaking down barriers as the first woman and first Jewish governor of the Aloha State .

Running in a presidential election cycle with Hawaii-born Barack Obama on the ballot is no picnic for a Republican , but Lingle has overcome long odds before -- she won reelection as governor by the largest margin in Hawaii 's history . She 's developed an impressive record as a decisive leader , combining fiscal responsibility with a big-tent approach on social issues . She would be a refreshing centrist Republican voice in the U.S. Senate .

Tim Kaine

Kaine -- a former DNC Chair - is not as nonpartisan as many centrists , but he is a classic DLC Blue Dog of the kind we have seen almost hunted into extinction on Capital Hill . His election would send a welcome signal about that tradition 's persistence and further commitment to the kind of thoughtful bipartisan cooperation we need to see in the Senate .

But Brown 's record can not and should not be ignored -- and if he loses this Senate seat in the headwinds of the likely Obama landslide in his home state of Massachusetts , we could see Brown back in the Senate or serve as governor sometime in the future .

Jim Graves

To many moderates , Michele Bachmann is the symbol of everything that 's wrong with our divided and dysfunctional congress . She 's quick to call opponents anti-American and weave unhinged conspiracy theories into policy debates . But she 's never had a serious candidate campaign against her until now .

`` My policy approach transcends political lines , '' Graves told me in an interview for DailyBeast , `` I 'm a centrist , a libertarian when it comes to social issues . I do n't think government should be involved with personal lives . I really believe in separation of church and state . Bachmann wants to blur those lines -- she would -LRB- replace -RRB- our democracy with a theocracy , '' he says . `` She epitomizes everything that 's wrong with Congress and this country -- a lack of civility , a lack of bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to problem solving .
