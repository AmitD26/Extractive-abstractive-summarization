`` We think India as a country understands the importance of trying to use diplomacy to resolve these difficult threats and is certainly working toward lowering their purchases of Iranian oil , '' Clinton said in Kolkata , the first stop on her visit to India . `` We commend the steps they 've taken thus far and hope they will do even more . ''

The United States and other Western countries are using economic pressure on Iran , particularly on its oil industry , to try to push Tehran into halting its nuclear program .

They have encouraged Asian countries like India , Japan and South Korea -- key consumers of Iranian oil -- to cut back their purchases .

U.S. officials say India has lowered the amount of oil it buys from Iran in recent months . But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's government is also wrestling with stubbornly high inflation and is wary of provoking upward pressure on prices .

India imports about 70 % of the oil it uses , with around 10 % to 14 % estimated to come from Iran .

Clinton said Monday that there was an `` adequate '' supply of oil `` in the marketplace . ''

She made the comments before she traveled to New Delhi , where she is met with Singh and other top officials .
