Badawi , 30 , fell foul of Saudi Arabia 's guardianship laws , which require women to gain permission from their father , husband or even adult son for many daily activities .

She was jailed for seven months after her father brought a `` disobedience '' case against her and she refused to return to his home .

Badawi was released last year after an online campaign , and eventually got a ruling to transfer her guardianship to her uncle .

She also successfully filed a suit against her father 's refusal to allow her to marry .

Badawi added : `` When I was alone , I would remember the injustice , from my father , from the judge who was horrible to me .

`` I would remember my son . I would remember how even society did n't spare me -- I was insulted a lot and despite the insults , I stayed quiet , I did n't respond . In these moments I would cry . ''

Despite her own trauma , Badawi does not call for a change in the law , but rather for better awareness .

`` That 's why I wish that law would be taught in schools from an early age . ''

Badawi was presented with an International Women of Courage award by U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama and U.S. Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton on March 8 . Presented annually , the award recognizes women who have show exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for women 's rights .

Women 's rights is a hot issue in Saudi Arabia , and there is a surprising range of views , from both women and men .

She continued to do so several times after that , but can no longer drive after she and her husband were both forced to sign legal pledges that she would not drive again .

`` What is more upsetting to me than having to sign the pledge is that my ` guardian ' was summoned , '' she said . `` I reject the whole idea of his being my ` guardian ' because I 'm a 47-year-old woman , I should be my own guardian . ''

For Hariri , there is far more to campaign for than driving .

`` So we started calling for the establishment of a ` personal status law ' to protect these rights , '' she added .

Hariri said the rights she wants are those already given to women in the Quran and the Sunna , the teachings of Prophet Mohammed .

For Al Youssef , women who campaign for more rights are a pampered minority with no real problems .

`` Bring me a poor woman who talks about these things and I 'll say ok , maybe she needs this , but those who talk about women 's rights ... these are women who have everything they need and all they 're missing is to be able to take their passport and travel as they want , or to drive a car .

`` They did n't think about the needs of the poorer class . ''

While Al Youssef believes there is no appetite from either King Abdullah or society at large for greater women 's rights , Samar Fatany is convinced of the opposite .

Fatany , a radio journalist and writer on women 's issues who was one of the first women employed in government 30 years ago , believes change will be inevitable , though gradual .

`` I think King Abdullah has been a great supporter of women , he has been the champion of women and as a result the whole nation has changed and given great support to women . ''

Fatany added : `` It takes an educated person to know a different way of life , that it does n't have to be that way .

`` If you are a person who is isolated and this is a lifestyle that you know , it does n't occur to you that there 's another way , that you do n't have to accept that . This does n't have to do with religion .

Cleric Sheikh Adnan Bahareth , who insisted on being interviewed over the phone because he did not want to appear on camera with a woman , argued that Saudi women were lucky not to have to drive .

`` Men are slaves for women today , '' he said .
