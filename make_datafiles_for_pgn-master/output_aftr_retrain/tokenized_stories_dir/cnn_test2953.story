The Manchester United star won his 100th international cap at the Asian Cup last week , as South Korea lost on penalties to eventual winners Japan in the semifinals .

`` I am announcing my retirement to open more doors for younger , junior players who have to grow to replace me eventually , '' Park told reporters .

He added that a right knee injury , for which he has undergone two major operations , also played a part in his decision .

Park was not included in the squad who defeated Uzbekistan in Friday 's third-place playoff match in Qatar , but the news that he was to step down as South Korea captain was announced by coach Cho Kwang-Rae after the match .

`` It would be better if I could keep both of them in the national team but they have done an excellent job and I 'm sure the Korean fans would like to congratulate them for all their hard work . ''

`` Like we have seen during the Asian Cup games , there are many young Korean players who have enormous potential , passion and talent , '' Park , who led South Korea to the World Cup semifinals on home soil in 2002 , said .

`` My departure will help more young players who have demonstrated their talent and ability during the Asian Cup to prepare for the next World Cup . ''

The former Kyoto Purple Sanga and PSV Eindhoven player added that his retirement was definite and he would not be tempted back into the fold even if South Korea qualified for the World Cup finals in Brazil in 2014 .

Park became the first Asian to play in a UEFA Champions League final , when Manchester United lost to Barcelona in 2009 .

And he said that despite his international career being over he had no plans as yet to leave the Premier League leaders , who he has been with since 2005 .

`` I have n't decided when I 'll quit . I think I can play at least three to four more years , '' he added .
