Philip Chism was indicted Friday on an additional count of aggravated rape in connection with the death of Colleen Ritzer , 24 , on October 22 in the girls ' bathroom of Danvers High School . He will be arraigned on the new count on Thursday .

The affidavit , released Monday , said that after being booked in connection with the crime , Chism `` admitted to murdering '' his teacher . Chism , in the presence of his mother , Diana Chism , waived his Miranda rights .

The affidavit also said Chism may have sought to `` memorialize '' the crime by photographing or videotaping parts of it with his cell phone , which was later destroyed in what investigators said was an attempt to hide incriminating evidence .

The Essex County district attorney 's office said Friday that it presented a grand jury with additional evidence . The new youthful offender indictment alleges that Chism forcibly had sexual intercourse with the victim .

`` Aggravated rape is charged when there is serious bodily harm and/or when the rape was committed during the commission of another felonious and assaultive crime , '' the district attorney 's office said in a statement .

Denise Regan , Chism 's public defender , could not be reached for comment .

Chism , who is being held without bail , is set to appear January 30 in Salem Superior Court for a pre-trial conference .

According to a police affidavit , a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee .

The affidavit includes testimony from witnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher 's final moments .

Shortly after , a female student enters the bathroom and then quickly walks out , according to the court papers . She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes ; the person 's rear was exposed , with clothes piled on the floor .
