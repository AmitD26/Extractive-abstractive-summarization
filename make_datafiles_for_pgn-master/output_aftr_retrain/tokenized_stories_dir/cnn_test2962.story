He has found himself in some pretty privileged positions , capturing compelling images of football 's greats -- and poignant , intimate shots away from the on-field action .

`` I think knowledge of the sport is particularly important , because certain players have different styles , '' the Briton tells CNN 's Sports Photo Masterclass series .

`` Generally the good players that just want to win and score make better pictures . ''

It 's been said that eyes are the windows to the soul . Botterill says he 's learned that focusing on players ' eyes helps photographers to anticipate their moves .

While covering the trophy ceremony at the 2006 World Cup in Germany -- a tournament he describes as one of his favorite events to have worked at -- Botterill caught a glimmer in Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro 's eyes as he stood with his team for the presentation .

`` Once Cannavaro got the trophy , he did n't just grab it , '' Botterill recalls .

`` You could see he had something in his mind to do . Things seemed to slow down and I thought I knew what was going to happen next . ''

Born in the English town of Northampton in 1967 , Botterill got his first break at the age of 16 at the agency founded by renowned sports photographer Bob Thomas , working in the dark room .

He attended his first World Cup in Mexico in 1986 and , after a brief career break `` hanging out on beaches and scaffolding , '' he resumed his photographer career at Allsport , which was later acquired by Getty .

The job took him not only to his first World Cup , in the U.S. 20 years ago , but to both the Summer and Winter Olympics .

`` It 's not all glamor -- I had cockroaches in my bag last night ! '' he told CNN , post-interview , via email from Brazil -- where he is crisscrossing South America 's largest country to cover the game he loves most .

There he captured closeup shots of former football star and Argentina coach Diego Maradona , running down the line , kissing each player and firing them up before the game .

Because few photographers are given that kind of access , there 's a certain amount of pressure to deliver .

`` Every time you 're in that kind of situation , you know some of this has never been photographed before -- so there 's pressure in one way , but it 's also quite exciting , '' Botterill says .

`` Because you know if you stumble across a picture and something happens , people are going to want to use it because it 's never been shot . ''

`` The key is to work with the equipment you 've got , '' Botterill advises .

`` Do n't try to look at the photographers on the other side of the pitch and go , ` Oh they 've got a big lens ... ' because you ca n't take those pictures .

Basic photographic techniques will help elevate your work . Botterill says any photographer can better their chances by first finding the best background and the best light before starting to shoot .

And it 's important to sometimes just wander in pursuit of rare photographic moments -- not all the World Cup pictures are on the pitch . If you do n't move around and explore , he says , you 're not going to find anything different .

And in Brazil , the country 's renowned fervor for football means fans are out in full regalia everywhere , showing pride and support for their team .

`` Those pictures for me are as important as anything , '' Botterill says . `` Those are the pictures that you really want to get .

`` The more experience you have -- and the nice thing about doing a lot of World Cups -- is that you kind of back up and back away from the more obvious things and you take the time to go looking for those rare moments . ''
