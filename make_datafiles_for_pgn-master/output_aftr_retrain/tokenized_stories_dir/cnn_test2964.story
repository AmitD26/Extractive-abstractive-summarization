State prosecutors released a grand jury indictment Monday that charges Joseph Robert Patterson with second-degree murder .

The new charge comes more than a week after the death of the Minnesota Vikings running back 's son , who was living with his mother in South Dakota .

Authorities have said that the child suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse .

In a text to a Fox Sports reporter , Peterson said he decided to play again for the same reason he participated in the NFL 's skills testing event for potential draft picks a day after his brother died in 2007 .

He tweeted thanks to fellow players , some of whom had taken to the social network to defend his decision to play .

`` The NFL is a fraternity of brothers and I am thankful for the tweets , phone calls and text messages from my fellow players , '' he tweeted after his son 's death .

After the game last Sunday , Peterson 's teammate , tight end Kyle Rudolph , praised Peterson 's determination and heart .

`` I ca n't imagine , you know , the heavy heart that he had today , being out on the field , '' Rudolph said . `` But he spoke to us right before the game , right before he took the field and said he was going to give it his all , for all four quarters , and that 's exactly what he did . ''
