Want to make plans for the weekend ?

Wondering how my day was ?

Need to discuss our relationship ?

Save texting for simple stuff : Let 's meet at 8 p.m. ? Do you like sushi ? Or even , you looked so hot last night ! When it comes to texting , the KISS rule applies -- Keep It Simple Stupid .

`` He 's a very smart man , and I was in love with him when I married him , '' Perry says , of her ex-husband Russell Brand . `` Let 's just say I have n't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31 , 2011 . ''

`` People can hide themselves in a text message , '' warns Bela Gandhi , founder of Smart Dating Academy in Chicago .

As a happily single woman , I am shocked at how many professional , attractive and otherwise intelligent men have no idea how to hold communicate effectively by phone or face to face .

Real communication often takes courage . It 's not easy to drop our defenses and reveal our insecurities to one another , especially if we 've gotten our feelings hurt a few times . But developing your emotional intelligence is a critical ingredient in all healthy adult relationships .

`` Texting is not the place for anything serious . Never handle something over text that should be handled in person or over the phone . This just shows that you are a weakling who deserves a good slapping . Swallow your fear , and pick up the phone . '' says relationship expert Michael Masters , author of `` TextAppeal -- For Guys ! The Ultimate Texting Guide . ''

Do n't get me wrong , no one has time to be on the phone all day every day , but I can guarantee you that if the woman you 're dating would rather text you than call , the relationship is over .

The lost art of offline dating

I get it . I love technology and I text , tweet , tumblr , pin , and share on Facebook with a passion . Social networking is an integral part of my life . But when it comes to romance , women still need to hear your voice or look you in the eye when we 're talking .

Do n't let technology turn you into a coward who is afraid of real conversation , or sharing yourself in any meaningful way . Do n't be a Russell Brand . If you have more virtual friends on Facebook than you do in reality , it 's time to reevaluate your life . Get out there make a few actual friends , in person .

Dating is easy . It 's risky . But it is not nearly as complicated as many people make out -- as long as you actually like yourself first and are basically satisfied with your own life .

I admit there is one date text I always will answer : `` Want to go to the Knicks game tonight ? '' Now that message just might be the start of a beautiful relationship .
