The U.S. military burns waste -- including medical waste -- in pits near an Air Force base in Iraq .

Until three incinerators were installed , the smelly pit was the only place to dispose of trash , including plastics , food and medical waste .

`` At the peak , before they went to use the real industrial incinerators , it was about 500,000 pounds a day of stuff , '' according to a transcript of an April 2008 presentation by Dr. Bill Halperin , who heads the Occupational and Environmental Health Subcommittee at the Defense Health Board . `` The way it was burned was by putting jet fuel on it . ''

A lawsuit filed against the burn pit operators by a contractor alleges the burn pit also contained body parts . Watch burn pits spew black smoke ''

Aside from Balad , there are similar pits at bases elsewhere in Iraq and Afghanistan . Some still have no incinerators .

` Iraqi crud '

Many of the soldiers who went through Balad since the beginning of the war had become used to `` Iraqi crud , '' as they dubbed the symptom .

`` I had a chronic cough , irritation , shortness of breath , '' said Dr. Chris Coppola , an Air Force surgeon who worked on base in 2005 and again in 2007 , `` I was coughing up phlegm , sometimes black stuff and dust . ''

While Coppola said he did n't work in the burn pit , he knew the medical waste was going there .

Coppola said that when he worked at the base hospital , the emergency room had frequent visits for `` respiratory complaints , complaining of the coughing and breathing issues . ''

Since he 's been back from Iraq , Coppola said he feels `` very healthy . ''

But other soldiers said they can not shake the symptoms and they suspect the burn pit smoke is the cause .

Dennis Gogel was stationed in Balad twice between 2004 and 2006 . He said he was in housing just a few hundred yards from the pit and would often jog past the pit .

The 29-year old Gogel said that in the last two years he 's had upper respiratory infections , skin irritation and he 's lost 60 pounds since deployment .

`` I have blotchy spots on my face . I was treated for psoriasis , but it wo n't go way , '' he said .

Gogel has recently joined a class action lawsuit against the company contracted to handle waste disposal .

Just months after returning home from his first tour in Iraq in 2006 , Maj. Kevin Wilkins developed headaches , but did not see a doctor .

Soon after his second Iraq tour in 2007 , Wilkins -- a registered nurse in the Air Force reserve -- died of an advanced brain tumor . He was 51 .

Concerning memos , questionable tests

The memo , written by Lt. Col Darrin Curtis , a bioenvironmental engineering flight commander , concluded `` there is an acute health hazard for individuals . ''

The memo is co-signed by Lt. Col James Elliott , chief , Aeromedical Services , who wrote that he concurred with Curtis ' memo .

`` In my professional opinion , the known carcinogens and respiratory sensitizers released into the atmosphere by the burn pit present both an acute and a chronic health hazard to our troops and the local populations , '' Elliott said .

More alarm was raised in the military community when the initial draft of results from a 2007 study was released with a math error , overstating the dioxin levels tested by 1,000 times .

The report was circulated by the military 's U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine `` in the interest of transparency and the fact that they needed this information very quickly in order to answer service members ' concerns , '' said Craig Postlewaite of the force readiness and health assurance office at the Department of Defense .

At the Pentagon 's Force Health Protection Directorate , officials analyzed more than 160 air samples and concluded , in a soon to be released report , that the only risk is of temporary respiratory distress , nothing that poses a long-term threat .

However , in the general findings , the report questioned whether the conclusions would hold `` when more thorough analysis is conducted . '' But a spokeswoman for the military said the final report , expected this week , will find the testing conducted was sufficient and conclusive .

Pits still in use

The concern about the pits was first reported in the Military Times . Upon seeing that article , Sen. Russ Feingold , D-Wisconsin , wrote to Gen. David Petraeus , the commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East , to express his concern about the smoke 's effect on troops .

Petraeus responded citing the military findings , but said burn pits are necessary .

`` There is and will continue to be a need for burn pits during contingency operations , '' Petraeus wrote back to Feingold in a letter provided to CNN .

`` I remain concerned that service members may become sick as a result of exposure to fumes at Balad Air Base and potentially other bases in Iraq and Afghanistan , '' Feingold said . `` Service members who serve at the base for more than a year could still be in jeopardy as a result of exposure to the fumes . ''
