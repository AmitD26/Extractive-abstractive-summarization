-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The parents of a missing Missouri girl have refused to be interviewed separately by authorities , Kansas City police said Wednesday .

But the attorney representing Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley , parents of 11-month-old Lisa Irwin , said the couple is not opposed to separate interviews , but do not want what police requested -- an unrestricted interview with no attorneys present .

`` Being questioned separately is not the issue , '' said attorney Cyndy Short . She said the couple has been cooperative and has previously been interviewed separately as well as together . They do n't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair , open-minded and non-accusatory , she said .

Meanwhile , Lisa 's half-brothers , who were in the family 's home the night she disappeared , will be re-interviewed by authorities on Friday , Kansas City police said Wednesday .

`` Not an interrogation , '' he said . `` They are kids , after all . ''

The boys are 8 and 6 , Short said . Young said they were previously interviewed just after Lisa disappeared , both for under an hour .

Bradley said in an NBC interview last week that she was drunk the night Lisa disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported .

The couple said in the same interview they had refused to let authorities re-interview Lisa 's older brothers .

`` Lisa was the little girl that was going to hold this family together , '' Short said , adding the child was wanted , looked forward to and `` well-loved . ''

Asked about Bradley 's admission that she was drinking the night Lisa vanished , Short said Bradley did what a lot of parents do when their children are in bed -- shared some drinks with a friend . `` It 's just not that unusual until your life gets turned upside down , '' she said .

A cadaver dog searching the family 's Kansas City home indicated a positive `` hit '' for the scent of a body , according to documents released Friday .

On that information , Short said that law enforcement typically begins such investigations inside the home , then if warranted the probe moves outside the family . `` We do n't know exactly what happened here , so we need to keep broadening the investigation , '' she said , adding she is hopeful that the investigation is going in that direction .

Between 30 and 50 investigators , including police and FBI personnel , were involved in the search as of Tuesday , the Kansas City Police Department said . Some 900 tips had been received by investigators , the department said .
