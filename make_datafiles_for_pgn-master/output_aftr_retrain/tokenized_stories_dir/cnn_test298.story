At the height of summer , in the sweltering industrial suburbs of Jaipur , Rajasthan in north-west India , the Pearl Academy of Fashion remains 20 degrees cooler inside than out -- by drawing on Rajasthan 's ancient architecture .

While the exterior appears very much in keeping with the trends of contemporary design , at the base of the building is a vast pool of water -- a cooling concept taken directly from the stepwell structures developed locally over 1,500 years ago to provide refuge from the desert heat .

`` When water evaporates in heat , it immediately brings down the temperature of the space around it , '' he says .

While traditional stepwells often go many stories below ground level , Rastogi 's go down just four meters . However , the effect is the same and -- like the ancient Mughal palaces before it -- the academy enjoys its own microclimate .

`` How do you begin to think that you can dig into the ground and use the earth as a heat sink , have access to water , put a pavilion into it so that its comfortable through the year ? It takes a lot of technology for us to think up something that simple now . ''

Centuries ago , latticed screens or `` jaali '' filtered direct sunlight into the palaces . The effect was decorative and helped reduce the heat . Likewise at The Pearl Academy , a latticed concrete screen runs the length of the building and provides a cooling outer skin .

The success of the academy 's eco-design has had an impact . Regulations -- based on these passive cooling techniques -- were introduced last year for all new Indian government buildings .
