Bynes then boarded a flight from New York to Los Angeles , where she told reporters at the airport that she was there to file a lawsuit against her parents .

While she was told that a limo driver was taking her to a lawyer 's office in Pasadena before going to a West Hollywood hotel , she was instead driven to the hospital -- which resembles an office park -- where her parents ' lawyer was waiting for her .

`` In a perfect world , one would be honest about getting a person into a psychiatric hospital , but from her past behavior we have seen that Amanda Bynes avoids psychiatric hospitals at all cost because she does n't believe that she 's sick , '' Dr. Carole Lieberman , a Los Angeles psychiatrist who has followed Bynes ' story , told CNN on Sunday .

If the psychiatrists at Las Encinas Hospital decide to extend Bynes ' involuntary treatment beyond the initial 72 hours allowed for evaluation under California 's `` 5150 '' law , they must convince a mental health referee that she is `` a danger to self , to others or is gravely disabled , '' Lieberman said .

One reason for keeping psychiatric patients on an involuntary hold is if they are `` having auditory hallucinations '' or they are `` responding to internal stimuli , '' according to guidelines on the Los Angeles County Superior Court website .

The ups and downs of Amanda Bynes

Her tweet about a microchip forcing her to write negative things about her father would not be the only potential evidence , based on her very public history of odd behavior and several criminal charges .

Bynes was arrested on a DUI charge in Sherman Oaks , California , last month . Her arrest report noted a `` disheveled appearance . ''

This is the second time Bynes has been placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold . The previous instance came in July 2013 after she was `` involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood '' in Thousand Oaks , California . She eventually entered an inpatient psychiatric facility and was later released into her parents ' custody .

The latest episodes of odd behavior come a year after her parents told CNN their daughter was `` making great strides towards recovery '' from mental illness .

She enrolled into the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles at the start of 2014 , but she dropped out in the summer .

Lieberman said if Bynes is returned to a conservatorship under her parents , as was done last year , they need to work with a psychiatrist to `` work out the family dysfunction . ''

People magazine reported in 2012 that Bynes tried to emancipate herself while still a minor , though she never moved out entirely .
