-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It sounds like something made up just in time for Halloween . Several reports from France of attacks by people dressed as clowns -- and armed with anything from knives to baseball bats -- have been making headlines in Europe . Taken with the recent sightings reported by some communities in Florida , New Mexico and Indiana , among others , it is easy to wonder what is going on . What is it about clowns ? Why these strange sightings now ?

But to those of us who have been following what is proving to be an unusually lively period of clown reports -- whether they be actual crimes or simply hoaxes -- neither the reports themselves , nor the peculiar interest in these incidents , is all that surprising .

For a start , while these developments are notable , the recent outbreak of such activity is actually not without precedent .

In the mid-1980s , for example , a number of episodes were recorded on both sides of the Atlantic , first in Scotland and then in various towns across New England , as people reported clowns in ice cream vans attempting to lure children .

We also know that clowns inhabit fertile ground in terms of phobias -- after all , they can invoke anything from a fear of masks , to stranger danger , to our anxieties regarding public humiliation . -LRB- And that 's not to mention the question of why a grown person would dress this way , in a kind of asexual fetishism -RRB- .

Meanwhile , the Clowns of America International , the professional organization representing U.S. clowns , has reported a significant decline in the number of students attending clown school in recent years .

So it is possible , then , that these two elements -- the decline in `` licensed '' clown performers and the rise in the number of `` sinister '' sightings -- are more closely related than they seem . After all , all forms of monstrosity are essentially commentaries on the nature of humanity 's social relations -LRB- the Twilight books and movies , for example , offer a straightforward examination of adolescent sexuality explored through the lens of a vampire/human/werewolf menage . -RRB-

But this golden age has passed , and our ideas of clowns are now set against a backdrop of recession , social atomization and a distrust of traditional institutions . When seen from the vantage point of the present , the Joeys of the big top seem hopelessly naive , the leering remnants of an industrial past whose promises are unfulfilled . It also seems no coincidence that the narratives that employ scary clowns so often associate them with failed businesses -- empty music halls echoing with the ghosts of past laughter or abandoned theme parks repurposed as lairs .

So , should you think you see a clown peering through your curtains this Halloween , take comfort in the fact that it 's nothing personal .
