He swam 2.4 miles . He biked 112 miles . He ran 26.2 miles . The Pennsville , New Jersey , resident found relief in triathlons .

Then in 2007 , after a three-day binge , `` I came home and was crying , '' Freas said . `` I was so depressed . I turned on the TV . '' The set was tuned to ESPN , which was airing a story about a former drug addict who competed in triathlons .

The program 's subject was Todd Crandell , who had lost a college hockey scholarship because of a drug addiction . After 13 years of using drugs , Crandell started competing in Ironman races and championed finding positive ways to fight addiction through his program called Racing for Recovery .

`` Having an athletic background , I was drawn to getting back in shape , '' Crandell said . `` It makes you turn intellectually and spiritually fit . Exercise is essential . It decreases addiction , depression and you use it as part of the recovery . ''

`` His whole story seemed like mine , '' Freas said . `` That 's why it hit me so much . It was my story but it happened to somebody else . I knew I had to get back into fitness . ''

`` It killed me , '' Freas said . `` I was just motivated . I was sore for a week and I gradually got into it . As soon as I started including fitness into my everyday lifestyle , it made it so much easier . It kept me busy and because of the physical fitness , it was making me feel better about myself . ''

He pushed himself to run farther and raced in his first Ironman competition in 2008 .

`` It 's different when you use drugs , you temporarily feel good and afterwards , you feel like doing more drugs , '' Freas said . `` When you go for a long run and do physical fitness , you feel good doing it . ''

`` The thought centers around the release of mood-altering brain chemical , mainly endorphins , '' Bryant said . `` It gives you euphoria or what you call ` runner 's high . ' ''

Crandell said some people who battle drug addiction `` want something more than sitting in support groups filled with smoke , complaining about drinking . ''

The purpose of Racing for Recovery is not to turn everyone into an athlete , but to focus on positive pursuits in a person 's life .

`` Whatever you lost during your addiction , that should be your Ironman , not just running , '' Crandell said . `` If your goal is to become a teacher , let that be your Ironman . ''

`` I did n't want to come back home , because this was where I did all the dirt , all the partying and stuff , '' Freas said . `` As time went on , I had to come back here . My life is turned around . I got to help people in my hometown . ''

Back in New Jersey , Freas helped train Dustin Deckard , 19 , a former high school star wrestler , who is recovering from a four-year heroin addiction . Deckard wanted to get clean after a near-fatal overdose .

`` I have to be clean the rest of my life , '' Deckard said . `` Sometimes that overwhelms me . I just feel that sometimes it 's not fair that other people can go out and have fun and drink and do whatever at a party . But me -- if I do anything -- it 's off . I ca n't stop . I definitely have troubles with that . ''

`` I know how he was feeling , being down , not wanting to use drugs , '' Deckard said . `` I just relate to him in every way . We both used . He 's also into sports and into wrestling like I was . That 's what 's cool . ''

This Sunday , Freas and Deckard head to Racing for Recovery 's half triathlon at Monroe , Michigan where the teen will race for the first time .
