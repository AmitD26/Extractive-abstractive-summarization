Instead of listening to Malala , instead of seeing Prime Minister Stephen Harper honor the idealistic teenager who defied radicals to advocate peace , reconciliation , and education , Canadians watched in horror as their normally placid capital became the scene of mayhem in what Harper later described as a terrorist attack .

The killings in Canada and the canceled events delineate a sharp contrast between the alternative worldviews faced by young people today -- particularly by young Muslims .

They also highlight the need to develop a clear path of active involvement for those who want to join in making a reality of Malala 's vision , just as those who support extremists receive clear direction on how to join their cause .

On one side there is the future outlined with such remarkable clarity by Malala , one in which we provide educational opportunities for all , strive for peace , and respect our differences . She has the heavy burden of having become the torch-bearer for advocates of moderation , coexistence and equality .

Then there is the other end of the spectrum , inhabited by the hyper-extremist group known as ISIS , which also manages to communicate its vision for the future , broadcasting its ideology , its military exploits and its excesses across social media platforms .

It was not the first time that her plans were abruptly changed by a shooter . Her life took a most unexpected turn in 2012 after an extremist tried to kill her .

Now , with the rise of ISIS and a jihadist appeal that has brought young Muslims from around the world to fight in Syria and Iraq , Malala 's symbolic place in the battle of ideas extends beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan .

Consider Malala 's words at the U.N. last year : `` We call upon all communities to be tolerant -- to reject prejudice based on cast , creed , sect , religion or gender . To ensure freedom and equality for women so that they can flourish . We can not all succeed when half of us are held back . We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave -- to embrace the strength within themselves and realize their full potential . ''

The jihadi appeal is quickly rejected by the vast majority of Muslims , but the tiny percentage who accept it can cause terrible damage . And their help contributes to ISIS victories in the Middle East that are destroying the lives of men and women , including those who might have grown into future Malalas .

Malala 's canceled events in Canada will likely be rescheduled . When she returns , she will have a message that will resonate even louder after what occurred in Ottawa . Until then , let her supporters come up with a plan so that those who would follow her can help build the world she envisions , with organizations and active movements in which people can enlist to promote equality , coexistence , and acceptance of other points of view .
