-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- â € ªIndia : you either love it or hate it .

Home to 28 states and 7 union territories , India contains more than 800 dialects and can lay claim to some of the most varied sites in the world .

From Kerala 's backwaters to Tamil Nadu 's temples , and Rajasthan 's deserts to Kanchenjunga , the third highest mountain in the world , there are endless superlatives to go around .

Here are 10 .

1 . Barbers

Barbers will take their scissors to wayward eyebrows , tufts of ear hair and nostrils .

That 's just the beginning .

Once the customer is shorn , wet-wiped and toweled off , barbers begin a firm head , neck and shoulder massage , which can descend into facial slapping and skull-pounding known as `` champi , '' which is where the word `` shampoo '' comes from .

Be warned : their signature move is a swift neck crack , which can come as a shock to first-timers .

2 . Enterprising street vendors

India 's street vendors sell the usual wares , from fake DVDs to earrings to bags of masala popcorn and roasted peanuts .

But there 's also ear-cleaning , street dentistry and pavement astrology .

Vendors possessing the presence of mind to seize any opportunity -- last year when Starbucks opened in Mumbai , the queues were so long , a tea-vendor set up shop outside and sold his wares to waiting customers .

3 . Old world train travel

This year marks 160 years since the birth of Indian Railways , which carries more than 20 million passengers a day along 65,000 kilometers of track .

Tip : travelers should choose the new derailment-proof Duronto trains -- there 's no better way to see the country .

4 . Notorious celebrities

They might endorse skin-lightening creams , produce terrible films and become embroiled in one scandal after another , but almost nothing ca n't dim their stardom .

Current fave Sunny Leone -- a former pediatric nurse trainee in Orange Country turned porn star and now mainstream actress -- is the most searched celebrity on the Internet , racking up 35 million searches in India this year .

5 . Accessorizing

6 . Comfort food

7 . Gesticulating

India has more than 800 dialects , but it 's the head-shaking and wrist-flicking gestures that are the most dramatic means of communication and an inherent part of an Indian 's genetic makeup .

When the British left India , they left two real legacies : the railways and cricket .

Not just the preserve of the upper classes wearing club ties , drinking Pimms and eating cucumber sandwiches , cricket in India is a way of life , enjoyed by every class , age and sex , while cricketers are revered as gods .

With so many religions and cultures existing side by side in India , it 's rare for a week to go by without some sort of celebration .

It 's wise to bring along a change of clothes when invited to share mutton biryani during Eid or set off Lakshmi banger fireworks in the street at Diwali or be doused in colored water during Holi , the festival of spring .

10 . Cities in the mountains

India 's cities in the mountains , or `` hill stations , '' are walkers ' havens .

Hidden between the jungle-topped Sahyadri hills 80 kilometers east of Mumbai , it was originally used by the British to escape the Bombay heat , and is free from fume-spewing vehicles while being accessible on horseback , on foot or by the narrow-gauge toy train that trundles along tiny tracks .
