Darijo Srna , who plays for Donetsk-based Shakhtar , made the gesture which allowed for the fruit from his hometown of Metkovic in Croatia , which is renowned for the fruit , to arrive in Ukraine .

`` It is very important that there are people who support you in difficult situations . Donbass and Donetsk gave me a lot . And these citrus fruit is just a small gift that I can give back . ''

In April 2014 , pro-Russian activists took control of government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine .

This season , Shakhtar has been forced to play its home league games in Kiev , the capital city , while it has hosted Champions League fixtures in Lviv .

`` Every day I read and watch the news . After each game I tell the guys that all the goals we score , all our victories are our gift to Donbass , to Donetsk , to the fans of Shakhtar , who currently have a tough time . ''

`` This is my city . The city in which I have been supported for 11 years , owing to which I matured both as a footballer and individual .

`` I do it not for someone to say : `` Well done , Darijo ! '' This is from the heart and soul . I 'll try to support all those who need it , '' he added .
