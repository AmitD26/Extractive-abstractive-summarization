-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For centuries , Timbuktu has existed in the Western imagination as a byword for the most exotic , far-flung place conceivable .

Situated on the southern edge of the Sahara , it acquired a near-mythical status in distant countries for its fabled inaccessibility , and for the accounts of the dazzling material and intellectual wealth to be found there .

The city , today part of present-day Mali and known as the `` city of 333 saints '' for the Sufi imams , sheiks and scholars buried there , was made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988 .

But there are fears this carefully preserved legacy could be under threat from groups of armed rebels who have overrun the ancient city this month , in the vacuum left by retreating Malian government forces .

Following the overthrow of Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi , many Tuareg who had been fighting for Gadhafi 's forces reportedly returned to northern Mali , bringing their weapons with them . Last month , a Tuareg uprising triggered a military coup against Mali 's President Amadou Toumani Toure by officers dissatisfied with the government 's efforts to put down the insurrection . But in the disorder following the coup , the rebels seized large areas of the north .

Martin van Vliet , a researcher at the African Studies Center in Leiden , the Netherlands , said that while Timbuktu was no longer a city of vital economic or military importance , it stood out as an important prize for the rebels due to its symbolic significance .

`` The group that controls Timbuktu controls the symbolic capital of the entire region , because it 's that well-known across the world . If you control that city , it will be known . ''

Historically , Timbuktu 's legend began to spread throughout the medieval world when the Emperor of Mali made his pilgrimage to Mecca through Cairo in 1324 , and dazzled those he encountered with the gold his party carried .

Two years later , however , the person to do so met with disaster . Scottish explorer Gordon Laing survived an attack by Tuareg nomads en route to Timbuktu , only to discover on arrival that its wealth had greatly diminished since its heyday . Laing stayed a month in the city , then was murdered two days after leaving .

During its golden age , Timbuktu was a thriving desert trading town at the heart of important trade routes for gold and salt , and a major intellectual and spiritual center , which played a key role in the spread of Islam in Africa . Islamic scholars traveled great distances to study in the city 's university , which had 25,000 students during its zenith , and was comprised of three mosques .

Constructed from mud bricks and wood in the distinctive Sudano-Sahelian architectural style , the Sankore , Sidi Yahia and Djingarei-ber mosques have been maintained and remain major attractions in the city today . The latter , Timbuktu 's oldest , was built in the early 14th century , while the Sankore , during its heyday , was said to have the largest collection of books in Africa since the Library of Alexandria of antiquity .

Comprising the other significant component of Timbuktu 's heritage legacy , this immense trove of scholarly manuscripts -- estimated to number in the hundreds of thousands -- remains in the city in state and private collections .

He said the city 's heritage was vastly important to locals -- as a source of cultural pride , but also of income . Even if the city 's treasures survived unscathed , they stood to lose out from the uprising as it could plunge the region into isolation once again . In addition , an estimated 200,000 people have been displaced by the uprising in the wider region .

`` The fact this part of the country has been taken by the Tuareg rebellion and Islamist groups does not allow any more tourists to visit , and the communities depend a lot on the tourism revenue , '' he said . `` This is really going to affect their lives . ''
