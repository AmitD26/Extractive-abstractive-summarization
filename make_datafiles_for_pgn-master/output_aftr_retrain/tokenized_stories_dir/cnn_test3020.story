-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After crashing in the Tour de Suisse and being overlooked by his team for the Tour de France -- he became the first British winner of the race in 2012 -- Bradley Wiggins hoped relief would come at the Commonwealth Games .

`` It 's given me another focus rather than just lolling about at home feeling miserable , '' he was quoted as saying by The Guardian .

Wiggins indeed won a medal Thursday in the first day of action in Glasgow , but it was n't the one he wanted .

But instead of dwelling on the disappointment , Wiggins was already looking ahead to the Olympics in Rio in 2016 .

`` That 's the reality of it . We 'll look back on this in two years with hopefully gold medals around our necks and say this was the start point for us . That 's what it 's all about .

`` It 's going to be two years of graft now and it 's so different to the road . I ca n't underestimate how much work it 's going to take . ''

Despite England 's runner-up finish , Wiggins enjoyed his time with his teammates .

`` It 's been brilliant , '' he said . `` I said to the boys , ` It 's like being on holiday . ' I got to go back to work Monday morning now .

`` It 's been just a nice break from everything from the road . ''

The Australian quartet of Jack Bobridge , Luke Davison , Alex Edmondson and Glenn O'Shea set a new Games record , clocking in at three minutes , 54.851 seconds to better England by about six seconds .

Murdoch established a Games record time of 2.07.30 .

She was both ecstatic -- and tired .

`` That was just incredible , '' she was quoted as saying by The Scotsman . `` I literally could n't feel my legs for the last 50 so , when I touched the wall , I was hoping and praying that I could go fast . ''

They indeed led the way and not for the first time Alistair Brownlee beat younger sibling Jonny to gold .

Alistair , who also won gold on home soil at London 2012 , finished in 1:48.50 , 11 seconds better than Jonny -- the bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympics .

`` This is the goal I wanted to achieve for the season and I 've done it now , '' Alistair Brownlee told BBC Television . `` Now I 've done everything I 've wanted to do in my career . I do n't know what to do now . Maybe I should retire , '' he joked .

Farah pulls out

He 'll continue to train in France and hopes to return in time for the European Championships that begin August 12 in Zurich .

`` I have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games , '' Farah told the England Athletics website . `` The sickness I had two weeks ago was a big setback for me .

`` Training is getting better here in Font Romeu but I need another few weeks to get back to the level I was at in 2012 & 2013 .
