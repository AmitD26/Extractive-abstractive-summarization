Attorney Mark O'Mara drops George Zimmerman

When asked Monday night by CNN for clarification about the gun , a spokesman for O'Mara 's law firm , Shawn Vincent , said there was no update yet .

The incident stemmed from a visit by Shellie Zimmerman , who filed for divorce last week , and her father , David Bryant Dean . They came to the house the couple used to share to pick up some of her belongings .

George Zimmerman and his wife texted Monday morning , and she told him she was going over to the house , according to a person with whom the family shared the photos of the texts .

George Zimmerman came to the house with a friend of his and got into a heated discussion with Dean , O'Mara said .

What 's at stake in Zimmermans ' divorce

During the altercation , Zimmerman smashed his wife 's iPad .

Shellie Zimmerman called police as George Zimmerman sat in his truck with his friend .

The incident comes two months after Zimmerman , a neighborhood watch volunteer , was found not guilty of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford , Florida .

O'Mara said , `` There was heightened emotion , and a disagreement took place . ''

O'Mara said Shellie Zimmerman no longer lives at the house , which is owned by her father .

After he was initially detained by officers , George Zimmerman was interviewed at the house by detectives , Lake Mary police spokesman Zach Hudson said .

Zimmerman had offered to turn over surveillance tapes from security cameras at the house to investigators .

Police said Dean spoke with first responders but was not treated by paramedics .

Shellie Zimmerman 's divorce filing last week in Seminole County came after she pleaded guilty to perjury on August 28 for lying about the state of the couple 's finances during a bond hearing in April 2012 . She had claimed she and her husband were broke , when in reality they had collected about $ 135,000 in donations .

Since his acquittal on July 13 , George Zimmerman has been in the headlines several times . In late July , he reportedly helped a family escape from an overturned SUV . A report from the Seminole County Sheriff 's Office confirmed his involvement .

Lake Mary is a suburb of Orlando near Sanford .
