UPDATE : On April 30 , NASA revealed `` Technology '' as the winning design for their new Z-2 spacesuit . With almost 150,000 votes -- just over 63 % of the 233,431 total -- `` Technology '' will be incorporated into the final version of the Z-2 spacesuit , and is expected to be ready for testing by November .

I applaud you all for not choosing `` Biomimicry . '' There 's hope for the future . Maybe .

Below is our original column about the design contest , published on March 28 :

The July 21 , 1969 , headline of the New York Times read , `` MEN WALK ON MOON . ''

To be fair , I do n't actually know what happens if an astronaut ventures out into space wearing , say , blue jeans and a Mexican Baja hoodie , but if cartoons have taught me anything -- and God knows they have -- it 's that people tend to explode .

So that 's exactly what would happen . Cartoons do n't lie .

Of course , the Apollo 11 's original A7L spacesuit was a technological achievement for its time . But like all things NASA , it was a constant work in progress , and four missions later when Apollo 15 blasted off for -LRB- I think -RRB- Pittsburgh , astronauts began wearing the A7LB .

Most notably , among some other minor changes , the A7LB provided more waist mobility for sitting in the rovers . But it was also probably just as difficult to change your socks .

`` Yo , Buzz , a little help here . ''

Since the Apollo missions , spacesuits have continued to change and advance , always reaching for the limits of science and imagination . Though , I am holding back a certain amount of praise for NASA until they finally engineer a loose-fitting space Snuggie .

`` It needs a beer holder ! For your beer ! Roll Tide ! ''

The new spacesuits are a direct improvement to the current prototype Z-1 , which had a soft upper torso . The Z-2 is made of state-of-the-art hard composite , perfect for cage fighting on Mars . Which is probably the first thing we 'll do with the Red Planet after we put up a Wal-Mart .

The Z-2 is also the first spacesuit to use 3-D laser scanning and 3-D printing .

So , clearly , there 's a bit of serious technology going on here . Though , with all due respect to NASA , none of this stacks up to the vision and engineering of the Sports Illustrated football phone .

But so are the new Z-2 spacesuits , and when you go online to vote , you 'll have three options .

The first option , `` Biomimicry , '' is inspired by the oceans of Earth and mimics some of the bioluminescent qualities of fish and reptiles . Its signature feature is electroluminescent wire that stretches across the upper torso and becomes visible in low light .

`` Gork , she sort of looks like us . ''

`` Your mom sort of looks like us . ''

`` Shut up , Gork . ''

The second design is called `` Technology '' and uses Luminex wire and light-emitting patches that can help crew members easily identify each other on spacewalks .

It 's actually a cool-looking design , but I 'm pretty sure they could 've just saved a bunch of money by stealing a box of those `` Hello , My Name is _____ '' stickers from a company retreat .

Keeping to its name , the `` Trends in Society '' spacesuit proudly supports legalized marijuana and does n't want to have kids .

Voting ends for the Z-2 project April 15 , and the winning design will be revealed by April 30 . After that , NASA expects to have the suit completed by November and will immediately begin testing with it at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .

`` Shut up , Gork . ''
