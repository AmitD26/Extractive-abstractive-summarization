That 's when my dad dropped me off on the front porch of Sunnyside School in Brownsville , Texas , the border town where I was born and raised . Like any kid on his first day of school , I was engulfed by longing and loneliness , staring forlornly at my dad through the screen door as he walked away .

My introduction to the world as baby Rodolfo Ruiz -- the cocooned son of an immigrant mother and an eponymously named first-generation Hispanic father -- had ended . My journey as an American began .

My teacher , Mrs. Collins , was a tall , grandmotherly figure with neatly coiffed silver hair and wire frame glasses . She ran Sunnyside in a modest house she 'd once called home . Quickly , I felt her casa was mi casa .

I nodded politely , just like my mam√° had taught me .

By the end of the school year I was fluent in English . And by second grade I was promoted to the advanced learners class of the elementary school to which my parents transferred me after Sunnyside .

There , in a predominantly Hispanic grade school run by Catholic nuns , I began to wrestle with what my name meant to me , and how I wanted it pronounced . I did n't mind `` Rudy '' but I did n't like `` Ruiz '' pronounced in English . It just did n't sound right to me .

Call it instinct , or since I was bilingual and my mother rigidly emphasized speaking both languages correctly , perhaps I felt the most respectful and authentic pronunciation of a name should be that of its language of origin .

Balance , or the constant search for it , became a hallmark of my life . Maybe it was because I was reared on the US-Mexico border , a place akin to the fulcrum in a playground see-saw . To the south thrived my living heritage , which I experienced at home and with my family . To the north loomed my future , which I was learning and absorbing at school and in the media .

It took five minutes to commute from my house in the United States to my abuelos ' home in Mexico , where I whiled away countless afternoons playing ball beneath a giant avocado tree in the backyard , devouring homemade corn tortillas hot off the plancha , and listening to the colorful yarns my abuelita spun and the wise dichos -LRB- sayings -RRB- my abuelito religiously repeated .

Meanwhile at school , I gobbled up books and determined to someday head north to Harvard and make my way as a productive American . And all along , as I introduced myself , I started my name in English and switched gears into Spanish for the second half .

Even though I was bilingual , it took practice . You see , different languages employ varying muscles in your mouth and face . Unseen , but not unheard , the tongue curves uniquely in each language , enabling one to enunciate not only different words but diverse vowel sounds , unique consonants , cadences and accents . And the alliteration of `` Rudy Ruiz '' provided a challenge in that the `` r '' in Rudy flows smoothly in English , while the `` r '' in Ruiz rolls like a locomotive thundering over the old railway bridge that spans the Rio Grande in Brownsville , often backing up traffic for miles .

Try quickly repeating `` Rudy Ruiz '' 10 times bilingually . It 's a bicultural tongue twister , a `` trabalenguas '' as they say in Spanish . So I practiced some more . Until I got it right . Four letters in English . Four letters in Spanish . A smooth `` r. '' A rolled `` rrrr . '' Balance .

Pronounced completely in the native tongue , a name could be interpreted as a sign of a person 's unwillingness to embrace American culture and integrate fully into society . On the flip side , translated entirely into English it can give the impression that one is trying to hide his or her heritage , that perhaps the past is a source of shame rather than pride .

The story of the innkeeper stirred my memory . Surely , it 's no surprise that when a child finds challenge in something as simple as their name , he or she will likely also face a complex path in crafting an identity as a multicultural American . But what I take from these experiences is that an extreme approach in either direction is not the most constructive , healthy strategy .

Cultural evolution and acculturation take time and involve compromise and negotiation , in the hearts and minds of individuals as well as within our broader social discourse . The key to attaining the right balance is empathy . The secret to maintaining it is practice .
