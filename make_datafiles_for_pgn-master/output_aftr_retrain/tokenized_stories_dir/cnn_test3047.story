Online delivery services have a checkered history at best . But Uber , the app-oriented car service , is giving it another go .

Being tested only in Manhattan , it 's a lot like a typical courier service . First , users summon up a vehicular courier -LRB- the company 's reportedly adding bike and foot messengers to its fleet -RRB- . Next , the app quotes them a price . And then the courier hauls an item or items from Point A to Point B .

The service does n't allow users to order items , such as lunch , and have them delivered . It 's just for transporting items already in their possession .

Rush is now an option on the existing Uber app in areas where it is available .

During the initial dotcom boom of the late '90s and early 2000s , several online delivery services tried , and failed , to catch on .

Prices for Uber Rush appear to be higher -LRB- $ 20 - $ 25 -RRB- , more in line with what New York City couriers typically charge . Uber 's model is to take 20 % of whatever price their drivers charge .

The company says it will expand Rush to other areas of New York if it succeeds in its initial test phase .
