Who 's been hacked ?

There 's a list of 100 celebrity women -- and one man -- whose photos were supposedly downloaded and stolen by a hacker . It includes A-listers , notably Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence , and D-listers whose names you may not recognize . Many of them only found out they were victims because of media reports naming them , but others -- such as Lawrence -- found out when social networks exploded with buzz about nude photos being distributed online .

Lawrence and two others , actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead and model-actress Kate Upton , almost immediately confirmed the images were of them . Several others -- including singer Ariana Grande , gymnast McKayla Maroney and singer-actress Victoria Justice -- said photos supposed to be of them were fakes .

There may not be one answer for this , but distance from love interests could be a major factor . Actors spend months away from spouses and lovers while making movies . Musicians tour the world for months . Sexting can become a substitute for intimacy when a relationship goes long distance .

Of course , some bathroom mirror selfies may be snapped and kept as a way to measure progress on a diet or to assess the need for a tummy tuck or update with the plastic surgeon .

Other celebs , however , have enjoyed career boosts when supposedly inadvertent leaks of nude photos or videos have gone viral . Ask Kim Kardashian about that . Her career highlight was as Paris Hilton 's personal assistant before the world discovered her sex tape .

Another way nude photos might find their way onto a celebrity 's cell phone is just plain naivetÃ © . Maybe they do n't realize images on their iPhones are automatically backed up by iCloud , or perhaps they thought iCloud was a safe place for their data .

How did the hacking happen ?

Nearly a decade ago , Paris Hilton 's Sidekick cell phone was accessed when a hacker guessed her password was Tinkerbell , the name of her famous teacup chihuahua .

What penalty could the hacker pay ?

Jennifer Lawrence 's representatives said investigators have been contacted and `` will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence . ''

The FBI 's Los Angeles office confirmed Monday that it was investigating the hacking . `` The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusionsÂ and the unlawful release of material involving high-profile individuals , and is addressing the matter , '' the agency 's spokeswoman said .

The same office caught a Florida man who hacked celebrity email accounts in 2011 . Christopher Chaney , whose targets included actresses Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera , was charged with accessing protected computers without authorization , damaging protected computers , wiretapping and aggravated identity theft .

Chaney is serving a 10-year federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2012 .

The hackers arrested in the Paris Hilton case , including a teenager , got jail time , too .
