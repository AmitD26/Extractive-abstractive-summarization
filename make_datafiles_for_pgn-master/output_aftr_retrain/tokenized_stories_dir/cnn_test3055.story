Separately , a group of hackers calling themselves Anonymous Operations said they would attack PayPal , not Amazon.com , about an hour after an attack on Amazon was due to start .

`` We can not attack Amazon , currently . The previous schedule was to do so , but we do n't have enough forces , '' they said on Twitter .

Anonymous Operations released a do-it-yourself hacking tool earlier Thursday so supporters could make their own computers part of the attack .

The Amazon.com attack was supposed to have started at about 11 a.m. ET .

So far , PayPal appears to be operating normally . The site has been attacked , which has slowed it down but has `` not significantly impacted payments , '' PayPayl 's Anuj Nayar told CNN .

Amazon.com has massive server capacity -- much more than that of Mastercard or Visa -- in order to handle the holiday e-commerce rush . Its server infrastructure ensures that a massive traffic spike ca n't take site down , whether it comes from a hacker-led attack or genuine shoppers .

Amazon used to host WikiLeaks ' website in the United States , but shut it down last week , saying it had violated their terms of service by publishing material it did not own and which could cause harm .

PayPal stopped handling donations to WikiLeaks last week .

The United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights said Thursday that pressure on websites to cut off WikiLeaks could violate the site 's right to freedom of expression .

`` I 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , to close down credit lines for donations to WikiLeaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mirror sites , '' Navi Pillay said in Geneva , Switzerland

`` They could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , '' she said at a press conference . `` If WikiLeaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts , then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties . ''

Anonymous Operations members told CNN Thursday their goal was `` freedom of information . Any and all information . ''

They were originally focused on piracy , but shifted their attention to WikiLeaks because it was `` obvious we had to help . ''

`` While their methods may be controversial , they do demand transparency , which is something we definitely support , '' they said , adding that once they feel they have made their point about WikiLeaks , they will go back to fighting for `` unlimited freedom of expression . ''

The hackers have been attacking sites with a relatively simple tool called a low orbit ion cannon -LRB- LOIC -RRB- .

Users who put it on their computer are allowing Anonymous Operations to use the machine to launch attacks on a chosen target , computer security expert Mikko Hypponen told CNN .

One person who put the hacking tool on his computer told CNN it was the arrest of Assange that `` sparked this global movement .

`` If he was not arrested , I doubt that the movement would have grown to its current unstoppable size , '' said the computer user , who refused to give his name but said he was not a hacker .

The website of the lawyer representing the women who accuse Assange of sex attacks in Sweden went down on Thursday , said the office of the lawyer , Claes Borgstrom .

The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported that government 's website also went down for a few hours , but the government refused to comment , saying it did not discuss security matters .

And a website has been set up in the name of Swedish Justice Minister Beatrice Ask -- but it automatically redirects users to WikiLeaks .
