In response to an incendiary e-mail that drew criticism from online sites and on-campus organizations alike , a Georgia Tech student and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity member has stepped forward and issued an apology in the school 's newspaper .

`` In retrospect , it was a nickname I should not have embraced but continuing to use the term was my fault . As a leader I should have put a stop to it in any reference , '' he wrote .

`` I know I can not fix all the damage I have done , but I will strive to become a better man as I work through this episode in my life , '' Matthew said .

Matthew ended his e-mail by saying , `` I will conduct myself to more honorably reflect the ideals of Georgia Tech in the future . ''

Many campus organizations outside of the fraternity have condemned the note , and some students have commented on Technique 's Facebook page , saying they have `` no sympathy '' for the writer .
