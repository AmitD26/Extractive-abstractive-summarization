That 's the experiment being tested by several hotels in the French capital during the height of the summer season .

He tells CNN he struck on the idea after successfully running an honesty bar that left it up to guests to declare their booze consumption at check-out . In the City of Light , it seems hotel guests are not generally light fingered .

`` We put guests at the heart of the system and we transform them into a mystery customer . They will look at the hotel with a new eye and if they play true in this game , it can work . ''

If guests decide their stay is barely worth a dollar -- or euro , this being Paris -- then it could it could also wind up being an embarrassing financial disaster .

Duval does n't think so .

`` We could have run a promotion offering free rooms to the first 15 people to answer a question on our Website , but we 've decided to do this instead . ''

Duval says the scheme has attracted interest from other hotels in Paris and elsewhere in France , with several in Cannes and Nice planning similar deals for the winter low season .

The pay-what-you-want scheme follows recent comments by France 's foreign minister , Laurent Fabius , that the country needs to be friendlier and more accommodating to visitors if it want to protect an annual tourism income of $ 16 billion .

Duval said his scheme was n't a response to this and complained that the government should be doing more to help hoteliers during tough economic times .

It 's unlikely , however , that Fabius will let them set their own tax rates .
