-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A month after a devastating earthquake sent a wall of water across the Japanese landscape , the global terrain of the atomic power industry has been forever altered .

The ongoing drama at the power plant in Fukushima -- a name now ranked alongside Three Mile Island and Chernobyl as history 's worst nuclear accidents -- has erased the momentum the nuclear industry has seen in recent years .

The growth in the emerging world , such as China and India , fueled increased demand in planned reactors . Oil-rich regions like the United Arab Emirates and smaller nations like Vietnam announced plans to build nuclear reactors in the past year . Once the bane of environmentalists , the nuclear industry enjoyed newfound `` green '' credentials as a cleaner alternative to coal-fired plants that belch greenhouse gases to produce electricity .

Before Fukushima , a `` nuclear renaissance '' -- as it was termed in the press -- seemed well underway , except for this point : Nuclear power , as a total of world energy supply , has been in steady decline for the past decade .

The shockwaves from the Fukushima plant disaster shook German politics , which could have economic implications far beyond the nuclear industry as Germany -- the largest economy in Europe -- attempts to steer the eurozone out of its debt crisis . Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats suffered a historic loss to the Green Party during a key state election in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg , a traditional stronghold for Merkel 's party .

China , by far , has the largest number of plants planned with 27 reactors currently under construction , followed by 11 in Russia , and five apiece in India and South Korea , according to the International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- . Beijing announced that China would temporarily suspend construction of new plants pending review of the Fukushima incident , but few analysts believe China will scuttle planned reactors .

`` The countries that are going to do big builds ... have said loudly and clearly , we are not backing down from nuclear energy , '' said Margaret Harding of the American Nuclear Society , a group for nuclear industry professionals .

Fear factor

`` Radiation in particular is a scary thing -- we ca n't see , we ca n't touch it , you ca n't look at the ground and know its there , '' said Harding , a former vice president of engineering at GE Nuclear Energy who now advises companies on nuclear industry issues .

'' -LRB- Nuclear power -RRB- gets conflated in people 's minds with weapons , '' Harding said . `` The fact that the first controlled nuclear plants were to run submarines and other military secrets , there is a web of secrecy as to what you can talk about , which adds to the mystique . ''

There were no deaths at the 1979 Three Mile Island crisis in the U.S. . A 2005 report from the World Health Organization said as many as 4,000 people may die of radiation exposure from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Russia , although fewer than 50 deaths were directly attributed to the disaster .

`` The numbers do n't lie , coal kills millions every year '' through air pollution , said Michael Shellenberger , head of the Breakthrough Institute , a think tank that aims to modernize liberal thought , at Fortune 's Brainstorm Green conference last week in California .

Green nukes

When Harding moved to California in 1981 , the young nuclear engineer attended a meeting of the Sierra Club , the environmental group . `` When they found out what I did , they kicked me out , '' Harding recalled .

In the past decade , however , many environmentalists have embraced nuclear power as a better alternative than coal and gas-fired plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . France , for example , gets 75 % of its power from nuclear plants -- the highest ratio in the world , according to the IAEA . By comparison , the U.S. gets just under 20 % of its power from nuclear , although it has the most reactors in operation -- 104 reactors , nearly double the number in France .

`` France 's advance in terms of nuclear and hydraulic energy generation -LRB- allows -RRB- the country to maintain its emissions at the same level as they were in 1990 , '' said Sabine Mezard , a spokesperson for French energy giant EDF .

Still , the early promise of nuclear energy as a cheap , clean form of energy has never materialized . Costs of nuclear power plants can be as high as $ 10 billion , according to a 2010 report by the CIGI Nuclear Energy Futures Project at Carleton University in Canada . The average construction time is seven years , but with licensing approval new builds often take a decade , Schneider said .

`` These plants are 30-year investments -- it 's hard to get the market interested in more than two-year investments , and loan guarantees are not a subsidy , '' countered Harding of the American Nuclear Society . Government backing of insurance in case of disasters has resulted because `` the nuclear industry has had so few accidents , there is no actuarial for insurance companies on which to offer an insurance policy , '' she added .

Still , no one expects the industry to fade . The U.S. , Japan , South Korea , Russia and France have significant nuclear industries with important strategic as well as economic interests , analysts say .
