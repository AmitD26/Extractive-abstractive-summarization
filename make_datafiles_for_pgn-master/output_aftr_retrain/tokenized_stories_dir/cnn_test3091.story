Nearly two years after tech blogs screamed `` Antennagate ! '' over problems with the iPhone 4 's reception , owners will be getting a little pocket change for their troubles .

Released in June 2010 , the slimmer reworking of Apple 's smartphone became a huge seller . But soon after it went on sale , some owners began complaining that their phone frequently dropped voice calls .

The culprit , it was ultimately determined , was the antenna , which is wrapped in a band around the phone 's edge to help create its slim form . Using what became known as the `` death grip , '' -LRB- i.e. holding the phone at a certain spot -RRB- caused reception to suffer or cut out entirely .

However , Ira Rothken , a lead attorney in the case , said more than 21 million iPhone 4 owners were eligible for the payout .

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

Multiple lawsuits had been merged into one in the case . Plaintiffs claimed that Apple had been misleading in its communication with customers about the problem .

Rothken first noted `` preliminary approval '' of the settlement late Friday on Twitter .
