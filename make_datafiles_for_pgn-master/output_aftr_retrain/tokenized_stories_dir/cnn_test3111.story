Nigeria defended its response to the kidnapping of hundreds of schoolgirls by the terror group Boko Haram , even as details emerged Tuesday about a second mass abduction , adding to a growing global outrage over the fate of the children .

President Goodluck Jonathan has been under fire over accusations the government initially ignored and then later downplayed the abduction of the girls , who have become the focal point of a social media campaign demanding their safe return .

`` We 've done a lot -- but we are not talking about it . We 're not Americans . We 're not showing people , you know , but it does not mean that we are not doing something . ''

In detailing the government 's response , two special battalions have been devoted to the search for the missing girls , Okupe said . That includes 250 locations that have been searched by helicopters and airplanes .

But the father of two of the schoolgirls taken by Boko Haram told CNN there has been no sign of the military in the days and weeks following the abduction .

U.S. offer of military help

In a sign that Nigeria may be bowing to international pressure and outrage , the government announced the creation of an information center dedicated to answering questions and providing daily updates about rescue efforts , Okupe said .

`` So what we 've done is -- we have offered , and it 's been accepted -- help from our military and our law enforcement officials , '' U.S. President Barack Obama told NBC News on Tuesday . `` We 're going to do everything we can to provide assistance to them . ''

That help includes the creation of a `` coordination cell '' to provide intelligence , investigations and hostage negotiation expertise , U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said . The cell will include U.S. military personnel , she said .

But even as the help was offered to Jonathan , new details were emerging about the abduction of at least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15 , who were snatched Sunday night from the village of Warabe .

The village is located in the rural northeast , near the border of Cameroon , an area considered a stronghold for Boko Haram , a group that U.S. officials say has received training from al Qaeda affiliates .

Boko Haram translates to `` Western education is sin '' in the local Hausa language , and the group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south .

In recent years , the group has stepped up its attacks , bombing schools , churches and mosques .

But it is the abductions of girls that has spawned the biggest outrage , with a #BringBackOurGirls campaign that initially began on Twitter and then quickly spread with demonstrators taking to the streets over the weekend in major cities around the world to demand action .

6 reasons why the world should demand action

On Tuesday , the United Nations human rights chief blasted Boko Haram , saying the group 's claim of slavery and sexual slavery of girls are `` crimes against humanity . ''

` I abducted your girls '

A man claiming to be Shekau appeared in a video announcing he would sell his victims . The video was first obtained Monday by Agence-France Presse .

In the nearly hourlong , rambling video , Shekau repeatedly called for an end to Western education .

`` Girls , you should go and get married , '' he said .

Pillay , along with three other African United Nations women leaders , sent a letter reminding the Nigerian government of its `` legal responsibility to ensure that girls and boys have the fundamental right to education and to be protected from violence , persecution and intimidation , '' according to her statement .

In the United States , all 20 women serving in the Senate signed a bipartisan letter calling on Obama to take action .

`` More can be done by this administration . I would like to see special forces deployed to help rescue these young girls . Some of these girls are as young as nine years old , '' Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told CNN . '' ... They 're being sold into slavery , forced into marriages , required to convert . This is just horrible . ''

The petition calls on Jonathan and the government `` to ensure all schools are safe places to learn , protected from attack . ''

Nigerian Minister of Information Labaran Maku told CNN that despite international reaction and media reports , there have been some successes in combating Boko Haram .

He also declined to agree that misinformation released by the military in the aftermath of the April kidnapping added to the growing outrage .

`` When they made that statement , it was based on a report they received , '' the minister said .

Nigeria 's finance minister said Monday that her country 's government remains committed to finding the girls but should have done a better job explaining the situation to the public .
