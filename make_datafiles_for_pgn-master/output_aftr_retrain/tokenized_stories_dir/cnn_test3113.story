-LRB- CNN -RRB- Hundreds of potential jurors were introduced to accused killer Aaron Hernandez during the first phase of jury selection on Friday .

Hernandez , former New England Patriot tight end , is indicted in the June 17 , 2013 , death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd , who was shot seven times , prosecutors say , in an industrial park around 3:30 in the morning .

Hernandez , Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have pleaded not guilty to the slaying .

Wallace and Ortiz will be tried separately .

With his defense team at his side , a clerk read the three charges to the jury pool . They are murder , unlawful possession of a .45 caliber gun and unlawful possession of .22 ammunition .

Outside court , defense attorneys declined to answer questions as they carted in supplies , including bottled water , paper towels and a mini-refrigerator .

Acting District Attorney Thomas Quinn made a prepared statement to reporters .

`` We look forward to a jury being selected that is fair and impartial to both sides . The court has gone to great lengths to ensure that this takes place , '' Quinn said . `` We look forward to the start of the trial . ''

It 's unclear how long it will take to seat a jury .

Individual questioning of potential jurors is not expected to begin until January 16 .

Prosecutors are also seeking immunity for Hernandez 's fianc√©e and mother of his child , Shayanna Jenkins . The immunity request remains under seal .

Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to a grand jury .

The day after opening statements , jurors will be taken by bus to see the inside of Hernandez 's home , at the request of the defense . The panel will also be shown the killing scene , about a mile from the home , and cellphone towers that allegedly captured a ping from Hernandez 's phone in an industrial park the night of Odin Lloyd 's death in that location .
