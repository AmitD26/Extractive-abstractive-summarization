Israeli forces dropped leaflets in northern Gaza on Sunday to warn residents to move away from Hamas sites to avoid military strikes .

The warning came as the death toll in Gaza reached 172 , with more than 1,250 people injured , the Gaza Health Ministry said early Monday .

Israel said its forces have struck 1,320 `` terror targets '' across Gaza , including 735 concealed rocket launchers . Seventy percent of Israel 's population lies within range of Hamas rocket attacks , the Israel Defense Forces said .

One airstrike targeted the house of the head of the Gaza police , Tayseer al-Batsh , and killed at least 18 people and injured 50 , Palestinian security and medical sources told CNN on Sunday . The attack happened late Saturday .

Israel has used its Iron Dome defense system against many of the more than 800 rockets fired from Gaza into Israel , the military said . Two more were intercepted Sunday over the Tel Aviv metropolitan area .

One rocket that hit the city of Ashkelon on Sunday severely wounded an Israeli teen , the Israel Defense Forces said .

`` All sides ... must respect the sanctity of civilian life , '' Gunness said on Twitter .

Pierre Krahenbuhl , head of UNRWA , planned to visit Gaza on Sunday , but the Israeli military did not authorize the mission for security reasons , Gunness said .

`` Hope for peaceful resolution seems to be even further away , '' he said Sunday in a written statement , according to a CNN translation . `` Nevertheless , in this crisis we must establish dialogue with the political decision makers . That is why , above all , it is about ongoing talks in Amman , Jerusalem and Ramallah . ''

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a senior State Department official said . Kerry `` condemned the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel , and stressed Israel 's right to defend itself , '' the official said . Kerry also discussed U.S. concerns about escalating tensions and reiterated the U.S. is prepared to help facilitate a ceasefire , the official said .

Battle over ` human shields '

Video on Hamas-run television showed a Hamas spokesman urging people to serve as human shields , CNN 's Jake Tapper reported Thursday .

Palestinian sources have also described some deaths in the conflict as being people who formed a `` human shield . ''

The Palestine Liberation Organization , meanwhile , announced that it will ask the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination , at its annual meeting in August , to designate Israel as an `` apartheid state . '' And Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will ask the United Nations `` to officially put the State of Palestine under the UN international protection system , '' the PLO said .

Israel raids missile site

Israeli forces briefly entered Gaza early Sunday and raided a missile launching site , an Israeli military source said . It marked the first time Israeli forces have acknowledged they 've entered Gaza in the current conflict .

Four Israeli soldiers suffered light injuries , but all the troops returned home safely , the source said .

`` We can expect these type of activities taking place , '' IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said . `` Special ops that happen usually below the radar , in and out , swift missions , quickly , concise and very precise at what they 're doing , to get that added value to safeguard Israeli lives . ''

Israel : ` What would you do ? '

`` Sirens heard across -LRB- Israel -RRB- . Gaza terrorists are firing barrages of rockets . Israel is under attack , '' the IDF posted , with a photo asking `` What would you do ? ''

Another tweet Sunday showed large trucks . `` As rockets fall on Israel , we keep our crossing to Gaza open . 59 truckloads of goods are about to reach Palestinians , '' the post said .

In leaflets dropped Sunday , the IDF warned residents that it intends `` to attack terrorists and terror infrastructures . '' The leaflets list areas that will be targeted . `` Israel is currently attacking , and will continue to attack , every area from which rockets are being launched at its territory . ''

The Israeli military said it also drops empty shells on roofs , an operation it calls `` roof knocking , '' to alert civilians that airstrikes are imminent .

Hostilities between the two sides escalated this month after the killing of three Israeli teenagers and a Palestinian teen . Neither Hamas nor Israel appears to be backing down .

More than 10,000 Palestinians are displaced and hundreds of thousands have been affected by damage to water infrastructure , said UNWRA , the refugee agency .
