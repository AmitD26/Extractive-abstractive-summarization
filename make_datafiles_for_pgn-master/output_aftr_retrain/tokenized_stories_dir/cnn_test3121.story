`` This was a mistake of unbelievable and unimaginable proportions , '' attorney Julia Yoo said on Tuesday .

Daniel Chong , 25 , drank his own urine to survive and even wrote a farewell note to his mother before authorities discovered him severely dehydrated after a 2012 drug raid in San Diego .

He kicked the door and yelled , anything to get someone 's attention , the station reported .

`` I was screaming . I was completely insane , '' he told KWSB .

Chong was detained on the morning of April 21 , 2012 , when DEA agents raided a house they suspected was being used to distribute MDMA , commonly known as `` ecstasy . ''

A multiagency narcotics task force , including state agents , detained nine people and seized about 18,000 ecstasy pills , marijuana , prescription medications , hallucinogenic mushrooms , several guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition from the house , according to the DEA .

While detained , Chong had given up and accepted death , using a shard of glass from his glasses to carve `` Sorry Mom '' onto his arm as a farewell message , Yoo said . Chong lost 15 pounds and suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder , she said .

`` He 's the strongest person I have ever met , '' Yoo said . `` As a result of his case , it 's one of the primary reasons the DEA placed a nationwide policy that calls on each agent at satellite offices to check on the well-being of prisoners in their cells on a daily basis , '' Yoo said .

`` I am deeply troubled by the incident that occurred here , '' said DEA San Diego Special Agent in Charge William R. Sherman shortly after the incident . `` I extend my deepest apologies to the young man and want to express that this event is not indicative of the high standards that I hold my employees to . ''

Since the incident , Chong has returned to complete his undergraduate degree at UC San Diego , Yoo said . `` He changed his major from engineering to economics and wants to finish school , pursue his career and help take care of his mother . ''
