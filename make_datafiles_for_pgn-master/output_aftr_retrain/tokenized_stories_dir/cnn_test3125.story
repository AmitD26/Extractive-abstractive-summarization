`` Everyone has two lives . A second one begins when you realize you only have one , '' one letter said in part . `` Hug each other every day . Please know I am OK . Live your lives to the fullest and pray to be happy . ''

The 31-year-old freelance journalist disappeared during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2013 and was later determined to have been abducted .

On Tuesday , ISIS posted a video online showing one of its members beheading Sotloff . The grisly killing provoked international outrage at the Islamic terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State . The group seeks to establish an Islamic state , a caliphate , in parts of Syria and Iraq .

It is not clear how Sotloff 's letters , read by his relatives , made it into his family 's hands .

`` I will try to speak from my heart but my heart is broken , '' the father said . `` I lost my son and my best friend .

`` He is done suffering . ''

Sotloff 's mother , Shirley , said she was proud her son got to live his dream .

His sister , Lauren , expressed her loss .

`` Dear Steven , I love you very much . ... You were my best friend , '' she said . `` You introduced me to the ` X-Files ' and ` Freaks and Geeks . ' ''

Rubio said the slain war correspondent `` chose not to just be a journalist but one to report where horrible things happen . ''

`` It was to bring to us stories about the people who were suffering unbelievable acts , '' Rubio said . `` Evil is still here . It has a different name but it 's still here , and he unmasked it . ''
