-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- News that the United States is considering a military strike on Syria in response to the Bashar al-Assad regime 's suspected use of chemical weapons suggests we could soon see an American bombing campaign on the war-torn country .

Bergen : For U.S. , Syria is truly a problem from hell

A brief bombing campaign in Syria might make the United States and its allies feel like they are doing something , but it will prove nothing .

Syria is not the greatest threat in the Middle East to U.S. or world security . The Iranian regime is working every day to get a nuclear weapon . It poses a direct threat to Israel 's survival and a long-term threat to America .

The conflicts in Syria , Egypt and Libya are small threats compared with the disaster that could ensue and the lives that would be endangered if Iran succeeds in its drive for nuclear weapons .

We should focus more on the truly big threat ahead of the headlines of the day -- or we will be reading much worse headlines in the future .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Newt Gingrich .
