Michael and Jamira Dixon believe they were turned in for texting by shooting suspect Curtis Reeves two weeks ago at the same Florida movie theater complex where Chad Oulson was shot to death Monday .

Reeves is charged with second-degree murder after an argument about texting ended with the 71-year-old former police officer shooting Oulson in the chest , prosecutors said .

The Dixons said Wednesday night that in late December during a matinee showing of `` The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug '' a man they identified as Reeves was in the same theater with them and was `` bothered by everything . ''

The man she identified as Reeves was sitting in the same row and talked with the usher afterward and gesticulated at her and her group , she said . She said she was there with her husband , three of her children and a niece .

The Dixons spent part of Tuesday night giving their version of the events of the December 28 movie to authorities , they said . They were interviewed separately , each for an hour , they said . CNN was unable to confirm Wednesday night that those interviews took place .

In recounting the experience to reporters outside their home in Wesley Chapel , the Dixons said the man never used foul language toward them ; he just angrily kept his eye on them from the end of the row .

`` As the -LRB- day -RRB- went on he just glared and glared and was grumbling the whole -LRB- time -RRB- , '' Jamira Dixon said .

She said she heard about Monday 's shooting through a Facebook post she noticed while driving that afternoon . Because the incident also involved someone texting at the same theater , she asked a friend to see if there was a picture of the suspect and send it .

She showed the picture to her husband , who agreed it was the same man .

`` I was , like , that is the same guy , '' Michael Dixon said . `` It could have happened to us . We were in the same exact position . ''

In the aftermath , heroes responded

The shooting happened early Monday afternoon at the Grove 16 theater , just before an afternoon showing of `` Lone Survivor , '' a film about a Navy SEAL mission .

The two men began to argue and Reeves walked out of the auditorium . Police said Reeves was going to complain to a theater employee .

But Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told CNN Tuesday night that the manager was busy with another customer and Reeves never addressed his complaint with a supervisor .

When Reeves returned , witnesses and authorities said that Oulson asked him if he had gone to tell on him for texting .

Police said Tuesday that Oulson was texting his young daughter 's babysitter .

Voices were raised . Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves , police said . Then , the former police officer took out a .380 semi-automatic handgun and shot Oulson , police said .

Theater reopens

The Grove complex , including the theater where the shooting took place , reopened Wednesday .

A theater employee told WTSP that the staff had actually gone through a training session the day of the shooting to help prepare them for an emergency , a precaution inspired by the theater massacre in Aurora , Colorado , that occurred in the summer of 2012 .

Reeves made his first court appearance Tuesday on a charge of second-degree murder .

Authorities said a preliminary investigation determined that there was no physical contact during the incident . It was popcorn , thrown by Oulson , that struck Reeves .

Tepper said there was no evidence to support the claim that the shooter was a victim . She denied him bond .

Outside Reeves ' home Wednesday were newly hung `` No trespassing '' signs .

Who was the texting father ?

Wednesday morning , a woman who said she was Oulson 's sister answered the door at his home in the Tampa suburb of Land O ' Lakes .

She declined to give her name but told a CNN reporter and producer that the family was n't going to make a public statement for a while , and that they were struggling with their grief and arranging a funeral for Oulson .

Though the garage door was shut , a day earlier the Tampa Tribune reported that a reporter saw a motocross motorcycle was on a stand next to a gold pickup truck and a child 's wagon .

Theater security

Theater violence is nothing new . Less than two years ago , an Aurora , Colorado , cineplex was the scene of a shooting massacre that left 12 people dead .

Theater chains had already moved to ban handguns . Cobb Theatres , which owns the Grove 16 and more than 120 other theaters , says posters displaying its zero weapons policy are posted on its front doors . Other chains have also stepped up safety measures .

Still , is that enough ?

`` The question is going to become : how are they enforcing them ? Is a sign sufficient to give notice that you shall not bring a handgun on our premises ? '' CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos asked .

There are theater chains that take it a step further , employing security guards at some locations to keep patrons safe .
