Tommy Vietor , a spokesman for rival Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign , said the Bosnia claim was part of `` a growing list of instances in which Sen. Clinton has exaggerated her role in foreign and domestic policymaking . ''

`` I say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement , '' she said .

In a radio interview that aired Tuesday , Clinton said she was n't worried about the incident hurting her credibility .

`` I have been in the public eye for many , many years , and this is something that I think happens to anybody , '' she told radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .

In a foreign policy speech last week at George Washington University , Clinton used the description of a dangerous arrival to bolster her argument that she has the foreign policy experience needed to be commander in chief .

But news video footage of her arrival at Tuzla shows Clinton , then the first lady , calmly walking from the rear ramp of a U.S. Air Force plane with her daughter , Chelsea , then 16 , at her side . Both Clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed .

Clinton 's campaign has made foreign policy experience a centerpiece of her effort to come back against Obama , whom she is trailing in delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination . Watch a report on the Bosnia story and other political news ''

`` Now let me tell you what I can remember , OK -- because what I was told was that we had to land a certain way and move quickly because of the threat of sniper fire . So I misspoke -- I did n't say that in my book or other times but if I said something that made it seem as though there was actual fire -- that 's not what I was told , '' she told the newspaper .

`` I was told we had to land a certain way , we had to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire . I was also told that the greeting ceremony had been moved away from the tarmac but that there was this 8-year-old girl and , I ca n't , I ca n't rush by her , I 've got to at least greet her -- so I greeted her , I took her stuff and then I left . Now that 's my memory of it . ''

Meanwhile , as Clinton backpedaled from the description of her Bosnia trip , the senator from New York was keeping her focus on the economy with a town hall-style meeting Tuesday in Greensburg , Pennsylvania .

`` I know there are some in Washington , and some in the media , who want this race to be over , '' she said to a loud chorus of boos .

`` There are some who think we do n't need to hear the voices of people in Pennsylvania or Indiana or North Carolina or Montana or any of the other states that have n't had their chance to vote . Well , I disagree . ''

Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , focused on the economy and the housing situation Tuesday , participating in a roundtable discussion in Santa Ana , California .

He resumes campaigning Wednesday , with stops scheduled in North Carolina .

He said he planned to spend a lot of time talking about the economy when he returns . E-mail to a friend
