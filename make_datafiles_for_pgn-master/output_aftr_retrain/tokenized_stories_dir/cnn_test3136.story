-LRB- CNN -RRB- For decades , U.S. climate change policy amounted to a hypocrisy associated with bad parenting : `` Do as I say , not as I do . ''

That began to change Monday when President Barack Obama 's administration announced its boldest step yet to reduce the nation 's biggest source of pollution blamed for global warming -- carbon emission from power plants .

A proposed new Environmental Protection Agency rule would reduce such emissions 30 % by 2030 , compared to the levels in 2005 .

The move announced by EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was intended to show the world that the United States would walk the climate change talk , and establish Obama 's environmental legacy as he enters the final third of his presidency .

`` For the sake of our families ' health and our kids ' future , we have a moral obligation to act on climate , '' McCarthy said . `` When we do , we 'll turn risks on climate into business opportunity . We 'll spur innovation and investment , and we 'll build a world-leading clean energy economy . ''

`` This beautiful blue ball in space ''

`` This is something that is important for all of us , '' he said , urging support for efforts to work together to help protect `` this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space there we 're a part of . ''

Nonsense , Obama shot back , noting how similar warnings always greeted major environmental progress in the past , but eventually proved untrue .

A multimillion-dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change , but polls show most Americans believe the planet is warming .

Almost a third of America 's carbon emissions comes from electricity generation , and the proposed EPA rules announced Monday would give states a variety of options to meet the goal of an overall 30 % reduction in such pollution by 2030 .

Some of the ideas already being used include improving energy efficiency at plants , changing how long they operate each day and increasing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar production .

EPA officials concede some of the dirtiest power plants now operating , such as older coal-fired plants , will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives .

By 2030 , just over 30 % of U.S. electricity will come from coal and about the same amount from natural gas , with wind , solar and other alternative sources providing about 9 % , according to the EPA officials who spoke to reporters on Monday on the condition of not being identified .

According to the EPA , the proposed new rules would reduce carbon pollution by the same amount as removing two-thirds of all cars and trucks form American roads .

It put the cost as high as $ 8.8 billion a year , but noted health gains such as fewer premature deaths and respiratory diseases along with other benefits would be worth tens of billions of dollars to the U.S. economy .

While critics contend the EPA rules will mean higher electricity costs , Obama and members of his administration argued the transformation to a more energy efficient power sector would bring lower electricity bills in the future .

For Obama , another key motivation is to give the United States standing to pressure emerging economies in China , India and other countries to also adopt cleaner energy policies .

Until now , U.S. calls for all players to participate in global climate change agreement went unheeded because developing countries argued America and other industrialized powers got rich while polluting , and now they should have the same chance to develop .

At home , enemies of climate change legislation complained any U.S. steps would be meaningless , putting America at a disadvantage for policies that would do little on their own to reduce overall global emissions .

The EPA will hold a public comment period and then revise the proposal over the next year . Under the proposed rule , states would have until June 30 , 2016 , to submit plans for achieving the reduced emissions target .

`` This is something we put off ''

Opponents were equally effusive in their condemnation .

Obama 's move could affect competitive Senate races in coal industry states such as Kentucky , North Carolina and Colorado at a time when Democrats are trying to keep control of the upper chamber .

`` By imposing these draconian new rules on the nation 's coal industry , President Obama and every other liberal lawmaker in Washington who quietly supports them is also picking regional favorites , helping their political supporters in states like California and New York while inflicting acute pain on states like Kentucky , '' said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , who is facing a re-election battle in November in the Bluegrass State . `` The impact on individuals and families and entire regions of the country will be catastrophic , as a proud domestic industry is decimated â € '' and many of its jobs shipped overseas . ''

Democratic Sen. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire , who also has a tough re-election challenge from former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown , took her own regional approach to the matter , saying the EPA rule was needed to balance regulation of power plants .

`` For too long , the Midwest has been allowed to lag behind New Hampshire and other New England states in addressing carbon pollution , '' she said , referring to acid rain regulations that affected her region . `` The draft EPA rules will get Midwest power plants to do what power plants in New England have already done and will decrease the air pollution that moves from the Midwest to our states .
