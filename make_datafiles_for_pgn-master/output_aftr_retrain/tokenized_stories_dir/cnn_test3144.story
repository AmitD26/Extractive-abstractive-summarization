-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Effective Saturday night , Yemeni Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi took over Ali Abdullah Saleh 's responsibilities as president , Yemeni government spokesman Abdu Ganadi told CNN .

Some Yemeni officials continue to insist that Saleh , who for months has resisted calls to step down , is still in Yemen . Yaser Yamani , Sanaa 's deputy mayor , told Yemeni state TV Saturday night that `` Saleh is still being treated in the military hospital in Sanaa . ''

A senior Yemeni government official had told CNN that Saleh was fine after sustaining a slight head injury in Friday 's attack , and he gave a nationally broadcast speech later that night . But Saleh 's medical condition is worse than originally thought , according to the Saudi source .

In response to that attack , Yemeni security forces on Friday pounded the home of Sadeq al-Ahmar , the tribal leader whose supporters are suspected of being behind the presidential palace offensive . The flurry of shelling left 10 people dead and 35 others wounded , according to Fawzi Al-Jaradi , an official with Hamil al-Ahmar , a Hashed tribal confederation led by Sadeq al-Ahmar .

Key members of all pertinent parties agreed to the deal , with the signatories including Brig. Gen. Ali Mohsen al Ahmar , who defected to the opposition ; Sadeq al-Ahmar , the Hashed and Hamil al-Ahmar leader ; and Saleh 's sons , representing the government . The Saudi source said that King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud have been heavily involved in setting up the framework for the cease-fire .

Meanwhile , the popular unrest in the impoverished Arab nation continued Saturday .

Tens of thousands of demonstrators congregated Saturday in Sanaa 's Change Square .

Meanwhile , in the flashpoint town of Taiz , protesters retook an iconic square in the city 's center Saturday after government forces cleared it out last week . Eyewitnesses said security forces tried to disperse crowds of anti-government demonstrators by shooting at them and that at least two were injured .

Yemen 's tough crackdown against peaceful protesters in Taiz prompted a new denunciation by Human Rights Watch , an international organization that monitors human rights violations .

`` First the security forces kill and wound protesters , then they keep medical workers from treating the wounded and raze the protesters ' camps to wipe out all traces of them , '' said Joe Stork , deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .

A Yemeni official who asked not to be named told CNN that Saleh was in the mosque when two `` projectiles '' were fired during Friday prayers . He confirmed the death of Sheikh Ali Mohsen al-Matari and four bodyguards . State-run news agency SABA , citing a source in Saleh 's office , said three guards and the sheikh were killed .

In a televised speech Friday night , the president said the attack occurred as talks were taking place between himself and affiliates of Sadeq al-Ahmar , the Hashed tribal leader whose break with Saleh has been followed by spiraling violence .

`` I salute the armed forces everywhere and the courageous security forces who are keen on combating the attacks by a criminal gang that is acting outside of the law and is not affiliated with the youth 's revolution present in Change Square , '' Saleh said .

Mohammed Qahtan , the spokesman for the Joint Meeting Parties , Yemen 's largest opposition coalition , said `` the attack on the palace was preplanned by President Saleh to make people forget about the attacks that he has committed over the last two weeks . ''

Qahtan said Saleh 's forces have `` bombarded most of the al-Ahmar family properties after the palace attack '' and have killed hundreds over the past two weeks .

While Saleh has been unpopular among many inside his country , he has been a longtime ally of the United States in the war against terror .

The United States has counted on his government to be a bulwark against militants , including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , but it believes he should transfer power in order to maintain stability in the country .

White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said on Friday that John Brennan , the president 's homeland security adviser , traveled to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for meetings with government officials to `` discuss options to address the deteriorating situation '' in Yemen .
