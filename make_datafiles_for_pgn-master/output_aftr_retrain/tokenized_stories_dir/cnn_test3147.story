To address these questions -- and many more ! -- we spoke with Walking Dead comic writer and Walking Dead TV show executive producer Robert Kirkman .

Robert Kirkman : We say `` a few months . '' Some people think a few is two , some people think a few is three . It 's a vague answer .

EW : What 's up with Rick and the gardening ?

EW : What would you say is this season 's theme ?

EW : Maybe this a foolish thing to say based on having just seen the premiere . But this was the first ever Walking Dead show I could n't at least roughly place in the chronology of the comic . Have you made a decisive break with that mythology ?

EW : I 'm not a doctor -- I just play one on TV -- but I 'm assuming there 's some sort of nasty , swine flu-type virus abroad in the prison .

EW : And that kid Patrick coughed all over the water supply !

Kirkman : Well , that shower water supply is fairly contained . That 's like a bag that they fill up . I do n't know how this works , I 'm getting a little too technical here . All the water is contaminated ! It 's very dangerous ! Be careful !

Kirkman : Yes , that is who she is after . The story there is that , after the events of season 3 and the death of Andrea , Michonnne and Daryl spent some time out in the wilderness looking for the Governor and eventually Daryl decided , `` Look , this is a futile effort and we 're not going to find this person . '' And Michonne kept it up .

EW : She 's heading to Macon . Is there any chance of her catching an Allman Brothers Band show while she 's there ?

Kirkman : We can only hope that they are still performing shows . If that 's where the Governor is and that 's what she 's doing I do n't know how Michonne 's going to handle that . She 's gon na want to watch the show , she 's gon na want to get revenge . She 'll be be torn .

EW : Here 's a question you 're not going to answer : How long before we see the Governor ?

Kirkman : -LSB- Laughs -RSB- Is this the question your boss makes you ask ?

Kirkman : He 's definitely going to appear at some point this season . It 's possible there are elements of his return that have already been set up in some ways you might not have noticed . But when he returns it will be at a time when you least expect it .

EW : Is Woodbury now a ghost town ?

Kirkman : That will be dealt with in an upcoming episode .

Kirkman : Look , if they ever need to rappel down something they 're able to do that .

Kirkman : -LSB- Laughs -RSB- Yeah , Norman asked for that . He makes everyone on set call him Pookie . We worked that into the show .

EW : Judging from the premiere , I got the impression you will be exploring the character of Beth more this season than you have done previously .

Kirkman : I think that to a certain extent we will be exploring all characters more than we have . This show has been doing a lot of world-building for the first three seasons . Now that we 've got that out of the way , this season we 're going to be intensely focused on the characters themselves . You 'll learn a lot more about Beth , you 'll learn a lot more about Daryl , you 'll learn a lot more about Rick . We 're going to be doing a lot of character work this season .
