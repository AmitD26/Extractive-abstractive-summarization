Hoping her celebrity will bring attention to the widening Syrian refugee crisis , actress and U.N. envoy Angelina Jolie spoke of the horrors that children , many of them orphans , have witnessed in Syria .

`` Body parts separated , and burned people being pulled apart like chicken -- a little 9-year-old girl said that , '' Jolie said during her visit to a refugee tent camp in Jordan near the Syrian border .

Escorted to the border overnight by the Jordanian military , Jolie witnessed the moment when Syrians crossed into Jordan , becoming refugees before her eyes . The actress , who is raising six children with partner Brad Pitt , said she was greatly moved by what she had seen and spoke of the connection she felt in particular with the mothers and their children as they faced such challenging times .

`` The amount of innocent children that have been reported dead , the amount of innocent children I 've met here who are wounded and unaccompanied -- with their parents being killed and now they 're on their own -- it 's impossible to imagine any mother standing by and not stepping up and doing something to prevent this , '' she said .

Jolie has made countless trips to the world 's hotspots in her role as a U.N. goodwill ambassador -- including a visit to Syrian refugees in Turkey last year .

`` I am grateful to Jordan and the border countries for saving the lives -LRB- of those -RRB- who are dying in Syria . It 's an extraordinary thing . We encourage the international community to support the people here until one day they go back home . ''

The humanitarian situation in Homs is `` grave and continues to deteriorate , '' according to a team of international health experts who visited the embattled province last week as part of a U.N. exploratory mission .

Some 550,000 of the 2.2 million people in the province are in need of humanitarian aid , said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic . And there is little time to get that aid into Homs , which has been a bastion of anti-government sentiment in the Syrian civil war .

`` The urgency of scaling up delivery of humanitarian aid is exacerbated by the approaching winter , '' Jasarevic said .

About half of the province 's medical doctors have left , and only about three surgeons remain , he said . Facilities across the province have been damaged or destroyed , leaving only a fraction of the existing hospitals overwhelmed with patients and short on medicine and supplies .
