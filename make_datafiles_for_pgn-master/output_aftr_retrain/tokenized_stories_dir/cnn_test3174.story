But it got me to thinking : How do you show love of country ?

10 . Support a strong central government . The Articles of Confederation were a disaster . The U.S. Constitution was designed by men who wanted a strong central government so as to build unity , strengthen the economy and defend the homeland .

9 . Be skeptical of too much centralized governmental power . Inconsistent ? Well , that tension is at the heart of the American experience . George Washington and Alexander Hamilton wanted national strength ; Thomas Jefferson and James Madison did not . To truly love America is to hold both ideas in your head at once .

8 . Embrace immigrants . The best day I had in 2014 was the day my eighth-grader was chosen to speak to hundreds of new Americans at their naturalization ceremony . The energy , idealism and unadulterated patriotism in that room was overwhelming . True love of country was in the air ; and tears were in my eyes .

As a professor at Georgetown I have taught many outstanding young officers over the past 14 years . I have kept in touch with many : some are still in uniform -- they give me firsthand reports of the glory and the errors of today 's military . Others are in civilian life : they connect me to the ground-level challenges young veterans face , from the job market to navigating the VA. . If you really love your country , the least you can do is be able to name someone who is sacrificing for your freedom .

5 . Travel around America . I have been in all 50 states . I had the privilege of visiting most of them with Bill Clinton . If you ever get the chance to fly a million miles with President Clinton , I highly recommend it . Everywhere we went , we soaked up the local culture -LRB- and both of us inhaled the local cuisine -RRB- . The lengthy , grueling presidential campaign gives our candidates a marrow-deep love for the wonderful diversity , the impossible breadth , and the miraculous unity of this country .

4 . Then travel the world . The cliche is true : The more you see of the world , the more you love America . Maybe one reason the Greatest Generation had such deep love for America is that they 'd served their country overseas and seen the rest of the world at its worst . At the same time , when you see other countries that are doing something better than we are ; when you ride a highway in a Third World country that is smoother than your local interstate ; when you see a successful European pre-K program , it makes you want to work to improve on those things at home .

2 . Inform yourself . Yes , the media is rife with faults , but we live in a time when technology empowers us to inform ourselves as never before . So , for example , before I jumped ugly over Sarah Palin 's recent speech in Iowa , I got on my computer and actually watched the whole thing . Perhaps before they screamed about President Obama 's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast , my conservative friends should have actually read it . If you truly love your country , get out of your media comfort zone -LRB- see # 3 above -RRB- , check out original sources , look up some history . Arm yourself with facts if you want to really love your country .

1 . Question your leaders in time of war . The greatest , most disastrous , most tragic governmental decision made in my lifetime was the Iraq War . Too many Americans , broken-hearted and justly vengeful after 9/11 , meekly swallowed the Bush administration 's line that Saddam Hussein was an imminent threat . Same thing with FDR 's internment of Japanese-Americans in 1942 . When your country is freaking out , when war fever is at its height , that is when questioning your leaders is the deepest display of patriotic love .
