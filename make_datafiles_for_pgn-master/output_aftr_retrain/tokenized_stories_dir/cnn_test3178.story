-LRB- CNN -RRB- Some say it 's the most famous , perfectly composed news photo of all time .

The image was so inspiring that , by 1945 standards , it went viral . It triggered a wave of national hope that Japanese forces would soon be crushed and peace was near . It spurred millions of Americans to buy war bonds to keep the nation on solid financial footing . Basically , this simple photo was so powerful it helped win World War II .

But Rosenthal was just one of several cameramen on the island 's Mount Suribachi that day . Their images reveal the entire story behind the famous picture . They provide clues into the anger and ugly rumors over whether the Pulitzer Prize-winning photo was staged .

Hal Buell , a former executive newsphoto editor at the Associated Press , knew Rosenthal . Buell shared with CNN the inside story surrounding the photo .

`` The most surprising thing to me is ... that even today there are many people who believe that the picture was posed , '' Buell said . `` It still comes up over and over again . ''

On February 23 , 1945 , Rosenthal , an AP photographer covering the battle for Iwo Jima , had heard Marines were headed up the mountain . He decided to make the climb and see what was going on .

But Sgt. Louis Lowery , a Marine photographer for Leatherneck magazine , had beat him to it . Lowery was already on the summit snapping photos of Marines proudly raising the American flag .

For miles around , the sight of Old Glory atop the mountain set off whistles , gunfire and celebrations . The noise stirred up a firefight with Japanese soldiers near the summit . Lowery dove for cover and fell 50 feet , smashing his camera .

According to Buell , Lowery said , `` Hey , you 're late fellas , there 's already a flag up there . '' Lowery told Rosenthal that he should keep going to experience the breathtaking view .

As Rosenthal got closer to the summit , the flag began to come into view .

Let 's stop a minute and remember that this was long before today 's sophisticated cameras and digital technology . Photographers took one picture at a time , often with only one opportunity to get the perfect shot .

Rosenthal had to quickly decide whether to shoot both flags simultaneously -- one rising while the other lowered -- or to photograph the second flag as it was being raised .

Rosenthal 's choice made all the difference .

`` Joe did not pose that picture , '' Buell said .

He explains what happened : `` While the photographers were taking their positions to get the shot , Genaust -- the motion picture photographer -- asked Joe , `` I 'm not in your way , am I ? ' Joe turned to look at Genaust , who suddenly saw the flag rising and said , ` Hey , there she goes ! ' ''

Just in time , Rosenthal raised his camera to his eye and took the shot .

There it was : a genuine moment in history , artfully captured for all time .

`` Like any good , experienced and talented photographer , there 's a sense of anticipation and a sense of shooting a picture at peak action -- and Joe got it , '' Buell said . `` You could n't have captured the action at a better peak . A moment earlier , and the flag would have been too low . If it had been a second later , the flag 's staff would have been straight up and the photo would n't have had that strong diagonal line . ''

Think about it : At the exact moment that Genaust cued Rosenthal , sunlight , shadows , wind and the Marines all converged perfectly .

But what about Lowery 's flag photo ? How was the composition of his image ?

But it 's just not a memorable picture , Buell said , which is likely why it never gained fame . It did n't have the same powerful visual message and photographic excellence of Rosenthal 's image .

On the other hand , Rosenthal 's `` picture captured the heroism of the whole World War , '' Buell said . `` It captured a moment during a ferocious battle and it looked to the future -- to victory and the end of the war . ''

In fact , the image was so good that critics accused Rosenthal of staging it -- a myth he fought for more than 60 years .

The rumor started for a good reason . Rosenthal actually did stage a photo on the summit . But the photo he posed was a different picture that was taken after the famous flag-raising . In the staged photo , Marines posed in front of the flag , victoriously holding their helmets and rifles in the air .

That image is referred to as Rosenthal 's `` Gung Ho '' Iwo Jima photo .

Before he even saw his photos , Rosenthal sent his film by plane to Guam , where it was developed and edited . The famous photo was transmitted by radiofax to San Francisco before it was shared with newspapers across the nation and around the world .

Lowery alleged that Rosenthal 's picture must have been posed . According to Buell , `` someone asked Joe if he posed his picture , and Joe -- thinking they meant the ` Gung Ho ' photo -- said yes . ''

Minutes later , Rosenthal realized what photo they were talking about and immediately tried to correct his error .

`` They came to the conclusion that the picture was not posed , '' Buell said . `` It was an authentic news picture of the second flag being raised . ''

Years later , Rosenthal and Lowery settled their differences . During a Marine event somewhere in the Carolinas , they reunited in a hotel room where they shared a bottle of bourbon , Buell said . Afterward , Lowery acknowledged Rosenthal 's picture was not posed .

The picture has become almost an unofficial symbol of the Marine Corps and World War II in the Pacific . The Marines embraced it by transforming the photo into a memorial statue in Arlington , Virginia . Hollywood movies have been made about the flag-raising . The U.S. Postal Service featured it on a stamp . Even the shape of the National Museum of the Marine Corps , in Triangle , Virginia , was inspired by Rosenthal 's photo .
