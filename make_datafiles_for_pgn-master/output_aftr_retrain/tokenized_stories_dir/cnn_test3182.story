Believe it or not , that 's the Lunar New Year message for the people of Hong Kong from the city 's leader C.Y. Leung .

`` In the coming year , I hope that all people in Hong Kong will take inspiration from the sheep 's character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for Hong Kong 's future , '' he said .

For 79 days in late 2014 , student-led protests for democratic open elections took over major streets in the heart of the city . It was the biggest political challenge to Beijing since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests .

And while the Umbrella Movement , so named after umbrellas were used to shield protesters from the tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police , is no longer blocking the roads , Hong Kong 's young protesters have vowed to return in force in the Year of the Sheep .

`` And Occupy action will be happening more often in the future . ''

As pledged in their `` we 'll be back '' slogans at the end of the protest in December , the demonstrators plan to return and will once again rely on the civil disobedience tactics that eventually turned public opinion against them .

`` It 's the only way I see now that will actually give pressure to the government because you are actually blocking the roads , causing some problems and some trouble to the government , '' says student activist Glacier Kwong of Keyboard Frontline .

But they -- and the pro-democracy legislators who have joined their protest -- insist the reason for their protest is both economic and political .

`` The livelihood issue of the people of Hong Kong is very much affected by the political structure which completely swings over to the upper class and the elite , '' says Lee Cheuk-Yan , a pro-democracy lawmaker and former student activist who was detained during the Tiananmen uprising .

`` For young people in Hong Kong , if you want to climb that so-called ladder of mobility , you have to be politically ... correct and that is horrible . ''

But Hong Kong 's student protesters want more . They want the right to vote on candidates for chief executive who are independent of Beijing .

`` It 's not like the Chinese government owes us anything , '' says Kwong . `` We have the right to have these things . We have the right to have democracy -- true democracy -- and universal suffrage because this is a human right . ''

Idealistic words . And her teenage ally is not shy to admit the challenges ahead .

`` Fighting for true universal suffrage in Hong Kong is trying turn something impossible to possible , '' concedes Joshua Wong .

After making the cover of Time magazine 's international edition , Wong was included in the magazine 's annual list of most influential teenagers .

`` What we need is international public opinion to keep a watch on China , so that they should leave Hong Kong alone , '' says Lee .

And people in Hong Kong are nothing like sheep , especially its young activists .

They are dauntless and determined to have a say in Hong Kong 's political destiny .
