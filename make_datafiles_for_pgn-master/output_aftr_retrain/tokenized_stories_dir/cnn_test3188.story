-LRB- CNN -RRB- In Washington , we are seeing the re-emergence this year of a phenomenon that many Americans were afraid had gone extinct : real live no-joke bipartisanship .

Heavyweights from both parties are attending the March 26 Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform . The event is co-produced by Gingrich Productions -LRB- on the right -RRB- and by my project , #cut50 -- an initiative that aims to safely halve the number of people behind bars within 10 years .

Attorney General Eric Holder will be speaking . So will Newt Gingrich , the Republican former House speaker . Sen. Cory Booker , D-New Jersey , will be there . So will Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Donna Brazile , a co-host of the summit .

So will President Obama .

The ever-expanding incarceration industry has begun to violate some of the deepest and most sacred principles of BOTH major political parties .

Therefore , conservatives , libertarians and liberals have their own objective interests in reform -- and their own values-based incentives to make real changes .

For example , the right takes very seriously the concept of `` liberty . '' Conservatives and libertarians want to defend the rights of every individual to pursue his or her dreams . They favor limited government . They hate massive , failed , bloated government bureaucracies that suck up more and more money and get more and more power , no matter how badly they perform .

And most people come out more damaged , more hopeless and less able to thrive than when they went in . -LRB- So much for `` corrections '' ! -RRB-

That 's the opposite of limited government -- and liberty .

On the other hand , progressives like me care passionately about the `` justice for all '' part -- including racial justice and social justice . We are incensed by a system that locks up the poor and racial minorities in numbers that are massive -- and massively disproportionate . We oppose a system that forever tars people as `` felons , '' deemed permanently unfit for employment or the right to vote , possibly because of one mistake , early in life .

Still struggling to believe me ? I was on `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' on Monday night to discuss the movement for criminal justice reform .

Here is a quote :

`` A lot of kids I grew up with , grammar school , middle school , high school , were in prison . They were the poor kids and they had drug addictions . They had drug problems , they did n't have any money , they got caught , and they got caught in the poverty cycle , and they are at the bottom of society and they ca n't get out of it . ... People with drug problems , people who have mental illnesses , they probably should n't be in the criminal justice system . And people who make mistakes , let 's not write them off forever , let 's give them a chance to reintegrate and reenter society . ''

On practically every other issue , the Koch brothers and I are still fierce opponents . I doubt if we will ever agree on tax policy , campaign finance reform , environmental rules or the Keystone Pipeline , to name a few . But on criminal justice reform , it 's different .

Mark speaks eloquently about the way the criminal justice system violates the Bill of Rights and criminalizes behaviors that should not result in prison terms .

Fiscal conservatives decry the money wasted on a system that is too expensive and produces poor results . That 's one reason that red-state governors , like Georgia 's Nathan Deal , have acted boldly . Leaders with roots on the religious right , including summit co-host Pat Nolan , insist on the Christian value of redemption and second chances for those behind bars .

Our values may not always be identical , but they can find common expression in fixing this broken prison system . Progressives and conservatives do n't have to trust each other -- or even like each other -- to vote together on this issue .

Perhaps the March 26 Bipartisan Summit will represent the first major bend in the road back toward sanity .
