-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While Fernando Alonso has overcome the shortcomings of his 2012 Ferrari to be an early title contender , the two-time world champion 's teammate Felipe Massa is facing an uncertain future after a disappointing start to the Formula One season .

`` Felipe was very unlucky , both in the race and in qualifying , '' read a statement on Ferrari 's official website .

`` But everyone , he more than anyone , is expecting a change of gear starting right away with the Monaco Grand Prix , his second home race , given that he lives just a few hundred meters from what , as from next Sunday , will be transformed into the paddock for the sixth round of the 2012 championship . ''

Massa 's most successful year in the elite division of motorsport was in 2008 , when he was denied a first world championship crown by McLaren 's Lewis Hamilton on the final corner of the final race .

`` It takes very little to change the hierarchy among the teams and this rule is even more true when the differences are just a few tenths or even hundredths , '' he said .

`` This year , the winner will be whoever manages to bring the best technical updates to the track in the shortest time possible : staying still for just a handful of races could mean finishing out of the points , given that so many teams have proved capable of fighting for the top places .

`` We achieved our goal of making a step forward in Spain , but we must continue down this path , especially as the gap to the time that gave Hamilton his pole position is still too big . ''

Meanwhile , F1 chiefs are still investigating the fire that cast a shadow over Williams ' first grand prix victory since 2004 and the first race victory by a Venezuelan driver .

The blaze in the British team 's garage left seven people in hospital , but a statement released by Williams on Monday confirmed that all but one of those injured have now been released .

`` His family are in constant communication and he is in good spirits . Investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing in collaboration with the FIA and local authorities .

Team principal Frank Williams thanked the other teams for their help and support following the incident .

`` The astonishing response from the teams and other paddock personnel was immediate , unconditional and overwhelming . ''
