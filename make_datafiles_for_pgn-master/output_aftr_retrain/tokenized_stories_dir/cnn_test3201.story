-LRB- CNN -RRB- In Russia 's tightly-managed democracy , where being an opposition politician can seriously damage your health , chances to question the country 's leader are rare .

President Vladimir Putin cuts an isolated figure , closely guarded behind the walls of the Kremlin , traveling to-and-fro by helicopter or high-speed motorcade .

In recent years , sitting in a shiny studio surrounded by a hand-picked audience of soldiers , doctors , teachers , factory workers and so on , Putin has held forth on subjects from parenting to food prices , to relations with America .

Last year he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes . In 2013 , it was a record-breaking 4 hours and 47 minutes . Organizers say this year , public interest is especially strong .

Sanctions and Russia 's deep economic crisis , which saw the value of the Russian currency , the ruble , plunge in value by 50 % against the dollar , is set to be a major a theme .

So too is foreign policy . With Moscow at odds with the West over Ukraine , some of the released questions show how concerned ordinary Russians are about their country 's place in the world .

It 's not just Russian schoolchildren who want to hear Putin 's answer .

Critics of the Kremlin , of course , slam this entire event as Russia 's imitation of democracy in action . It 's hard to imagine a truly critical question , they say , getting aired on national television here . In fact , its best not to look at this event as an opportunity for Russians to question their leader at all .

Sometimes , the Kremlin likes to throw in a nasty surprise , too . Last year saw NSA whistleblower , Edward Snowden , granted asylum in Russia , address Putin by videolink .

Who knows who may pop up this time .
