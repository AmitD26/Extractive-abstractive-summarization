-LRB- CNN -RRB- They took Yarmouk by storm , a sea of masked men flooding into the streets of one the world 's most beleaguered places .

Besieged and bombed by Syrian forces for more than two years , the desperate residents of this Palestinian refugee camp near Damascus awoke in early April to a new , even more terrifying reality -- ISIS militants seizing Yarmouk after defeating several militia groups operating in the area .

The camp , which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus , has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012 .

Hundreds have been injured , but the camp 's only functioning hospital was first occupied by ISIS , then targeted last week by regime shelling .

As the fighting raged in Yarmouk , the director of the Jafra Foundation -- the only aid group that has been able to get into the camp -- painted a grim portrait of the conditions on the ground since ISIS arrived .

`` We need medicine and access to treatment and medical facilities , '' Wesam Sabaneh told CNN . `` The last hospital in Yarmouk camp was bombed yesterday , so there 's really nothing functioning . ''

Opinion : Save the ` miracle babies '

Even delivering clean water in Yarmouk can be a deadly task . Majed Alomari , the Jafra Foundation 's water coordinator , was killed a few days ago -- gunned down in an ISIS firefight with rival rebel groups .

The head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights in Syria -LRB- PLHR -RRB- , who fled the camp and Syria in October 2012 , said the people of Yarmouk were in dire need of help .

Aid agencies briefly managed to break the government 's stranglehold on the camp last year , and delivered aid to tens of thousands .

But now , as terror closes in on Yarmouk from all sides , residents have two choices -- to attempt to flee what was their place of refuge , or to stay inside what the U.N. says now resembles a camp of death .
