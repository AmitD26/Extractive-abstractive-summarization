LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prince Harry led tributes to Diana , Princess of Wales on the 10th anniversary of her death , describing her as `` the best mother in the world '' in a speech at a memorial service .

William and I can separate life into two parts . There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father .

And then there are the 10 years since our mother 's death . When she was alive , we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life , laughter , fun and folly . She was our guardian , friend and protector .

She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated .

She will always be remembered for her amazing public work . But behind the media glare , to us , just two loving children , she was quite simply the best mother in the world .

But we miss her . She kissed us last thing at night . Her beaming smile greeted us from school . She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day . She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure .

She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood .

To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age , as others have experienced , is indescribably shocking and sad . It was an event which changed our lives forever , as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night .

But what is far more important to us now , and into the future , is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was : fun-loving , generous , down-to-earth , entirely genuine .

We both think of her every day .

Prince William 's reading from St Paul 's letter to the Ephesians :

I bow my knees before the Father , from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name .

I pray that , according to the riches of His glory , He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit , and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith , as you are being rooted and grounded in love .

I pray that you may have the power to comprehend , with all the saints , what is the breadth and length and height and depth , and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God .

Thanks be to God .

One tiny incident , characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess 's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort .

Everyone here will have their own memories .

After her marriage , the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty , empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates .

Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family , our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century .

There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but does n't intrude , but there is another sphere , vital to any sense of national unity and creativity , a sphere in which communities must be celebrated , common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored .

We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God 's will , but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ , the human face of God , then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society .

She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital 's Aids ward . It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s .

Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin .

And she had a similar impact in the USA . An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign , and even a royal , dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US .

Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention , banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children .

He said : `` She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well . She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable . She knew the feeling . She did n't set out to be a saint . ''

She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched . She said of John , a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis : `` He showed no sign of anger , no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered . ''

The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life . Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those , like John , whose lives she touched .

This is the knowledge which passes all understanding . This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints .

It 's easy to lose the real person in the image , to insist that all is darkness or all is light . Still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of `` fury '' at this or that incident , and the Princess 's memory is used for scoring points .

Let it end here .
