NAIROBI , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gangs of young men armed with machetes are roaming the streets in Kenya as post-election violence threatens to engulf the country . Horrific attacks are being reported , including the torching of a church where people who had sought refuge were burned alive .

At least 148 people have been killed and about 75,000 have fled their homes since President Mwai Kibaki won a narrow victory , according to Kenyan government officials . The Associated Press reported a higher number -- about 275 -- have died since Saturday .

Much of the violence is between supporters of Kibaki from the majority Kikuyu tribe and backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga , who is from the Luo tribe .

The ethnic violence , previously rare in Kenya , is reminiscent of the strife that led to the Rwanda genocide . In a particularly disturbing incident , a mob appears to have burned a church filled with Kenyans seeking refuge from the violence .

Biwott said he counted at least 15 charred bodies , including children , in the burned church and an adjacent field .

The wounded sustained gunshot wounds , burns and cuts from a panga , a machete-like weapon , the Red Cross said . Watch smoke darken skies near a burned church

Police and political backers of opposition leader Raila Odinga began clashing about four days ago as Odinga , of the Luo tribe , narrowly lost Kenya 's presidential election to Mwai Kibaki .

Violence broke out in several cities as frustration mounted during the slow hand-count of the ballots . Kibaki was re-elected with 51.3 percent of the vote , to 48.7 percent for Odinga .

`` What we now witness is a cold and calculated plan to organize and engage in massacres , '' government spokesman Alfred Mutua said .

Bringing in the New Year , Kibaki -- who rarely speaks to the press -- urged calm to the nation .

`` It now is a time for healing and reconciliation amongst all Kenyans , '' he said .

Foreign Minister Raphael Tuju said the government is committed to taking control .

The government said Tuesday it will not allow any political rallies in the aftermath of the controversial election outcome .

Odinga 's opposition Orange Democratic Movement had scheduled rallies for Tuesday , raising fears of more violence .

Mutua said there was no intention to impose a state of emergency or curfew at this point , and said police are handling the violence well and with `` extreme restraint . ''

However , he warned that police restraint would not last forever . The violence is rare for Kenya , which has enjoyed relative calm even as war and chronic political violence wracked neighboring countries , such as Ethiopia , Sudan and Uganda .
