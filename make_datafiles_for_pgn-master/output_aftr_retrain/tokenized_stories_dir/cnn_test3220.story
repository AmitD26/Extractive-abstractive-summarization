-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The only thing Venus Williams treasures more than winning is a decent nap .

Venus Williams knocks Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova out of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships on February 17 , 2009 .

Just before a match , when other top tennis players might be psyching themselves up for a three-set onslaught , the elder of the Williams sisters can be found somewhere private , snoozing .

Her younger sister , world number one Serena , sounds almost envious of Venus ' ability to keep her emotions in check .

`` Venus is really , really unusually composed and that 's just her style , '' Serena told CNN .

`` On the court she 's always really focused . She always has this quiet tenacity and she never really shows her emotions which I think is good . ''

Venus is just 15 months older than Serena . She set the marker for success in 2002 when she became the first of the sisters to become world number one . Serena first took the title in July of the same year and reclaimed it earlier this month .

`` I 'm always trying to do what she does . If she 's going on the right path then I 'm going on the right path too . If she 's working hard then I want to work hard also . I 'm the little sister who wants to be just like the big sister , '' she added .

If they once struggled to find the required ruthlessness to eliminate each other from a competition , it is clearly no longer a problem .

Of 18 matches they have contested , each sister has won nine . At the time of writing , there is every chance they will meet again this week in the semi-final of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships .

They last clashed at the Sony Ericsson Championships in Doha in November 2008 when Venus dispatched Serena in three hard-fought sets before going on to win her first end of season title .

Asked after the match about accusations they do n't play as hard against each other as they would normal rivals , Venus replied , `` You have to play hard against a Williams or you are going home quickly . We try our hardest and I think that everyone knows that by the effort level . ''

Their mother , Oracene Price , told CNN she keeps her advice on the subject simple .

`` So , this is just a game and eventually it would be over and you will have to live with each other . So , just go out there and do your best and whoever wins , wins . And whoever loses , better luck next time . ''

Having said that , Price admits she keeps her distance from whoever comes out second best , in any match .

There is no need for tip-toeing today . Venus made fast work of Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova , beating the 17-year-old 6-0 , 6-1 in less than one hour in the second round of the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships .
