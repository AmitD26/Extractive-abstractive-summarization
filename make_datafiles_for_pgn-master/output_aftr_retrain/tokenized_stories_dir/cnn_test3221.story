-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One week in Darfur , the next week at the White House . That 's the role of a peace activist -- one that actor George Clooney embraces .

His battle to bring peace to Darfur brought him to the White House on Monday , where he met with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden .

The actor appeared on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' later on Monday to discuss his activism .

`` I actually met with the president in the Oval Office for about 15 minutes , '' Clooney told King , adding that they 'd worked together on Darfur three years ago , holding a news conference on the issue when Obama was a U.S. senator . The actor met separately with Biden on Monday .

Clooney , a longtime Darfur activist and a Messenger of Peace for the United Nations , was in Darfur last week with journalists Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and Ann Curry of NBC .

The government of Darfur has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years , a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide .

An estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat , disease or malnutrition , according to the United Nations . An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels , government forces and the allied Janjaweed militias .

Last year , Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government 's campaign of violence in Darfur .

`` This is n't about needing American dollars , '' Clooney said of the push for peace in Darfur . `` I understand that it 's a very difficult time . It 's not about needing American troops . It 's about needing what we do best -- what we have done best since the start of this country -- which is good , robust diplomacy all across the world . ''

The priorities , as Clooney advocated to Obama and Biden :

-- An envoy working full time on bringing peace to Darfur -- someone `` getting up every morning with their sole job to find peace in the area , '' he said .

-- Pressing Egypt , the African Union and Europe to strengthen diplomatic efforts in the region .
