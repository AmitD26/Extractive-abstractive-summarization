MOGADISHU , Somalia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At least 39 civilians were killed in Somalia 's capital Monday after a convoy of African Union peacekeepers was hit by a roadside bomb , causing the troops to open fire , officials and eyewitnesses said .

Islamist militia display weapons Monday in defiance of newly elected President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed .

Ahmed Dirie Ali , spokesman of Hawiye Traditional Elders -- a major group of local clan leaders -- condemned the civilian deaths . And Mogadishu 's deputy mayor , Abdifatah Ibrahim Shaweye , accused AMISOM of killing innocent civilians deliberately during a `` brutal attack , '' an allegation Barigye denied .

`` The deputy mayor has got the wrong information , '' he said . `` They are targeting AMISOM , but the people who have died are all Somali civilians , who have nothing , whatsoever to do with AMISOM . ''

`` It is important that these efforts should have a tangible effect in improving the security environment for the Somali people and humanitarian actors , '' Ban said in a statement released by his office . `` The United Nations will provide strong logistical support to the African Union 's AMISOM force and help develop Somali security forces . ''

AMISOM was set up to take over from Ethiopian forces , which were supposed to be withdrawn soon after the December 2006 invasion that deposed the Islamic Courts Union , which Ahmed once led . But the Ethiopians and the country 's U.N.-backed transitional government were soon battling Islamist guerrillas , including the militia al-Shabaab -- which the United States has designated as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda .

The militia overran the town of Baidoa , the seat of the transitional government , within hours of the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops last week . Ahmed was elected president Saturday by lawmakers in Djibouti , and many Somalis view him as a final hope to challenge the militia and its extremist ideology .
