-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazilian star Kaka has rejected a world record transfer move to Premier League Manchester City and decided to stay with AC Milan .

Kaka opted to stay with AC Milan despite the riches on offer .

The devoutly religious Kaka explained his reasons on the club 's television station .

`` To have gone to Manchester City could have been a great project but in the past few days I have prayed a lot to understand what the right team would be and in the end I have decided to remain here .

Italian prime minister and Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi originally broke the news that the devoted fans of the Rossoneri wanted to hear .

Interviewed on Italian TV 's Sky Italia late on Monday night , Berlusconi confirmed that Milan had offered Kaka the chance to `` make himself a fortune , but said he has `` higher values . ''

Berlusconi continued : `` He is staying with us , there are things which are more important than money : we are happy .

Fans of former European champions Milan had staged a series of protests since City 's audacious move for Kaka became public late last week .

Have your say : Should Kaka have stayed at AC Milan or taken the money ?

City , who are being backed by Sheikh Mansour 's Abu-Dhabi investment group , finally admitted defeat in a statement on their club Web site www.mfc.co.uk from executive chairman Gary Cook :

`` Whilst Manchester City Football Club has an obvious interest in world-class players of the quality of Kaka , we owe it to our fans that such a transfer must work on every level ; commercially , financially , in terms of results on the field and within Manchester City 's broader community . ''

City , who are struggling in 11th in the Premier League and out of the FA Cup , signed Kaka 's Brazilian international teammate Robinho from Real Madrid shortly after their new Abu Dhabi owners took over last summer .

Robinho has proved an immediate success with 12 goals , but City are aware of the need to attract more world class players to their ranks , hence the ulitmately fruitless attempt to sign Kaka .

In a separate development , Robinho moved quickly to deny reports that he had stormed out of City 's training camp in Tenerife because they had failed to sign his friend Kaka .

`` I am committed to helping Manchester City become the force the owners assured me they will become . ''
