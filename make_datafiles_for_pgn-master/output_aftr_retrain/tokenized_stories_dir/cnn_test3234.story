LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After a long apprenticeship , it 's been an astonishingly fast rise for R&B singer Jazmine Sullivan .

She went to that city 's performing arts high school and was signed to a contract by Jive Records , where she was paired with producers such as Timbaland and Cool & Dre .

Now she 's up for five Grammys on February 8 , including best R&B performance -LRB- for `` Bust Your Windows '' -RRB- and best new artist .

CNN 's KJ Matthews talked with Sullivan about her inspirations , who she 's bringing to the Grammys and the mysterious person behind `` Bust Your Windows . '' The following is an edited version of that interview .

CNN : How would you describe your sound ?

Jazmine Sullivan : I ca n't really describe it ; that 's the whole thing . Once you hear the CD , you 'll hear that one sound does n't sound like the next . You know , I 've been influenced by so many different styles and different genres of music that I felt like that should be represented on my first album , so when you get it , you get a taste of gospel , jazz , R&B , hip-hop , reggae , pop ... everything is on there , there 's something for everybody to enjoy . I did n't want to exclude anybody from the album .

CNN : Let me ask you this : When you saw or heard the other nominees in the best new artist category who happen to be a little bit more well-known , was it intimidating ? I mean , you got the Jonas Brothers , Katy Perry , Adele ...

Sullivan : Yeah , the Jonas Brothers , specifically . I did n't even know they were new artists because they are so huge , so , you know , so after , when my name was called after theirs , I thought , `` Wow , they 're new artists , too ? '' I got a little scared , I tell you that .

CNN : So everybody wants to know , the guy behind `` Bust Your Windows '' -- is there one ?

CNN : `` Need U Bad '' is rising as well . What 's the thought process behind that one ?

But on the flip side , I do a song like `` Bust Your Windows , '' so on the album you have a lot of different perceptions and everything .

CNN : How old are you ? You look like you 're 10 .

Sullivan : I 'm 21 years old .

CNN : Success that early , that 's sometimes tough for people .

Sullivan : Well , I 've been in this industry for a very long time . I started out when I was 12 ; I got signed when I was 16 , so it was n't an overnight success story at all . I put a lot of hard work into it , and this is just a byproduct of all of that .

CNN : All right , the big question : Grammy night . What are you wearing ? Who are you bringing ? What are you going to be doing ?

CNN : You 're just trying to enjoy the moment .

Sullivan : Enjoy , yes .
