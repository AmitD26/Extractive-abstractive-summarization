BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From a distance , it looks like an apparition : a huge multi-colored hot-air balloon floating in the Baghdad sky , bearing a large poster of Jesus Christ . Below it , an Iraqi flag .

Santa and his helpers stand under palm trees at Baghdad 's first public Christmas festival .

Welcome to the first-ever public Christmas celebration in Baghdad , held Saturday and sponsored by the Iraqi Interior Ministry . Once thought to be infiltrated by death squads , the Ministry now is trying to root out sectarian violence -- as well as improve its P.R. image .

The event takes place in a public park in eastern Baghdad , ringed with security checkpoints . Interior Ministry forces deployed on surrounding rooftops peer down at the scene : a Christmas tree decorated with ornaments and tinsel ; a red-costumed Santa Claus waving to the crowd , an Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders ; a red-and-black-uniformed military band playing stirring martial music , not Christmas carols .

Even before I can ask Interior Ministry spokesman Major-General Abdul Karim Khalaf a question , he greets me with a big smile . `` All Iraqis are Christian today ! '' he says .

Khalaf says sectarian and ethnic violence killed thousands of Iraqis . `` Now that we have crossed that hurdle and destroyed the incubators of terrorism , '' he says , `` and the security situation is good , we have to go back and strengthen community ties . ''

Many of the people attending the Christmas celebration appear to be Muslims , with women wearing head scarves . Suad Mahmoud , holding her 16-month-old daughter , Sara , tells me she is indeed Muslim , but she 's very happy to be here . `` My mother 's birthday also is this month , so we celebrate all occasions , '' she says , `` especially in this lovely month of Christmas and New Year . ''

Father Saad Sirop Hanna , a Chaldean Christian priest , is here too . He was kidnapped by militants in 2006 and held for 28 days . He knows firsthand how difficult the lot of Christians in Iraq is but , he tells me , `` We are just attesting that things are changing in Baghdad , slowly , but we hope that this change actually is real . We will wait for the future to tell us the truth about this . ''

Her mother , the children 's art teacher , Raja , shows me another child 's display called `` Baghdad Today . ''

In the middle is a black mound that looks like a body bag . Policemen and Interior Ministry forces surround it . `` This is terrorism , '' she tells me . `` We killed it and destroyed it , and our lives went back to normal . ''

A Christmas tale perhaps , I think , but one that many Iraqis hope will come true .
