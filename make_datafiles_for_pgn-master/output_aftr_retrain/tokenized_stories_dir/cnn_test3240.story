North Korean diplomat Kim Myong-gil gathered with other officials to discuss North Korea 's energy needs

Tong and Kim , a North Korea representative at the United Nations , gathered with others including former diplomats and academics at the Georgia Institute of Technology to discuss North Korea 's energy needs and the status of the six-party talks on its nuclear program .

Although the two top-level diplomats kept their remarks private , other participants in the conference at the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs aired their opinions openly .

Thursday 's conference coincided with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's announcement that her new envoy to North Korea , Stephen Bosworth , will travel to Russia , China , South Korea and Japan next week `` to consult on the next steps to move the six-party process forward . ''

Senior administration officials said Bosworth is considering heading to Pyongyang on that visit , but only if the leaders of the other parties involved in the talks are comfortable with that overture .

`` The question as to whether we 're going to engage with them on this particular trip remains to be decided , '' he said . `` That will depend upon our consultations in the region , and it will depend upon what we hear back from the North Koreans . ''

Thursday 's conference also coincided with reports that North Korea is apparently preparing to test-fire its long-range missile , the Taepodong-2 , under the guise of launching a satellite into space .

`` The only way to fix this problem is to negotiate , '' said Sigal , who is currently director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York .

`` It seems to me the answer to both is for Washington to put a bigger deal on the negotiating table now , '' Sigal proposed .

That drew a couple of comments and questions from the audience . One graduate student asked why the United States should `` put more oil in a leaky bucket , '' referring to the idea of sending more fuel oil shipments to North Korea when the previous shipments -- part of an agreement to get Pyongyang to shut down its nuclear facility -- have done little to deter the country from abandoning its nuclear program .

At Thursday 's conference , former U.S. ambassador to South Korea James Laney cautioned against resorting to the same rhetoric about which side had violated previous agreements .

`` I can understand how we want to score points ... but there are times when prudence or better wisdom or real strategy dictates that we have to -LRB- have -RRB- some sort of engagement , '' he said .

`` A peace treaty would mean there are two nations on the Korean peninsula , '' said Laney . `` There are two nations now , but a treaty would recognize -LRB- this -RRB- . ''

Cha , who said he routinely has to apologize for being a member of the Bush administration , praised Obama 's government , which he said has `` none of the hang-ups '' in dealing with North Korea 's leadership that the previous administration had .

Laney urged the new administration to `` move beyond sticks and carrots , '' which was the stated approach of the Bush administration . While there is no guarantee that a peace treaty or any other overture to North Korea would work , Laney and Sigal said the administration has to try a new approach .

`` You see , I 'm 81 and I want to see something -LRB- happen -RRB- before I die , '' said Laney , who worked in U.S. Army counterintelligence before serving in the Korean War . `` Fifty-five years is a long time . ''

Sigal concurred , saying that `` diplomatic give-and-take is the only policy '' for North Korea .

`` Kim Jong-Il wants to force America to be his friend , '' he said , referring to the North Korean leader . `` He seems unwilling to unclench his fist and shake Obama 's hand . We may have to settle for a fist bump . ''
