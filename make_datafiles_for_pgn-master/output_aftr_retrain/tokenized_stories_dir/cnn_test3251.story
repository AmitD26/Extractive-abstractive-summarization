Three of the four suspects in the alleged synagogue bombing plot are shown after their arrests .

The plot was uncovered in a yearlong investigation involving an FBI informant . It ended with federal agents and New York police used an 18-wheel truck to block a vehicle carrying the suspects after they planted what they believed were explosive devices in cars near the synagogues , said New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly . The planted devices were actually duds .

At a court hearing on May 21 , U.S. Magistrate Lisa Smith ordered three of the suspects -- Cromitie , David Williams and Onta Williams -- to remain in custody without bail . Prosecutor Eric Snyder described the suspects as violent men `` eager to bring death to Jews . ''

Cromitie , David Williams and Onta Williams are U.S. citizens , while Payen is Haitian , according to the New York governor 's office .

Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the work of his city 's Police Department and federal authorities in uncovering the alleged plot .

`` The good news here is that the New York Police Department and FBI did exactly what they 're trained to do and prevented what could have been a terrible event , '' Bloomberg said . `` We have to constantly be vigilant . ''

`` Unfortunately , this is the world we live in , '' said Nurit Bacharach of the Gan Miriam Early Childhood Center at the Hebrew Institute in Riverdale . `` We just have to forge ahead and keep a positive mind and live life and just be cautious and aware . ''

According to state and federal authorities , an FBI informant met with Cromitie in June 2008 in Newburgh , New York . During that meeting Cromitie said his parents live in Afghanistan , he was angry about the U.S. war there and that he had an interest in `` doing something to America . ''

The informant provided the men with a surface-to-air guided missile and C-4 plastic explosives , none of which could actually be used .

`` No one was at risk , '' said Kelly , the police commissioner , describing the explosive devices as duds created to dupe the suspects .
