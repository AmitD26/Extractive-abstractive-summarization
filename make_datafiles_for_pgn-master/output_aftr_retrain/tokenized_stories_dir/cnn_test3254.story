Deepa Krishnan : `` When you live in Mumbai you feel like you 're in the nerve center of the country . ''

Deepa 's Mumbai tours take in the city 's bazaars , backstreets and culture and her blog , Mumbai Magic , is a personal view of life in the city .

CNN : How does Mumbai compare to those other cities your company offers tour of ?

Deepa : Mumbai is a very young city by Indian standards , only 500 years old , whereas a city like Delhi is really ancient . Mumbai used to be a fishing hamlet and it grew after the British arrived . So it 's a young city and one that has been formed by migrants . Almost everyone in Mumbai has arrived here in the course of the last few generations , and so the city has a vibrancy and cosmopolitanism that is different from other cities .

Deepa : The fact that I am so grounded here -- I was born here and four generations of my family live here . But also , Mumbai is on the move , it 's vibrant , it 's accepting of change and it 's got a very active citizenry . It 's the one place where you can make a mark , where you can make a difference .

When you live in Mumbai you feel like you 're in the nerve center of the country . You feel like all the big events are near you and you 're connected to everything . In other cities I tend to feel more remote . If there 's a new play it premieres in Mumbai , if there 's a new band they play in Mumbai -- everything happens here . We 're close to the center of commerce and I would rather be close to the center of commerce than the center of politics !

What makes Mumbai special to you ? Let us know

CNN : Where do people go if they want to escape Mumbai 's bustle ?

Deepa : We head out of the city -- we run for the hills ! We go to the Western Ghats , which is a mountain range that runs parallel to the coast , barely a two-hour drive from where I live .

We also have a lot of beaches just outside the city and they are popular as well . Within the city there are little enclaves of peace -- even in Bhuleshwar market there are temple complexes where there 's a surprising silence compared to the bustle of the streets .

CNN : What 's a typical weekend in Mumbai ?

Alongside all the partying we 're all in a mad race to lose weight and look good . Bollywood is helping men wake up to the fact that there 's nothing wrong with a well-toned physique . In all the suburbs of Mumbai there 's a mushrooming of places where young guys are pumping iron and trying to be ` he-men . '

Deepa : Yes , I think there 's a hardening of stances and an unwillingness to accept platitudes . I also think there is increased uneasiness between communities .

CNN : If Mumbai was a person what would he or she be like ?

Deepa : This is a city which is strangely beautiful and strangely warty . At its heart this city is about money , it 's a city of exchange and commerce , so it would be a trader or a wheeler dealer -- someone who 's on the move , making deals and making money !
