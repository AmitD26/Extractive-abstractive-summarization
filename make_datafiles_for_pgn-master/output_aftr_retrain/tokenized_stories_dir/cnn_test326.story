-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Federal support for renewable power helped the United States reclaim from China the title of the world 's biggest investor in clean energy , researchers for the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts reported Wednesday .

The $ 48 billion in U.S. private investment in technology such as wind turbines and solar panels in 2011 edged out China 's $ 45.5 billion , Pew researchers found in a new study . Worldwide , investors put $ 263 billion into renewable energy projects last year -- a 6.5 % increase over 2010 -- and the cost of producing electricity from solar power was cut in half , the study found .

`` Those countries that have long-term policies in place are the ones that have had consistent growth , '' Cuttino told CNN . `` And we do n't have that . ''

And while U.S. investors have been ponying up while the incentives are in place , much of that money is going into projects overseas -- and America is importing the resulting products .

In the United States , renewables other than hydroelectric provide about 4.7 % of U.S. generating capacity , according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration .

Germany and China have boosted their green energy sector `` through consistent policies , '' by setting targets for new generating capacity , the report said .

The United States is also seeing a boom in cheap natural gas , which produces fewer carbon emissions than coal or oil . And in the past year , the collapse of the solar energy firm Solyndra has cast a pall over alternative energy funding in the United States .

Solyndra filed for bankruptcy in 2011 after receiving more than $ 535 million in federal loan guarantees , putting more than 1,000 people out of work . President Barack Obama 's Republican opposition has attacked the loan-guarantee program as `` crony capitalism , '' accusing Solyndra of receiving special treatment because a key investor was an Obama fundraiser , but supporters say the company was undermined by the explosive growth of China 's solar industry .

Cuttino said companies are going to fail as the renewable power industry grows , comparing it to the early years of the automobile industry .
