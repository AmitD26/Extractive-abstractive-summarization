LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and pleaded for a powerful sedative despite knowing its harmful effects , a nutritionist who worked with the singer said Tuesday .

Cherilyn Lee , a registered nurse and nurse practitioner who first met Jackson in January to treat his children for a common cold , said she rejected his requests for Diprivan and informed him of the side effects .

`` I told him this medication is not safe , '' Lee said . `` He said , ` I just want to get some sleep . You do n't understand . I just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep . ' ''

`` I told him -- and it is so painful that I actually felt it in my whole spirit -- ` If you take this you might not wake up . ' ''

According to the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners , nurse practitioners `` provide high-quality healthcare services similar to those of a doctor . '' They can also prescribe medications , according to the academy 's Web site .

`` I wonder why someone would make a comment about drugs when they have n't seen him take the drug or anyone who administered it . ''

The drug , known by its generic name Propofol , is administered intravenously as an anesthetic during surgeries . Watch nurse describe Jackson 's drug request ''

An initial dose puts a person to sleep . An overdose can lead to cardiac arrest , doctors say .

Jackson died June 25 at the age of 50 . Authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine what killed him .

Lee said that four days before Jackson 's death , she received a call from a Jackson staff member who said the singer felt that one side of his body was cold ; the other hot .

Lee , who was in Florida at the time , said she told Jackson 's staffers to take him to a hospital .

Lee also could not say why Jackson would call on her , when the last time she saw him was three months ago .

But , she added , she did n't know of any doctors who would have given him the drug .

Dr. Rakesh Marwah of the anesthesiology department at the Stanford University School of Medicine said Propofol can lead to cardiac arrest , which is suspected in Jackson 's death .

`` Propofol slows down the heart rate and slows down the respiratory rate and slows down the vital functions of the body , '' he said .
