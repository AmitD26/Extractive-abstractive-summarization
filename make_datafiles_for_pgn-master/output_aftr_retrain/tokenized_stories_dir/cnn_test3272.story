-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two former Blackwater employees have made statements against Blackwater Worldwide and its founder Erik Prince , accusing the security company and its former CEO of murder and other serious crimes in Iraq , according to court documents filed this week .

Blackwater founder Erik Prince , shown here before a congressional panel in 2007 , recently left the company .

The sworn affidavits by an ex-Marine who joined Blackwater and another employee -- listed in the documents as `` John Doe No. 1 '' and `` John Doe No. 2 '' -- are part of a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Virginia against Prince on behalf of Iraqi families who say they lost loved ones at the hands of his company .

`` First , he views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe . ... Second , Mr. Prince is motivated by greed , '' says John Doe No. 2 . `` He sought every opportunity to deploy men to Iraq in order to earn more money from the United States government . ''

He refers to another incident when he `` first arrived in Baghdad '' in which he saw fellow employees pulling weapons out of a shipment of dog food -- the allegation being smuggling .

John Doe No. 1 describes witnessing one incident in Baquba , where a Blackwater employee allegedly fired into a passing single-passenger vehicle without provocation . He says he 's heard of similar instances of excessive or deadly force from other Blackwater employees .

The court documents filed Tuesday are in response to a defense motion to dismiss the suit . The suit says the affidavits were also submitted to the Justice Department , which is engaged in an ongoing investigation into the Blackwater case . No criminal charges have been filed against Prince .

`` It is obvious that Plaintiffs have chosen to slander Mr. Prince rather than raise legal arguments or actual facts that will be considered by a court of law . We are happy to engage them there , '' the company statement said . `` We question the judgment of anyone who relies upon and -LSB- reiterates -RSB- anonymous declarations . ''
