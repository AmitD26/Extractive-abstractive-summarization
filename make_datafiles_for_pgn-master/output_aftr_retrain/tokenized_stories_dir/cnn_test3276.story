Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle .

After the president 's speech , Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion . Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama 's .

Alexander has written five books of poetry , including `` American Sublime , '' a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005 . Her father is Clifford Alexander , secretary of the Army in the Carter administration , and her mother teaches history at George Washington University . Her brother is an adviser to Obama 's transition team .

Alexander 's view of poetry is captured in a few lines from `` American Sublime '' -LRB- Graywolf Press -RRB- :

Poetry is what you find / in the dirt in the corner ,

to get from here to there . / Poetry -LRB- and now my voice is rising -RRB-

is not all love , love , love , / and I 'm sorry the dog died .

CNN : You met Barack Obama when you were both teaching at the University of Chicago ?

Alexander : In the community in Hyde Park , he and Mrs. Obama were just people I 'd heard about for a long time and heard wonderful things about , and we were of a generation . ...

He was in the law school , and I was in the Department of English so our day-to-day work did n't really cross so much . ... -LSB- We were in -RSB- the community of people who were at that time in our early 30s , thinking about the different ways that we could contribute to improving things with whatever skills we had -- political skills , intellectual skills , skills in the discipline of law , in literature , artistic skills . That was the common ground , thinking about how we could contribute to bettering our community .

CNN : And you did it by writing ?

CNN : We have this historical moment , the 80th birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King , the inauguration of the first African-American president . How does that resonate with you ?

Alexander : It 's amazing , is n't it ? I just shake my head and say , `` Is n't that something ? '' The civil rights struggle in this country and in the world is not over because we have an African-American president . At the same time , this must be recognized as a tremendous moment in our nation 's history . I ca n't tell you how many older people have said to me , `` I never thought I 'd live to see this day . ''

Alexander : Oh my goodness , so much . There are wars or conflicts in many different places , there are potentially incipient conflicts in different places , there 's the tremendous challenge of the economy . ...

CNN : Can poetry help in that regard ?

Alexander : I do believe that it can . The way in which poetry models precise and mindful language is useful , because after all if we ca n't be precise with language , how can we share ideas ? Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions . You can look straight in front of you and never get any yield to a problem , but if you can look around the back of it or step to the side of it , those are the ways that we experience some movement with calcified problems .

CNN : So you 're going to write a poem about health care ?

Alexander : I show it to my husband -LSB- artist Ficre Ghebreyesus -RSB- , and he is my first , last and best critic .

CNN : You wrote an essay about Gwendolyn Brooks -LSB- the Pulitzer Prize-winning African-American poet -RSB- in which you said that `` the pressure on creative work can be intense for artists who belong to groups still struggling for their fair shake in society . ''

And then later on you said you 've seen your work `` overpraised by narrow-minded white critics '' and `` criticized small-mindedly by more than one black woman elder poet -- the same poets I imagined would be pleased by it . '' Your work is read very differently depending on who 's reading it ?

It reaches people unexpectedly . You really , really ca n't predict who is going to connect with various aspects of your work . That 's been a real gift to me ; it 's made me try not to assume too much about who thinks what and who is able to gain something from work .

CNN : How do they feel about the poem ?

Alexander : Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most , and I mean jazz across the board because that 's an incredibly diverse art , and also I must say , R&B , funk and soul speak very powerfully to me .

CNN : Favorite artists ?

Alexander : Thelonious Monk is quite a favorite artist . Marvin Gaye , John Coltrane , and also the breadth and accomplishment over a career of Duke Ellington .

CNN : And Aretha Franklin ?

Alexander : Can you imagine ? I get to hear her at close range . Boy , that 's going to be my gift for the year .
