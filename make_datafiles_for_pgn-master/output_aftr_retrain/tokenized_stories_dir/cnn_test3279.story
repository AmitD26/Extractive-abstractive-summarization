Steve McNair , former NFL quarterback , was a married father of four when he was killed last summer .

Details of their relationship were revealed in a case summary released by Nashville police Monday .

Though McNair was a married father of four , he was seeing Kazemi and at least one other woman , Leah Ignagni , according to Nashville police . McNair had spent the night at Ignagni 's apartment on July 2 , two nights before he was killed , Ignagni told police .

On the morning of July 4 , Kazemi texted McNair , saying she was stressed and needed money to pay bills .

`` Baby I might have a break down im so stressed , '' Kazemi said in one text message . `` baby i might need to go to the hospital . baby whats wrong w -LRB- ith -RRB- me i can hardly breath -LRB- e -RRB- . ''

Chris Wall , who provided security for McNair and his family , told police he knew about McNair 's relationship with Kazemi . McNair was tired of her calling when he was with his family , Wall said .

Kazemi continued to text McNair throughout the day , asking for money and when she could see him next .

At 4:04 p.m. on July 3 , Kazemi said , `` baby I have to be w -LRB- ith -RRB- u 2nite . I dnt care where . '' The messages continued for more than eight hours before McNair said he was on his way to the condo . He had told Kazemi earlier that he would n't leave the house `` til the kids fall asleep . ''

McNair and Kazemi exchanged a final series of messages early July 4 , when he asked her to leave the front door to the condo open for him .
