`` The Tournament respects Ms. Shahar Peer as a professional tennis player on the Tour and understands her disappointment , '' the organizers wrote in a statement .

`` We do not wish to politicize sports , but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here . ''

This sparked a response from the Sony Ericsson WTA Tour that it could drop Dubai from the World Tennis Tour calendar .

`` I am confident that the Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future , and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term , '' Peer said in a statement on Tuesday .

`` There should be no place for politics or discrimination in professional tennis or indeed any sport . ''

WTA chairman and chief executive officer Larry Scott had said : `` The Sony Ericsson WTA Tour believes very strongly , and has a clear rule and policy , that no host country should deny a player the right to compete at a tournament for which she has qualified by ranking . ''

Scott noted this is not the first time Dubai has taken this type of action .

World No. 6 Venus Williams told The New York Times : `` All the players support Shahar . We are all athletes , and we stand for tennis . ''

On Tuesday in Dubai , Venus rushed to a 6-0 6-1 win over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova whose Russian compatriot and second seed Dinara Safina suffered a shock exit against Virginie Razzano , of France , 6-2 6-4 .
