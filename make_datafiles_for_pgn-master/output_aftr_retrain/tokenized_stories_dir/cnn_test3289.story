First Up : Senate Health Care Plan

AZUZ : First up , the Senate has come up with its plan to reform the U.S. health care system . The proposed bill , released last night . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says it would give health insurance to 30 million more Americans and would cost an estimated $ 849 billion over the next 10 years . Some senators now opposed to the bill are concerned about what it covers and how much it costs . Republicans have threatened to try and block the legislation from being passed . Debate on it could start as soon as Saturday .

Nuclear Fears

AZUZ : No deal ! That 's what Iran seems to be saying about sending some of its nuclear materials to other countries . This plan was worked out at a meeting last month . Iran would send raw nuclear materials to other nations who would make it into nuclear fuel , and then that would go back to Iran to be used in medical facilities . But now , instead of sending out materials and getting them back later as fuel , one Iranian official is saying the country will only swap raw materials for already processed fuel , and the trade would have to happen in Iran . All this is part of the ongoing tension over the Middle Eastern nation 's nuclear program . Iran says it 's only being used for peaceful reasons . But other countries believe Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons .

Terror Trial Debate

AZUZ : Well , there has been a lot of back-and-forth about the Obama Administration 's decision to try a group of suspected 9/11 terrorists in a civilian court in New York City . A lot of people spoke out about this on our blog and in Congress , where Attorney General Eric Holder , who made the decision , talked about it yesterday . Samantha Hayes has our report on that .

SAMANTHA HAYES , CNN CORRESPONDENT : It 's a move that 's sparked a raging debate .

ALICE HOAGLAND , MOTHER OF 9/11 VICTIM : I think I can speak for many 9/11 families when I say that we are heartsick .

HAYES : But Democrats who support the move expressed confidence in the court system and the ability of the city of New York to handle the trials , even though it was the epicenter of the 9/11 attacks .

SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN , -LRB- D -RRB- CALIFORNIA : I happen to believe that New York City is able to handle this in a very professional and definitively legal manner .

HAYES : And Holder said it in no way undermines the administration 's commitment to fighting terror .

HOLDER : We are at war , and we will use every instrument of national power -- civilian , military , law enforcement , intelligence , diplomatic and others -- to win .

HAYES : Holder also told the panel that he is not concerned that a federal court could find the suspected terrorists not guilty . He said he has told prosecutors that these are cases that must be won . For CNN Student News , I 'm Samantha Hayes .

MICHELLE WRIGHT , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mr. VandenHeuval 's social studies classes at Dos Rios Elementary School in Tolleson , Arizona ! Who is the longest-serving member in the history of the U.S. Congress ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Is it : A -RRB- Robert Byrd , B -RRB- Strom Thurmond , C -RRB- Harry Reid or D -RRB- Ted Stevens ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Today is Senator Robert Byrd 's 20,775 th day serving in Congress . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Congressional History

AZUZ : Six years in the House of Representatives ; elected to the U.S. Senate nine terms -- only person ever to do that -- it makes Sen. Byrd 's total time representing residents of West Virginia 51 years so far . Plus , he 's turning 92 tomorrow . As he became the longest-serving member of Congress yesterday , Byrd 's years of service were praised by Democrats and Republicans . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about Sen. Byrd 's love for both the country and the Congress . And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted that many of Byrd 's records will never be broken .

AZUZ : Deja vu in waters off the coast of the African nation of Somalia , when pirates tried to hijack a ship called the Maersk Alabama . If that sounds familiar to you , it 's because that was the same ship that was hijacked back in April . A Navy operation rescued the crew members in that incident . And yesterday , a private security team on board the Maersk kept the attempted hijackers from taking over . When we talk about pirates , we do n't mean `` of the Caribbean . '' These are very dangerous people with guns ; they hold ships for ransom ; they 're very active in this part of the world .

Is this Legit ?

MATT CHERRY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ? The African elephant is the largest animal on land . This one 's true . These animals can grow to be 9 tons ; that 's 18,000 pounds !

DAVID MCKENZIE , CNN CORRESPONDENT : They grow up to be one of Africa 's giants , but like all creatures , they start off pretty small . Dwarfed by their keepers , each orphaned elephant at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has a tragic tale . This is Sala . She 's 6 weeks old . They say her mother died because of starvation in the Kenyan drought . The person who found her gave her cow 's milk , which is extremely harmful to elephants because of the fat . Sala wandered into a tourist camp in Kenya 's Sala National Park , alone and confused . The orphanage scrambled a plane to rescue her .

DAME DAPHNE SHELDRICK , DAVID SHELDRICK WILDLIFE TRUST : Whatever comes in , we have to make space .

MCKENZIE : It takes years to rehabilitate and reintroduce the orphans into the wild . For the keepers , it 's not just a 9 to 5 job .

MCKENZIE : Every three hours , day and night , the keepers mix fortified soy milk for the elephants . It costs $ 900 a month to care for each orphan , so the elephants have to earn their keep . With a slap of sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin , the babies go on parade . They slush and slide for the throngs of tourists who see the fun , but not the heartbreak .

MCKENZIE : So , they hope to lead these infants through their most fragile stage . It could take years before Sala joins a family of wild elephants . In the care of her human family , she might just make it . David McKenzie , CNN , Nairobi , Kenya .

Why did the turkey cross the turnpike ? Who knows -- it 's a turkey . But she does get a lot of looks from people driving by , and she seems to enjoy it !

AZUZ : In fact , you could say Tammy 's gobbling up all the attention . That 's where today 's show hits the road . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .
