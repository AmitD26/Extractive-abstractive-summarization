Brazilian model Mariana Bridi da Costa died Saturday after undergoing multiple amputations .

`` Unfortunately Mari could n't resist any longer . She passed away at 3 a.m. today , '' Henrique Fontes , executive director of Miss World Brazil , said in an e-mail to CNN .

On his blog , Lindgren wrote that he and other friends were going to the hospital .

Da Costa , 20 , had fought a pernicious disease that has ravaged her body and forced doctors to perform the amputations and extract part of her stomach as well as both kidneys .

She had been breathing through a respirator , officials at Dorio Silva Hospital in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo said Friday .

Da Costa suffered from necrosis , or the fast deadening of tissue , caused by septicemia . Septicemia , triggered by a bacterial infection , causes insufficient blood flow that can lead to organ failure .

Doctors decided to amputate first her hands and then her feet after the condition reduced the amount of oxygen being delivered to her limbs .

Just less than one month ago , da Costa was a healthy young woman well on the way to achieving her dream of becoming a world class model .

Thiago Simoes , da Costa 's fiance , said she was on her way to international stardom , signing with prominent model scout Dilson Stein , who brought Brazilian models , including Gisele Bundchen and Luize Altenhofen , to the world stage .

`` All the agencies were very interested in knowing her . I know for a fact that they would have loved her because Mariana is beautiful , '' Stein told Brazil 's Tribuna newspaper .

`` She told me she was praying to stay alive , that she still had a lot to do on this earth , that she wanted to go on with her plans , '' he said .

`` She never dieted , never took pills ... she is a very simple , very warm human being , '' he said .

`` We know a lot about what happens once a patient contracts the illness but we know very little about what causes it , '' said Dr. Greg Martin of Emory University in Atlanta .

Martin said sepsis is a `` response '' to an infection that can cause the immune system to lose its balance .

Men are more susceptible than women , Martin said .

News of da Costa 's condition spread quickly throughout Brazil and then worldwide . A message on her Web site said that the volume of traffic had caused it to crash , and that the site had received more than 15,000 hits in two days .

The message said they had received `` e-mails of solidarity from all corners of the world : Australia , Ukraine , Czech Republic , France , Italy , USA , Russia , etc. ''
