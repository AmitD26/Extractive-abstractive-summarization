Fresh out of high school , she embarked upon a three-week tour of Eastern Canada earlier this month full of hope over her blossoming career and excited to explore the region with a new car and driver 's license .

Mitchell was a `` seasoned naturalist '' well versed in wilderness camping who would n't want the coyotes responsible for her death to be killed , her mother said Thursday .

When she was 15 , Mitchell began vocal lessons with her future producer , Michael Johnston .

`` They saw in her the rarest of the gifts -- an ability to sing not only from the heart , but in a way that transcended her age and experience and became something universal . ''

She was nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by the Canadian Folk Music Awards , which will be awarded in November .

On her Facebook page , she detailed her busy summer performance schedule , describing it as her `` craziest summer yet . ''

In July , she said she took a Greyhound bus to perform in the Young Performers Program at the Winnipeg Folk Festival , her first show west of Ontario , which featured acts including Arlo Guthrie , Neko Case and Elvis Costello .

She played more shows in the Toronto area , relishing the airplay her album was receiving , and worked on songs for her next album , Weitz said .

Yet she managed to return to nature with her aunt , mother and best friend at the family cottage in Owen Sound , Ontario , delighting in its simple joys .

`` Taylor Mitchell 's vocal style and consummate songwriting craft belied her vernal years . Indeed , her songs told the tales of a seeker , a sojourner with a sage wisdom atypical of most , let alone one of such tender years , '' Weitz said .

On her Facebook page , she had begun counting down the days to her East Coast tour in September , saying in a September 18 status update that she was `` feeling the pull of the road . ''

Those closest to her said they 'll derive inspiration from her passion for life .

`` Taylor was my shining light , my baby , my confidante and best friend , '' her mother said . `` I do n't know how to move forward from here but I know that she would want that for me , and I will try to do that in her memory and celebrate her life in the way she lived it -- with passion , commitment and an unbridled loving heart . ''
