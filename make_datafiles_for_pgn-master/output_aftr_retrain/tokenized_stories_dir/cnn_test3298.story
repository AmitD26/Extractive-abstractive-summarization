Hurricane-force winds over the weekend toppled trees , taking power lines with them . Five of the weekend 's deaths were caused by falling trees , authorities said .

Flood warnings were in effect from northern Virginia to southern New Hampshire , the National Weather Service said .

The city of Alexandria , along the Potomac River across from Washington , distributed nearly 800 sandbags to those in low-lying areas that typically are first to see high water . A coffee shop there experienced minor flooding , said Alexandria official Rich Baier .

In Connecticut , the lingering effects of wind and rain from the weekend were apparent just by looking at the streets , according to J.P. McNamara , an iReporter in Fairfield , along the coast .

`` The beach area of Fairfield experienced high tides that flooded streets with ... water and sand on Saturday night , '' McNamara said Monday . `` Many roads are still blocked off because of fallen trees and limbs , and it seems that this occurrence is widespread . ''

`` The way the whole scene looked was just incredible , '' Durosier said Sunday of the damage in the area . `` Power lines were hanging , street signs knocked down , and it was very quiet . ''

Brian DeNicola of Sayreville , New Jersey , said he has opened his home to three friends who do n't have any power or hot water to shower . He said he lost electricity for about an hour Saturday evening and had to use a vacuum to relieve his basement of flooding .

DeNicola said he 's eager for spring 's arrival Saturday .

`` Oh , thank God , it 's almost here , '' he said . `` We 're ready . We 've had it with this stuff . ''
