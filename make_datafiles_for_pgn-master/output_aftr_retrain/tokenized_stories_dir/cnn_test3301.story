U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker had decided to allow the proceedings to be taped , then aired on YouTube . But as the trial was set to begin Monday morning , the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order blocking its broadcast .

If they can view the Prop 8 trial via YouTube , they will be surprised by what they see : a decision-making process devoid of politics , in which a thoughtful and unbiased judge asks hard questions of both sides ' lawyers in search of legal rules reflecting neutral principles , not political fiat .

Legitimacy matters . If , in the end , Judge Walker upholds Prop 8 , rejecting challenges to its constitutionality , opponents of the law will feel angry and aggrieved -- to put it mildly . But if they have viewed the trial online , they are less likely to feel victimized in a process that was politically rigged .

Defenders of Prop 8 are against broadcasting the trial because they believe it would infringe on their right to a fair trial . They claim that release of videos on YouTube would expose participants to harassment .

The concern about harassment is not trivial . Some financial contributors to the Prop 8 campaign were harassed following voter approval of the law in November 2008 .

Much as I disagree with their position on same-sex marriage , harassment infringes their First Amendment right to participate in the political process .

In any case , most trial participants are people who , because of their prominence in the electoral campaign , have chosen to have a high public profile on same-sex marriage . They expect to be recognized and identified with this issue . They have , or should have , thick skins .

Their First Amendment right to join the political fray must be balanced against the public 's First Amendment right to know what transpires in the courtroom . There is no secret justice in the American judicial system .

Courts must be open to assure the parties receive a fair trial and to give the public the necessary confidence that the laws are applied justly .

To be sure , the First Amendment does n't require public access to include television broadcast or online distribution . But when judges exercise their discretion to open their courtrooms to cameras , that choice should be upheld .

Let 's hope the Supreme Court quickly rescinds its order blocking online distribution of the Prop 8 trial video .
