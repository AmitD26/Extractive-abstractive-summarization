`` Investigators are now working to determine how the remains came to be in this particular location , cause and time of death , and identifying who was responsible for the remains being there , '' Geller said in a news release .

More information is expected after the completion of an autopsy , the spokeswoman added .

Police said skeletal remains were found Tuesday morning by a farmer driving a tractor through a hay field on his 700-acre farm . The area has no public access point , police said .

The farm is about 10 miles from where the concert was being held .

`` I looked down and saw what looked like a human skull , and my first thought was that it was Morgan Harrington , '' Dass told WTVR , adding that he immediately called 911 .

There was significant evidence leading police to believe that the remains are Harrington 's , Virginia State Police Col. W. Steven Flaherty said , though he declined to specify what the evidence was .

Gil Harrington expressed concerns Saturday that there was beginning to be complacency in the search , she wrote in a blog on the Web site set up to help find their daughter .

On Sunday , more than three months after Morgan went missing , Gil Harrington still clung to hope .

`` Despite the length of time Morgan has been gone I remain hopeful , '' she wrote . `` Part of me is waiting to be surprised . Waiting for God to pull the rabbit out of the hat and bring Morgan home .

`` I remember that the light always returns , it can not help but return . Will the light of my life return soon ? I can not imagine that all the water of Morgan 's potential is to run down the drain and be wasted . Can it really play out like that ? ''

During the concert , Harrington left her friends to use the restroom , police said . When she did not return , they called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. . She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy , police said , but told them not to worry about her and that she would find a ride home .

There are restrooms inside the arena , police said , and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside . Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone , police said .

About 9:30 p.m. that night , witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington 's description walking on a nearby bridge , police said . No further sightings were reported .

Harrington 's purse , with her identification and cell phone inside , was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena , police said . A friend had driven Harrington 's car to the concert , she said , and was still in possession of the car keys when they got separated .

Working with police and the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center , the Harringtons organized community searches , saying they would not give up hope that their daughter would be found .

Harrington said he reached out to Smart last week to seek advice on how to go through the disappearance of a child .

Harrington was wearing a black Pantera T-shirt , a black miniskirt , black tights and black boots when last seen .
