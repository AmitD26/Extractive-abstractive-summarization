The term `` Republican leadership '' has become the biggest oxymoron in politics . If we learned one thing from Republicans ' elections , it 's that their leadership simply follows their tea party base in an unceasing march to the right .

Following their losses at the ballot box in 2012 , Republicans rolled out a post-mortem calling for a move to the middle , recognizing that their days as a competitive national party were numbered if they continued on their current rightward path .

Since then , we have seen Republicans across the country do the exact opposite . They have grown more paranoid , more insular and more fearful . It 's that fear of the tea party that shut down the government to disastrous consequences last year , and it 's that fear that just caused them to replace one leader of the Republican shutdown with another .

Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise are members of the same tea party club and were elected on pledges of fealty to the tea party agenda . And that agenda will keep turning off the American public , dragging their ratings down and dragging Republicans further and further outside the mainstream .

The tragedy is that the middle class pays the price .

Take immigration as an example . Just 19 % of tea party Republicans believe immigration helps the United States , compared to 47 % of the country at large . With House Republicans beholden to this tiny minority of the country at large , they will continue to drag their party to the right â € '' and their so-called leadership will have no choice but to follow , if they want to keep their jobs .

You can change the names on the door , but the out-of-touch agenda remains the same . If the country is to have any hope of combating the serious challenges facing us and creating an economy that works to lift up middle-class families , we need more than just a change of figureheads in the House .
