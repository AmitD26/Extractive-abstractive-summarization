Australian Open champion Federer is set to be sidelined for up to six weeks and may not return to action until a big hard court event in the United States in March .

Federer , who won his 16th grand slam when beating Britain 's Andy Murray in Melbourne , has been advised by a doctor not to play for at least a fortnight .

He is set to play at the Masters Series event at Indian Wells which starts on March 11 , but may have to wait until the following tournament in Miami .

`` There are no guarantees that I will play at Indian Wells -- this could be a maximum of six weeks , but if it 's treated properly everything should be fine and I should be back fairly quickly , '' he told the official ATP Tour Web site .

Federer , who is a four-time Dubai Open champion , had traveled to the United Arab Emirates to practice ahead of the tournament , but found he was struggling .

`` The doctors say it 's too serious for me to try -- and that I should rest for at least two weeks -- obviously I ca n't take any more chances . ''

Federer , who has a home in Dubai , was looking to regain his title from Novak Djokovic , who will now be top seed , with Murray also in the field for his first tournament since Australia .
