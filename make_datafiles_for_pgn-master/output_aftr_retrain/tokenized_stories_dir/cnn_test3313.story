-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The city councils in two of Arizona 's largest cities have voted to file suit over the state 's controversial new immigration law , which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency .

The Tucson City Council voted 5-1 to file suit , and the city council in Flagstaff approved a similar measure 7-0 . Both votes occurred Tuesday .

Members of the Phoenix Suns basketball team , meanwhile , plan to wear jerseys that say `` Los Suns '' in a playoff game Wednesday as `` a way for our team and our organization to honor our Latino community , '' managing partner Robert Sarver said in a statement .

Opposition to the law continued Wednesday , with some civil rights and labor organizations saying they will announce a boycott Thursday .

Joining in Thursday 's announcement will be the National Council of La Raza , which bills itself as the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States ; the Asian American Justice Center ; the Center for Community Change ; the Service Employees International Union ; and the United Food and Commercial Workers , the groups said in a release .

Critics say the law will lead to racial profiling . Brewer and others who support the law say it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts .

The city councils said they passed the measures because of concerns over enforcement costs and negative effects on Arizona 's tourism industry . Opponents of the immigration law have called for a boycott of Arizona tourism and urge that no one engage in any commerce with businesses located in the state .

`` This bill opens the door to racial profiling , and it puts Latinos in Arizona in automatic suspect mode , '' Romero said .

Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup said up to 38 percent of retail sales in the city come from legal Mexican visitors .

The Organization of American States expressed its concern about the law last week , and presidents of South American countries meeting in Argentina for a gathering of the Union of South American Nations condemned the law Tuesday .
