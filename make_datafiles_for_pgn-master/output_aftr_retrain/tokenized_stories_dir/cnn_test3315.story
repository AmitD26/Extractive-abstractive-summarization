Mohammed Ajmal Kasab , a Pakistani , was convicted on Monday of murder , conspiracy , and waging war on India . He was sentenced to death on five separate counts , and life imprisonment on five others .

Kasab is the only man to have been sentenced in connection with the three-day siege in November 2008 . During the raids , 10 men attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels , the city 's Victoria Terminus train station , and the Jewish cultural center , Chabad House .

Kasab was photographed holding an assault weapon during the attacks .

Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization , which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India 's parliament . The group denied responsibility .

Two Indian nationals accused of conspiracy were acquitted in the trial .

The prosecutor said he would fight their acquittals .
