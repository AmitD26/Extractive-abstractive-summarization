During her speech , Palin ripped abortion rights opponents in the Democratic Party who `` promised to hold firm '' during the health care debate , but ultimately backed `` the most pro-abortion president who ever occupied the White House . ''

Palin mentioned , among other things , her daughter Bristol 's decision not to have an abortion after becoming pregnant at age 17 . `` It was an embarrassing time for her , '' Palin told the audience . But `` choosing life was the right road . ''

Palin said national media coverage of the pregnancy `` kind of made it rough '' on Bristol and sent a not-too-subtle message to other young women that it 's easier to choose to have an abortion .

In addition , she will travel South Carolina to endorse GOP state Rep. Nikki Haley for governor . The state 's scandal-tarred Republican governor , Mark Sanford , is term-limited and will leave office in January .

`` It is a tremendous honor to receive Gov. Palin 's endorsement , '' Haley said in a statement released Thursday . `` Sarah Palin has energized the conservative movement like few others in our generation . ''

Palin has also endorsed , among others , former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina in California 's GOP Senate primary .

Palin is set to release a new book in November -- `` America By Heart : Reflections on Family , Faith , and Flag . '' Her first book , `` Going Rogue , '' was a national bestseller .

Palin has become one of the GOP 's biggest stars since being tapped as Sen. John McCain 's running mate during the 2008 presidential race . In addition to being an author , Palin has become a sought-after speaker and a contributor on Fox News .
