Editor 's note : Jim Rogers is chief executive officer of Charlotte , North Carolina-based Duke Energy , which generates much of its power from coal-burning plants and is making investments in clean energy technology in China . Jonathan Lash is the president of the World Resources Institute . Ming Sung is Asia Pacific representative of the Clean Air Task Force .

China is the largest producer of solar water heaters , with 50 percent of the world 's production and 65 percent of all installations .

Although there has been much talk about creating `` green jobs '' in the United States , China leads the world with its massive investment in energy efficiency and renewable power .

China produces 80 percent of its electricity from coal and now leads the world in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants .

Although the United States has made great strides in reducing pollution in recent decades , we are still the world 's second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions , with emissions per capita four times higher than China 's .

Our nation is also heavily dependent on coal and imported oil . We are moving ahead in solar energy , wind and efficiency , but we are doing so in a fragmented , state-by-state approach that reflects our democracy and regulatory structures .

We will not climb this ladder overnight but one rung at a time .

With the United Nations ' climate change conference in Copenhagen , Denmark , just two months away , it is imperative that our two nations establish a more trusting , give-and-take relationship upon which good business partnerships are built .

The World Resources Institute , the Clean Air Task Force and Duke Energy have started this work , with great prospects for results .

WRI , an independent , non-partisan environmental research organization , is working with China to calculate its greenhouse emissions as a key part of its next national Five-Year Plan to advance its economy .

The intent is to develop reportable and verifiable measures in the plan that could facilitate China 's participation in an international climate agreement .

The Clean Air Task Force -- an environmental organization advancing clean technology in the United States and China -- is pivotal to Duke Energy efforts .

It has created a network of a dozen Chinese and U.S. companies to develop joint business ventures to build advanced , low-carbon coal technology in China and around the world .

This network is expanding to include an array of other renewable and clean energy technologies .

Historically , Americans have known little about China and , at times , are justifiably concerned about its growing power and influence .

This is changing as our trading and financial interdependencies grow .

Today , China is the largest exporter to the United States and the largest holder of U.S. debt . It is clearly not beneficial to either country to turn back the clock .

There always will be healthy competition between China and the United States in developing and marketing technologies , but we must work closely together to scale up and commercialize the best ideas , regardless of whether it comes from our two nations or other countries in Europe or Asia or North America .

China and the United States bring extraordinary and complementary skills to the table .

The sooner we get to work on achieving proposed congressional targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , the less expensive addressing climate change will ultimately be .

If the United States and China can come together to lead on addressing climate change , the rest of world will follow .

To make this relationship work , each country should leave fear and timidity at the door , put economic self-interest to work and forge the strategic partnerships necessary to get the job done .
