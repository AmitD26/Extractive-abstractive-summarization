PHOENIX , Arizona -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thirty-year-old Lisa Locascio is walking through what she hopes will soon be her new living room .

`` The carpet 's clearly trashed , but that 's going to get ripped out , '' she says .

She 's excited to become a first-time homebuyer and has been shopping exclusively for foreclosed homes in the Phoenix , Arizona , area for several weeks now .

`` It 's the American dream , '' Locascio says of home ownership , and she 's just zeroed in on the one she wants to be hers . She has a bid in and is waiting to hear on her offer .

Program watch dogs are keeping their eyes on states like Arizona to see how the money will be spent and whether it will make a difference .

Arizona had the fourth highest rate of new foreclosures in May , according to Realty Trac .

With such a high foreclosure rate , the funds allocated to Arizona , and in particular the Phoenix area , were significant .

However , not one home in Phoenix has been purchased using the NSP funds despite hundreds of applications . People are still trying to navigate an unfamiliar process , housing experts in Phoenix say .

Locascio would be thrilled to be the first person to close on a home . She is single and works as a project manager at a Scottsdale asset management company . However , she currently has no savings . After recently providing financial assistance to a relative -- a move that depleted her bank account -- Locascio admits she never thought she 'd be able to afford a home of her own any time soon . She 's unable to meet the 3.5 percent down payment required for the most affordable government-backed home loans ; therefore , she had resigned herself to paying rent until she was able to recoup her savings .

`` My Realtor filled me in on it , and then I did some research on it and decided that would probably be the best route to take , '' Locascio says . The program is limited to applicants with incomes between $ 55,350 and $ 104,400 , depending on family size , according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development . The income limits vary from region to region .

Applicants must also complete eight hours of financial counseling and courses in budgeting and home ownership , and be able to invest $ 1,000 of their own money . Under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program , HUD requires the lender to give buyers a 15 % discount below the appraised value and the loan must be paid back in full when the homeowner sells the home or refinances . Lenders are not required , however , to accept a discounted offer .

Connolly has been in the Phoenix real estate market for about nine years and has seen the disastrous real estate downturn up close . He hopes to soon see more clients using NSP funding .

`` It 's just kind of coming out now that people are understanding it 's there . I do n't think they have done a very big promotion ... put it on billboards or anything like that to say , ` Hey , this is available to you , ' '' Connolly said . Until now , Connolly said , Internet-savvy house hunters have had to discover the program on their own .

Experts want to caution those who think the Neighborhood Stabilization Program will solve Phoenix 's devastated real estate market .

John Smith , president of Mesa , Arizona-based Housing Our Communities , a nonprofit that helps people find affordable housing , says that wo n't happen .

`` We have to identify those goals , those strategies and those resources that are going to make a difference , '' he says . `` This is not , in and of itself , going to do that . ''

He compares the program to a Band-Aid , cautioning , `` It is only one tool ... we 're going to have to find some other solutions to stabilize these communities . ''

Nonprofit housing assistance programs such as Smith 's are available in many cities across the country to educate and counsel prospective home buyers and inform them of available assistance . However , Smith cautions it 's not just about quick ownership .

`` We just do n't want houses to be bought and sold . We want families to invest and develop affordable , sustainable home ownership throughout the community . '' Smith urges patience and warns it will take full cooperation for all sectors to turn the housing crisis around .

Less than 24 hours after submitting her bid , Locascio received a call from the bank . After watching the property sit foreclosed and idle on the market for almost two months , she was informed that someone else beat her bid by only a few hours . Despite the funding assistance , Locascio quickly learned there are no assurances or guarantees in the federally funded home buying process . She later found two more places she likes and placed bids on them .
