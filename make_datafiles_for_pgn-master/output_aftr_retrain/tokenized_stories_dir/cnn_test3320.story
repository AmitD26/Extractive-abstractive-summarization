`` Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease , disability and death , '' an FDA official said .

The FDA said Chantix and Zyban will carry the warnings to alert consumers to the risks of depression and suicidal thoughts when using the drugs .

The drugs also have been reported to cause changes in behavior , hostility and agitation in users , whether users had a history of psychiatric illness or not . In many cases , side effects started shortly after use began and ended when the medication was stopped . The FDA does not know what is causing the changes and said people taking these products should be monitored by their doctor .

`` The labeling update underscores the important role of health care providers in treating smokers attempting to quit and provides specific information about Chantix and instructions that physicians and patients should follow closely , '' said Dr. Briggs W. Morrison , senior vice president of the primary care development group at Pfizer . `` Quitting smoking is one of the best things people can do for their health , but the quitting process is both difficult and complex . ''

Zyban contains the same active ingredient as the antidepressant Wellbutrin and already carried a box warning about the increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior .

Neither Chantix nor Zyban contains nicotine , and the FDA said some symptoms could be the result of nicotine withdrawal . Still , the agency said , people using these drugs experienced some of these symptoms while they were still smoking .

In a review of side effects in patients using the nicotine patch , the agency said it did n't find a clear link between those products and suicidal events .
