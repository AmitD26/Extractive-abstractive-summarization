-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Finland has become the first country in the world to declare broadband Internet access a legal right .

The move by Finland is aimed at bringing Web access to rural areas , where access has been limited .

Starting in July , telecommunication companies in the northern European nation will be required to provide all 5.2 million citizens with Internet connection that runs at speeds of at least 1 megabit per second .

The one-megabit mandate , however , is simply an intermediary step , said Laura Vilkkonen , the legislative counselor for the Ministry of Transport and Communications .

Finland is one of the most wired in the world ; about 95 percent of the population have some sort of Internet access , she said . But the law is designed to bring the Web to rural areas , where geographic challenges have limited access until now .

It is a view shared by the United Nations , which is making a big push to deem Internet access a human right .

In June , France 's highest court declared such access a human right . But Finland goes a step further by legally mandating speed .
