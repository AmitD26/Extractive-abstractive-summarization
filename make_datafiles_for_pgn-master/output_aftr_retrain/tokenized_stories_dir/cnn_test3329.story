Cameron , however , said he is opposed to a British government investigation into the release .

The two leaders also said they addressed a range of issues in talks at the White House , including the war in Afghanistan , sanctions against Iran , the state of the global economy and the responsibilities of BP -- a British company -- after the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .

`` We can never say it enough . The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy a truly special relationship , '' Obama said . `` We celebrate a common heritage . We cherish common values . ... -LRB- And -RRB- above all , our alliance thrives because it advances our common interests . ''

The meeting was part of Cameron 's first U.S. visit as Britain 's leader . The two men met with reporters shortly after huddling behind closed doors .

The 1988 bombing killed 270 people .

The Scottish government has insisted that BP never lobbied to free al Megrahi .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and four U.S. senators from New York and New Jersey have called for Britain to revisit the case , even though there is little chance that al Megrahi will be returned to custody from his native Libya . Cameron was scheduled to meet with the senators during his visit to Washington .

Obama said most Americans were `` surprised , disappointed and angry '' about the decision to let al Megrahi go . `` We should have all the facts , '' he added . `` They should be laid out there . '' The decision `` ran contrary to how we should be treating terrorists . ''

Obama has pushed for the need for greater stimulus spending in the short term while addressing deficits as more of a long-term issue ; Cameron entered office pledging the enactment of immediate austerity measures . In keeping with those measures , his office said earlier , the prime minister flew on a commercial flight to Washington .

While their different approaches to the economic crisis underscore their different political orientations , Obama and Cameron , according to many observers , also have a great deal in common .

Among other things , they 're a similar age -- Cameron is 43 and Obama is 48 -- and they both campaigned on the slogan of hope and change . Cameron came to power in May in a historic change of government in the United Kingdom , about 18 months after Obama made history with his own election as the United States ' first African-American president .

The two men bet a bottle of beer on the outcome of the USA-England soccer match in the first round of the World Cup , and exchanged bottles in a lighthearted event when the teams tied 1-1 in June .
