That all appeared to come to an end on Tuesday , when Israel and Hamas militants agreed to an open-ended truce -- and talks .

Here 's what you need to know about the Egyptian-negotiated agreement that appears to have halted the fighting between Israelis and Hamas militants .

As part of easing the blockade , Israel will also extend the fishing limit off the coast of Gaza to six miles , the official said .

Both sides agree to return to Cairo for further , indirect talks -- as Israel and Hamas refuse to meet face to face .

If the ceasefire holds , the two sides have agreed to begin talks four weeks from now on a broader range of issues , including the Israeli release of Palestinians -- primarily Hamas members -- arrested during the conflict and the construction of a seaport in Gaza , according to published reports in state-run media .

The talks will also address Israel 's demand for the demilitarization of Gaza .

While Hamas spokesman Fawhi Barhoum declared before a cheering crowd in Gaza that the truce was `` a day of victories for our people , '' there is little sign that either side got what it wanted .

The agreement between Israel and the Palestinians broke no new ground .

According to Beinart , who has long covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict : `` After all this terrible , terrible bloodshed and trauma on both sides , it looks like we are back to where we were at the beginning . ''

What was the cost ?

The cost can be measured in lives lost , but also in the economic and political fallout .

More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the conflict . The United Nations estimates that more than 70 % were civilians .

Sixty-seven Israelis -- 64 of them soldiers -- have been killed , the United Nations reports . A foreign worker in Israel was killed as well .

The fighting displaced more than 500,000 Palestinians , according to the United Nations , and left thousands of homes damaged . It 's not exactly clear how much money the fighting cost both sides , but observers have put the number in the billions of dollars .

Given the toll the conflict has taken , there is also likely to be some kind of political fallout .

The popularity of Hamas has been on the decline since it took control of the Palestinian Parliament in 2006 . Given the length and toll of this conflict , there is a question of whether Palestinians will hold Hamas accountable for it .

In any talks , Palestinians are likely to include a demand that Egypt lift its blockade of Gaza dating back to 2007 .
