-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three Iranian prison officials have been charged with murder after three imprisoned protesters were beaten to death in the aftermath of the country 's disputed presidential election , Iranian media reported Saturday .

The judiciary also blamed the prison 's medical shortcomings and sub-par conditions as factors in the men 's deaths .

Iranian media first reported the three protesters ' deaths nearly two weeks after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's supreme leader , ordered the Kahrizak facility shut down amid reports of prisoner mistreatment . In the wake of the deaths , authorities fired and arrested Kahrizak 's warden .

The three protesters were among some 4,000 people arrested in connection with protests following the June 12 presidential election . Thousands of Iranians demonstrated against the official result of the vote , which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .

The government said he won by a landslide , but his opponents accused officials of rigging the results .

Putting the prison officials on trial is an attempt by the government to build credibility and maintain public order , some scholars say . But , they argue , it 's a political move that will likely fail .

`` Ayatollah Khamenei will be the loser no matter what happens , '' said Ali Alfoneh , a research fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute who has researched the relationship between Iranian civilians and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard .

He said the guards would likely be prosecuted in a `` show trial , '' noting that the Iranian government has orchestrated such trials in the past by giving in to public demands for accountability , but without holding high-ranking officials responsible for their roles in any wrongdoing .

Another expert described the defendants as `` scapegoats . ''

Amid earlier reports of prisoner mistreatment at Kahrizak , Khamenei ordered the facility shut down . Nearly two weeks later , Iranian media reported the deaths of the protesters . In the wake of the deaths , authorities fired and arrested Kahrizak 's warden .

When Gen. Esmaeel Ahmadi Moghadam , commander of Iran 's security forces , announced the arrest of the warden , he also said no one died at Kahrizak from physical abuse and that the inmates died from illnesses . The coroner later disputed that claim .

The bereaved father announced on Khamenei 's Web site in September that he was satisfied with how the government was handling the case .

But the trial will not help Khamenei 's relationship with the public , Alfoneh said .

`` Regardless of what the father says or does not say , the person responsible is Khamenei , '' Alfoneh said . `` Whatever he does , he has lost this case . ''
