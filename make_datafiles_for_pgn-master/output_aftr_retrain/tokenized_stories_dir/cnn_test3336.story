It was the first goals of the season for Adebayor and a reminder of his talents to manager Roberto Mancini with City heavily linked with a move for Manchester United 's star striker Wayne Rooney in the January transfer window .

Rooney would be reunited with Carlos Tevez should he choose to join United 's city rivals , the Argentine rested by Mancini for Thursday 's match against spirited Polish opposition .

Adebayor put City two-up early in the first half , but Lech hit back through Joel Tshibamba just after the break and had chances to equalize before the striker sealed victory with his third goal late in the second half after being set up by the excellent David Silva .

England winger Adam Johnson nearly scored a superb individual fourth , but the night belonged to Adebayor , who might have also added to his tally .

The win sees them top of Group A ahead of Lech , with Juventus in third after their 1-1 draw in Salzburg .

Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson , under pressure after their dismal start to the English Premier League season , fielded an inexperienced side lacking Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres and they did him proud .

With five points from three games , they remain top and favorites to qualify from Group K

Falcao hit the opener and Hulk scored the other two goals before Bobo netted a consolation for the hosts .

Spain 's Sevilla are chasing PSG in second in a tough group , one point behind , after a 1-0 win at Karpaty Lviv with Frederic Kanoute scoring the winner .
