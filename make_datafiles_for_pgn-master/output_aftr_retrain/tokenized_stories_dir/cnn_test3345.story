At first , Yoko Ono herself did n't realize the significance of that date . `` I do n't think about age so much , '' she tells `` Rolling Stone '' . `` But I was getting messages from all corners of the world : ` We 're celebrating John 's birthday as a tribute to him . ' I said , ` What is going on here ? ' It seems like with 70 , there 's an explosion -LSB- of sentiment -RSB- . ''

Over the next two months , Lennon 's birthday will be commemorated with tribute concerts , reissues , a new documentary , the annual lighting of Ono 's Imagine Peace light tower , even an Ono-Lady Gaga summit . Why is all this happening now ? `` The reason has to do with the social climate , with wanting some of John 's energy , power and conviction , '' says Ono .

Documentary on the New York Years

`` LENNONYC , '' which premiered at the New York Film Festival September 25 and will debut on PBS November 22 , focuses exclusively on the last decade of Lennon 's life , from the time he and Ono moved to New York in 1971 until his death in 1980 . `` New York offered him a chance to disconnect from the shackles of the Beatles , '' says director Michael Epstein . `` It allowed him to be John Lennon and not Beatle John . It offered simple freedoms , like going to Burger King and buying a Whopper , which he liked to do . '' The film explores Lennon 's immersion in the city 's downtown arts scene and his raucous rock & roll work with Elephant 's Memory , as well as the depression that followed the critical drubbing of his `` Some Time in New York City '' album and 1972 Madison Square Garden concert -LRB- which is seen here in newly restored footage -RRB- . It also covers his `` lost weekend '' in Los Angeles , reconciliation with Ono and the creation of `` Double Fantasy '' . Epstein says Ono had to stop and start several times while talking about Lennon 's death , but she gave her blessing to the film nonetheless . `` It 's ` Gim me Some Truth , ' as John put it , so it 's fine , '' Ono says . `` Let it all hang out there . ''

`` John Lennon Signature Box ''

This independently-made U.K. movie takes an unexpected focus : It 's a biopic concerned solely with Lennon 's teenage years in Liverpool . The film , which is based on a memoir by Lennon 's half sister Julia , hinges on the relationship between the future Beatle ; his guardian , Aunt Mimi ; and his free-spirited mother , Julia , who abandoned Lennon at four and then reappeared when he was 15 . `` It 's a love triangle that happens to be about John Lennon , '' says director Sam Taylor-Wood . `` There were two strong women then -- and that -LSB- dynamic -RSB- played out throughout his life . ''
