In the Senate , where the procedural power of the minority has already given Republicans the power to shape deliberations , the narrowed Democratic ranks will further weaken the majority .

In the weeks running up to the election , there were some commentators who concluded that the current situation would be the best outcome for President Obama .

Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico said , `` I do see a similarity to the Clinton experience . The divided government result , if it happens , is good for the president , because he now has some potential enemies but he also has some potential partners to get things done where he did n't have them before . ''

Republicans conducted a series of investigations into the Clinton administration , which consumed an enormous amount of time and political energy from the White House . The investigations culminated in Clinton 's impeachment proceedings .

The partisan battles took their toll . While Osama bin Laden and his minions were preparing to attack the United States , Washington was engaged in bitter partisan wars over Clinton 's relationship with an intern . As the historian Steve Gillon recounted , the partisanship also drowned a secret effort by Gingrich and Clinton to reach a bipartisan pact on Social Security reform .

The 2000 election revealed how divided the parties had become . Democrats and Republicans squared off in the courts after questions about the vote in Florida , making the electoral process itself fair game in the scandal wars taking place between the parties .

Divided government will make a fragile legislative process even more difficult to maneuver . Although political scientists have shown how important legislation has passed in periods of divided government , it is unclear how this model holds up in recent times .

There was not much legislative progress on big issues such as Social Security or health care reform in the second half of the 1990s . These years were not some high point in policymaking . In fact , it was just the opposite . Most key issues were pushed aside .

The situation will only be worse today . The intensified partisan polarization that exists in today 's never-ending campaign cycle makes it even more difficult for the parties to reach deals on major issues . With the exodus of moderate Democrats as a result of Republican victories , the parties in Congress will move farther apart . The 24-hour polarized media will fuel the conflict and facilitate scandal warfare .

So if Obama attacks the Congress for failing to produce results , voters will not only turn to see the face of Speaker John Boehner but they also will see whoever ends up as leader of the Senate Democrats . This makes the argument hard to sell .

We should hope that the United States is not about to live through a repeat performance of what occurred after 1994 . The nation faces too many pressing economic and foreign policy problems to have that happen again .
