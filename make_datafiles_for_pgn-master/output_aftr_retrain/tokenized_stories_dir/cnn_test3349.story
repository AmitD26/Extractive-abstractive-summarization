CNN -RRB- -- Samir Nasri scored two superb goals to give Arsenal a 2-1 win in a London derby against Fulham to go top of the English Premier League on Saturday .

Chelsea looked set to be the beneficiary as Didier Drogba 's penalty put them ahead at Stamford Bridge against Everton .

Carlo Ancelotti 's men have won only once in six games and have seen United and Arsenal leapfrog them in the standings .

Arsenal have 32 points from 16 games , one clear of United , who have played a game less , and two ahead of faltering Chelsea .

Manchester City are also taking closer order in the title race with a 1-0 home win over Bolton giving them 29 points from 16 games .

Carlos Tevez gave them a fourth minute lead at Eastlands but they had Aleksandar Kolarov sent off in the second half and had to battle hard for the three points .

But Nasri put Arsenal ahead again with 15 minutes left as he took advantage of a layoff from Robin van Persie to beat a defender and then visiting goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer with another flash of individual brilliance .

Gunners manager Arsene Wenger singled him out after his ninth league goal of the season .

In other games , Blackburn beat Wolves , who are now bottom , 3-0 to bounce back from their 7-1 defeat last weekend to Manchester United . Wigan and Stoke drew 2-2 .
