A young American living in the United Arab Emirates has been imprisoned since April , his family says , for posting what was intended to be a funny video on the Internet .

The video depicts a look at a `` combat school '' in the suburb of Satwa , where these `` gangsters '' are trained . The training includes how to throw sandals at targets , using clothing accessories as whips , and how to call on the phone for backup .

UAE authorities did not respond to CNN requests for details about what charges Cassim may be facing and why .

`` It 's just a straightforward silly comedy video . And he 's being treated like some sort of dangerous criminal , high security criminal that they need to keep under maximum security conditions , '' Shervon Cassim told KARE about his brother .

Shez Cassim has lost a lot of weight , but is otherwise in good physical condition , his brother told CNN .

Cassim , from Woodbury , Minnesota , moved to Dubai in 2006 after graduating college to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers .

He and some friends made and posted the video online in 2012 . He was arrested in April 2013 .

The U.S. State Department is providing consular services to Cassim , a department official said , and has attended all his court hearings .

`` The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General have engaged with UAE counterparts to urge a fair and expedient trial and judgment , '' the official said .

The Satwa G 's , the family said in a statement , were known as wanna-be gangsters , and that 's how Cassim portrayed them .

`` These ` gangstas ' were known for their decidedly mild behavior and were seen as the total opposite of actual criminals , '' the statement said . `` The fictional training depicted in the video teaches techniques that include the best way to throw a sandal at a newspaper -LRB- target -RRB- and , ultimately , how to use the mobile phone when in trouble . ''

At the last hearing , the judge in the case asked for an Arabic translation of the video , giving the family some hope that the authorities will realize that it was a parody .

`` I just want my son home for Christmas , '' said Cassim 's mother , Jean Cassim , in a statement . `` He 's a good young man with a great career and has never been in trouble . Now he 's being held for no reason . I 've been praying , going to mass and lighting candles , and that 's what I 'm going to keep doing . ''
