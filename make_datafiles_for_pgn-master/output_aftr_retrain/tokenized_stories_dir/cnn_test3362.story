-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker , a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp .

Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed , and investigators are looking for him , police say .

Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court , said Jim Gavin , spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State .

Heritage Wealth Management , Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are `` the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division , '' Gavin said . Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers , Indiana .

A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31 , Gavin said .

Schrenker , 38 , took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane , a Piper PA-46 , from Anderson , Indiana , en route to Destin , Florida . Authorities said the Fisher , Indiana , businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle .

The craft came down near the Blackwater River , only 50 to 75 yards from homes , said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff 's Office . Watch more about the mysterious flight ''

Military aircraft from Whiting Field , which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency , witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT. . The crews fired flares and noticed the plane 's door was open and the cockpit was dark , Haines said in a news release . They got no response .

The Childersburg , Alabama , Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m. , `` and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends , '' a news release said . Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham .

Hotel manager Yogi Patel , who identified Schrenker on surveillance video , told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight . He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook , Illinois , Patel said .

Steve Darlington , manager of Anderson Municipal Airport , told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff , and said Schrenker is `` an accomplished pilot '' who owns `` a couple of airplanes '' and flies regularly .

No agency has come forward to lead the probe .

`` The FBI is looking into the matter , along with other agencies , '' said Paul Draymond , of the Birmingham FBI office .

Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane , and made a video featured on a YouTube site . A message preceding the video warns , `` No pilot should attempt this stunt . You will get yourself killed . Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows . ''
