Milan , Italy -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judge in Italy is set to announce whether Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will face an immediate trial on charges of abuse of power and sex with an underage prostitute .

Prosecutors in Milan filed the request for trial last week , setting in motion a five-day clock for Judge Cristina di Censo to make a decision .

She can order the trial to go ahead without the traditional preliminary hearing , as Milan chief prosecutor Edmundo Bruti Liberati requested , or dismiss it , allowing investigations to continue to determine if there is enough evidence for trial .

She can also refer the case to another jurisdiction , or request one more day to make her decision .

Thousands of Italians took to the streets across the country Sunday to protest Berlusconi 's alleged behavior toward women .

The largest gathering was in Rome , where organizers said 100,000 people gathered , under the slogan , `` If not now , when ? ''

In Milan , organizers estimated that 60,000 people gathered .

Sunday 's demonstrations were the biggest anti-Berlusconi rallies since the most recent sex scandal broke .

Berlusconi has denied that he has ever paid anyone for sex .

The protests were organized by women 's groups and publicized by internet . The turnout surprised the organizers , who did n't want the demonstrations to be political , though that 's what they became .

One woman who came with her family to the Milan rally told CNN that she was `` fed up with the way women are portrayed as objects in the Italian media . The way that young girls are glorified by their looks and youth and then what ? I do n't want my daughter to grow up thinking that that is the only way to be ... that the only thing that matters is to be pretty and show off their legs . ... We are more than that . ''

Many of the speakers at the Milan rally criticized the way Berlusconi 's sex scandal made Italy look , his behavior towards women and his promoting ex-show girls to high government positions .

Protesters said leaked evidence from the investigation show he has little respect for female dignity , the state-run ANSA news agency reported .

Wiretaps published in the media suggest he surrounded himself at parties at his home with starlets and other women hoping to use their looks to gain positions in politics or at Berlusconi 's Mediaset TV empire , ANSA reported .

Prosecutors say the activity took place from February until May 2010 . Both El Mahrough , now 18 , and Berlusconi have denied they ever had sex .

Berlusconi 's party argued that he believed that Ruby was Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 's niece and the phone call to the police station on her behalf was done to avoid a possible diplomatic crisis with Egypt .
