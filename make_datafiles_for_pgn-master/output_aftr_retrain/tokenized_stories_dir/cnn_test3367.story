-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Javier Zanetti equaled Inter Milan 's Serie A appearance record as the Italian champions continued their revival under new coach Leonardo with a 4-1 win over Bologna on Saturday .

The 37-year-old midfielder matched the mark of 519 league games set by Giuseppe Bergomi in 1999 , having passed 700 in all competitions in the black and blue of the Nerazzuri in May 's Champions League final win over Bayern Munich .

Stankovic provided a perfect throughball that allowed Diego Milito to score the second goal on the half-hour , with the Argentine having headed against the near post early in the match .

Milito 's clever backheel provided Eto'o with a one-two into the area in the 63rd minute and the former Barcelona star slotted home a right-foot effort .

The four-time African player of the year made it 4-0 with 19 minutes to play as he curled in a freekick , while Henry Gimenez scored a consolation six minutes later for the visitors -- who remained in 15th place after being penalized three points earlier this week for infringing rules over tax and player payments .

It was the fourth successive victory for Brazilian Leonardo , who replaced the sacked Rafael Benitez last month .

It was a disappointing result following last weekend 's 3-0 win over Juventus .
