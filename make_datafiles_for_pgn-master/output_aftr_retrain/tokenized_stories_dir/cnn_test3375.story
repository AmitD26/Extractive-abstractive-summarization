Tokyo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Japanese nuclear plant will shut down its reactors after the country 's prime minister warned it was vulnerable to natural disasters , its owner announced Monday .

The Chubu Electric Company said it will take two of its reactors at the Hamaoka nuclear plant off line and not bring a third back on line , effectively shutting down the plant .

In a statement , the company said , `` At the May 9 , 2011 meeting of the Board of Directors , Chubu Electric Power Company , Inc. , has decided to suspend operations of Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant until further measures to prevent tsunami -LRB- damage -RRB- are completed , as requested by the prime minister . ''

Meanwhile , workers reentered the No. 1 reactor building at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant Monday as they try to restore its cooling system , the plant 's operator said .

Cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi , about 240 kilometers -LRB- 150 miles -RRB- north of Tokyo , were knocked out by the devastating tsunami that struck Japan 's Pacific coast after a massive earthquake March 11 .

The disaster triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors 1-3 overheated and spewed huge amounts of radioactive contamination across the surrounding area .

The buildings that house reactors 1 and 3 were blown apart by hydrogen explosions in the first days of the crisis . Another hydrogen buildup is believed to have ruptured a water reservoir beneath the No. 2 reactor .

In April , Tokyo Electric laid out a six - to nine-month timetable for winding down the crisis and bringing the reactors to a complete shutdown .

The disaster has led to mandatory evacuations of about 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers -LRB- 12.5 miles -RRB- of the plant . People living another 10 kilometers away -- or at least another 60,000 people -- have been ordered to remain sheltered .
