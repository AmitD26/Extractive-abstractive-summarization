Despite Los Angeles ' reputation as `` the car capital of the United States of America , the congestion capital , the city most addicted to the single-passenger automobile , '' motorists found alternatives to driving for the weekend , Mayor Villaraigosa said .

Barriers that had detoured northbound and southbound traffic away from the 405 since late Friday were removed at noon Sunday , with the opening of interchanges and ramps to follow .

The real story may be how Los Angeles residents reacted to dire warnings to keep their cars parked or else get struck in predicted gridlock that Yaroslavsky had dubbed Carmadegeddon .

`` I propose a yearly carmageddon holiday ! What a lovely chill summer day in Santa Monica , '' resident Novena Carmel said in a Twitter posting Saturday afternoon .

The mayor said he was pleased with reports of `` people going to their neighborhood restaurants , going to a coffee shops , talking with neighbors , having family dinners or barbecues that they might not otherwise have done in the rat race that we live in . ''

In fact , the city will do it again in 11 months when the second half of the Mulholland bridge is demolished to complete the expansion project .

While fear of gridlock motivated the change in habits this time , Yaroslavsky suggested Los Angeles residents may have learned an unexpected lesson .

`` I think a lot of people in Los Angeles have learned that you can get along without taking long rides in your cars on weekends these past couple of days , '' he said . `` There 's a feeling in Los Angeles that if you do n't get in your car on a weekend that you 're somehow being cheated of something . ''

Crews closed ramps late Friday on the 405 , where it passes over the Santa Monica Mountains , California Department of Transportation officials said .

The $ 1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at Mulholland Drive , a mountain summit road that is featured in many Hollywood films , authorities said . A year from now , crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge , officials said .

The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction , creating `` the largest HOV system in the world '' at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County , said Mike Miles , the California Department of Transportation 's director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties .

The 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country , carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the Sepulveda Pass , a critical artery connecting Californians along the coast . The 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former NFL player O.J. Simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994 .
