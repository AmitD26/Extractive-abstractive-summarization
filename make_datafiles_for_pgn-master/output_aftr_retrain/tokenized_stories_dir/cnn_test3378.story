Under Senate rules , the treaty required support from a two-thirds majority of voting senators for final approval .

`` This is the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades , '' President Barack Obama said after the vote . It `` will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them . ''

Bipartisan passage of the measure `` sends a powerful signal to the world that Republicans and Democrats stand together on behalf of our security . ''

Obama signed the treaty with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in April . The accord is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the administration 's attempt to `` reset '' Washington 's relationship with Moscow .

Others said they had been assured of an administration commitment to modernize America 's aging nuclear arsenal .

`` We are the leading nuclear power on this earth . It is our responsibility to lead , '' said Sen. Byron Dorgan , D-North Dakota . This treaty is `` a step in the right direction . ''

Not all Republicans were convinced of the treaty 's merits , however .

Sen. Jim DeMint , R-South Carolina , argued on the Senate floor that the basic premise of the treaty -- that America 's nuclear arsenal should be at parity with Russia 's -- is flawed .

DeMint also voiced an ongoing conservative complaint in the lame-duck session -- that Democrats were ramming the treaty through as part of a long list of partisan priorities rejected by the public in the midterm elections .

`` We should not be passing major legislation at this time of year with this Congress , '' he said . The arms pact is part of `` a continued effort of accommodation and appeasement '' that makes a `` mockery of the debate and ratification process . ''

Sen. Mark Kirk , R-Illinois , called the treaty `` an echo from the 20th century '' that fails to account for new and emerging threats . Kirk and several other senators expressed a fear that the treaty would weaken America 's ability to prevent potential nuclear attacks from countries such as Iran and North Korea .

Passage of the treaty appeared to be in doubt for weeks . A late burst of support came Tuesday , however , after treaty supporters voted down or tabled several Republican amendments , saying they were unnecessary and would imperil the pact by reopening negotiated language or understandings with Russia .

A number of senior military leaders publicly endorsed the treaty , including Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .

Obama and Democratic leaders , conversely , pushed strongly to get the agreement passed before their majority in the Senate diminishes .

Biden , acting in his capacity as president of the Senate , personally presided over the final vote . Clinton also went to Capitol Hill to discuss the issue with former Senate colleagues .

A joyous atmosphere was seen on the floor after the vote -- likely the last Senate action of the lame-duck session . The treaty 's supporters and opponents alike congratulated Lugar and Kerry , the key congressional proponents of the accord .

An overwhelming majority of Americans support ratification of the treaty , according to a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday : 73 percent of people questioned in the national poll said the Senate should approve the accord , while 24 percent said senators should reject it .

CNN 's Alan Silverleib , Tom Cohen , Dana Bash , Ted Barrett and Lesa Jansen contributed to this report .
