-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The first democratically elected president of Zambia , who become the focus of a lengthy corruption trial during his retirement , died at his home early Saturday , his spokesman said .

Frederick Chiluba was 68 .

`` The death was a surprise for us because he was normal during the day , '' spokesman Emmanuel Mwamba said by phone from Lusaka . `` He met some people , had appointments and consulted . It was a normal day . ''

He died surrounded by his wife and some relatives , the spokesman said .

The former president suffered from heart problems during his retirement and had undergone treatment overseas .

An attempted military coup to oust him in 1997 failed , leading Chiluba to throw some of his opponents in prison , including Kaunda .

Shortly after the successor took office , he turned on Chiluba and called for a corruption trial against him .

A London court convicted him of fraud in absentia and ordered him to repay millions of dollars in government funds , but Zambia did not honor the ruling . The trial was held in London because some of the alleged corruption occurred there .
