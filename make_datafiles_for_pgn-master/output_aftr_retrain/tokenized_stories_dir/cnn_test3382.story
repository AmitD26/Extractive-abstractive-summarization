Gates made the comment while speaking to reporters at the U.S. Division-Center headquarters , where he addressed about 200 soldiers from Kansas and Hawaii . He called it `` the high point of my trip . ''

Differences between U.S. Democrats and Republicans have kept them from reaching agreement on a budget for this year . If there is no deal by midnight Friday , when the current spending authorization measure expires , parts of the government will close down .

Earlier Thursday , Gates met with the Commanding General of U.S. Forces in Iraq , General Lloyd Austin , and with the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq , James Jeffrey , at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad .

Later , Gates will meet with Massoud Barzani , president of the Kurdish regional government , said a senior defense official who agreed to talk on background

Gates arrived in Baghdad Wednesday night on an unannounced visit .

Prior to touching down in Baghdad , Gates was in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , for talks with that country 's leader , King Abdullah . Like most top-level U.S. visits to regional hot spots , Gates ' visit to Iraq was unannounced , most likely for security reasons .

Speaking to reporters after his meeting with the Saudi monarch , Gates said they discussed `` developments all over the region '' and `` obviously they talked about Iran . ''

He described the talks as an `` extremely cordial , warm meeting . ''

`` We already have evidence that the Iranians are trying to exploit the situation in Bahrain , '' Gates told reporters Wednesday . `` We also have evidence that they are thinking about what they could do to try to create problems elsewhere , as well . ''
