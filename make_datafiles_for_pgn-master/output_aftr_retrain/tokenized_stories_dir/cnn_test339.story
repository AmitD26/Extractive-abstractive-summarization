-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An education department in one Malaysian state is sending effeminate boys to a boot camp to change their behavior , a move that 's drawn fire from educators and activists .

The Terengganu state Education Department picked 66 boys for the camp this month , part of a program to help boys deal with identity crises , media in the Asian nation reported .

`` The boys involved were selected from most schools in the state , '' Daud is quoted as saying . `` They were carefully vetted before a final selection was made . ''

Daud said there could be big problems for such boys if their behavior was not addressed . He cited a couple of factors contributing to the issue -- parents dressing boys in girl 's clothing `` as they had really wanted a girl '' or boys `` surrounded by female siblings . ''

`` Starting a re-education camp or boot camp is directly counter to that . It goes to encouraging discrimination against all people because of their sexual orientation . ''

Malaysia 's Women , Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Sharizat Abdul Jalil said the ministry views the move with `` alarm and great concern '' and said such boot camps should be abolished .

`` The experience of being singled out on the basis of perceived characteristics is an extremely traumatizing experience , in particular for adolescent teens . Such profiling has potentially serious psychological repercussions and could harm the development and mental health of the children , as it exposes them to prejudices among their peers and members of their family and community , '' she said .

The Joint Action Group for Gender Equality , a coalition of Malaysian organizations , said it was appalled at the move , noting that `` identifying and singling out boys who behave effeminately is highly discriminatory bordering on predatory . ''

It said the department is undermining the role of education -- nurturing `` the personality and talents of the child '' and inculcating `` respect for human rights in preparation for responsible adulthood . '' And it said fashioning a criterion for so-called normal behavior `` is highly questionable . ''

`` The boys in this case have been denied and persecuted for the expression of their personalities and identities . Ideally , school is supposed to provide a safe and neutral space for children to develop without fear of recrimination for being themselves , '' the group said .

It added that the children in question were n't -- but should have been -- consulted .

`` Corrective boot camps to ` fix ' children and individuals must not be condoned because it violates the rights of people who are perceived as ` different . ' It should be strongly opposed and challenged as it promotes homophobia and prejudice . We should send a clear message to institutions that they have no business meddling with an individual 's identity and personal preference , '' the group said .
