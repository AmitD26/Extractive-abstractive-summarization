The banner , which measures 20 feet high and 30 feet wide , was draped between the extended ladders of two fire trucks outside the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson , Arizona , forming an arch under which Christina 's family passed as they arrived ahead of the 1 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. ET -RRB- service .

John and Roxanna Green , Christina 's parents ; and her 11-year-old brother , Dallas , paused for a few moments to look up at the flag as it rippled against the clear blue sky . A few minutes later , more relatives emerged from the same black SUV limousine that brought her immediate family , also craning their necks to take in the huge banner .

Soon after , the shredded flag was removed and put in storage until 2008 , when a member of the New York Says Thank You Foundation recovered it and took it to Greensburg , Kansas . Foundation volunteers were there to help residents of the small town complete some rebuilding projects more than a year after a strong tornado devastated the region .

According to Jeff Parness , the founder and chairman of the foundation , it was a way to say `` thank you '' to some of the townspeople who had come to New York in the aftermath of the terror attacks to help there .

According to the group 's website , while foundation members worked to rebuild the town , residents began to repair what is now called the National 9/11 Flag by patching it with flags recovered from the tornado rubble .

Parness contacted the family 's pastor , who conveyed the offer , and the Greens accepted .

`` We both let out a gasp of emotion , because , you know , that meant a lot to us , '' Christina 's father , John Green , told CNN . `` And for them to extend that courtesy to our daughter ... again , it 's just another one of those things that will help for us . We feel like the country wo n't forget her . ''

Parness says the flag is really more of a symbol of 9/12 , instead of 9/11 .

It shows `` what it looks like when Americans come together and help each other recover from tragedy and disaster , '' he explained .

He said newly naturalized citizens would help with the stitching on Friday at the Martin Luther King Center in Atlanta , Georgia .

`` It 's about bringing people together and showing what 's possible out of a tragedy like this . ''

`` In a bizarre way , this is a tremendous gift that Christina is giving to us , to show the country this flag , to ... let people in local communities nominate service heroes to place a stitch in this flag so we can heal it and make this flag whole again by the 10-year anniversary '' this September , Parness said .
