-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Golfer Tiger Woods Tuesday addressed a racially-tinged remark made by his former caddy , telling reporters Steve Williams apologized and is not a racist .

According to media reports , when asked about those comments during his acceptance speech Friday night , Williams said : `` I wanted to shove it up that black a -- . ''

`` I apologize for comments I made last night at the Annual Caddy Awards dinner in Shanghai , '' the statement said . `` Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun .

`` I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist , '' Williams ' statement said . `` However I assure you that was not my intent . I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended . ''

Woods said Tuesday that Williams `` did apologize . It was hurtful , certainly , but life goes forward . ''

Both the PGA Tour and the European Tour condemned Williams ' comment , but he will not face sanctions .

Scott said earlier he had discussed the matter with Williams and accepted his apology . `` There is absolutely no room for racial discrimination in any walk of life , including the game of golf , '' Scott said , according to the article on Woods ' website .

Williams said in July he was shocked and disappointed that Woods had severed their 12-year relationship , especially after he remained loyal to the golfer during the sex scandal in which he was embroiled for several months .

`` Given the fact of my loyalty and the way that I stood by this guy through thick and thin ... '' Williams told CNN affiliate Mediaworks in New Zealand at the time . `` And the timing of it is very poor , from my perspective . ''

In announcing he would no longer be working with Williams , Woods said it was `` time for a change . ''

`` Stevie is an outstanding caddy and a friend , and has been instrumental in many of my accomplishments , '' Woods said in July . `` I wish him great success in the future . ''
