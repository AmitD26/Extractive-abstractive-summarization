-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- France international footballer Patrice Evra is determined to follow up his complaint of racism against Uruguay striker Luis Suarez , according to his club manager .

Manchester United defender Evra accused his Liverpool opponent of racially abusing him during Saturday 's 1-1 Premier League draw , and the English Football Association said it would investigate after match referee Andre Marriner reported the incident .

Suarez denied the claims in a statement on his Facebook page , but United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters on Monday that Evra stands by his comments to French television channel Canal Plus .

`` I spoke to Patrice today . He is adamant he wants to follow it on , '' Ferguson said ahead of Tuesday 's Champions League clash with Romanian minnows Otelul Galati .

`` It is not an easy one for us . It is not something we would want to level against Liverpool , and it is not against Liverpool . Obviously Patrice feels very aggrieved at what was said to him . It rests in the hands of the FA now . ''

United and Liverpool are bitter rivals , and Ferguson appealed to both sets of fans before the match at Anfield , asking them not to sing abusive chants about the clubs ' respective tragedies in Munich and Hillsborough .

United midfielder Ashley Young was racially abused by Bulgaria fans during England 's Euro 2012 qualifier in Sofia in September , but Ferguson said there are no such problems in the Premier League .

`` I am not aware of any instances in terms of British football , '' the 69-year-old Scot said .

`` Yes , yes . There is no problem , '' he said , while confirming that England striker Wayne Rooney would play despite Sunday 's top-of-the-table derby clash with Manchester City looming .

`` When the initial news came through it was a definite blow for him . He did n't expect that . None of us did , '' Ferguson said .

In Tuesday 's other Group C game , Swiss side Basel host Portugal 's Benfica with both clubs on four points .

In Group B , Italy 's Internazionale travel to French side Lille on the back of another domestic defeat at the weekend , while Turkey 's Trabzonspor will seek to extend their lead at home to CSKA Moscow .

Dutch club Ajax , whose fourth European title came in 1995 , travel to Croatia 's Dinamo Zagreb -- with neither team having won yet this season .
