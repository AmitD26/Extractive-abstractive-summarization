-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the surface , the first round of the Egyptian presidential election seemed to show that the Muslim Brotherhood and the remnants of the Mubarak regime are locked in mortal combat for the political soul of Egypt -- as Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi faces pro-military candidate Ahmed Shafik in a second round of voting in June .

First , it is very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood , despite Morsi 's emergence as the presidential front-runner , lost almost half its support base between the parliamentary and presidential elections -- from 47 % to 25 % .

It is true that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood was able to mobilize its political base in the presidential elections more effectively than its competitors . But the support of a mere quarter of the electorate is nowhere near sufficient for the Brotherhood to govern the country by itself .

Only part of this decline in support can be attributed to former Brotherhood leader Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh 's 2011 defection from the party and his decision to run for president as an independent . The decline also reflects a disenchantment with the Brotherhood 's poor legislative performance , its attempt to pack the constituent assembly with its supporters , reneging on its promise not to run a presidential candidate and its tendency to compromise with the military on important issues .

The real surprise of the election was the emergence of Hamdeen Sabahy -- whose campaign was built on nationalism and demands for social justice -- with 22 % of the vote .

Sabahy was often referred to as the Nasserist candidate who represented the legacy of the Gamal Abdul Nasser , the leader of the 1952 revolution and Egypt 's first president . His campaign did not get going until very late in the day ; otherwise it is more than likely that the runoff would have pitted him against Morsi . That would have given Sabahy a real shot at winning the runoff , given the anti-Islamist search for a viable candidate untainted by the Mubarak regime .

The fact that pro-military Shafik , the leading remnant of the Mubarak regime , took almost a quarter of the votes seems remarkable . But the superior financial capability and patron-client network of the former ruling party NDP , especially in the Nile Delta , and covert support from the military brass played a big role .

Reports are emerging that the security services and military-linked pro-Mubarak landlords coerced many of the Delta peasantry to vote for Shafik . It appears that pressure was also put on public servants and their families .

Shafiq 's law-and-order message also attributed to his success . The security situation in much of the country has deteriorated markedly -- some argue deliberately engineered by the military . But his performance can also be read as the last gasp of the old regime , which can be well and truly buried if its opponents , from the Brotherhood to the Nasserists and liberals , can form a coalition capable of providing effective and legitimate government .

It is clear that the Islamist forces are fractured and the Brotherhood 's base is shrinking , as the political playing field becomes increasingly level in a democratizing Egypt . There are indications that the Brotherhood is aware of its limitations , which has forced it to mellow considerably , sacrificing some of its ideological purity at the altar of political pragmatism .

A consensus will also have to be built on the role of Islam in the new political order . The Muslim Brotherhood has demonstrated remarkable flexibility in the past on this issue . It may be even more flexible now that it realizes a consensus on Islam that is acceptable to the majority of political parties and factions would be essential to creating a coalition .
