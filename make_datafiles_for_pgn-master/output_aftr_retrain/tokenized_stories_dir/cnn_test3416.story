Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than half of all adult Americans say they do n't want to get the H1N1 flu vaccine , according to a new national poll .

The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Wednesday also indicates that the number of adults who have tried to get the vaccine but were turned away is higher than the number of adults who have gotten a swine flu shot .

According to the poll , 55 percent of adults do n't want to get the swine flu vaccine and do n't plan to get a shot . Another one in five say they want to get inoculated but have n't taken any steps to do so ; 14 percent want a shot and have tried to get it but have been unsuccessful . Just 7 percent have been inoculated for H1N1 .

So far officials of the National Institutes of Health say they 've seen no serious side effects in clinical trials and that study subjects who have been immunized have generated a good response .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for certain high-priority groups because they are more likely to have serious complications if they develop swine flu . These groups include : pregnant women ; caregivers and household contacts of children younger than 6 months ; everyone between the ages of 6 months and 24 years ; and people ages 25 to 64 with existing health problems .
