The Australian 's error handed Jorge Lorenzo second place and means he now leads the world championship standings by 16 points from Pedrosa .

Stoner slipped to third and was distraught to have thrown away a winning position . He told the BBC : `` I 'm pretty disappointed , I had planned to go for my ` win or bin ' effort in the last corner not that one !

`` I felt confident but as soon as I tried to turn in a little more , the front went . I was already off the brakes and not in the hard braking area , as soon as I eased of the brakes I guess the weight came off the front and down I went .

`` I 'm frustrated I was n't allowed to get up and try and score some points , the bike was perfect , but the marshals pushed me away .

`` If we can continue this momentum for the rest of the season then we should n't be so worried for the championship . ''

It was Pedrosa 's third consecutive German MotoGP victory and he was quickest off the blocks , beating Stoner , who started on pole , to the first corner from third spot .

The next race on the MotoGP calendar takes place in Italy on July 15 .
