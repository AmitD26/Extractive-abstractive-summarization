-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- To call `` The Dark Knight Rises '' `` highly anticipated '' at this point would be an understatement .

The fervor for Christopher Nolan 's third Batman film has been so intense , tickets were selling out in select theaters back in January , months ahead of its July 20 U.S. opening .

With this being the third and final film in an acclaimed trilogy , each casting announcement and trailer clip has been thoroughly analyzed and discussed . And now , thanks to early reviews that have circulated on Monday , the fascination with `` The Dark Knight Rises '' has reached a new level .

`` Big-time Hollywood filmmaking at its most massively accomplished , this last installment of Christopher Nolan 's Batman trilogy makes everything in the rival Marvel universe look thoroughly silly and childish , '' says The Hollywood Reporter 's Todd McCarthy .

With aid from Anne Hathaway 's Selina Kyle , who initially lures Bruce Wayne out of hiding with a burglary , Batman tracks down Bane only to find that it is going to take some doing to vanquish this villain .

Variety 's Justin Chang notes that , `` All in all , the picture impressively conveys a seething vision of urban anxiety that speaks to such issues as the greed and complacency of the one percent , the criminal neglect of the poor and oppressed , and above all the unsettling sense that no one and nothing is safe . ''

Agrees Time magazine 's Richard Corliss , `` The most eagerly anticipated movie of summer 2012 was worth waiting for . ... The movie may not top ` The Avengers ' at the worldwide box office , but it is a far , far better thing -- maybe the best , most troubling , assured and enthralling of all the superhero movies . ''
