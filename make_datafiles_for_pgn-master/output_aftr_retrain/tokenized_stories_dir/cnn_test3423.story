London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Olympic star Ryan Lochte said Friday that he tries to maintain a sense of humor and perspective despite his intense focus on swimming -- one that leaves him little time for romantic relationships or much else besides training and competing .

`` I am taking this seriously , but there 's so much more to life than just swimming , '' he said . `` That 's what I want to have people know : You know what , I 'm having fun doing this . ''

Still , free time for the 28-year-old -- who has been called one of the Olympics ' most eligible bachelors -- has been severely limited over the past decade .

If he could choose anyone to whisk away to a deserted island , the Rochester , New York , native did n't hesitate as to who he 'd pick : `` Gossip Girl '' actress Blake Lively .

`` She is gorgeous , '' he said of Lively , who is currently dating actor Ryan Reynolds . As to what he 'd say to her if they met , Lochte jokingly said , `` I would be like , ` Hi ... You want to go to an island with me ? ' ''

Lochte entered the London Games as one of his nation 's most highly touted athletes , having won two golds and two bronze medals four years earlier in Beijing and threatening to topple Phelps from his perch atop the swimming world this year .

Immediately , he made a splash by defeating Phelps and others for the 400-meter individual medley gold on the day after the opening ceremony .

Lochte rebounded with two medals on Thursday -- bronze in the 200-meter backstroke and a silver in the 200-meter individual medley , this time finishing right behind Phelps .

The next day , the swimmer acknowledged to CNN that he 's had `` ups and downs '' during the London Games but overall , he 's satisfied with his performance .

Bold move put Gabby on path to gold

But he said that it 's all been worth it to put on a swim cap adorned with an American flag , and especially when his national anthem is played after a gold medal performance

`` It 's everything -- chills , excitement , knowing that I 'm not just swimming for myself , I 'm swimming for my whole entire country . It 's one of the greatest feelings in the world , '' Lochte said .

`` There 's nothing like it . It 's something that you will cherish for the rest of your life . ''
