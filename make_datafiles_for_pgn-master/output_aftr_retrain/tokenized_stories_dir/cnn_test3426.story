Fireworks mark the groundbreaking for the Jeju Global Education City in Jeju , South Korea , last week .

Definition : A geese father who is rich enough so he can swoop in to see his family any time he wants .

Definition : A geese father who is too poor to fly . He can only yearningly gaze into the direction of his family .

With a big bang , the groundbreaking for an ambitious new project on the South Korean island of Jeju got under way last week , a project that hopes to make these `` geese '' nouns obsolete .

And while the location will be in Jeju , organizers say the curriculum , except for Korean language and history , will all be taught in English and be identical to that being taught at the institute 's headquarters .

Officially , English is taught from the third grade here . But many Koreans believe in an early start . There are even popular Internet sites that offer recorded English language songs and stories for the fetus .

Official statistics say that as of 2007 , more than 27,000 South Korean high , middle and even elementary school students were studying abroad .

A government survey done last year says nearly half of all South Korean parents wanted to send their children abroad .

`` I always felt guilty because my children were not getting the English education that other people were getting because of me . ''

He also saw how the geese father phenomenon was breaking up families , and creating social problems . There have been many media reports about divorces , and even suicides among the lonely fathers .

So when the government of Jeju Island asked him to support their project , Song said he gladly said yes .

Jeju officials say the tuition will be somewhere between US$ 3,100 to US$ 4,700 . About half the amount South Korean parents would be paying to send their children overseas .

But Jeju is eying something bigger than just the Korean market . The future vision is targeting the entire northeast Asian population : Japanese and Chinese as well as South Korean children .

`` Potentially there are 750 million people that live within a two-hour flight time radius of Jeju , '' says Christopher Bogden , the project manager for the Jeju Global Education City .

Jeju is already a popular destination for Japanese and Chinese tourists . The tropical climate and natural beauty of the island is a major draw . And the island has recently attracted foreign investors who are seeking to cultivate the island 's assets .

The concern is that the Jeju project will become just `` one of the many . '' And that it will be difficult for the provincial government to recoup their investment , especially in this slow global economy .

The first stage -- comprising one each of an elementary , middle and high school -- will be ready to accept students from 2011 , and the entire complex is scheduled to be complete in 2015 . Organizers say that will be more than enough time for the global economy to recover and the demand for quality English education in Asia to flourish .

That 's good news for all geese fathers in South Korea .
