-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities in Oklahoma have arrested and charged a 23-year-old man who they say planned to blow up 48 area churches .

Authorities were tipped off to the plot by workers at the motel about 90 miles northeast of Tulsa . One discovered a duffel bag full of Molotov cocktails near the outside trash , while a room service employee reported suspicious items in Weiler 's room , said Loring .

Among the documents were a list of churches , a hand-drawn map with the churches grouped and circled , instructions for making Molotov cocktails and a handwritten journal , said Loring . Some of the documents had been torn up and needed to be assembled .

Loring said one of the journal entries read as follows : `` Self-Promote for the next 4 years while beginning list of goals written out in Oklahoma having to do with destroying and removing church buildings from U.S. , a tiny bit at a time -- setting foundation for the years to follow . ''

The suspect , who is from Illinois , is expected to appear in court next on October 22 .
