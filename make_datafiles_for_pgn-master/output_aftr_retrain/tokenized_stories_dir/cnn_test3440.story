The incident happened around 4:30 p.m. Thursday , during the `` Hunt for Heroes '' event in Midland . According to the group Show of Support , these festivities -- including a banquet and , after that , an `` all expense paid whitetail deer hunt '' -- are to honor members of all branches of the U.S. military .

The last flatbed truck in the parade was crossing tracks when an eastbound train slammed into it , said Midland police spokesman Ryan Stout .

Some people were able to jump off the truck in time .

Marine Corps Chief Warrant Officer 3 Gary Stouffer , 37 , and Army Sgt. Maj. Lawrence Boivin , 47 , were pronounced dead at the scene . Army Sgt. Joshua Michael , 34 , and Army Sgt. Maj. William Lubbers , 43 , died at Midland Memorial Hospital .

Five others continue to be treated at University Medical Center in Lubbock . One remains in critical condition .

Authorities do n't yet know why the truck was on the tracks as the train arrived at the crossing , Stout said .

The gates and lights at the intersection were working at the time , and the train 's two-member crew sounded the horn prior to impact , according to Tom Lange , a spokesman for Union Pacific Railroad . The train included more than 80 rail cars carrying double-stacked containers , he said .

The NTSB said it has not confirmed whether the crossing gates and signals were active at the time of the accident .
