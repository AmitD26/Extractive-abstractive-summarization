-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Martin Brodeur was unstrapping his goaltending pads after another victory , about to be rushed to a TV interview , when a reporter on deadline made a request . Could he answer just one quick question ?

No goaltender in NHL history has won more games than Brodeur : His 656 career victories are 105 more than Patrick Roy , who is second on the list . The next active goaltender on the all-time list , Roberto Luongo , has just 339 , so it 's a record that may never be broken .

And no one has appeared in a playoff game in his teens and his 40s , which became another line on Brodeur 's long rÃ © sumÃ © this week . He is the definition of longevity , and he 's not just hanging on by the edge of his skates , either .

`` But you 're able to play at a level when you 're having fun and you 're able to compete in a league you always wanted to play and still be able to keep going . For me , I do n't take anything for granted . I appreciate every moment , especially this year . It 's been awesome for me . ''

Brodeur has spent his entire career outside the limelight . That comes with the territory of playing in the NHL , the least popular of the four major U.S. sports leagues , and playing for the Devils , who lack the following of their rivals across the Hudson River , the New York Rangers . The Devils , despite their continued success , are rarely picked for national TV games .

That does n't diminish what he could accomplish this spring . When Brodeur won his first Stanley Cup , he was just 23 . Now , if the Devils continue their hot streak through the playoffs , he could win his fourth at 40 .

That would be a 17-year gap between his first title and his last one . There are n't many athletes who can match that , but two who did -- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Babe Ruth -- are recognized amongst the greatest in sports history .

His critics have said that Brodeur benefited from the Devils ' defensive approach for years . But his former role model -- who later became his biggest rival -- thought that argument was unfair .

`` I remember in the playoffs , he once said he was facing more critics than shots , '' said Roy , who owns most of the NHL goaltending records that Brodeur does n't have . `` I thought it was a nice way to deal with the pressure . From the outside watching him , he almost makes it look easy , but I know how tough it is . ''

Roy retired in 2003 , when he was 37 . Brodeur is in the final year of his contract but has said he 's leaning toward coming back next year -- his 20th in a Devils uniform -- `` if they 're going to take me back . ''

He said he 's having too much fun to stop now .

`` You have to enjoy what you do , '' he said . `` I 've been here for so long that I 've had different roles regardless of me playing or not playing . Just watching guys and helping guys during their careers to make the right decisions . You have to think the right way and go through hurdles for success . ''
