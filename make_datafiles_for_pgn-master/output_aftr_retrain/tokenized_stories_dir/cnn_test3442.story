Two other keepers rushed to the woman 's aid after they heard her cries and moved the elephant away , the zoo said in a statement .

The elephant involved was a two-and-half-year-old male calf called Pathi Harn , which means `` miracle '' in Thai . The calf was given the name after being born alive , even after experts pronounced him dead in the womb following a difficult eight-day labor .

The calf -- initially referred to as `` Mr Shuffles '' due to his odd gait -- was conceived by artificial insemination as part of the zoo 's elephant breeding and conservation program .

The zoo said it does n't know what provoked the calf . `` It 's unknown at this time why the young elephant challenged the keeper . The public were not at risk at any time and the elephants are now in their paddock at the zoo . ''

`` Initial enquiries indicate that the zoo keeper suffered serious crush injuries while working in the elephant enclosure , '' the agency said in a press release .

The Sydney zoo is home to eight elephants , some of whom have rehabilitated from domestic elephant camps in Thailand .

According to the zoo 's website , their enclosure includes deep and shallow swimming pools , mud wallows , sleeping mounds , shaded areas , scratching posts and logs .

The World Wildlife Fund estimates that there are around 30,000 Asian elephants left in the world . Of those , nearly 30 % are in captivity .
