Beijing , China -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jonathon Levine was a fiercely ambitious 25-year-old with a Masters degree -- but stuck in a dead end job .

This is not how it was meant to be for a boy raised in New York City , nourished on the American dream that hard work and a good education would bring rewards and riches .

`` In the -LRB- United -RRB- States everyone is so mopey -- it is the end of the world , no jobs , and income inequality is through the roof . We 're back to the gilded age in the U.S , '' he said .

Fact Check : China tire case

`` You could say it has been a long march , '' he said .

He is part of a new generation waking up to a new reality . America is no longer the land of opportunity . China is .

The China bashing moved to center stage in the second U.S. presidential debate . Both candidates tried to score points against each other by getting tough on China .

In response , President Barack Obama , looking far more engaged than he did during the first debate , said Romney was the last person to get tough on China , accusing him of sending jobs to Asia during his business career .

`` And as far as currency manipulation , the currency has actually gone up 11 % since I 've been president because we have pushed them hard . And we 've put unprecedented trade pressure on China .

After a softly-softly approach at the beginning of his administration , Obama has switched tack .

It is boosting its military presence by carrying out military exercises with allies Japan and South Korea , while some U.S troops have been placed on Australian soil at a new base near the northern city of Darwin .

`` She has brought new and extremely profound mutual distrust between the mainstream societies of the two countries . ''

While Chinese officials responded diplomatically by saying that `` freedom of navigation and safety in the South China Sea is assured , '' another editorial in the Global Times was more scathing , saying it hoped Clinton `` can reflect upon the deep harm she is bringing to the Sino-U.S. relationship in the last few months before she leaves office and try to make up for it . ''

For her part , Clinton has stressed the importance of deepening bilateral ties . `` As we continue to expand our work on the consequential issues of our time , we must continue to build on this historic opportunity to deepen our relationship , because a thriving China is good for America and a thriving America is good for China , '' she said in a goodwill message to mark China 's National Day on October 1 .

Meanwhile , Levine is watching all of this unfold as he teaches his students about the United States , the country he 's left behind .

He says it is misguided to fear China .

`` It 's not like going to the moon , like it might have been a hundred years ago because communication links us much closer together . ''

For him this is a new world , interdependent with China as a rapidly emerging new axis of power . And for people like he used to be -- back home and struggling -- he has some only half-joking advice .

`` Get out , get out , leave everyone behind you . ''
