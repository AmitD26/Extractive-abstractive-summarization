-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Florida A&M University , under fire in the hazing death of a drum major and over its finances , was put on probation for one year by an accrediting agency , officials said Tuesday .

FAMU expects more details of the sanction within the next week , the Tallahassee institution said in a statement .

Administrators learned from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges that FAMU 's accreditation is in jeopardy . The loss of accreditation would put thousands of students at risk of not being eligible for federal financial aid .

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement separately investigated alleged `` financial irregularities '' involving the marching band .

The probation comes as a Florida circuit court judge weighs whether to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought by the family of drum major Robert Champion Jr. , 26 .

In September , FAMU responded to the lawsuit by filing court documents saying that the institution was not responsible for Champion 's death . The school asserted that Champion broke the law and school policies when he willingly took part in the hazing that killed him .
