One of the great joys -LRB- or , depending on who you are , nightmares -RRB- of the holiday commerce season is the never-ending stream of Christmas music filling in all the empty airspace in your local shopping malls and department stores . But what if you 're shopping online , and somehow avoiding every other vestige of public-space holiday-music inundation ?

The undisputed champ of this season 's holiday music bonanza is Stewart , whose first holiday album is currently doing big business -LRB- it narrowly missed preventing Alicia Keys from being the top album in the country this week -RRB- . His approach is very much `` Over-Eggnogged Uncle Croons Hugs ` Round the Tree , '' but it 's still Rod-ily charming , and his original composition `` Red Suited Super Man '' will be an alternate-universe hit next Yuletide season .

Cee Lo Green , Cee Lo 's Magic Moment

A Very Special Christmas 25th Anniversary

Lady Antebellum , On This Winter 's Night

Holidays Rule

Like the indie version of Now That 's What I Call Christmas , Holidays Rule brings together Paul McCartney , Civil Wars , the Shins , and a bevy of other on-the-fringes acts doing Yuletide favorites . Nobody has more fun than , uh , fun. , who blow through `` Sleigh Ride '' with the same kind of joyful abandon they bring to their own hits .

Blake Shelton , Cheers , It 's Christmas

Scotty McCreary , Christmas With Scott McCreary

Scotty 's album made a huge jump up the Billboard chart this week , which means that his core demographicâ € '' country fans who find Blake Shelton too edgyâ € '' have made their way to their local record emporium . Listen to his `` First Noel '' only if you do n't like booze in your eggnog .

Because even Goth kids need a little Christmas cheer , Perri lends her icy alto to a handful of standards plus an original called `` Something About December '' that provides some fantastically melodic holiday haunting .

John Travolta & Olivia Newton-John , This Christmas
