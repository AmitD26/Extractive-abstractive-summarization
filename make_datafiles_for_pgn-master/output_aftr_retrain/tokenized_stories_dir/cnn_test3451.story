Like most plea bargains , the perpetrator got something from the deal , too .

By settling early , the university avoided the prolonged NCAA infractions process . Proceeding by the infractions process would have kept Penn State 's name , Sandusky 's crimes and Joe Paterno 's dubious legacy in the news longer than usual . More alarmingly , the infractions committee could have imposed the dreaded `` death penalty '' -- a complete termination of the football program for years , the cost of which would have undoubtedly dwarfed the measures imposed .

Notably , Penn State agreed in accepting the deal that it would not challenge the NCAA 's authority in court .

Corbett described the sanctions as `` overreaching and unlawful '' while other lawmakers object to the fines being used to fund programs in other states . Since the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was not limited by the Penn State-NCAA agreement , it can sue to overturn it . Yet it is that very fact -- that Pennsylvania is a stranger to the agreement -- that dooms its litigation .

What bad thing will happen to Pennsylvania ?

It partially funds Penn State . Therefore , according to the complaint , future NCAA sanctions that come out of the Penn State treasury will , by derivation , also be taken from Pennsylvania 's treasury , or at least the part of it that the state chooses to share with the university .

Yet none of those other people would likely have standing to sue , so their inclusion only underscores the state 's untenable litigation position . At times , the complaint filed by the state reads less like a legal document and more like a press release , extolling the fine virtues of a Penn State education amidst the hard-working townsfolk of central Pennsylvania .

The complaint also strangely paints the NCAA in starkly negative hues , as if associating the organization with greed and its leadership with conspiracy will somehow make a difference . It goes so far as to smear the NCAA president for his handsome salary , noting that it constitutes a substantial raise over that of his predecessor .

But imagine that Pennsylvania actually litigates to a successful conclusion and has the consent decree between Penn State and the NCAA overturned . What then ?

The NCAA can simply reopen the case and refer the matter to the infractions process , with the penalty of death the likely outcome for Penn State 's Nittany Lions .
