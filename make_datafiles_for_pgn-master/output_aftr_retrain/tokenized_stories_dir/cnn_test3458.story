-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The undersea earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday was the largest earthquake of its type ever recorded and has increased the risk of more powerful quakes in the region , a leading expert has said .

Director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore , Kerry Sieh , told CNN that the 8.6 Richter scale undersea earthquake was the largest `` strike-slip '' quake - steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other - ever recorded .

`` Before that we thought that 8.1 was as big as they get , but this 8.6 quake was phenomenal , '' Sieh said . `` It has been absolutely jaw-dropping and has caused a lot of foment among seismologists . ''

Likening the tectonic plates to a group of 10 men holding onto an elephant with a rope , he said that pressure on the plates becomes greater as the struggle becomes unequal .

`` Eventually what you have is a cascade of failures and the last guy has to let go and the tectonics win and the fault moves , '' Sieh said . `` What we had in Sumatra between 2004 and 2007 was pop ! Pop ! Pop ! Three great earthquakes ; 9.2 , 8.7 , 8.4 . ''

`` There 's still one or two patches left to go , '' Sieh said .

He said the past 10 years had been particularly seismically active , providing invaluable information to seismologists .
