Washington , D.C. -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At a time when our nation 's top university is more diverse than ever before , Harvard 's recent decision to honor its former professor Marty Peretz on Friday for setting up an undergraduate research fund in his name comes as a big , disappointing surprise .

Here is the latest blog-post calumny : `` Muslim life is cheap , most notably to Muslims '' and `` I wonder whether I need honor these people and pretend that they are worthy of the privileges of the First Amendment , which I have in my gut the sense that they will abuse . ''

Despite the voices raised against it , the university just reaffirmed its decision to recognize him -- although it appears he will no longer speak at the gathering -- citing Peretz 's apology .

This comes in the wake of his series of shockingly ignorant comments that have galvanized student groups on campus to protest Harvard 's decision to honor him .

In another display of ignorance , he claimed `` So many in the black population are afflicted by cultural deficiencies . ''

The Harvard platform for Peretz gives racism an intellectual cast and authority and that is a very dangerous thing . When groups like the Tea Parties espouse bigoted views , they are more easily dismissed . But when Harvard chooses to distinguish a man who cloaks his prejudice in intellectual jargon , and then gives him additional credibility by choosing to recognize him out of thousands of its distinguished alumni , it makes scholarship a haven for prejudice .

Peretz contends that certain qualities exist in cultures that do n't , in reality , and moreover he claims that these things are innate , a method of sophisticated racism that has existed wherever hatred has manifested itself -- most painfully during World War II Germany .

When a prominent intellectual promotes such racist ideology , it makes such views more palatable . Many people find it difficult to recognize that educated people can hold ignorant views , and it is even more difficult to challenge such scholarly authority .

Indeed , Peretz 's elite background and lofty connections had several people mitigating his recent comments on Muslims as an `` oversimplification '' instead of what it really is : untrue and odious .

During the past holy month of Ramadan , we saw an outpouring of intolerance toward Muslim-Americans , from the ground zero mosque protests to the acts of vandalism and threats against mosques around the country that continue to this day .

Last month , conscious individuals like New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg restored vision to many Americans ' blind eye , but someone who has a history of doing the opposite is being honored instead .

The unintended consequence of Peretz 's recent comment is that it situates Islamophobia within the larger context of racism at large . As his diversely racist comments indicate , hatred is rarely faithful to one group .

The Peretz affair is a small aftershock of the racial and religious tensions that have shaken our nation over the past couple of months . Its silver lining is that it has mobilized hundreds of students from different backgrounds to unite against bigotry -- something we can all learn from .
