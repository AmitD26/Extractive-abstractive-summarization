Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lindsay Lohan 's alleged lie to a police officer investigating a car crash last June could send the actress back to jail next month .

But confusion surrounds the question of who will defend Lohan , 26 , when she goes on trial February 27 after her longtime lawyer received a letter saying she was fired .

Celebrity news website TMZ reported the letter to Holley came from an attorney in New York .

She faces four misdemeanor charges relating to the traffic accident , but the most serious threat to Lohan 's freedom is the probation revocation that the arrest triggered . She could be sent to jail for up to 245 days for violating her probation for a shoplifting conviction .

The actress was put on probation after she was convicted in 2011 on charges related to the theft of a necklace .

But then last summer , she crashed her car in Santa Monica . Authorities said not only was she driving recklessly , she also gave false information to a police officer and then resisted a police officer .

The case is just one in a long list of legal trouble for the actress , whose struggle with drugs and alcohol has seen her bounce in and out of court 19 times and to five rehabilitation facilities since 2007 .

In November , she was charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly punching a woman at a Manhattan nightclub .

In the Santa Monica case , Lohan is accused of telling police her assistant was driving the Porsche , while witnesses told investigators they saw Lohan behind the wheel .

The crash took place while Lohan was on her way to the set for the filming of `` Liz and Dick . ''
