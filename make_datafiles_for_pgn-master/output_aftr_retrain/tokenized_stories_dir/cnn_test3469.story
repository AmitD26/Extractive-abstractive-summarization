-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A powerful storm is making its way through the northeastern U.S. , expected to dump 2 feet of snow or more in some areas .

This weekend will be another test of how accurate those forecasts are .

Weather forecasts are much more accurate today than decades ago , but they are still not perfect . There are two big hurdles to overcome . One is creating accurate mathematical descriptions of the dynamics of the atmosphere . Two is increasing the resolution of the weather model .

By the numbers : Northeast blizzard

We predict the weather by putting all the observations we have on winds , temperatures , pressures and other variables into a mathematical model that estimates how these systems will interact . Unfortunately , the earth 's circumference at the equator is almost 25,000 miles , so when we try to model the entire earth , and go up into the mesosphere -LRB- about 25 to 50 miles above the earth -RRB- the picture gets fuzzier .

But it 's nearly impossible to accurately model strong weather systems such as big storms or hurricanes , which include various cloud systems .

Staying safe when the lights go out

Although miscalculations occur , they are not particularly common , especially over the past decade . We have a much better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere , more observations from towers , balloons and radar , and faster computers with much more processing speed and memory . Weather forecasting models are continually improving .

Think of it this way : A meteorologist 's job is equivalent to guessing when a flashmob is going to break out . At the outset , it seems impossible . But if you meet every person in your city , get to know each of their general habits , and keep track of everyone 's plans , you could guess when they might break out into song and dance as a group .
