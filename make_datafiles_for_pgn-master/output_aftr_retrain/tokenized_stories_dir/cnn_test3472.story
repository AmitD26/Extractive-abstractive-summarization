-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Criminal investigators from the Department of Justice and the Food and Drug Administration were at a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company on Tuesday with a search warrant , a company spokesman said .

FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson confirmed that criminal investigators were on site , but declined to answer questions regarding a warrant .

Also , a fungal infection from Aspergillus was reported in a transplant patient who received cardioplegic solution from NECC , the FDA said . Cardioplegic solution is used to induce paralysis of the heart during open-heart surgery .

`` An investigation of this patient is ongoing ; and there may be other explanations for their Aspergillus infection , '' the FDA said .

The health care facility initially reported two transplant patients having infections from Aspergillus , the FDA said .

The CDC reported Monday the number of meningitis cases increased from 205 to 214 , spread across 15 states .

The cases have been linked to injections of a contaminated steroid , methylprednisolone acetate , produced by the NECC . Some 14,000 people may have received the injections , the CDC estimated last week .

In a letter to the director of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy , leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce noted the FDA sent the NECC a warning letter in 2006 `` detailing significant violations witnessed '' by investigators the previous year .

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick also accused the NECC last week of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide . Plus , the state 's pharmacy board mandated that all Massachusetts compounding pharmacies sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients .

Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord . It is usually caused by an infection , frequently with bacteria or a virus , but it can also be caused by less common pathogens , such as fungi in this case , according to the CDC .

Fungal meningitis is very rare and , unlike viral and bacterial meningitis , is not contagious .

Dr. William Schaffner , chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said fungal infections are not usually mild . He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels , it can cause them to clot or bleed , which can lead to symptoms of small strokes .

In addition to typical meningitis symptoms such as headache , fever , nausea and stiffness of the neck , people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion , dizziness and discomfort from bright lights . Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms , the CDC says .
