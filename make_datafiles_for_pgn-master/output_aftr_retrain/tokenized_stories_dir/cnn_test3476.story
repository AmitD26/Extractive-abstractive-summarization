For nearly 17 years , gay and lesbian soldiers were expected to deny their sexuality under threat of dismissal as part of `` do n't ask , do n't tell . '' With the repeal of the rule on September 20 , 2011 , a new era began for homosexual members of the armed forces .

In December , a group of students at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London , Connecticut , formed a group called the Spectrum Diversity Council , to serve as a gay-straight alliance on campus .

The night before `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' ended , cadets at Norwich University , the nation 's oldest private military academy , held the first meeting of the school 's Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender , Questioning and Allies Club .

These clubs are school-sanctioned , and their numbers are growing , according to cadets and school officials .

`` No one was allowed to ` come out ' in the DADT Working Group , '' Normoyle said , but it was an unspoken secret that many of the members of the group were gay .

Today , Normoyle and Hall are co-leaders of the Spectrum Diversity Council that boasts 60 to 65 members . They say the experience of going to the academy is one they would never trade , but they acknowledge that life is different since the repeal .

`` It 's hard to separate the personal changes from 18 to 21 -LRB- years old -RRB- , but the repeal of DADT was less like flipping a switch . It was n't like one day I 'm hiding my sexuality and denying who I am and the next I 'm out and proud . It was more like a continuum ; I progressed through my own comfort with being gay , '' Hall said .

`` I knew the Coast Guard was what I wanted to do . I knew I wanted to go to the service academy . I wanted to show people that it did n't matter if I was gay ; I could just do my job and make friends . I thought I would put my personal life in the back seat . ''

She found this easier said than done .

`` I felt separated from my friends having to hide something that big , a part of my life , '' she said . `` We have an honor code at the school , and you practically had to lie to people when they asked if you 're dating anybody , if you had a boyfriend . ''

Other cadets have been welcoming , too , Normoyle said .

`` We 've had nothing but positive experiences with our classmates . We had some people coming up and telling us they grew up having negative stereotypes of gay people , but said , ` I know you two , I respect both of you , I 'm trying to break those stereotypes . ' ''

From March 30 to April 4 , the Coast Guard Academy will host Eclipse week , a tradition dating back 37 years to one of the first African-American cadet groups on campus . The week has turned into a diversity week of sorts , according to Hall . He said Spectrum plans to host a roundtable discussion with active-duty members of the Coast Guard on homosexuality in the service .

Hall and Normoyle received their orders last week and will graduate as full members of the Coast Guard at the end of the school year .

Dr. M.E. Kabay , a professor at Norwich University , is the faculty adviser to the Norwich Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender , Questioning and Allies Club . He described how on the last night of `` do n't ask , do n't tell , '' cadets met in the school library for the first meeting of the club . Cadet organizer Josh Fontanez raised all the blinds of the club to symbolize openness to the community .

`` Right from the beginning , the intention was to be open , and that 's what has happened , '' Kabay said . The LGBTQA group at Norwich has even collaborated with a group called Christian Fellowship to foster discussions and understanding , he said .

`` I know I 'm going to be a leader in the armed forces when I leave here , '' he said . `` Norwich teaches us when you see something not right , fix it . That 's what we did . ''

From March 26 through March 31 , the Norwich LGBTQA group hosted what is thought to be the first `` Spirit Week '' on a U.S. military academy campus . The week was full of activities , workshops and discussions focused on anti-bullying , harassment and collaboration . There were HIV screenings , films on acceptance and stereotypes , and even an event called `` the condom olympics , '' which highlighted the importance of safe sex and distributed prophylactics .

The week culminates in a `` Queer Prom '' on Saturday night , consisting of a social that the head of the university and the governor of Vermont will attend , followed by a dance where same-sex couples will obviously be accepted .

`` All these events have an ulterior motive : to show that gay people are people , '' Kabay said . `` For some students , this is going to be an eye-opener . Maybe what they 've been told does n't fit . ''

At the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , the cadets are still getting their group officially approved .

`` The primary purpose of clubs is beneficial to the cadet experience and beneficial to the West Point goal of graduating cadets , '' said Col. Charles A. Stafford , West Point chief of staff . `` We want to graduate leaders who can go into any culture in any part of the world , '' he said , `` having the ability to speak with a diverse group of people and work effectively with different cultures . ''

`` While policies have changed so events like this are possible , I think attitudes have been changing for a long time , '' said Knights Out founder Sue Fulton , who was among the first women to graduate from the academy in 1980 .

The dinner will celebrate the repeal of `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' and the formation of Spectrum at West Point , and it will include cadets , alumni and others , according to Fulton .

Representatives from The Citadel , the U.S. Naval Academy and The Virginia Military institute told CNN they have not been approached with formal requests to start LGBT clubs at their school , but if the momentum started by cadets at other institutions is any indication , it is only a matter of time before they do .
