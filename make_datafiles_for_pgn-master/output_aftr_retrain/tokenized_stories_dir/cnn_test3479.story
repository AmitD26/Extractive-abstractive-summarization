-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Neighbors expressed shock as details emerged Wednesday in the case of a 17-year-old Missouri boy found handcuffed to a stainless steel support pole in his family 's basement . He had been there since September , police say .

Friends and neighbors said the Kansas City teen was mentally challenged , and they were heartbroken to see him taken by ambulance to a hospital .

`` You give birth to this child and you are going to handcuff it and lock it and not feed it and not give him water ? How do you not take care of your child ? '' said Ashley Reppy , who lives close to the family and spoke to CNN affiliate KSHB Wednesday .

The teenager told police that he had been handcuffed in the basement since September , that he was unchained three times a day to go to the bathroom and that he was given only instant oatmeal , Ramen noodles and bologna sandwiches to eat .

Her cousin reported the alleged abuse to a children 's division hot line of the Missouri Department of Social Services , she said . The victim 's older brother had told them that the victim had hit his mother and was `` on permanent house arrest , '' she said .

`` We cried a lot yesterday because we 're friends with him , '' Reppy told CNN affiliate WDAF .

Jim Roberts of the Clay County Prosecuting Attorney 's Office said the victim 's parents have not been charged .

A digital camera and numerous photographs discovered at the home were sent to the Kansas City Regional Crime Lab .

`` State law prohibits release of information specific to a case or individual , so I can not confirm nor deny involvement in a case , '' Rebecca Woelfel , the communications director for the Missouri Department of Social Services , said in an e-mail to CNN .
