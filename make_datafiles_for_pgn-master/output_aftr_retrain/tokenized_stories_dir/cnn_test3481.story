However , when it came time to decide the fate of my sons ' own genitalia , my wife and I bucked the trend and let them live as they were born .

And the American Academy of Pediatrics 's newly revised policy statement will not , in my opinion , make the issue any clearer for expectant parents -- it remains artfully ambiguous . Yet , the revised policy does clearly state that the procedure should be covered by insurance . This will likely lead to greater access to circumcisions , which will surely be heralded by advocates .

Parenting : A history of circumcision

I 'm not worried about the hygiene issues that are potentially related to uncircumcised penises . They are minor and rare . Besides , my boys are lucky enough to be able to bathe in clean water just about every day . I 'll take the time to show them how to clean themselves just as the parent of a little girl must teach her to wash her vagina carefully .

Considering that some estimate a 1.5 percent complication frequency rate among newly circumcised infants , I 'm OK with my boys ' risking the infrequent urinary tract infection .

There is , I suppose , a slightly higher risk of HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections for uncircumcised males . But I trust that I 'll be able to convey the importance of proper condom use when my boys reach the appropriate age .

Should teens make circumcision decision ?

Before the birth of my first son , most of the parental backyard barbecue banter dealt with either aesthetics or tradition . Who was going to opt for the knife -- and why -- had a lot to do with personal preference , it seemed . Practical health issues and religious adherents were rarely , if ever , discussed .

Either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just did n't care if they did n't . There was some talk among the women about whether circumcised penises were `` cuter '' than uncircumcised penises . They could n't agree . While amusing , I did not find any real substance in these discussions .

There is also an argument to be made that circumcision , in effect , mutilates the genitals of a minor without their consent , which strikes me as neither fair nor particularly holistic .

Parenting : Why I decided to circumcise my sons

Thirty percent is a lot closer to the global ratio . So , even if we move away from Portland someday -LRB- and go ahead , make all the Portlandia jokes you want -RRB- , the likelihood that my boys ' penises will be accepted is pretty high .

The day will come when one of my boys will want to know why his penis is different than mine . It has n't happened yet although the oldest is only 3 . When it does , I will look him in the eye and tell him that people did things differently when I was born -- no big deal .
