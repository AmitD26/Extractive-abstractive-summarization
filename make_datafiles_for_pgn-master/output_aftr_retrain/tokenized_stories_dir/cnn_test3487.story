-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former champion Angel Cabrera and America 's Brandt Snedeker are tied for the lead after the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club .

The world No. 1 finished on three-under par , four shots off the lead , but began his day not knowing whether he 'd be competing at all over the weekend following a rule violation at the par five 15th during Friday 's second round .

But having sought an explanation from Woods , the Augusta National rules committee , who described him as `` very forthright '' and `` honest , '' concluded that the four-time Masters champion should incur a two-stroke penalty .

Woods ended up shooting a round of 70 and was n't firing on all cylinders but is now well placed to mount a challenge in Sunday 's final round .

`` I hit it all right today . I missed a few putts here and there . I had a few opportunities to shoot a lower score but the finish was huge - the last three saves certainly kept me in the ball game , '' Woods said .

Woods is tied for seventh place with South Africa 's Tim Clark whose five-under par round of 67 was the best of the day .

America 's Jim Furyk , Ricky Fowler and Steve Stricker are currently tied for ninth at two-under par alongside England 's Lee Westwood and two-time champion , Germany 's Bernhard Langer .

China 's teenage star Guan Tianlang battled his way to five-over par 77 to leave the 14-year-old amateur nine-over par for the tournament .

The Northern Irishman 's round fell apart at the 11th where his approach found the water . He walked off having carded a triple-bogey seven . His ball also found water at the 15th which contributed two more dropped shots before bogeying the 16th to leave McIlroy five over for the tournament .
