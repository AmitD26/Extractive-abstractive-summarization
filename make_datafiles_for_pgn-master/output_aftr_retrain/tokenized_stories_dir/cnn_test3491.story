-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Slovenia 's Tina Maze was crowned World Cup overall champion Sunday -- landing the coveted Crystal Globe with fully nine events of the season still remaining .

The 29-year-old Maze has achieved 1,844 points across all races in all alpine skiing 's disciplines , finishing on the podium 18 times in a season marked by incredible consistency .

She is almost certain to break through the 2,000 point barrier by the end of the season , a feat only once achieved by Austria 's Hermann Maier in the 1999-2000 season .

Maze also won the super-G gold at the recent world championships in Schladming in Austria and claimed two silvers in the super-combined and giant slalom .

She succeeds American Lindsey Vonn as overall champion . Vonn has been sidelined for the season after a nasty fall in super-G at the world championships .

Maze is not resting on her laurels and is targeting the individual discipline crowns in a triumphant year .

`` I will stay focused and try to get all the globes possible and most important to keep that high level of performance until the end of the World Cup season '' , she told the official FIS website .

Meanwhile , Austria 's Marcel Hirscher increased his advantage in the battle for the men 's overall World Cup title with second place in the giant slalom at Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany .

Ligety , who claimed the giant slalom title in Schladming , was only fifth going into the second leg and could not make up the deficit .
