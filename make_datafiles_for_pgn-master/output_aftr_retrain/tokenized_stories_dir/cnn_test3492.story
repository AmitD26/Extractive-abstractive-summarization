Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Daniel Guadalupe stared at the passport application in front of him , dumbfounded .

Details about how immigrants can apply for the program , which administration officials announced last month , have not been released . But already young people are flooding Mexican consular offices around the United States , trying to get the citizenship documents they 'll need from their home country in order to ask for a reprieve from U.S. immigration officials .

This week , Guadalupe waited in a long line at the Mexican consulate in Atlanta before a clerk took his fingerprints , reviewed his documents and helped him fill out the passport form in a language he sometimes struggles to understand .

Most of the people he hangs out with speak English , the teen said , and he only speaks Spanish with his parents .

Getting a passport from a country he barely remembers is the first step to get into college , Guadalupe said . He hopes to study music somewhere in Georgia , the state where he 's lived since arriving in the United States .

But first , he must prove he is a Mexican .

The process is not always simple for young immigrants in the United States who do n't have birth certificates or passports handy , said Abigail Calleja , consul for protection at the Mexican consulate in Atlanta .

`` But let me assure you that nobody will lose -LRB- his or her -RRB- chance to apply for the program because of a passport . We will do what we need to help these kids , '' she said .

`` We are asking them to stay alert to our websites and other places where official information is issued , '' she said .

The Obama administration 's shift last month on the politically volatile issue of immigration policy prompted immediate praise from Latino leaders who have criticized Congress and the White House for inaction , while Republicans reacted with outrage , saying the move amounts to amnesty and usurps congressional authority .

In Mexico , Central American immigrants under fire

Up to 1.2 million illegal immigrants could benefit from the program , according to U.S. government estimates .

More than 58 % of the estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States are Mexican , the Pew Hispanic Center said last year .

`` It will allow me to go to college , to get a job and feel safe here , '' the 18-year-old said as she waited in line to get her picture taken .

Her mother , Rocio Medina , said she brought her children to the United States 10 years ago to give them a better chance to succeed in life and to reunite their family .

`` Their father was already here , and we did n't want to be apart , '' she said .

Now , Medina said she hopes the U.S. program will not only help her children , but also help lead to a change in her immigration status in the future .
