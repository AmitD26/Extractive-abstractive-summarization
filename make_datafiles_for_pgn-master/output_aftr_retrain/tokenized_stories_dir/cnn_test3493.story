St. Joseph Hospital in Eureka said it treated several people for minor quake-related injuries , but none were significant enough for the patient to be admitted .

Chris Durant , a reporter for the Eureka Times-Standard , said he was working on the second floor of the newspaper 's concrete building when he and his colleagues felt the earthquake .

`` We are used to feeling small ones , '' he said , `` but after the first few seconds , we looked at each other and said , ` This is not a small one . ' ''

Eureka resident Cole Machado told CNN he was talking on the phone when he felt the ground shake . `` I thought my TV was going to fall over . ''

Tom Grinsell , the fire chief in the nearby town of Ferndale , said it was `` one of the strongest quakes I remember in quite a while . I assumed it was going to be a lot worse than we 're seeing . ''

Grinsell said officials have asked residents to stay off the roads because of debris , and to conserve water until it 's certain there is no damage to the water system .

Dave Magni , owner of the Ivanhoe Hotel in Ferndale , said , `` We are sitting in a sea of booze '' after the quake .

A 6.5-magnitude quake is considered `` strong '' , said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras , who noted that about 120 earthquakes of that strength are recorded worldwide each year .
