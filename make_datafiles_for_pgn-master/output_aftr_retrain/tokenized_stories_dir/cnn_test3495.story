-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A drug that presents a new way to knock out cancer cells was approved Friday to treat patients with a certain type of late-stage metastatic breast cancer .

The drug , referred to as T-DM1 during clinical research , will now be known by the brand name Kadcyla , the Food and Drug Administration said in its approval announcement . It 's a new therapy for women with HER2-positive breast cancer .

Kadcyla is a combination of the targeted drug trastuzumab -- better known by the brand name Herceptin -- and a powerful chemotherapy drug called DM1 . It 's designed to work when Herceptin alone can no longer keep cancer in check .

DM1 is too toxic to deliver directly into a patient 's bloodstream , like other chemotherapy drugs . The Herceptin part of the new drug homes in on cancer cells , sparing other healthy cells , and delivers DM1 into the cell .

Genentech , the company that developed the drug , is working to get it to patients `` imminently , '' said spokesman Susan Willson . `` As soon as humanly possible , but within two weeks at the outside . ''

Kadcyla will cost about $ 9,800 monthly , which Willson said is `` similar to the cost of other treatment regimens in this line of therapy . '' The estimated cost of a course of Kadcyla -- 9Ã‚ 1/2 months -- is about $ 94,000 .

Experimental drug offers new way to battle certain breast cancer

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women , according to the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth . It 's found in increased amounts on some types of cancer cells . In HER2-positive breast cancers , the increased amount of the protein contributes to cancer call growth and survival . Nearly 20 % of breast cancers have increased amounts of HER2 .

Researchers announced the results of a large three-year clinical trial of Kadcyla in June , saying they were optimistic about it . One significant benefit , according to lead study author Dr. Kimberly Blackwell of Duke University , is the lack of significant side effects and a better quality of life for patients on the drug .

Patients participating in the trial , she said , were the first group for whom officials worried about fixing their hair for media interviews .

An antibody-drug conjugate is described by the company as `` a new kind of targeted medicine that can attach to certain types of cells and deliver chemotherapy directly to them . ''
