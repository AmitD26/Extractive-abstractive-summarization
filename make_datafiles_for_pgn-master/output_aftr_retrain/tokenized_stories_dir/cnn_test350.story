South Carolina Republicans could make state Rep. Nikki Haley their first female gubernatorial nominee . She 's in a runoff against U.S. Rep. Gresham Barrett .

Haley just missed out on winning the nomination outright in the June 8 primary , capturing 49 percent of the vote in a four-candidate field . She was short of the 50 percent plus one needed to take the nomination .

Once facing long odds for the GOP nomination , Haley rose in the polls thanks in part to endorsements by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .

`` The unproven allegations and attacks against Haley actually played right into her message as a new kind of conservative , '' said CNN political producer Peter Hamby , who is in South Carolina reporting on the campaign .

If Haley wins Tuesday 's runoff , she 'll be considered the favorite in the general election against state Sen. Vincent Sheheen , the Democratic gubernatorial nominee . Haley would become the Palmetto state 's first woman governor if elected in November .

In neighboring North Carolina , Secretary of State Elaine Marshall faces off in a Democratic Senate primary runoff against former state Sen. Cal Cunningham , who was recruited by national Democrats . The winner will challenge Republican Sen. Richard Burr in November 's general election .

`` Richard Burr does n't have the strongest poll numbers , but that may not matter , '' said Stuart Rothenberg , publisher and editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .

Voters in three congressional districts and one state Senate district also will cast ballots in runoff contests .

Utah

The fight for the GOP Senate nomination is capturing the spotlight in Utah , and the contest will be another test of the political strength of the Tea Party Express .

The national Tea Party group , which is based in California , is backing and assisting lawyer Mike Lee in the battle to succeed fellow Republican Bob Bennett , who is supporting the other candidate on the ballot , businessman Tim Bridgewater .

Bridgewater and Lee finished first and second , respectively last month at the Utah Republican Party convention , advancing to Tuesday 's primary . Bridgewater and Lee touted themselves as more reliable conservatives than Bennett , who finished third in the voting by delegates , eliminating him from advancing to the primary and ending his chances of re-election for a fourth term . Bennett became the first sitting senator to go down to defeat in a primary season marked by strong anti-incumbent sentiment .

The Tea Party Express , best known for its three national bus tours , is running radio ads supporting Lee . The group recently pumped more than $ 500,000 into the recent fight for the Republican Senate nomination in Nevada , helping transform ex-state lawmaker Sharron Angle , once considered a long shot , into an easy winner in this month 's primary election .

FreedomWorks also has endorsed Lee , and its volunteers are assisting in get-out-the-vote efforts in Utah . FreedomWorks is a nonprofit conservative organization that helps train volunteer activists and has provided much of the organizational heft behind the Tea Party movement .
