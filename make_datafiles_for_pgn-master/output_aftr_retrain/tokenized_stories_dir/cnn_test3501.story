As a media theorist , I used to ignore these business shenanigans . Who cares if these companies are private or public , profitable or in the red ? How many non-Wall-Street-Journal readers even knew what an IPO was back before the Internet created the likes of AOL , Netscape , and Google ?

But the fact is we do now think about the stock market . Many of us are aware that Apple 's market capitalization is fast approaching half a trillion dollars , making it either the largest or second-largest company in the world behind Exxon Mobil - depending on the week . So when we hear that Facebook is preparing for an IPO that will likely dwarf Google 's entrance to the public markets in 2004 , particularly considering that the company does n't sell tangible goods or services in the traditional sense , we ca n't help but wonder what this will mean for the future of Facebook , its users , its competitors , and the greater economy .

This new form of media -- social networking -- will not only redefine the Internet , change human relationships , create a new marketing landscape , and challenge Google , but it will now rescue and alter the economy itself . Like virtual kudzu , it will infiltrate the financial markets , creating new sorts of opportunities for this peer-to-peer `` social '' economy to take root . We will all make our living playing Farmville , or designing new versions of it , or investing in companies that do .

In reality , however , I do n't think we are witnessing Facebook 's victory over the financial markets as much as its acquiescence to them . Yes , Apple challenged Microsoft for software supremacy , just as Facebook now challenges Google for Internet supremacy . But there 's another operating system churning away beneath all this high tech activity , and it 's called corporate capitalism . If a company is big enough -- and that means simply holding enough money -- then sooner or later that money influences the rest of the company 's activities .

Simply becoming a multi-billion-dollar company changes the essence of its goals , activities , and purpose . Its bloodstream becomes filled with cash , and cash has its own agenda . For just like print , TV , or the Internet , money is a medium , too . It has biases , or tendencies , programmed right into it . The kind of money we happen to use -- bank-issued central currency -- is biased toward lending . That 's why we call our system `` capitalism . '' It 's about the capital : Our money is designed to favor those who lend it to others who actually use it to build companies or create value .

The more money a company takes in , the more obligated it becomes to function in accordance with the properties and rules of money . For example , since becoming public , Google has had to prove its devotion to its shareholders ' interests by cutting pet programs , showing earnings ' growth , and demonstrating focus over big dreams . Out with public experiments like Google Labs , in with products like Android try to compete with Apple 's iOS and G + to compete with Facebook . No more touting that employees get 20 % of their work hours to do whatever they want . It 's a real corporation , now , and has to behave like one .
