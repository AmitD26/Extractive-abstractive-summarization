The key question the conservative West Virginia Democrat wants answered is whether a `` minimal change '' to a compromise background check proposal that he co-authored but which failed to gain enough support in a vote last month would entice more senators to support it , the source said .

Since the proposal he negotiated with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania faltered , senators who voted against it have been hounded in their states during the current recess by outside proponents of expanding background checks .

Lafferty asked `` why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school is n't as important '' as inconveniencing gun sellers .

The source said this sort of pressure from outside groups is a key to any hopes of swaying senators who may be open to supporting a modified proposal .

In addition to confronting senators in person , groups have run ads against lawmakers who voted against the Toomey-Manchin compromise and have supported senators who supported it .

The husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting in Arizona , wrote an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle challenging the National Rifle Association over its opposition to expanded background checks .

Thousands of NRA members are gathered in Houston this weekend for its annual convention .

`` We have to figure out some sort of new sentence , one change to it so they can go back and say ` I fought to change this , ' '' said the source .

At this point , however , it is not clear what the change would be .

In order to pass any legislation around the issue , gun control advocates need find 60 votes in the Senate . Fifty-four senators backed the Mancin-Toomey amendment while 46 opposed it . Majority Leader Harry Reid supported it but only voted ` no ' in the end on procedural grounds to keep open the possibility of revisiting it later .

The Senate source says Manchin 's prime targets to flip are all Republicans and similar to those under pressure from outside groups : Ayotte , Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona , Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada .

According to the source , proponents hope that if Murkowski flips , those in favor of tightening gun laws will have a good shot at getting her fellow Alaskan , Sen. Mark Begich , to do the same . But a source close to Begich , however , told CNN that it is very unlikely that he 'd change his vote .

The NRA is likely to be a power that looms large over any deal on background checks , much like it was during the last debate .

`` This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens , requiring lifelong friends , neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution , '' the NRA said .

Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the NRA , made it clear on Friday that his organization would not budge on guns .

In addition to LaPierre , several potential contenders for the 2016 GOP nomination will take the stage in Houston , including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal , Texas Gov. Rick Perry , former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker . Former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin spoke to the group as well .

But she also said that in his first vote , `` Montanans told Max loud and clear they did n't support new gun controls in the previous bill . ''
