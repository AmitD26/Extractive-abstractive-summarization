But the result was somewhat overshadowed by the death of another Godolphin horse , Fox Hunt , in the inaugural Dubai Gold Cup , held earlier in the evening .

However , when it became clear they would not be able to move him out of the way in time for the second lap of the race , the race was stopped and the remaining jockeys gradually pulled their horses up .

Fox Hunt was euthanized , while De Sousa fortunately escaped uninjured after his high speed fall .

There had been more to celebrate in the World Cup itself , Barzalona cementing his reputation for exuberance by rising in his stirrups in celebration well before the finish line , echoing his win in last year 's English Derby .

Godolphin 's Al Zarooni had saddled both Monterosso and Capponi , and told CNN he felt `` incredible '' about the result in only his second full season with Godolphin , Sheikh Mohammed 's vast racing operation .

Sheikh Mohammed himself , speaking exclusively to CNN after the race , said he felt `` doubly happy '' with the result , which saw the World Cup return to Godolphin hands after a six-year absence .

`` We have n't won this race for a few years so to win it really it 's great , great feeling , '' he said
