The affidavit , which was drawn up Wednesday but not made public until Thursday , was prepared by investigators for the state attorney , who charged Zimmerman with second-degree murder Wednesday .

Public documents in the Trayvon Martin shooting

Zimmerman 's relatives say that he did not profile Martin and that he shot him in self-defense . They say Zimmerman killed Martin after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk .

One of the responding officers reported seeing a wound on the back of Zimmerman 's head , and surveillance video appeared to show an injury .

`` Martin then walked back to and entered the gated community and was on his way back to the townhouse where he was living when he was profiled by George Zimmerman , '' the affidavit says . `` Martin was unarmed and was not committing a crime . ''

`` During the recorded call Zimmerman made reference to people he felt had committed and gotten away with break-ins in his neighborhood . Later while talking about Martin , Zimmerman stated ` these a ** holes , they always get away , '' and also said ` these f ****** punks . ' ''

As the incident was unfolding , Martin was on the phone with a friend , the affidavit says . `` The witness advised that Martin was scared because he was being followed through the complex by an unknown male and did n't know why . Martin attempted to run home but was followed by Zimmerman who did n't want the person he falsely assumed was going to commit a crime to get away before the police arrived . Zimmerman got out of his vehicle and followed Martin . When the police dispatcher realized Zimmerman was pursuing Martin , he instructed Zimmerman not to do that and that the responding officer would meet him . Zimmerman disregarded the police dispatcher and continued to follow Martin who was trying to return to his home .

Calls to 911 captured a voice crying for help ; that voice belonged to Martin , according to his mother ; the neighborhood watch volunteer 's relatives have said the voice was Zimmerman 's .

The affidavit says that an autopsy determined that Martin died of the gunshot wound .

Asked Thursday why his client had followed Martin , Zimmerman 's lawyer Mark O'Mara told CNN sister network HLN , `` I know so little about the evidence . ''

O'Mara , who began representing Zimmerman on Wednesday , said they had not yet discussed the facts of the case .

Immediately after the shooting , Sanford police questioned Zimmerman and released him without charges . They said then that there were no grounds to disprove his account that he 'd acted to protect himself .

The affidavit was released the same day that Zimmerman made his first court appearance Thursday , wearing gray jail coveralls and saying little as his arraignment was set for May 29 .

O'Mara did not ask that Zimmerman be released on bond , although he had said earlier that he wanted his client released as soon as possible .

He added , however , that Zimmerman 's safety could be jeopardized if he were released .

The case has triggered a nationwide debate about race in America and about Florida 's `` stand your ground '' law , which allows the use of deadly force in response to a reasonable threat of death or serious injury .

O'Mara said Zimmerman , who will plead not guilty , is worried about getting a fair trial in Sanford -- where thousands had decried the police department 's handling of the February 26 shooting .

Martin 's mother , Sybrina Fulton , released a statement on Thursday seeking to clarify what she had said earlier on NBC 's `` Today . ''

Earlier , Fulton had told NBC , `` I believe it was an accident . I believe that it just got out of control , and he could n't turn the clock back . ''

Prosecutor Angela Corey said she will ensure that the judge or jury deciding the case will get only `` the relevant , admissible evidence on which they can then base their decisions . ''

`` Let me emphasize that we do not prosecute by pressure or petition , '' said Corey , who has a reputation for taking on tough , controversial cases in the three counties that make up the 4th Judicial Circuit .

A second-degree murder charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison .

`` It 's actually a very brave charge of Angela Corey and really shows that she conducted an independent , impartial and fair investigation in this case , '' the attorney said Thursday . `` She could have easily charged this as a manslaughter to try to appease everyone . She did n't . ''

Jurors will have several options under Florida law , including considering aggravating factors such as Martin 's status as a child , Jackson said .

`` He is stressed , '' O'Mara said of his client . `` I 'm just hoping that his mental health stays well and we can move forward with getting the case figured out . ''

Gov. Rick Scott , who appointed the special prosecutor on the case , issued a statement Wednesday calling on Florida 's residents to `` allow our justice system to reach an appropriate conclusion in this case . ''

What happens next

Meanwhile , Attorney General Eric Holder pledged Wednesday that the Justice Department , which launched a concurrent investigation three weeks ago , will `` conduct a thorough and independent review of the evidence . ''
