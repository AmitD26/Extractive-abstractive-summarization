Unfamiliar with the sound , she thought maybe children were throwing rocks outside . Her curiosity drew her to the balcony of the family 's third floor apartment in the quiet Tunis suburb of Menzah , where she found her husband 's colleague standing next to his car , panic-stricken . `` They hit him , '' he cried out .

Belaid had prepared for leadership from an early age . He was a legend of Tunisia 's student movements and eventually founded the leftist Watad party . A lifelong human rights advocate , he championed democratic reform , secularism , and vehemently confronted the rise of radicalism .

`` He was being watched before the revolution . After the revolution he got direct and written threats . The last threats came from the mosques , in which the Imams there called for him to be killed , '' Basma says . `` They always used me and the two girls to threaten Chokri . He used to tell me about these threats in his own way in order not to put fear in us . ''

But as Basma approached her husband slumped in his car , she discovered the worst . `` I found him in the car . It was locked but all the windows were broken . I saw the traces of gunshots , and at that time , my only concern was to save him . But I made sure not to touch anything in the car for the sake of investigation . ''

The assailants , according to witnesses , had waited for Belaid to emerge from his home . As he got into his car , a gunman approached and fired four shots which struck Belaid in the head and chest , then fled by motorcycle with the help of an accomplice driver .

But this was n't just another politically motivated murder in another unstable Arab country . Prior to Belaid 's murder on February 6 , Tunisia had been widely hailed as the poster child of the Arab Spring .

Having ousted Ben Ali and having held free and fair elections , and while their Arab counterparts in Egypt , Libya , and Syria continued to struggle under the rule of dictators desperately clinging to power , Tunisia was setting the precedent for democratic transition in the modern Arab world .

And though President Moncef Marzouki pledged Belaid 's `` odious assassination '' would not derail Tunisia 's democratic transition - it did just that .

Three days of persistent outrage by hordes of Belaid supporters forced Prime Minister Jebali to the negotiating table . He proposed handing over key ministries , such as justice and foreign affairs , to independents in an attempt to form a more inclusive government and avoid further political instability and pledged to step down if his efforts were not successful . But despite gaining broad support from the general public and the opposition , Jebali also succeeded in alienating himself from his party 's most-ardent supporters .

Few Tunisians had probably heard of Basma Khalfaoui before her husband 's death , but in the last two months she has attained rock star status in her country .

`` The number of people who attended the funeral and the spotlight I am put under has increased the amount of responsibility I am feeling . The whole thing has changed the destiny I have chosen , and yet I feel I am in the middle of the way , '' Basma says as she clutches tissues with one hand and constantly fiddles with a charm on her necklace bearing the image of her late husband with the other .

Being a political celebrity was not part of Basma 's plan . She had long ago left her activist life behind to raise her family . Like her husband , Basma was a leader in Tunisia 's student movement in the General Union of the Students of Tunisia , a group of leftist and nationalist students concerned with the rising Islamist presence on campus . Following her time at university , she went on to join the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women , a prominent part of the Ben Ali opposition .

`` The negativity here is that I am a person who dislikes spotlights . My concern is my daughters , but now I feel the amount of responsibility towards the people of Tunisia . I do n't want to collapse , for the sake of Tunisia . I feel proud for spreading courage in the atmosphere . Nahda party wants to spread fear and I want to stop that feeling , '' Basma says .

As she spoke , a local Tunisian TV station was still breaking down its equipment which cluttered her modest apartment . Soon , another would arrive for yet another interview where she would , once again , relive the morning that changed her life . `` Undoubtedly , his death is a loss to me and to our two daughters . To me , he was a husband , friend , colleague in the same party and profession . ''

Later that week , Basma and thousands of supporters donning Chokri Belaid masks and carrying posters bearing Chokri 's trademark mustache and mole , an image which has come to represent the revival of revolutionary fervor in Tunisia , gathered at her husband 's graveside .

Chokri 's father and members of the Popular Front addressed the crowd flooding the Tunis cemetery over a loudspeaker between chants of `` who killed Chokri ? ''

Barbed wire lined the streets as hundreds of Tunisian police , equipped with batons and riot gear , looked on suspiciously . That afternoon , the eager crowd lining Habib Bourguiba Avenue , the birthplace of the Arab Spring , parted as a large truck crept past , draping behind it a giant , cascading Tunisian flag . Coming to a stop in the center of Bouazizi Square , Basma emerged from behind the flag to address to thousands of supporters and well-wishers .

Despite her obvious fatigue , she refuses to rest until those that are responsible for her husband 's death are brought to justice . But buried beneath the sadness and anger , Basma still clings to hope .

`` I still feel optimistic as he was before he died . He once said , `` if they assassinate me , a flower will grow . '' Now , thousands of flowers have grown in Tunisia . ''
