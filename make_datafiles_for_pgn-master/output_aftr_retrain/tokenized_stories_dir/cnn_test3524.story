-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three years ago , when Scott Hamilton moved from New York to Oklahoma for work , his marriage , and all the rights that went with it , dissolved in the transition .

Oh-good-God is right .

How does it make sense that a couple 's love for each other would be recognized by one state and mocked in another ? For lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people , the United States has turned into a complicated mess of 50 Americas -- most of which discriminate against them .

For what other group -- with the possible exception of pregnant women seeking abortions -- are state borders so important ? If you 're Jewish or tall or Christian or black or fat or old or poor or sad ... your fundamental rights as a human do n't change if you drive from the panhandle of Idaho , where same-sex marriage is banned , into Washington state , where it 's legal , or from the yellow plains of West Texas , where employees can be fired because of their sexual orientation , to New Mexico , where LGBT workers are protected from institutionalized bigotry .

But not basic rights to dignity and inclusion .

Some states allow same-sex couples to adopt .

Some states protect LGBT tenants from being evicted because of who they are .

Others , such as Louisiana and Montana , do n't seem to think that matters .

Others , such as Alabama , require teachers to mention `` in a factual manner and from a public health perspective , that homosexuality is not a lifestyle acceptable to the general public and that homosexual conduct is a criminal offense under the laws of the state . '' Never mind that homosexuality is not a crime , as the U.S. Supreme Court held in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003 . And that about half the nation is cool with same-sex marriage these days , a percentage that only will grow with time .

At least then the statutory inequalities would be visible .

It seems LGBT people have already taken notice .

Opinion : Gay marriage , then group marriage ?

A recent Gallup survey of 206,186 people found states with more accepting laws and cultures tend to have higher percentages of openly LGBT residents . Washington , D.C. , for example , which allows same-sex marriage , has a 10 % LGBT population . North Dakota , where laws and the culture -LRB- `` Fargo '' may have something to do with it , too -RRB- are less favorable , is only 1.7 % openly LGBT .

That may be because LGBT people in conservative states are less likely to be open about who they are , particularly with a pollster , Gary Gates and Frank Newport write in an explanation of the survey on Gallup 's website . `` It is also possible that LGBT adults make conscious choices to reside in certain states rather than others , '' they said , `` but this possibility is difficult to assess and seems less likely . ''

Plenty of gay people , Hamilton included , hope the Supreme Court , which is hearing two cases related to same-sex marriage next week , soon will expand rights for same-gender couples in this country . But even in a favorable scenario -- if California 's same-sex marriage ban is invalidated , and if the federal government starts recognizing same-sex marriages -- LGBT people still will be subject to vastly different laws depending on where they live and work . Folks like Hamilton , who moved from New York to Oklahoma , might as well be going from Alaska to Russia .

States , of course , should n't give up their right to self-governance .

But when it comes to civil rights issues , they have an awful history of clinging to laws long past their expiration dates . In 1967 , 16 states banned interracial marriage . The Supreme Court overturned that . Mississippi and others fought against racial integration in schools . But level heads , and courts , prevailed .

I 'm no legal scholar , and I 'm not sure exactly what the best strategy would be for ensuring gay people are seen as equal under the law in all states . But I do know that it 's far too complicated right now .

It has nice big windows , the group told him .

Hamilton turned it down . He worries he would be targeted .

If , heaven forbid , Hamilton were to be victimized because of his sexual orientation and because he 's a leader of an LGBT rights group , Oklahoma 's state laws would n't treat it as a hate crime . On the federal level , as of 2009 , LGBT people are explicitly protected . Kansas , a two-hour drive to the north , lists lesbian and gay people as specifically protected from hate crimes , but does not extend rights to transgender people .

Sounds fair , right ?

Either we live in a nation that supports LGBT equality or we do n't .

But we ca n't have it 50 ways .
