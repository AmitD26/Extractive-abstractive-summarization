Seoul , South Korea -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The main aim of President Barack Obama 's getting-to-know-you meetings with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in California is to build a personal relationship between the men who lead the world 's two most powerful countries .

But they have a lot of thorny issues to discuss , not least the shared challenge of what to do about North Korea .

The two sides will probably repeat well-worn mantras on their desires to see the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the need to ensure stability in the region .

These nine young refugees are unique in that we know their identities and because they got all the way to Laos before being caught and sent back .

But there are thousands more North Koreans who have risked their lives to leave their country , only to be caught in China and forcibly repatriated .

For those suspected of having associated with South Koreans or other foreigners , involvement in religious activities , or attempts to go to South Korea , refugees tell us that the punishment is ramped up to months of forced labor or banishment to a political prison camp . The North Korean government denies human rights violations and has said that the country has `` one of the best systems for promotion and protection of human rights in the world . ''

Tightening security

Vulnerable people

The current heightened crackdown on North Korean refugees should give President Obama the urgency to lead the international community in voicing concern for these vulnerable people , and suggest that the Chinese government 's actions will affect interpretations of what kind of superpower China aims to be , in terms of their emphasis on acting according to international law , humanitarian principles and in the interests of global human progress .

For their part , the Chinese authorities should also take a longer-term , strategic view in their implementation of policy on this issue . Beijing repatriates North Korean refugees to serve the dual goals of preserving their political relationship with Pyongyang and preserving `` stability '' on both sides of the border .

North Korea is changing . The gradual breakdown of centralized control , an unstoppable grassroots capitalism , new information flows , an explosion of corruption and even demographic shifts and the rise of a `` market generation '' mean that the current system is unsustainable in the long term .

Pressure from within

The Chinese government has long wanted North Korea to mimic its own process of economic liberalization and opening , in order to be a more reliable economic partner and improve stability in the long term . This can be seen in the subtle and not-so-subtle hints on the need for reform that are dropped every time a top North Korean official visits their country . But Beijing has been trying this charm offensive for over a decade , and they surely now realize that North Korea 's leaders listen to no foreign government and are impervious to such external pressure .

The only pressure point that can really change the regime 's calculus is the bottom-up pressure from their own society that no authoritarian government can ignore . If North Korean refugees are able to quietly pass through China without being actively hunted down and sent back -- as they were freer to do under a policy of `` benign neglect '' a few years ago -- then they will be able to play this bridge role and increase the pressure for change from within North Korea , which is the only kind of pressure that can effectively force the regime to innovate and adapt their governing system in a sustainable way .

On the other hand , if Beijing follows Pyongyang 's will and unstintingly collaborates in the repression of the North Korean people , they will enable the regime to bunker down , deny change and store up bigger problems for the future . Meanwhile Pyongyang will continue to develop its nuclear weapons and missiles and engage in periodic provocations , unsettling the region and worsening China 's strategic environment , as well as their relationship with the United States , South Korea and Japan .

China will also continue to hemorrhage soft power on this issue , increasing distrust with people of other countries in the region . And if and when North Korea finally does open up or reunify with the South , the people of North Korea will not easily forget the Chinese government 's brazen complicity during decades of their government 's repressive policies . This will create a long-term complication in China 's relationship with either a reformed North Korea or a reunified Korean peninsula alike .

People the world over will watch and hope that the presidents of China and the United States can develop a productive and healthy relationship in order to more effectively deal with the shared challenges that affect much of humanity . But if frank and tough discussions on both countries ' roles in the world can not happen in this setting , then where can they happen ?

The Chinese government is increasingly frustrated with North Korea but has always fundamentally fallen back on preserving the status quo . Obama should urge Xi and others with the power to change China 's direction to reconsider their active cooperation with Pyongyang 's repression of their people , particularly on the issue of forced repatriations of refugees , which only prolongs the denial of an opening which will one day become inevitable .

It is not too late for the Chinese government to chart a new path on the right side of history , and be remembered as a force for positive change in North Korea rather than a collaborator in the regime 's repression . Ultimately , that is not just the right thing to do ; it 's also the smart thing to do .
