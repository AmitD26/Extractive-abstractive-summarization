-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bullets were pinging off our armor , all over our vehicle , and you could hear multiple RPGs being fired , soaring through the air every which way and impacting all around us . All sorts of crazy insane Hollywood explosions were going off . I 've never felt fear like this . I was like , this is it , I 'm going to die .

Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell posted unfiltered blog entries from Iraq about his combat experiences .

When U.S. Army machine gunner Colby Buzzell began blogging about his combat experiences from a military base in Mosul , Iraq , he was n't looking for attention or trouble . Buzzell just wanted a way to chronicle what he saw and did and felt during the Iraq war .

But his visceral , first-hand accounts were a bracing antidote to dry news reports and bloodless Pentagon news releases . In the first major war of the Internet age , Buzzell and other soldier bloggers in Iraq offered readers around the world unfiltered , real-time glimpses of an ongoing conflict .

`` Here 's a soldier in a combat zone ... writing about it and posting it on the Internet . I do n't think that 's ever been done in previous wars , '' Buzzell said .

`` It just provides another perspective that no embedded journalist can ever do , '' said the veteran , now a freelance writer in San Francisco , California , and the author of `` My War : Killing Time in Iraq . '' `` An embedded journalist is just there observing . But a soldier writing about it -- you ca n't get more embedded than that . '' See an interview with Buzzell ''

A suburban skateboarder with punk-rock sensibilities , Buzzell had no background in creative writing before he joined the Army in 2002 . Inspired by a Marine buddy and burned out by a string of dead-end jobs , he signed up after a smooth-talking recruiter offered a signing bonus and sold him on the Army `` like it was some -LSB- expletive -RSB- Club Med vacation . ''

Parents of troops in Iraq wrote to thank him for helping them understand their children 's wartime perspective . One reader said they found Buzzell 's blog more informative than the war coverage in The New York Times . Buzzell even heard from a sympathetic Iraqi in Baghdad who prayed for his safe return to America .

But almost nobody -- not even Buzzell 's wife -- knew that he was the blogger .

The Army confined Buzzell to the base and began monitoring his posts . Then , after he posted an anti-Iraq war rant by Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra , they ordered him to stop blogging .

`` We 're actually entering an era of transparency , where we need to have our soldiers talk . It does open up risks . Once you post something , you ca n't get it back . But we trust our soldiers with a lot , '' she said . `` They are our best spokespersons . They know what the life of a soldier is like , and it 's important to convey that to the American people . ''

Blogging also helps soldiers process traumatic combat experiences that can be hard for them to talk about , Kyzer said .

The war cost Buzzell his marriage and left him with post-traumatic stress disorder , a diagnosis that helped him avoid being redeployed to Iraq last spring . Now 32 , he contributes regular features to Esquire magazine and hopes to write another book , the contents of which he 's not ready to discuss .

Buzzell is no fan of the Iraq conflict , although he 's heartened that active-duty soldiers are still reading `` My War . ''

`` Looking back now , I do n't think we had any business -LSB- in Iraq -RSB- , '' said Buzzell , who wants to see President-elect Barack Obama end the war . `` Hopefully , he gets us out of Iraq in a way that 's not a disaster or that gets a lot of soldiers killed . ''
