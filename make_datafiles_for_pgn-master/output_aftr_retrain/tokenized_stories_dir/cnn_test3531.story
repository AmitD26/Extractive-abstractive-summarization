-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sarah Murnaghan , the 10-year-old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national policy , is up and walking .

The girl was helped by a physical therapist .

Sarah , who turns 11 on Wednesday , was born with cystic fibrosis . She was on the transplant list for children 's lungs for 18 months .

Sarah was n't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young ; the agency that oversees transplants , the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network , had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs .

The organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates . The change is effective for a year , when it must be approved by the board of directors .

The original transplant on June 12 at Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia reportedly went smoothly but that evening '' ... an emergency code blue was announced . Sarah 's vital signs had begun descending rapidly as her new lungs started to fail , '' her family said in a statement .

The girl underwent surgery immediately and was transitioned to a bypass machine that took over the function of her heart and lungs , the statement continued .

Although the donated lungs were infected with pneumonia , `` Each day since -LRB- the second transplant -RRB- , her lungs have improved on X-ray and have continued to work better and better , '' the statement said .
