ADRE , Chad -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly 100 children at the center of an international scandal that left them stranded at an orphanage in remote eastern Chad returned home after nearly five months Friday , and were being reunited with their families .

Some of the children who were nearly abducted by a French charity , pictured in Abeche in November 2007 .

During the ride , the bus broke down when its radiator burst .

Those accompanying the children were concerned about rebels causing trouble along the way , but that concern turned out to be unfounded .

The 97 children were taken from their homes in October by a then-obscure French charity , L'Arche de Zoe -LRB- Zoe 's Ark -RRB- , which claimed they were orphans from Sudan 's war-torn Darfur region . Watch as children prepare for return home . ''

The group , which registered under the name `` Children 's Rescue '' in Chad , planned to place the orphans with foster families in France .

But Chadian authorities stopped the group just before its first planeload of children departed Abeche , after it was discovered that most of the children -- who range form age one to 10 -- were from Chad and had at least one living parent .

They were initially sentenced to eight years of hard labor in Chad , but were taken to France and jailed there after French President Nicolas Sarkozy intervened by flying to Chad and appealing directly to President Idriss Deby .

Although UNICEF and other agencies rapidly determined the children were Chadian , finding their parents was an arduous process , as little paperwork on them could be found .

Those efforts were hampered by a February offensive in the capital , N'Djamena , by rebels attempting to oust Deby .

Six of the children remained in the Abeche orphanage after it was determined they were from Darfur . Their future is unclear .
