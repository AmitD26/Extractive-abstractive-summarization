Mingo County Sheriff Walter E. `` Eugene '' Crum was eating lunch just blocks away from a courthouse when he was gunned down , officials said .

The suspect parked his car close to the sheriff 's SUV and shot through the window twice , hitting the sheriff twice in the head , according to a state official who was briefed on the investigation .

Maynard remained hospitalized Wednesday night after undergoing surgery to treat multiple gunshot wounds , Baylous said .

Investigators were still trying to identify a possible motive . On the way to the hospital , Maynard spoke with police , but Baylous did n't specify what he said . Authorities were hoping to speak more with Maynard now that he 's out of surgery .

`` He said some things to us , and we 're still trying to make sense of it , '' Baylous said . `` It could be interpreted in different ways . ''

At a news conference Wednesday , officials said Crum had taken office as sheriff in January and quickly earned respect from many in the community .

Crum also served as a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor 's office , Hubbard said .

The sheriff 's slaying shook the rural county , which normally sees only one or two slayings per year , said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff 's Office .

`` It 's devastating , '' Hatfield said . `` It 's a big blow to the community . ''

The Williamson Daily News reported that Crum was in his vehicle in downtown Williamson when a man drove into the parking lot , approached Crum 's sport-utility vehicle and shot him point-blank .

Crum was married and had children and grandchildren .

Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin issued a statement , saying in part , `` Our thoughts and prayers are with the Crum family . ''
