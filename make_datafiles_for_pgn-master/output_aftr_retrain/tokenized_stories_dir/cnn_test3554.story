In one crash , all three people on a Med-Trans helicopter died when the aircraft crashed in a field near Ventura , Iowa , Wednesday evening . The chopper had been en route to pick up a patient at an Emmetsburg , Iowa , hospital , authorities said .

Earlier in the day , an Air Methods helicopter crash landed near Seminole , Oklahoma , injuring the four crew members on board . There was no patient on the aircraft .

But problems have continued . Sixteen people died in medical aircraft crashes in 2010 , another three in 2011 , and three last year , according to records released by the National Transportation Safety Board .

Officials say the pressure to quickly respond in various conditions -- at night , in foul weather -- makes these operations inherently dangerous .

Wednesday 's fatal in Iowa crash occurred as a helicopter for Mercy Medical Center , operated by Med-Trans , went down about 9 p.m. . The dead were identified as nurse Shelly Lair-Langenbau , paramedic Russell Piehl , and pilot Gene Grell with Med-Trans .

`` They were each selfless health care professionals devoted to the delivery of emergency medical care , '' Dan Varnum , president of Mercy North Iowa , said in a statement .

Authorities said that the helicopter did not issue a Mayday warning and that it is too early to know the cause of the crash . It is not known whether weather was a factor , but Cerro Gordo County Sheriff Kevin Pals told CNN that the blacktop road was ice-covered when he arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the crash .

Both the Federal Aviation Administration and the NTSB are investigating .

According to an NTSB database , Med-Trans helicopters were involved in two nonfatal crashes in 2012 . In both cases , the helicopters sustained substantial damage . The Dallas-based company operates about 60 aircraft at bases in 18 states , according to its website .

The tail rotor and other parts of the tail broke away from the rest of the aircraft in the crash .

Air Methods Vice President of Corporate Development Craig Yale said he could n't comment on the circumstances of the crash because of the active investigation but said all of the injured were stable and some had been released from the hospital .

Yale attributed the total to the high number of flights they operate and noted that four of the deaths were on another company 's helicopter involved in a midair collision .

Air Methods has a dramatically lower rate of fatalities than the rest of the industry , he said , but it operates about half of the medical flights in the United States .
