Marketed as `` the future of fashion design shows , '' NBC 's `` Fashion Star '' premiered Tuesday . And despite mixed reviews , the Elle Macpherson-hosted show manages an innovative feel by borrowing bits and pieces from existing series .

In other words , if `` Project Runway '' and `` Shark Tank '' were one show , that show would be called `` Fashion Star . ''

`` In 2012 , there are so many channels and reality shows out there , it 's hard to come up with a concept where everything is completely new , '' said Steve Carbone of RealitySteve.com .

On the new NBC series , aspiring designers try to sell their fashions to retailers , just like entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to potential investors on ABC 's `` Shark Tank . '' Similarly , the network 's other brainchild , `` The Voice , '' found success by adding rotating chairs and teams to `` American Idol 's '' winning formula . -LRB- The model originated in the Netherlands as `` The Voice of Holland '' in 2010 . -RRB-

Based on `` The X Factor 's '' recent shake-up -- judges Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger and host Steve Jones all got the boot -- it 's clear audiences preferred the likes of `` Voice '' mentors Christina Aguilera , Cee Lo Green , Adam Levine and Blake Shelton .

While Hank Stuever of The Washington Post said the show deserves a shot for it its `` originality and conceptual pizzazz , '' the Los Angeles Times ' Mary McNamara wrote : '' ` Fashion Star is NBC 's attempt to refurbish ` Project Runway . ' ... It gets old really fast . As in , halfway through the pilot . ''

`` Fashion Star '' joins past and present fashion programs like `` 24 Hour Catwalk , '' `` Launch My Line , '' `` The Fashion Show '' and CBS 's short-lived `` The Cut . ''

This could be why the many `` Bachelor '' copycats , from `` Joe Millionaire '' to `` More to Love , '' have n't experienced the same success as ABC 's long-running franchise , which now includes `` The Bachelorette '' and `` Bachelor Pad . ''

`` The best kind of knockoff show just uses an existing idea as a jumping-off point , '' Dehnart said . '' ` The Voice ' succeeded and ' X Factor ' failed because , while ` The Voice ' borrowed from ` American Idol , ' its format was new , different and interesting . And ' X Factor ' was far too similar to what we already saw and grew tired of . ''

But do n't count the impending singing shows out just yet , Dehnart warns .

`` Success has less to do with whether a show is a knock-off than how compelling it is by itself , '' Dehnart said . `` On some level , ` American Idol ' was a knockoff of the shows that preceded it , like ` Star Search . '

Do n't forget , `` The Real World '' featured seven or eight strangers living under the same roof for 17 years before `` Jersey Shore '' came along .

`` Copycat shows are n't unique to reality TV , '' Dehnart said . `` Back before ` Survivor , ' networks were churning out ` Friends ' clones . ''

As long as new shows continue to add unique elements to existing reality programs , it seems they 'll have a shot at ratings gold .

After all , imitation is the sincerest form of flattery .
