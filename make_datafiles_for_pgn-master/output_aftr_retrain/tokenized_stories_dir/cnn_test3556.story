WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Twenty-six alleged members of a Hispanic gang believed to be one of the nation 's largest and most violent were indicted in North Carolina and charged with offenses including drug activity , racketeering , assault and murder , according to federal court documents .

Police arrest a suspected MS-13 member during an April operation targeting the gang in El Salvador .

A 55-count indictment was returned by a Charlotte , North Carolina , grand jury Monday and unsealed Tuesday .

It alleges that since 2003 , the members of Mara Salvatrucha , or MS-13 , committed four murders ; trafficked cocaine and marijuana ; and committed multiple robberies and assaults , among other crimes , the Department of Justice said in a written statement .

`` Today 's indictment is merely the latest sign of the gang 's reach , and it shows the breadth and seriousness of the crimes that MS-13 members are alleged to have committed , '' Attorney General Michael Mukasey said Tuesday in Charlotte .

The four murders occurred in Greensboro and Charlotte , North Carolina , authorities said .

Federal law enforcement sources said that while the arrests were taking place in North Carolina , Salvadoran authorities carried out related raids on gang leaders in that country .

MS-13 has long been regarded by law enforcement as one of the deadliest gangs in the United States and beyond . It is estimated to have up to 50,000 members worldwide , about 10,000 of whom are believed to be active in at least 38 American states , according to an attorney general 's report to Congress on gangs in April . In 2004 , the FBI created a task force that focuses specifically on it .

`` Members smuggle illicit drugs , primarily powder cocaine and marijuana , into the United States and transport and distribute the drugs throughout the country , '' the report said . `` Some members also are involved in alien smuggling , assault , drive-by shooting , homicide , identification theft , prostitution operations , robbery and weapons trafficking . ''

In 2007 , the Justice Department announced that it had charged other MS-13 leaders with federal racketeering crimes . Among suspects named in those charges were two men who authorities said ordered murders in the United States from their prison cells in El Salvador .

Most MS-13 members are immigrants from El Salvador or children of Salvadoran immigrants , federal authorities said in the indictment . The gang originated in Los Angeles , California , but has spread across the United States as well as into Mexico , Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador .

Last year , for instance , the FBI and El Salvador 's National Civilian Police joined to create the Transnational Anti-Gang center . FBI anti-gang agents were posted in the nation to work side-by-side with the National Civilian Police , Mukasey said Tuesday . He added that the anti-gang center was `` instrumental in the investigation that led to today 's operation here in Charlotte . ''

Anti-gang centers are planned for Honduras and Guatemala , Mukasey said .
