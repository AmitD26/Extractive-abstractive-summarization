A gas-compressor and gas-holder station in Mryn , Ukraine . Gazprom said it had cut supplies to Ukraine Thursday .

Gazprom has reassured the rest of Europe that its natural gas supply , which runs through Ukraine , will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev . Thursday , a Gazprom spokesman said on Russian state television the company had actually increased the deliveries to the rest of the continent .

`` Gazprom will continue supplying gas for its consumers in Europe at full volume , '' the company 's chief executive , Alexey Miller , said . `` We have an effective transit contract . ''

Without natural gas , some Ukrainians could be in for chilly days and nights .

Ukraine 's state-controlled energy company , Naftogaz Ukrainy , said Thursday it is ensuring domestic natural gas needs are covered by taking gas from underground storage facilities .

`` The United States would like to see a restoration of normal deliveries , '' White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said . `` The parties should be resolving their differences through good-faith negotiations , without supply cutoffs . ''

Ukraine , which currently pays about $ 100 per 1,000 cubic meters , balked at the figure offered , saying it simply ca n't afford to pay the new price .

It is the second time in three years Gazprom has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine . The company made good on its threat on January 1 , 2006 , but turned the supply back on a day later .

Russia is the world 's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine .

Although gas is still flowing to Europe , there are also concerns in Russia that the amount could be reduced if Ukraine siphons off some of the gas headed to the west .

Naftogaz said it will continue negotiating with Gazprom to address the issues .
