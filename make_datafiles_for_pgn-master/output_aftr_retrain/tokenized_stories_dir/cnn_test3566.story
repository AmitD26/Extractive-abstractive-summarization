Uganda is Africa 's second-biggest exporter of coffee beans , currently producing around 3.4 million bags per year . Yet instead of being refined locally , the vast majority of the country 's raw beans have been traditionally exported in the consuming countries of the West for processing .

`` The hard part was saying , ` look , I think as Africans we need to begin to look at ourselves as a solution to some of these problems of systemic poverty and underdevelopment . We have blessed soils , you guys have a commodity which is of great value , '' says Rugasira , recalling his first meetings to convince the farmers in Uganda 's Kasese district .

`` We can pay you a premium price ; we can also add value to your knowledge ; we can help train you ; we can set up savings and credit co-ops and we can really work together and begin to own the value chain which is historically being controlled outside the producer country .

`` We needed to change that -- and through trade we could bring prosperity to our farmers and their communities . ''

Over the last nine years Good African Coffee says it has built a network of more than 14,000 coffee farmers , who are organized into 280 farmer groups . The company , which is the first African-owned coffee brand to be available in British supermarkets , has also helped local farmers to set up several savings and credit cooperatives .

'' -LRB- It 's -RRB- about empowerment and it 's also about ownership , '' says Rugasira . `` It 's about owning the value chain , growing the coffee , processing it at source and it 's about exporting a finished product , '' he adds .

`` So we retain the value , which means we can employ people , we can pay taxes , we can prosper our farmers and their communities . And that 's the only sustainable way in which societies have prospered -- by moving from low-value agriculture into high-value manufacturing industrialization . ''

At the heart of all of Rugasira 's efforts is his strong belief in the transformative power of self-help . In trade , and not aid , he says , is where Africa 's future well-being lies .

`` Every society and economy that 's prospered has done it through their own hard work , ingenuity , dedication and commitment , '' he says .
