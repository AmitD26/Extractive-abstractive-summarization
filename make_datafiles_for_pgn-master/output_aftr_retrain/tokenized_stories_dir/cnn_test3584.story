Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Supreme Court offered its tentative endorsement of so-called `` organizing agreements '' between unions and for-profit companies , with some justices saying on Wednesday the longstanding practice can encourage good labor relations .

Unite Here independently spent more than $ 100,000 in an ad campaign supporting the measure . It also agreed not to strike or boycott . The casino in return allowed union members onto the premises , gave them employee contact information , and agreed to remain neutral in the organizing campaign .

But Justice Elena Kagan said , `` I would have thought that the premise and the policies of the labor laws are to encourage a wide variety of employer/employee agreements , '' she said . `` The idea is to get these parties together to reach agreements on a wide variety of things that matter to them , regardless whether the labor law specifically refers to that . ''

Section 302 of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 makes it a crime for an employer to `` pay , lend or deliver ... any money or other thing of value '' to a union that wants to represent its workforce .

Several justices suggested the casino and the union were engaged in a quid pro quo , but were not sure that amounted to an exchange of something of `` value . ''

`` I mean , the union would n't promise that for nothing , '' said Justice Antonin Scalia . `` It would get something in exchange such as , in this case , the right to go on the employer 's property to recruit union members or some other thing of value from the employer , right ? ''

But Richard McCracken , Unite Here 's lawyer , said this neutrality agreement and the $ 1000,000 ad campaign were like so many others , including the pending deal to build a massive oil pipeline through the middle section of the United States .

Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed to agree , telling Messenger that his client 's views run `` contrary to years of settled practices and understandings . ''

Unite Here represents about 265,000 active members in the United States and Canada , mainly in the hospitality , food service and manufacturing industries .

The case is Unite Here Local 355 v. Mulhall -LRB- 12-99 -RRB- . A ruling is expected by the spring .
