More Americans expected to hit the road for Thanksgiving

Everyone wants a safe , happy holiday , so we asked workers on the front lines of the Thanksgiving crush for their hard-earned tips for smooth travels .

As Thursday rolls closer and the roads get more crowded with impatient drivers , Pask would like them to stay clear of larger trucks .

Knowing that 80,000 pounds is barreling along in the lane beside you , why would you ever cut off a semi ?

Another tip : If you ca n't see her mirrors , she ca n't see you . And she ca n't ever see any cars that ride in tandem with her on the right side . `` That 's one of our major blind spots for small vehicles passing us on the right , '' she said . `` It 's a really dangerous spot to be . ''

Leave enough time for traffic jams

During the holidays , `` there are an awful lot of accidents , '' said Fran Ehret , a toll collector on the New Jersey Turnpike for 26 years and now president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 194 , which represents the turnpike toll collectors .

`` Leave enough time to get where you 're going so you 're not having to drive too fast , '' she said .

`` You do n't want to pull into an E-ZPass lane if you 're paying cash , '' said Ehret . You could cause traffic delays , and `` you 'll get a bill with a fee attached to it . ''

And please do n't yell or curse out your toll collector or your fellow drivers because traffic is heavy or lanes are merging into the toll plaza . Pay your toll and drive on !

Research air travel security rules

TSA officers Jackie Fitzpatrick and Charles Link promise they do n't want to take away your pies . Really .

`` We know there 's pressure to make that plane or you 're traveling with family or bringing special foods you do n't want to get squished , '' said Fitzpatrick .

Video games fall under the laptop rule and must be placed in a separate bin as they go through security machines . And snow globes ca n't be larger than a tennis ball .

If you 're getting a head start on Christmas , do n't wrap presents beforehand . The TSA may have to unwrap gifts , which could be sad if your child sees the light saber that Santa is bringing him .

Do n't overpack

Southwest Airlines flight attendant Barb Pool can spot the travelers who have overpacked and rushed to get to the airport in time .

`` Do whatever it takes to not stress , '' said Pool , who often celebrates the holidays in advance with her family . `` People get on a plane and are stuck for so many hours . It 's not a fun journey if you 're stressed . ''

Pool tends to find joy in many of her flights , whether it 's holding a baby as nervous parents stow their bags , talking to military personnel heading home on leave , or helping people with disabilities get settled .

`` Most of the time they 're preoccupied , but every once in a while they 'll offer to take you home for Thanksgiving , '' she said . `` Elderly people especially realize you 're not going to be with your family . ''

She also knows that something larger might be stressing out her customers .

`` Everyone 's not always traveling for happy events , '' she said . `` They might be fighting tears . It could be their first year without a spouse or they 're going to a funeral . Everyone 's not going to Grandma 's for dinner . I try to be extra sensitive to it . ''
