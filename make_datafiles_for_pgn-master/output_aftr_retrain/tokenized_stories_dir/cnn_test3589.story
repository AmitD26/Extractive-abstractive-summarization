Tacloban , Philippines -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Efren Penaflorida was grateful when Typhoon Haiyan bypassed his home in Cavite City , Philippines .

But when he saw the devastation in other areas of the country , he wanted to do all he could to help his fellow Filipinos .

`` I was crying watching the news , '' said Penaflorida , the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year . `` It really sank my heart , seeing all the people who lost their loved ones , houses . They lost everything . ''

Penaflorida immediately began collecting donations at his mobile `` pushcart classrooms , '' which he uses to educate poor children in the country . But he wanted to do more .

So he reached halfway around the world to Doc Hendley , a North Carolina clean-water activist who had also been honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009 .

After a disaster strikes , access to clean water is vital to help prevent the spread of disease . Hendley , who has responded to humanitarian crises in Darfur , Haiti and Syria , had just started assessing how his nonprofit , Wine to Water , might help the Philippines when he received Penaflorida 's e-mail .

`` I was already thinking that maybe I should go , '' Hendley said . `` When he shot me the e-mail ... he sealed the deal .

`` Our organization depends on relationships with people on the ground ... -LRB- and -RRB- what better relationship than with Efren ? ''

The next day , both men helped volunteers assemble the filters and pack 120,000 meals donated by Stop Hunger Now , one of Hendley 's partner organizations . Then they headed to Tacloban , in the heart of the devastated area , to deliver the filters .

Penaflorida said that the destruction was worse than he 'd seen on television , but he soon found reason to take heart .

He originally planned to return home for the Thanksgiving holiday , but he now intends to stay until early December .

`` I could n't be home for a nice Thanksgiving dinner and pretend like nothing happened , '' he said . `` There 's too much we have to do . ''

Penaflorida returned home Wednesday to focus on a new project : bringing his pushcart classrooms to the devastated areas to help educate children while the communities rebuild . The country 's minister of education has expressed strong interest in the large-scale replication of the program , Penaflorida said , and asked him to assess the feasibility during his visit . Penaflorida hopes work can begin in the coming weeks .

Robin Lim , the American-born midwife named CNN Hero of the Year in 2011 , has strong ties to the Philippines ; her mother was Filipino . So after the storm , she brought food and medical supplies . She has also been working with local clinics to provide assistance to pregnant women , new mothers and young children .

Unexpectedly , Hendley and Penaflorida ran into Lim as they traveled from Manila , an impromptu Heroes reunion of sorts . Hendley now plans to provide water filters to Lim so she can distribute them to the women and children she is helping .

Dr. Laura Stachel , a 2013 Top 10 Hero , has also provided Lim with one of five `` solar suitcases '' that she has donated to the relief effort . These portable kits provide essential power to medical clinics .

Team Rubicon , a group of military veterans that responds to natural disasters , was on the ground within days of the storm . The group , founded by 2012 CNN Hero Jake Wood , has 43 volunteers in the Philippines providing medical care , opening supply lines and helping repair a field hospital in an area west of Tacloban .
