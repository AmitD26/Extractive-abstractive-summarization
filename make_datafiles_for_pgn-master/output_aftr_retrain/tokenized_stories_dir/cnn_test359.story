Amateur video emerged last week showing Israeli police officers holding down and punching 15-year-old Khdeir , a high school sophomore from Florida .

The shocking footage prompted outrage from his family and calls by the U.S. government for a full and transparent investigation .

The young man 's killing came after three abducted Israeli teenagers were found dead in a field in the West Bank , sparking an upsurge in tensions in the region .

Israeli authorities say Khdeir was among a group of youths who attacked police during the riots . He is currently under house arrest at a relative 's home after being released on bail by a court .

The Israeli Department for the Investigation of Police -LRB- DIP -RRB- said Thursday that after an investigation into the incident , it had found evidence to suspect one of the officers of committing `` serious violent offenses '' while Khdeir was handcuffed .

`` I was attacked by police . I woke up in the hospital , '' he said as he walked out of court in Jerusalem on Sunday , sporting two black eyes and a swollen lip .

`` I just saw somebody running at me , so I tried to run away , '' he told reporters .

His mother has said the family intends to sue Israeli authorities over the matter .

CNN 's Tal Heinrich reported from Jerusalem , and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong .
