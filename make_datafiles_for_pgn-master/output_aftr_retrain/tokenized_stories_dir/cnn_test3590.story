Chardon , Ohio -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The cafeteria table where the deadly Ohio high school shooting began became a somber memorial for grief-stricken students returning for Friday first full day of classes since the incident .

A boy at Chardon High opened fire on Monday and killed three classmates . Two other students were hospitalized and another was grazed by gunfire .

The shooting rocked the school and the community of 5,100 people located 30 miles east of Cleveland . Teens heading back to their daily routines noticed some changes designed to reassure and calm them .

The cafeteria was repainted and tables were rearranged to give the room a different look . The table , with its fake woodgrain top , chrome legs and bench seats , sits perpendicular in the cafeteria , a counterpoint to the way the other tables are arranged .

`` Everyone is here for each other , '' Szalay said . `` But a lot of us are moving on . ''

The person who authorities say is responsible , 17-year-old T.J. Lane , was charged Thursday afternoon with three counts of aggravated murder , two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault , the latter related to the student who was `` nicked in the ear '' by a bullet , according to Geauga County Prosecuting Attorney David Joyce .

Some students were with their parents in the school on Thursday and counseling has been made available at various locales since the shooting .

Frank Hall , an assistant football coach and study hall teacher who chased the gunman from the school , said Thursday it was important that students and staff return -- if for no other reason than to `` show that terror and evil do not win out . ''

`` I 'm here to tell you that tomorrow our schools will be open , our teachers will be there , our administration will be there , our parents and community , but more important our children will be there , '' said Hall .

Meanwhile , the legal process continues .

Joyce , the prosecuting attorney , filed charges against Lane around 3:40 p.m. Thursday in juvenile court . The defendant 's next court appearance will be March 6 . A hearing scheduled for March 19 will discuss a motion to transfer his case to an adult court .

The murder charges state that the teenager `` purposely and with prior calculation and design '' fatally shot three people while at Chardon High .

By the time the bloodshed ended , three were killed : Daniel Parmertor , 16 , who died Monday ; Demetrius Hewlin , 16 , who died Tuesday morning ; and Russell King Jr. , 17 , who was declared brain dead Tuesday .

This is not Lane 's first brush with the law , according to juvenile records released by authorities this week .

When he was 15 , Lane was charged with juvenile assault for putting his uncle in a choke hold and punching him in the face , according to an incident report from the Geauga County Sheriff 's Office .

The report stated that Lane 's aunt called 911 in December 2009 to report the boy and his uncle `` were physically fighting '' -- and , at one point , the teen teamed up with his then-16-year-old brother , who himself was later charged with simple assault . Two sheriff 's deputies arrived to find the uncle `` bleeding from the mouth and ... on the kitchen floor . ''

At the time , Lane was in his grandparents ' custody , according to the complaint .

Lane 's driver 's license was recently suspended for two and a half months after he was ticketed for `` failure to control '' a vehicle . The license was reinstated in early February upon his completion of a mandatory driver improvement program , records show .

`` I think there 's a lot of kids that go through things like that . That does n't give them the right to kill other people , '' said Bob Parmertor , Daniel Parmertor 's grandfather . `` There are five families , including ours , that have been affected by this . No one has the right to shoot other people because they 've had a rough life . ''

At an earlier news conference Thursday , relatives of two of the slain children described what the boys were like .

`` He would never do anything bad to anybody , '' Dominic Parmertor added . `` He was going to change the world . He was an amazing individual . ''

Phyllis Ferguson , mother of Demetrius Hewlin , said her son donated his organs . His death was `` not in vain , '' she said . `` For his one life , he gets to change eight lives . ''

Ferguson said she did n't do that on Monday , because Demetrius was running late .

Ron Parmertor , Daniel 's uncle , called on young people to watch out for potential signs on social media that someone they know may be troubled .

If something posted on a social network `` does n't look right , tell your mom and dad , tell the police , tell a counselor , tell a neighbor , tell a friend . Just tell somebody , '' he said .

And , he added , to anyone who is having trouble dealing with the tragedy : `` Please talk to somebody . ''
