JOHANNESBURG , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Reggae legend Lucky Dube , one of South Africa 's most famous musicians , was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative 's house , his record label said Friday .

Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans .

Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans , and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa 's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend .

News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers , knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days .

Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris .

Gallo Records called the death `` senseless and random , '' and it was not clear whether Dube 's attackers knew who he was .

`` It 's very sad , '' said Mark Sutherland , London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine . `` He 's a big loss to the South African music business . -LRB- He was -RRB- one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists . ''

Born outside Johannesburg in 1964 , Dube was named `` Lucky '' by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies .

`` Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist , he was a personal friend , '' Haarburger said . `` It 's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically . ''
