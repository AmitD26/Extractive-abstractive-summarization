Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The wave of anti-Japanese protests currently sweeping across China has its roots in history but more recently can be traced back to April , when the firebrand governor of Tokyo announced plans to buy a group of islands claimed by Japan , China and Taiwan .

Spying an opportunity to assert Japanese control over the Senkaku islands , or Diaoyu as they 're known in China , Governor Shintaro Ishihara launched an online appeal fund to buy them from their private owners .

Ishihara has a long history of making inflammatory comments about China , so much so that in 1999 , when he was appointed Tokyo governor , Japan 's then chief cabinet secretary , Hiromu Nonaka , sought to reassure China that relations would remain `` friendly . ''

Before taking office , Ishihara was a well-known author whose name became famous in his early twenties after writing `` A Season of the Sun , '' which won Japan 's most prestigious literary prize .

He 's an outspoken nationalist who in the past has cast doubt on historians ' account of the 1937 Rape of Nanking , in which hundreds of thousands of Chinese were killed by Japanese troops .

What was China 's reaction ?

Back in June , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin dismissed Ishihara 's attempt to buy the islands as `` irresponsible , '' and repeated China 's ownership claim .

`` The Diaoyu Islands are China 's territory since ancient times , '' he said . `` The willful talk and action of some Japanese politicians is irresponsible and tarnish and smears Japan 's reputation . ''

When did the Japanese government step in ?

Faced with the prospect of the islands falling under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo metropolitan government , the Japanese government stepped in with its own bid for the disputed islands .

On September 11 , Japan 's Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura confirmed that the government had approved the islands ' purchase from private owners for 2.05 billion yen -LRB- US$ 26.2 million -RRB- .

`` The Senkaku Islands are an inherent part of Japanese territory , historically as well as under international law , so there 's no territorial claim issue between the two countries , '' he said .

China responded by dispatching six patrol ships to the surrounding waters , ignoring a warning from the Japanese coastguard not to approach . They entered the disputed waters for a short time before leaving , Japan 's coast guard reported .

At a press conference , Ishihara said of the Chinese patrols : `` We 'd better shoo off those who walked into someone 's home in dirty shoes , we should shoo them away . ''

`` I think China has gone crazy . We ca n't put up with their attitude like Mine is mine , but yours is mine too , '' he added , in quotes that appeared on the Tokyo Metropolitan government website .

While the verbal sparring between the Chinese and Japanese governments has played out in a series of statements , protesters from both sides have been taking direct action to assert their countries ' control over the islands .

In late August , Japan deported 14 Chinese protesters who were arrested after five swam ashore the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands and waved the flags of China and Taiwan . Nine others aboard the waiting vessel were also detained .

China says its claim extends back hundreds of years . Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey , so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895 . Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers . The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further .

The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war . But in 1972 , Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa .

The islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their legal owners would also have the right to fish surrounding waters .

What happens now ?

The Chinese government has been calling for restraint and `` rational patriotism '' when it comes to public protests . The United States has also weighed in on the issue with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta urging `` calm and restraint on all sides . ''

As Panetta spoke , Noda was telling senior government officials to stay on their guard in dealing with mass anti-Japanese protests , according to Japanese news agency Kyodo .

Meanwhile , the prospect of economic sanctions has been raised in a strongly worded opinion piece in the state-controlled China Daily newspaper .

Jin Baisong wrote that World Trade Organization rules could be used to limit export of `` important materials '' to Japan .

`` The global financial crisis increased Japan 's reliance on China for its economic well-being . So it 's clear that China can deal a heavy blow to the Japanese economy without hurting itself too much by resorting to sanctions , '' said Jin , deputy director of the department of Chinese trade studies at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation , which is affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce .
