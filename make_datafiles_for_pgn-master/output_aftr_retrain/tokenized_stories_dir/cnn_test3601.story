When I entered Harvard College as a freshman in 1980 , it happened to coincide with a new requirement -- all institutions receiving federal funds had to become fully accessible under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 .

I was a 17-year-old lifelong wheelchair-user , born with a neurological condition called spinal muscular atrophy . I 'd never walked or stood and my arms were weak as a baby 's . But , as my parents often said , there was nothing wrong with my head .

To be sure , Harvard had had students with disabilities before me . But those students had to make do , bearing or circumventing access barriers without complaint . After all , it was a centuries-old campus . How much could one expect ?

I , on the other hand , had rights -- and expectations . I challenged the university in a whole new way .

The timing was a coincidence , one I was n't entirely comfortable with . I remember meeting with university officials the summer before my freshman year got under way . We discussed every detail of my life and needs . What was the width my widest wheelchair ? Did I take baths or showers ? How much space around a toilet did I require for transfers ? Boxers or briefs ? -LRB- Just kidding . -RRB-

I also had to pre-pick classes so Harvard could ensure mine would be held in accessible classrooms , of which there were too few . If I changed my mind , I could be out of luck .

My parents had insisted on my attending `` regular '' schools at a time when that was unheard of . In the 1960s , according to government statistics , only one in five disabled kids was educated in a public school -- usually a separate -LRB- dare I say `` segregated '' ? -RRB- special-ed school . The majority stayed home or got sent off to under-regulated residential institutions .

They knew separate was n't equal , but they had no legal recourse . I ended up at the only private schools willing to take a kid in a wheelchair . It 's no exaggeration to say that for many years I assumed I was simply too dumb for my parents ' first-choice schools .

Today , of course , it 's completely different . After countless pieces of legislation , reauthorizations , government commissions and legal rulings , wheelchair ramps and lifts , Braille and recorded books , sign-language interpreters , `` shadow teachers , '' and other accommodations are commonplace in schools as they are elsewhere .

Nevertheless , how the demographics of education has changed became especially clear to me recently when my kids ' school held a `` diversity day . '' -LRB- My kids do n't have disabilities , but some of their classmates do . -RRB-

I boldly volunteered to lead a discussion about people with disabilities . To my surprise , I was n't the only one .

Kids do n't always appreciate this . For them , the return to the school year is a ritualized obligation . What a shame so few understand it as a right and a privilege to be celebrated -- a proud and hard-won victory .
