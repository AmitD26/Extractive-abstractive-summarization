Imagine the marketing potential of their twin titans battling it out down the stretch at major championships for years to come , bedecked , of course , in Nike gear .

Woods , the world No. 2 , did n't fare any better , losing to Charles Howell III . The other two top seeds , South Africa 's Louis Oosthuizen and England 's Luke Donald , the world No. 3 , went safely through to round two .

McIlroy squandered early chances against Lowry , who came to life on the back nine , chipping in for birdie at 11 and 12 before an eagle at 13 put him in the driving seat .

The Northern Irishman won 16 to reduce the deficit to one shot but Lowry , ranked 68 , held firm to sink a four-foot putt at the last to claim a famous triumph .

`` I did n't make enough birdies in the end , '' McIlroy told the PGA Tour 's official website . `` Shane had a nice little stretch around part of the back nine . I hung in there , but I just did n't do enough . ''

`` I 'm feeling quite good now , but it 's important not to get too high now because it 's only the first round , and I 've got another match tomorrow . ''

Woods was naturally disappointed in defeat but was pleased with his performance . `` I played well , I really did , '' Woods said . `` I hit a lot of good shots out there .

Elsewhere , defending champion Hunter Mahan moved into the second round after a comprehensive 5 & 4 victory over Matteo Manassero .

Donald , the 2011 champion , fought hard to beat Germany 's Marcel Siem on the final hole while fellow Englishman , and European Ryder Cup hero , Ian Poulter beat Stephen Gallacher 2 & 1 .

Graeme McDowell edged a close game with Padraig Harrington , Jim Furyk defeated Ryan Moore while 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson and 2012 U.S. Open winner Webb Simpson moved into round two .

There were other high-profile departures in the form of 2011 U.S. PGA champion Keegan Bradley , Lee Westwood and 2012 British Open winner Ernie Els .
