Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The image lasts just four seconds , flashed on the screen during the opening sequence of a Filipino news program posted online .

It 's of an elderly man kneeling on a church pew , his lips moving as though in prayer , and it 's given new hope to a woman in Hong Kong who has n't heard from 30 members of her family since Super Typhoon Haiyan smashed into Tacloban in the Philippines last Friday .

`` We think this is my uncle ! They look identical ! '' Daisy Nemeth wrote in an email to CNN , after receiving an overnight message from her sister , Merceditas Tan Ã˜stergaard , in Denmark , who 's been scanning online news in the hope of seeing a familiar face .

The lone , elderly man in silent prayer bears a striking resemblance to 68-year-old Rogelio Tan , the patriarch of the sprawling Tan family who all but disappeared during the storm .

`` She was staring at the video clips and he was there in one of them . But his wife was n't and his children were n't , '' Nemeth said from her home in Hong Kong , her joy of seeing her uncle tempered by the thought of those who were n't there , or could n't be seen .

The church withstood the storm , though its towering spire has been stripped of its roofing , as has most of the main building . Yet , it was there that the man suspected to be Tan can be seen praying , as he has done countless times before . His family lived just streets away .

`` You think about what 's going to happen when you find them , that it 's going to be relief and joy and happiness and it was n't , '' she said . `` I checked them off the list and moved onto my uncle . And now I 've checked him off the list , now I 'm moving on to someone else . There 's so much going on , feeling relief is impossible in this situation . ''

Her thoughts have now turned to her other cousin , Rogelio Tan Jr. , his wife Vanessa , and their three young children , aged from four to eight years old .

The Super Typhoon hit the Philippines coast just before 5 a.m. last Friday , flattening buildings , swamping homes and businesses with flood water and leaving a trail of destruction authorities and locals are still trying to comprehend .
