-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New ships , expanded technology and pop culture phenomena are some of the factors making 2014 an alluring year for a vacation at sea .

The traditional wave season booking window can be a great time to snag a deal such as 2-for-1 fares , on-board credits and suite upgrades , according to online cruise guide Cruise Critic , but it does n't always reflect rock-bottom pricing .

`` The first tip for saving money is not to primarily focus on saving money , '' Spencer Brown says . Good value comes from not only getting the right price but also in finding the right trip for your vacation needs and preferences .

Once you 're on board , amazing add-ons can boost your experience , but they usually come with a hefty price tag . Check to see if your cruise line offers any advance-purchase deals for dining , alcohol or spa treatments . And `` keep an eye out for specials advertised in the daily program , '' Spencer Brown advises , as those can be big money savers .

12 months , 12 amazing adventures

Stick to a set budget for a la carte purchases for a vacation free of financial surprise and use the on-screen feature on your cabin TV to track your daily spending . `` Be sure to resolve any concerns before the final day , '' Spencer Brown says .

Creating exotic and intimate experiences

Cruise ships are getting a warm welcome in Asia , where Cruise Lines International Association says 3.7 million passengers per year are expected by 2017 . From the wilderness of the Russian Far East to ports in Myanmar and Malaysia , there 's an emphasis on taking passengers to places far off the beaten path . Singapore , Hong Kong , Thailand and Japan are also beckoning cruise ships .

What 's more , exotic destinations can also equal top cruising value , according to Spencer Brown .

`` Destinations like Japan , Norway and Australia offer exceptional value for money , as exploring them by land tends to be extremely expensive , but traveling by cruise ship costs much less and is often more convenient , '' she says .

The Cruise Critic editor also flags the Panama Canal as a hot spot ; it turns 100 this year , with a new visitors ' center ready to welcome cruise passengers .

Offering shorter -- and longer -- voyages

To attract first-timers wary of an entire week at sea , cruise lines are offering more weekend-length cruises .

At the same time , lines have realized that sometimes , the typical shore excursion does n't allow enough time to revel in all that a port has to offer , so itineraries have changed . For example , Norwegian and Royal Caribbean spend more than a day in Bermuda , Carnival ships stop overnight in Nassau , Bahamas , and a Seabourn sails with a three-day stopover in St. Petersburg , Russia .

Every year brings new vessels designed to convince landlubbers of the advantages of a journey at sea . While this year brings fewer `` mega ships '' than in the past , innovation remains in the forefront on ships of all sizes .

Here is a handful of this year 's newcomers :

• Quantum of the Seas : This Royal Caribbean ship gets the `` wow factor '' award , with a skydiving simulator , bumper cars , an aerial viewing pod and inside cabins with `` virtual balconies '' thanks to giant LCD screens showing an ocean view .

• Norwegian Getaway : The Broadway musical `` Legally Blonde '' will be on board as well as the line 's signature special-effects magic show . Miami pop artist David `` Lebo '' Le Batard was commissioned for the ship 's impressive hull art , which features a whimsical mermaid .

• Avalon Waterways ' Illumination : This is one of three Avalon Suite Ships coming out in 2014 ; each features two decks of panorama suites with wall-to-wall windows , complimentary Wi-Fi and alfresco dining options .

• Regal Princess : An adults-only pool , a glass-enclosed `` SeaWalk '' extending 128 feet over the water and balconies for all outside cabins are among the highlights on this 3,560-passenger vessel .

• Pearl Mist : All 108 staterooms have private balconies on this new luxury ship being built for Pearl Seas Cruises . What 's more , a dozen of the cabins were built for solo travelers .
