But then the lights went out in the Superdome , and Twitter really heated up .

The year 's most-watched sporting event , interrupted by a 35-minute delay in the third quarter , may forever be known as the #Blackout Bowl . The bizarre interlude seemed to energize the San Francisco 49ers and the Twitterverse , which until then had been complaining about the one-sided game .

Twitter said its volume of chatter spiked during the blackout , reaching 231,500 tweets per minute . In total , there were 24.1 million tweets posted about the game and its halftime show , said Twitter in a blog post . By the beginning of the second half , Twitter said its volume of tweets had already surpassed last year 's total for the whole game .

We by no means saw all of them , but here are some of our favorites :

James Burnett -- The guy refereeing Puppy Bowl IX must be thinking , `` I did not get into broadcasting to call ` poopy penalty ! ' with a straight face . ''
