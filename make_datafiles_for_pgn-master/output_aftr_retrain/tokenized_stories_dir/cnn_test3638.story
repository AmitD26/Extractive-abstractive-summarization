-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The `` fastest man in rugby '' is to remain in the sport after resisting overtures from a major National Football League -LRB- NFL -RRB- team to sign for British team Glasgow Warriors .

Carlin Isles built his reputation playing for the U.S. in the HSBC Sevens World Series , where his searing pace helped him score 27 tries in 14 tournaments .

The former track athlete caught the attention of NFL franchise the Detroit Lions , who signed Isles to a practice contract in December .

But Isles has opted to commit his future to rugby , moving from sevens into the 15-a-side version of the sport with the Warriors -- who play in the Rabo Direct Pro 12 competition with teams from Scotland , Ireland , Wales and Italy .

Isles has n't ruled out representing the U.S. sevens team , known as `` The Eagles '' , in future tournaments , but for now he is focused solely on playing for Glasgow .

The Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend , a veteran of 82 Test matches with Scotland 's rugby union team , is excited by the potential of Isles -- who clocked a time of 4.22 seconds for the 40-yard dash while training with the Lions .

`` This is a major coup for the club and a very exciting prospect , '' said Townsend .

`` It 's very exciting to be moving to the 15-a-side game , '' he added . `` It 's a lot different to sevens but I want to work hard and do everything I can to succeed .
