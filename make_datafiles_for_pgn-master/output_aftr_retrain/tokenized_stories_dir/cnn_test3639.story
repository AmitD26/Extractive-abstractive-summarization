The sheriff 's technical crew , which is also examining security video seized in the search , are looking for any evidence of Bieber `` bragging or making fun of '' the incident , Thompson said .

`` We 're looking for anything that has to do with this particular incident , '' the detective said .

Deputies at the Lost Hills Sheriff 's Station , which serves an affluent section of Los Angeles County just east of Malibu , have become familiar with Bieber , 19 , since he moved into a $ 6.4 million home two years ago .

Neighbors have dialed 911 several times to complain that the teenage multimillionaire was speeding down their residential streets in his high-performance cars . One neighbor accused Bieber of spitting in his face during a heated confrontation last March . Deputies have responded to complaints about loud parties at Bieber 's place .

Except for warnings , nothing was done . The Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office concluded that they could n't prove the spitting or speeding cases in court , so they declined to prosecute .

Prosecutors also rejected a misdemeanor battery complaint from a photographer who accused Bieber of attacking him in the parking lot of a Calabasas shopping center as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend , Selena Gomez , in May 2012 .

`` We did n't do this search warrant to send a message , '' Thompson said Tuesday . `` That 's not what we do , but we hope maybe that understanding the gravity of this will change some of the behavior . ''

Lil Za 's lament

Deputies found suspected illegal drugs `` in plain view '' of Lil Za when they entered his bedroom in Bieber 's home , Thompson said . He was arrested on a felony drug charge . To make his bad day worse , he was also charged with felony vandalism after allegedly busting the telephone in the jail while he was waiting to be bailed out .

Za tweeted this Thursday : `` Honestly , the media is making me someone I 'm not . But only those in my shoes can relate . ... These ppl get paid to make you look bad . Some stuff I 've done has been wrong yes . but look at the position I 'm in and the color of my skin . Cocaine ? Really ? All this time I was home in tx nobody gave a f--k about what Za is doing . . soon as he gets to La he 's all over the news . ''

Thompson initially said the Texas native was found with cocaine , but later said the drugs were suspected to be Ecstasy -- aka Molly -- and Xanax .
