-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner admitted two years ago to sending explicit messages and photos to women online , his wife was notably absent , letting Weiner make his public mea culpa alone . But on Tuesday , Huma Abedin was front and center as Weiner confessed to having further explicit exchanges , even after the first scandal forced his resignation from Congress .

Abedin , 36 , is no stranger to politics . She has worked for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for years and accompanied her husband on the campaign trail in his current bid for New York City mayor .

She had her first news conference on Tuesday , however , and she admitted to being nervous -- but it was her moment to defend her husband of three years and describe her struggle to forgive him .

Soul-searching Weiner seeks forgiveness

Weiner admitted in June 2011 that he had sent sexually explicit messages and photos to women online . He apologized for initially claiming they were n't his and said he was seeking treatment , and he resigned from the U.S. House two weeks later .

The couple had a baby boy in December of that year .

In his afternoon news conference , Weiner admitted that some of the online exchanges and photographs were his but said some were from before his resignation and some were after .

Abedin said Tuesday she knows her husband made `` horrible mistakes '' both before and after his resignation from Congress .

From intern to State Department

When Clinton became secretary of state , Abedin served as a top aide to her . She remains a Clinton adviser .

Although she is described as a very private person , Abedin 's intelligence , striking style , unusual background and ability `` to make the trains run on time '' brought her attention well before her July 2010 marriage to Weiner .

Vogue magazine profiled her in 2007 , an unusual distinction for a campaign aide .

Abedin is the daughter of college professors . Her late father , an Islamic scholar , was from India and her mother , a sociologist , was from Pakistan . She was born in Kalamazoo , Michigan , but the family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was 2 . She moved back to the United States to attend George Washington University .

Abedin 's plans changed when the White House intern program assigned her to the first lady 's office , not the press office as she had requested .

She 's not been far from Clinton since then , friends say .

Her efficiency , language abilities , attention to detail and remarkable ability to pack for long trips -- noted by the Vogue reporter -- make her invaluable to the globe-trotting Clinton .

The Vogue story hinted in 2007 that she had dated actor John Cusack and cyclist Lance Armstrong . Abedin was introduced to Weiner during the 2008 congressional campaign .

Former President Bill Clinton officiated at their wedding . Their marriage drew extra attention because Abedin is Muslim and Weiner is Jewish .

Weiner rose through New York City politics as a young man unafraid of a fight and eager for media attention . Abedin , in contrast , is known for her diplomacy and privacy .

Abedin said she has long kept her personal life private , and no one is more surprised than she is to see herself out on the campaign trail .

`` So why am I doing this ? Because Anthony has always been a smart , caring , and dedicated person , and while he 's the same public servant who wants what 's best for the people he represents , he is now something else -- a better man , '' Abedin wrote .
