Srinagar , India -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Indian security forces Friday enforced a strict curfew in Srinagar and other major towns of Indian-administered Kashmir to stymie protests sparked Thursday when four civilians were shot and killed by the paramilitary border security force .

Nonetheless , people staged protests at several places , sometimes clashing with the security forces . Two people were wounded in the clashes and were evacuated to hospital , according to police .

The shooting erupted after scores of protestors attacked a security force camp Thursday morning , said the minister of state for home , Sajjad Kichloo .

In addition to the four killed , 40 people were reported wounded .

The villagers were protesting the alleged beating of the imam of a local mosque by the security force , officials said .

India 's home minister , Sushil Kumar Shinde ordered an investigation into the incident after the state chief minister , Omar Abdullah , spoke to him .

`` It is highly unacceptable to shoot at unarmed protesters just because they were reportedly protesting manhandling of an imam of their area , '' Abdullah said in a prepared statement . `` There is no justification or rationalization of this deplorable act . This shocking act warrants and demands the severest of condemnation in the strongest possible terms . ''

On Friday , Abdullah , chaired a Cabinet meeting that sanctioned an extraordinary ex-gratia relief payment of `` rupees five lakh , '' or more than U.S. $ 8,000 , to the next of kin of each of those killed .

The Cabinet , apart from `` extending condolences to the bereaved families and sympathies with those injured in the firing incident , condemned the excessive use of force . ''

Traffic on the lone highway connecting the landlocked Kashmir valley to rest of the country remained suspended Friday , according to traffic police .
