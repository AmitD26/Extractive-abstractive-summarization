An angry U.S. senator introduced legislation Friday to cap compensation for employees of any company that accepts federal bailout money .

Under the terms of a bill introduced by Sen. Claire McCaskill , D-Missouri , no employee would be allowed to make more than the president of the United States .

`` We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer , '' an enraged McCaskill said on the floor of the Senate . `` They do n't get it . These people are idiots . You ca n't use taxpayer money to pay out $ 18 billion in bonuses . '' Watch McCaskill 's heated words ''

McCaskill 's proposed compensation limit would cover salaries , bonuses and stock options .

McCaskill 's proposal comes three days after struggling banking giant Citigroup -- which has taken about $ 45 billion from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program -- reversed plans to accept delivery of a $ 42 million corporate jet . The company changed its mind under Treasury Department prodding .

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani defended corporate bonuses Friday , saying that cutting them also means slashing jobs in the Big Apple .

`` If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy , it really will create unemployment , '' he said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' `` It means less spending in restaurants , less spending in department stores , so everything has an impact . ''
