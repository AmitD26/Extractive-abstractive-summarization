The accusations come in a lawsuit filed by Brad and Melan Davis -- who said the fraudulent activity , such as double billing and submitting false invoices , occurred while the security firm , now known as Xe , carried out its work in Iraq , Afghanistan and in Louisiana during Hurricane Katrina 's aftermath .

Melan Davis , who was involved in record-keeping , said Blackwater billed the government for prostitution services in Afghanistan from a Filipino female , whose name was on Blackwater 's payroll roster under a category called `` Morale Welfare Recreation . ''

She said Blackwater billed the woman 's plane tickets and monthly salary to the United States .

`` The allegations are without merit and the company will vigorously defend against this lawsuit . It is noteworthy that the government has declined to intervene in this action , '' Xe said in a statement to CNN .

The married couple filed suit in December 2008 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia under the False Claims Act . It was unsealed this month .

Blackwater would continue to retain `` wholly incompetent '' personnel so they could pay their tuition bills to the company 's private training facility , the suit said .

In Louisiana , where Blackwater was contracted to supply security services after Katrina , employees there `` submitted a variety of bogus receipts , '' the suit said .

`` For example , Blackwater employees , when filling up Blackwater vehicles at commercial gas stations , would simply pick up the receipts that were left behind by other customers . They would then submit these receipts and be paid in cash by Blackwater . ''

The suit said Blackwater overbilled for travel expenses and `` created phone invoices to obscure the fact that Blackwater had failed to keep any of the necessary contemporaneous documentation on travel . ''

The suit said Melan Davis attempted `` to blow the whistle on the fraud and abuse occurring in New Orleans '' and was told in 2006 she `` needed to back off . '' The suit said she was fired in 2008 when `` she was on leave battling cancer . ''
