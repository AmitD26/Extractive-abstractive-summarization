-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- George Zimmerman , charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , had a `` little hero complex '' but was not a racist , a Sanford , Florida , homicide investigator told federal agents , according to reports released Thursday .

The reports and other information in the case against Zimmerman were released Thursday by Special Prosecutor Angela Corey to Zimmerman 's attorney .

The U.S. Department of Justice took up a civil rights investigation after allegations that race played a part in the killing of Martin , 17 , in February in a gated community in Sanford , Florida . The reports released Thursday do not draw conclusions in that investigation .

The 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer has said he killed Martin in self-defense , saying the teen punched him and slammed his head into a sidewalk before the shooting , according to family members and police .

Trayvon Martin memorial removed but preserved

Among the evidence released Thursday are details about federal interviews with more than 30 people , including key members of the Sanford Police Department and Zimmerman 's neighbors and co-workers .

`` Serino believes that when Zimmerman saw Martin in a hoody -LRB- sic -RRB- , Zimmerman took it upon himself to view Martin as acting suspicious , '' the report said . `` Serino described Zimmerman as overzealous and as having ` a little hero complex , ' but not as a racist . Serino explained that on numerous occasions he asked Zimmerman specifically if he followed Martin based on his skin color and Zimmerman never admitted to this fact . ''

In June , Sanford police said Serino had voluntarily asked to be moved from detective to patrol officer . At the time , police Sgt. David Morgenstern said the move was not a demotion and that he did not know why Serino made the request .

Many of Zimmerman 's neighbors , whose identities are redacted , told federal agents they did not know him . Those who did had nothing derogatory to say about him .

A timeline of events

Another FBI report documents a March 30 interview with a store owner who contacted authorities to say Zimmerman had contacted him about two weeks earlier `` in reference to purchasing a new firearm . '' Zimmerman told the owner , whose identity was redacted , that `` his life is in danger and he needs more guns , '' the report said . It was unclear from the report whether Zimmerman purchased the firearm .

The dispatcher tells officers to look for a `` black male , late teens , wearing a dark gray hoodie and sweatpants , walking around , '' adding that the youth was last seen running toward the back of the neighborhood .

Then , says the dispatcher , `` There 's screaming and a gunshot , are you responding ? '' Dispatchers later tell responding officers they have received a total of four calls regarding the incident . `` Someone 's laying in the backyard , '' a dispatcher says .

`` The fact I wear a hoodie does n't justify you killing me , '' he told Burnett .

Additionally , details about Zimmerman 's MySpace account , surveillance video and e-mails between Zimmerman and ousted Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee were released as part of the evidence handover .

He adds that he has not had a positive view of Sanford police because of the `` Sherman Ware incident . '' Ware , a black homeless man , was beaten by a Sanford police lieutenant 's son . Zimmerman was critical of police handling of the case and reportedly worked on Ware 's behalf .

Zimmerman was released on $ 1 million bond last week . An initial bond of $ 150,000 was revoked last month after a judge learned that Zimmerman and his wife failed to disclose more than $ 150,000 in donations from the public .
