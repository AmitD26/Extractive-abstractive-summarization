The family has designated Tuesday as `` Go Purple '' day . It 's the survivor 's favorite color and the family is asking supporters to wear it .

The family has asked that the victim not be named for her safety and because she is a minor .

The campaign has raised more than $ 42,000 toward its goal of $ 250,000 , and has also resulted in an outpouring of homemade purple hearts to be delivered to the girl and her family .

`` The messages that people are including in their hearts , the time and effort that they 're putting into some of these projects , it was absolutely incredible , '' Dana Hoffman , a family friend and spokeswoman and one of the organizers of the Hearts for Healing campaign , told CNN 's `` New Day . ''

The girl 's family said it is `` overwhelmed by the outpouring of love from the surrounding community , across the country , and even overseas . ''

The ordeal began May 31 when the girl went into the woods near her home in Waukesha to play hide-and-seek with two of her friends .

Who is Slenderman ?

A bicyclist found the wounded girl alive .

The 12-year-olds are being charged as adults , and bail is set at $ 500,000 for each , Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel said .

The recovery

The victim is sleeping better at night , her family said . But she gets tired and overwhelmed easily .

`` She spent time watching many episodes of ` Full House ' alongside her ` guard pets ' , which consist of a family dog and two cats . Like any older sister , she has also managed to continue teasing her younger brother . ''

`` I was taken aback by the strength this little girl has , '' Hoffman said .
