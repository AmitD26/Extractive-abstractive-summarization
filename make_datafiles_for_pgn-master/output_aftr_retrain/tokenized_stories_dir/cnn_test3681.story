-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Flying JetBlue Airways ? You might have to wait until your flight crew rests up if your travel includes Boston 's Logan International Airport or the three New York City-area airports .

JetBlue , the only airline to say publicly that the new pilot rest rules contributed to its cancellation of flights during this week 's winter blast , had asked regulators for a delay in implementing the changes .

FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said that JetBlue last year requested an extension to the January 4 , 2014 , implementation deadline .

JetBlue was the only airline to request an extension , she said . The FAA denied the airline 's request .

Lindstrom said Tuesday that the new scheduling rules related to pilot rest time `` are a factor , not a driver , in our recovery from two winter storms and JFK infrastructure issues . ''

Statements from the airline on Monday suggested the pilot rules were a bigger factor in the carrier 's near-halt in the Northeast .

`` In the midst of us repairing those schedules disrupted by this week 's winter storms , we 're facing an additional challenge as new FAA rules went into effect for crew rest , '' she wrote . `` These rules further impact our ability to operate an already disrupted schedule , causing our pilots to ` time out ' even sooner . As a result , additional cancellations are likely to occur as we work to reset the operation . ''

More than 400 JetBlue flights were canceled Monday , with 120 flight cancellations on Tuesday , the airline said .

The FAA announced the pilot changes in December 2011 , and they went into effect Saturday . Pilot fatigue became a top priority for the Department of Transportation , which oversees the FAA , after the February 2009 crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 near Buffalo , New York . The new rules require a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots before their flight duty period , which can range from nine to 14 hours , depending on the start time and the number of flight segments and time zones crossed .

`` The rules are necessary for passenger safety , -LRB- and -RRB- the airlines have had years to prepare , '' he said .

At the end of the day , `` the airlines really ca n't withstand irregular events like these , '' Kelly said . `` They have really bad emergency management plans in place . ''
