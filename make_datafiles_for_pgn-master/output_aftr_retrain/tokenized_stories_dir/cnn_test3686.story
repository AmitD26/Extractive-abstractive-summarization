-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Reaction was swift when the website TMZ released an audio recording in which a man purported to be Donald Sterling , the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers pro basketball team , made racist remarks .

The n-word was n't used , but the male voice on the audio recording complained that his girlfriend posted Instagram photos of herself with black men , including former pro basketball star Earvin `` Magic '' Johnson . `` Do n't bring him to my games , '' the male voice commanded .

Current and former players castigated Sterling . Talking heads called for the National Basketball Association to kick him out of the game .

A basketball team puts five players on the floor . In that spirit , here are five of the key players in the Sterling controversy :

Sterling , 80 , has made a fortune as a lawyer , real estate developer and entrepreneur . He 's the longest-tenured team owner in the NBA .

Sterling has n't commented extensively since the audio recordings were released , but a Clippers official said Sterling is `` emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with , nor does it reflect his views , beliefs or feelings . ''

These questions might overshadow the on-court drama of the NBA playoffs in coming months .

She calls herself an artist , writer , chef , poet , stylist and philanthropist . Sterling 's wife calls her a mistress and a gold digger .

Rochelle Sterling filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano , accusing her of targeting extremely wealthy older men .

3 . Kevin Johnson

Johnson , 49 , has credibility on at least two levels .

Pro basketball players respect him because he 's a former all-star in the NBA , having played 12 seasons in Cleveland and Phoenix . He 's also enjoyed political success as mayor of Sacramento , California , since 2008 . He 's the city 's first African-American mayor .

Before the Sterling controversy broke , the NBPA had asked for his guidance in finding a new executive director for the group . On Saturday , the NBPA asked him to help `` determine our response and our next steps '' to the Sterling situation .

Johnson jumped right into the fray and listed five demands of the NBPA . Expect to hear more from him .

4 . Chris Paul

Chris Paul serves as president of the NBPA . He also happens to play for the Los Angeles Clippers , the team owned by Sterling .

Paul , 28 , has been circumspect in his public comments , issuing a three-sentence statement on the NBPA website . But he did quickly ask Johnson to become involved .

It would be difficult to play basketball at a time like this , but that 's exactly what Paul must do . The Clippers looked out of it on Sunday in losing to the Golden State Warriors in the playoffs .

Even if you do n't follow basketball , you may know Paul from his Allstate insurance advertisements , in which he plays twins , one athletic and one nerdy .

This could be a make-or-break moment for the NBA 's new top dog .

A lawyer , Silver took over from David Stern , who served for three decades and oversaw tremendous growth in the sport . Silver has worked for the NBA since 1992 in various leadership jobs .
