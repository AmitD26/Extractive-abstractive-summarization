-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Roger Federer added fuel to the paternity leave debate as he crashed out of the Rome Masters just eight days after welcoming twin boys to his clan .

Federer will be back on nappy changing duties sooner than he may have expected after losing 6-1 3-6 7-6 -LRB- 6 -RRB- to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy Wednesday .

It was the 32-year-old father of four 's first match back since the birth of Lenny and Leo -- brothers to twin girls Charlene Riva and Myla Rose .

`` They told me to come here and play , '' Federer told reporters at Foro Italico . `` So I said ` OK , if you do n't want me around , I 'll go away ! I miss them a lot already . ' ''

`` The plan is that they can come on tour , '' he added . `` At least we know how to handle kids on the road .

`` I am aware it 's going to be a lot of work but at the same time it 's something I 'm really looking forward to . ''

There were victories on the Rome clay Wednesday for Britain 's Wimbledon champion Andy Murray , Germany 's Tommy Haas and Russian Mikhail Youzhny .

Spanish eight-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal opened his Rome title defense with a tough 7-6 6-7 6-2 victory over Giles Simon of France .

In the women 's draw , Venus Williams had her comeback from illness curtailed by Spain 's Carla Suarez Navarro .

The seven-time grand slam winner now has to manage her tennis career after the effects of Sjogren 's syndrome , a debilitating autoimmune disease .
