Pastor denied the prosecution 's request to increase Murray 's bail , which is now set at $ 75,000 .

The lawyer for Michael Jackson 's estate issued a statement on behalf of the co-executors .

`` The judge 's ruling ordering Dr. Murray to stand trial for the death of Michael Jackson is perfectly appropriate given the testimony in this case , '' Howard Weitzman said .

Murray 's lawyers appeared satisfied with the results of the preliminary hearing because of testimony they got from prosecution witnesses that might help raise reasonable doubt about Murray 's guilt at trial .

Earlier Tuesday , the prosecution 's expert witness in the case admitted he made a math mistake and that the recalculation supports the defense theory that Michael Jackson may have given himself the fatal dose of propofol .

Propofol is a surgical anesthetic that the Los Angeles coroner ruled killed Jackson in combination with several sedatives found in his blood .

Dr. Richard Ruffalo , an anesthesiologist hired by the prosecution , was the last witness to take the stand .

`` I actually made a mistake on that , '' Ruffalo said during cross-examination , referring to his calculation of the levels of propofol in Jackson 's stomach fluid .

`` Now it does n't make sense unless he ingested it orally in a huge amount , '' Ruffalo testified .

But he said Murray would still be at fault , because he left dangerous drugs near a patient who was addicted .

`` He gets upset if he does n't get his milk , '' he said , referring to Jackson 's habit of referring to propofol as his `` milk . ''

The pop star 's sister La Toya Jackson was clearly upset by hearing a prosecution witness vilify her brother as an addict .

The defense planted the seed Monday for its theory that Jackson may have given himself the fatal dose . A doctor said in a police interview two days after the death that a sleepless Jackson begged Murray for propofol the day he died , a police detective testified .

Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez testified at the preliminary hearing about what the doctor told him two days after Jackson 's death .

Several doses of two sedatives Murray used in place of propofol still had n't put Jackson to sleep after several hours on the morning of June 25 , 2009 , Murray said , according to Martinez .

`` Mr. Jackson began to complain that he could n't sleep and that he would have to cancel his rehearsal and cancel his shows if he could n't get any sleep since he could n't perform , '' Martinez quoted Murray as saying .

A civil lawsuit filed last year by Jackson 's mother against the company producing the concerts alleged that he had been warned a week earlier `` that if Jackson missed any further rehearsals , they were going to ` pull the plug ' on the show . ''

Murray said he eventually gave in to the pressure from his patient and administered a dose of propofol about 10 a.m. , the detective testified . Jackson finally fell asleep , according to Murray 's account .

While his patient slept , Murray sent an e-mail to a British insurance agent assuring him that Jackson was in good health , according to another witness Monday .
