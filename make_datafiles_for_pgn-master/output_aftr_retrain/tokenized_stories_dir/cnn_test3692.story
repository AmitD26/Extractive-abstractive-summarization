-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last weekend 's release and the now imminent homecoming of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl , held prisoner by the Taliban or its allies for nearly five years , are cause for celebration .

Bergdahl was the only U.S. soldier being held in the Afghan war . The U.S. military does not abandon its own .

Bergdahl 's release is nonetheless controversial because of the price paid for it : our release of five former Taliban leaders from Guantanamo to Qatar , where , we are told , they will be monitored and barred from leaving that small Gulf Emirate for one year .

There is no denying that the release of Taliban murderers was a stiff price to pay . Letting them go -LRB- albeit after a dozen years of incarceration at Guantanamo -RRB- was necessary , the administration says , because otherwise Sgt. Bergdahl 's life was in danger . If Washington , knowing of an imminent threat to his life , had chosen simply to let one of our soldiers die , how would the American public react ?

One objection is that the released Taliban prisoners , who have killed before , are likely to kill again , once they return to Afghanistan in one year -LRB- assuming they do not slip away from Qatar even sooner -RRB- .

In contrast , we are told -- on what classified basis we do not yet know -- that Bergdahl 's life was in imminent danger , if the White House and Pentagon had refused to make the swap .

And even if Bergdahl had survived , how many more years of incommunicado imprisonment would he have had to endure ? With U.S. forces in Afghanistan set to wind down to only 10,000 by the end of 2014 , and to leave the country altogether by the end of 2016 , U.S. leverage to secure his release was steadily diminishing .

The administration counters that there was no time for delay without risking Bergdahl 's life , and that in these circumstances , the President 's constitutional powers as commander in chief entitled him to override the statute . Although the point is debatable as a matter of law , in my view the administration wins the argument .

Both as symbol and in substance , Guantanamo thus remains a gaping wound in U.S. credibility . When we criticize Russia or China for violating international law , each has a ready retort : The U.S. violates international law at Guantanamo . Even our allies see us as hypocrites . At a time when our `` hard power '' is in decline , in both absolute terms -LRB- a shrinking military -RRB- and relative terms -LRB- versus mounting Chinese power -RRB- , Guantanamo undermines American `` soft power '' -- when we need it more than ever .

Guantanamo has too long been treated as a domestic political football . It is past time to recognize that the price of continuing this game into overtime is too high .
