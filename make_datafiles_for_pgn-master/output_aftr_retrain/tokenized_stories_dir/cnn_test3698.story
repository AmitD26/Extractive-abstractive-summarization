Shaul Mofaz is Israel 's main liaison with the United States on strategic issues .

`` If Iran continues its program to develop nuclear weapons , we will attack it , '' Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz told Yediot Ahronot , Israel 's largest mass-circulation daily . `` The window of opportunity has closed . The sanctions are not effective . There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear program . ''

Mofaz 's threat is one of the most explicit made against the Islamic Republic of Iran by a member of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's Cabinet .

It also has significant political resonance in Israel amid talk that Mofaz has begun jockeying to replace Olmert , who is embroiled in a corruption probe , as the ruling Kadima Party 's leader and prime minister .

At least one Cabinet member , Defense Minister Ehud Barak , has called for Olmert to step down .

Mofaz , Israel 's transport and road safety minister , is the main Israeli liaison with the United States on strategic issues , and his views on security have great import . He was born in Iran in 1948 and is a former defense minister , former armed forces chief and a member of Israel 's Security Cabinet .

`` Israel and the United States have long understood the acute danger embodied in a nuclear Iran , and are working closely in a concerted , coordinated effort to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear . Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran , and neither should any other country in the free world , '' Olmert said to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention .

In April , Israeli Infrastructure Minister Benjamin Ben-Eliezer said that `` an Iranian attack will lead to a harsh retaliation by Israel , which will lead to the destruction of the Iranian nation . ''
