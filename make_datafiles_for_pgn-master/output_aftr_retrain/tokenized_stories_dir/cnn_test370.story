`` It took Joseph Wood two hours to die , and he gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes . We will renew our efforts to get information about the manufacturer of drugs as well as how Arizona came up with the experimental formula of drugs it used today , '' attorney Dale Baich said in a statement .

He added : `` Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror -- a bungled execution . ''

A federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood 's execution .

`` One thing is certain , however , inmate Wood died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer . This is in stark comparison to the gruesome , vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims -- and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family , '' Brewer said .

Aside from snoring , he did not make grimaces or otherwise move , the corrections department said .

Wood was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father .

`` I do n't believe he was gasping for air ; I do n't believe he was suffering . It sounded to me like was snoring , '' said Jeanne Brown , a relative of Wood 's victims .

Troy Hayden , a media witness from KSAZ , told reporters the execution was difficult to watch . He likened Wood 's breathing to a `` fish gulping for air . ''

Michael Kiefer , a reporter for The Arizona Republic , has witnessed five executions , including Wood 's .

`` Usually it takes about 10 minutes , the person goes to sleep . This was not that , '' he told reporters afterward . `` It started off looking as if it was going alright but then obviously something did n't go right . It took two hours . ''

Wood 's attorneys had filed an emergency motion for a stay after his execution began , saying then that Wood had been `` gasping and snorting for more than an hour . ''

The motion read : `` He is still alive . This execution has violated Mr. Wood 's Eighth Amendment right to be executed in the absence of cruel and unusual punishment . We respectfully request that this Court stop the execution and require that the Department of Corrections use the lifesaving provisions required in its protocol . ''

Earlier , the Arizona Supreme Court lifted its brief stay of the murderer 's execution .

Wood was first set to be executed at 10 a.m. local time -LRB- 1 p.m. ET -RRB- , though it was temporarily halted when the court said it would consider his request for the justices to review his claims .

Wood was the latest American death row inmate to argue that an anesthetic recently introduced in some states ' execution protocols could fail to sufficiently knock out the inmate ahead of the lethal drugs , subjecting the person to an agonizing death .

Wood claimed among other things that the state was going to use an `` experimental '' drug protocol of midazolam and hydromorphone .

`` The room was silent . I was focusing on Mr. Wood . There were seven announcements during the process that Mr. Wood was still sedated . This is -- to confirm that he was still sedated .

`` He was still breathing and struggling to breathe and gasping and snorting . I have witnessed 10 executions , and I had never seen that before , '' Baich told CNN .

Opinion : I was 17 , on death row -- and innocent

Drugs were n't Wood 's only contention . He also argued the execution should be stopped because his trial attorney was ineffective and that new evaluations from psychologists show he has cognitive impairments that would make him innocent of premeditated murder .

Some states turned to midazolam this decade after they could no longer get sodium thiopental , a drug that was regularly used for executions . A U.S. manufacturer stopped producing sodium thiopental in 2009 , and countries that still produce it wo n't allow its export to the United States for use in lethal injections .

`` Instead of hiding lethal injection under layers of foolish secrecy , these states need to show us where the drugs are come from . Until they can give assurances that the drugs will work as intended , they must stop future executions , '' it read .
