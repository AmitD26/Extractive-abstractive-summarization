In addition , Jackson lawyers told the judge in a court filing this week they were concerned that lawyers for AEG Live , the company accused of liability in Jackson 's death , were `` behaving aggressively and erratically '' in their questioning of the Jackson children .

AEG Live asked Los Angeles Superior Judge Yvette Palazuelos to order Blanket Jackson to appear for a deposition , but his doctor warned it would be `` medically detrimental '' to the 10-year-old boy , according to the court filing .

Prince `` testified that he was intimately involved in his father 's affairs , '' an AEG Live lawyer said in an e-mail defending the questioning .

The wrongful death lawsuit is a high-stakes contest . Prince , Paris , Blanket and their grandmother , Katherine Jackson , are suing AEG Live for billions of dollars . The trial is set to begin in Los Angeles next month .

Blanket 's doctor provided a letter saying it would be `` medically detrimental '' to the boy . `` Yet defendants still to this day say they may move to compel Blanket 's deposition , '' the Jackson filing said .

`` My understanding is that the deposition proceeded with appropriate questioning , and that the questions were legitimate questions appropriate to a wrongful death suit , '' she said .

The Jackson lawyers also complained about the questioning of family matriarch Katherine Jackson , who is 82 . AEG Live lawyers deposed her for nine hours over three days and are asking for a fourth chance , they said . The questioning could have been easily done in two or three hours , they told the judge .

The lawsuit contends that AEG Live is responsible for Jackson 's death because it hired and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray , who was administering the surgical anesthetic propofol to Jackson each night for a month to induce sleep as he prepared for a series of concerts organized by AEG Live .

AEG Live contends that Michael Jackson chose Murray as his personal physician . The promoter denies having hired or supervised Murray .

A jury found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter after hearing testimony that he violated medical standards in his treatment of Jackson .
