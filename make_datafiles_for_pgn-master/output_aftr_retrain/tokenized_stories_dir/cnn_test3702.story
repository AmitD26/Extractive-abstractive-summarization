Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two former coaches have sued Major League Soccer team Chivas USA , claiming they were fired this year because they are not Latino .

The two men , both former pros and members of the U.S. national team , are seeking unspecified damages for discrimination , harassment , retaliation and wrongful termination , their attorneys said in a statement Wednesday .

In an interview in his attorney 's office , Calichman recalled a team staff meeting last November .

Vergara `` asked everyone who speaks Spanish raise your hand , and there was a group that could not speak Spanish , '' Calichman said . `` The work environment changed , and coaches that could not speak Spanish on the field were wondering , ` Hey , will we be fired because I ca n't speak Spanish and is it possible ? '

`` We are not commenting because it 's a legal matter , '' said Christina Maillo-Belda , spokeswoman for Chivas USA .

A co-defendant in the civil suit , the human resources firm Insperity Inc. of Kingwood , Texas , also declined comment on Tuesday 's filing .

The two former coaches experienced retaliation for opposing the allegedly unlawful employment practices , the lawsuit alleged .

The two men filed complaints with the team 's human resources manager and later with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing . The team terminated their employment on March 7 and sent a letter accusing the two men of unprofessional conduct that created an unsafe work environment , the lawsuit said .

The two former coaches dispute that accusation by the team .

Calichman reported to Chronopoulos and coached 17 - and 18-year-old players in the academy program . He also helped the pro team as needed , the lawsuit stated .

A year later , Vergara acquired 50 % ownership of the team and , with wife Angelica Fuentes , became the team 's sole owner , the suit said . He `` undertook a systemic effort to reverse what he perceived as the ` Americanization ' of Chivas USA and to implement a discriminatory employment practice similar to the ethnocentric ` Mexican only ' policy that exists at Chivas de Guadalajara , '' the lawsuit alleged .

In the suit , the two coaches accused Vergara of `` replacing players and staff who had no Mexican or Latino heritage with those who did have Mexican or Latino heritage or who , at a minimum , had some connection to Mexico -LRB- for example , being married to a Mexican spouse -RRB- . ''

Since Vergara took control of Chivas USA , about seven non-Latino academy employees , including the two former coaches , have been terminated , the lawsuit said . `` In contrast , no Latino employees have been terminated , '' the suit said .

Also , `` the organization has culled virtually all non-Latino players '' from the team and `` has , almost uniformly , replaced them with Latino players , '' the suit said , referring to a Los Angeles Times account on the player changes .

Among those players released or traded are James Riley , Ben Zemanski , Casey Townsend and eight-time Major League Soccer All-Star Shalrie Joseph , the suit said . The team acquired Eric Avila from the Colorado Rapids in exchange for Nick LaBrocca . The team also acquired three players from Chivas de Guadalajara , Edgar `` El Chore '' Mejia , defender Mario de Luna and forward Giovani Casillas , the suit said .
