Religious-affiliated non-profits -- including a Denver-based home for the elderly run by Catholic nuns -- have asked the high court to block enforcement of the requirement in the Affordable Care Act to provide birth control and other reproductive health coverage to their workers .

The emergency application was filed Tuesday with Sotomayor , a day before it was set to take effect . She issued a temporary stay , at least until the Obama administration could file a legal response .

Supreme Court to take up contraception case

That deadline is Friday at 10 a.m. ET . The Catholic-affiliated groups would have the option of submitting a final rebuttal before the court acts .

The mandate was designed by the administration to give women employed at nonprofit , religious-based organizations -- such as certain hospitals and private faith-based universities -- the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies with no co-pay .

A court ruling on this matter could ultimately impact dozens of religious groups and businesses that have mounted legal challenges in recent months .

The White House has said the birth control requirement is lawful and `` essential to a woman 's health . ''

Sotomayor is also taking the lead in a separate appeal involving Utah 's law banning gays and lesbians from legal wedlock .

A federal judge struck down the statute as unconstitutional on December 20 , and the state then asked the high court to block -- at least temporarily -- enforcement of the judge 's ruling .

Again , the state could submit a final rebuttal , and then the court would decide . An order could come as soon as that afternoon .

In the Utah case , U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby said the state 's law `` conflicts with the United States Constitution 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law . ''

The issue on enforcement is tricky since hundreds of marriage licenses have already been issued by some Utah counties in the nearly two weeks since the decision was announced .

Any action from the high court on the enforcement question would be temporary and not offer the final word on the constitutionality of the state 's ban on same-sex marriage .

One of the duties of the individual justices is to handle `` applications '' -- time-sensitive appeals , such as requests for an injunction against some government mandate , or a stay of execution .

Each justice is assigned a particular `` circuit '' -- a region of the country or judicial jurisdiction -- to handle these applications . So Sotomayor deals with the 10th Circuit , which includes Colorado , Wyoming , Utah , New Mexico , Oklahoma , and Kansas .

There is no specific deadline for her or the court as a whole to act , but they are generally handled relatively quickly .

But any decision from the high court at this stage would be limited in nature , dealing only with whether to block enforcement temporarily , until the larger legal and constitutional issues work their way fully through the various federal courts in both the marriage and healthcare cases .

The marriage case is Herbert v. Kitchen -LRB- 13A687 -RRB- .
