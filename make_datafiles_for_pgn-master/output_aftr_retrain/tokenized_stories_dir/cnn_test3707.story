Democrats turning up the volume on Christie bridge controversy

Favia 's letter -- dated September 10 , 2013 -- suggests that what started as a local political fight could have had real life-or-death consequences .

Favia asked for the mayor 's help in changing the traffic pattern to avoid delayed response times . He listed several examples of delays , including car wrecks , chest pains and a 91-year-old who suffered a heart attack .

In one instance , the EMS director said he was forced to jump a curb to escape traffic that was at a standstill while he was responding to a car accident with multiple injuries .

Trips that should have taken just a few minutes took up to three times longer , he wrote .

Christie said in a statement Wednesday that `` what I 've seen today is unacceptable , '' adding that he was `` misled by a member of his staff '' and knew nothing about what had transpired . He previously said he knew nothing about allegations of political retribution .

His administration earlier had blamed the lane closures and traffic mess on a mishandled traffic study .
