-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Singapore 's first public housing blocks built to be environmentally sustainable have become the testing ground for future projects .

The eco-friendly methods range from commonplace and practical to highly innovative .

Plant-covered roofs naturally lower the buildings ' temperature , and the towers ' orientation , facing away from the sun , helps too . Painting the buildings white helps keep them cool and bring in sunlight .

But white walls also look dirty more quickly , so the government is testing self-cleaning paint , which breaks down grime as it is triggered by sun exposure .

Inside the apartments , tap water that goes down the drain is used to flush toilets . Solar energy powers elevators , lighting and water pumps .

And various indicators placed around the buildings , like the ones found in the elevators that show the amount of solar energy being outputted , provide constant reminders to the residents of the different lifestyle they are living .

But being eco-friendly comes at a higher price -- the sustainable buildings cost 7 % more to build than traditional apartments .

`` It 's very difficult for the government to continuously provide the funding . So what we have done is that we will try to partner with the private industry , '' said Ng .

Under the scheme , the government subsidizes start-up costs , while the solar energy companies install the panels , maintain them and sell back the energy to the power providers to recoup their costs .
