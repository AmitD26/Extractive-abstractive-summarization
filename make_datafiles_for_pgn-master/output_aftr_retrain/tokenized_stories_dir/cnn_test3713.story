-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Patrick Vieira knows what it takes to win football 's greatest prize -- and the former France star believes Africa is close to claiming a historic first World Cup title .

Only three teams from the continent have ever reached the quarterfinal stage of the tournament -- Cameroon in 1990 , Senegal in 2002 and Ghana in 2010 -- yet none have made it to the last four .

Cameroon , Ghana , Ivory Coast , Nigeria and Algeria will all be hoping to overcome these hurdles in Brazil this time and perhaps go even further than their predecessors .

`` And when you look at how many big names African football has produced in the last few years , it 's unbelievable , '' he told CNN .

Those big names include the likes of Samuel Eto'o , Didier Drogba and Yaya Toure , who would all love nothing more than to add a World Cup winners ' medal to their lengthy list of honors in Brazil .

But while Cameroon and Ivory Coast have such world-beaters among their ranks , Vieira feels they will need to be at the top of their game to avoid past disappointments .

Quality

Ivory Coast has earned the nickname `` the chokers '' -- cruel given the quality of opposition the nation has faced -- after a talented set of individuals struggled to perform when it counted most , failing to make it out of the group stage in both the 2006 and 2010 World Cups .

`` You need quality . When you look at the African national teams individually , they are really talented so they 've got talent , '' Vieira says .

`` But I think to be in the World Cup , you need your talented players to be at their best because the quality will make you win , the quality will make the difference .

`` Quality will make the player make the difference at the right time when your team needs you . You may just go on to create one chance and you need to score the chance to go to the next round . ''

Vieira , though , believes that for talented players to flourish they must be in a team that has togetherness and unity .

Cameroon lacked in that department during its disastrous 2010 campaign , where the `` Indomitable Lions '' had been expected to do well in the first World Cup held on African soil .

Eto'o threatened to snub the competition after being criticized by compatriot Roger Milla , himself a former World Cup star for Cameroon .

`` We had the players from all around the world and I think we showed the diversity of the French national team , we showed what the diversity of the French people are , '' Vieira says . `` We showed to the French nation what France is really . ''

The Federation Camerounaise de Football temporarily suspended Eto'o from playing for the national team in 2011 for instigating the boycott of a friendly in Algeria over unpaid bonuses .

Emmanuel Adebayor , meanwhile , has criticized the Togo Federation in the past for its poor organizational skills , blaming the governing body for his late return to English club Tottenham following the 2013 African Cup of Nations .

`` The only problem in Africa is our leaders , who do not respect us , '' Eto'o told the Confederation of African Football 's -LRB- CAF -RRB- official website . `` Until we are respected , other -LRB- continents -RRB- will never have any consideration for us . ''

Vieira adds : `` I think what African football needs is better organization , better structure , and I think after that we 'll help the players to be more professional when they 're coming to play for their national team ... I think the structure around these players is not strong enough and I think if we do n't have that , it will take time -LRB- for an African nation -RRB- to win the World Cup . ''

The man in charge of African football -- CAF president Issa Hayatou -- however , feels the structures put in place by his confederation and its member associations should allow for a nation or two to go far in Brazil .

Discipline

That statistic could well have been banished in 1998 had Cameroon 's players kept their heads when it mattered most .

The Indomitable Lions picked up three red cards in just three games , including two in the final group clash against Chile -- a match they drew , when victory would have been enough for a place in the second round alongside Nigeria .

`` I would talk about discipline -LRB- as being vital if an African team wants to win the World Cup -RRB- , '' Vieira says . `` Discipline and sacrifice , so that means you have to concentrate on your objective , you have to concentrate on what you have to do for the months to get at your best , and be at the peak of your game . ''

Focus

The Super Eagles were just two minutes away from becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight at their debut World Cup , but let a 1-0 lead slip against Italy before conceding again in extra-time .

'' -LRB- You must -RRB- focus on your objective because when you are in the World Cup , you can get your head a little bit all over the place , '' Vieira says .

Luck

Having all these ingredients is no guarantee for success , however , as at a major international tournament the winning team often needs a little luck along the way .

Ghana found this out the hard way after a run to the last eight of the 2010 World Cup that captured the imagination of much of Africa -- but was brought to an end in the most controversial of circumstances .

Suarez was sent off for his actions -- and widely condemned by the world of football afterwards -- but the damage had already been done as Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting spot-kick , before Uruguay went on to win the ensuing penalty shootout .
