-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Broadcaster Lee Thomas ' patchwork skin has being losing pigment for 17 years . He 's gotten used to the constant stares when his work makeup is off ; he does n't even mind being asked about his varying skin tones .

`` It 's not really the ignorance , '' Thomas said about the lack of awareness surrounding vitiligo . `` It 's the malicious ignorance . Adults are weird . ''

He went through what he calls an `` angry spotted-guy '' period when he would give menacing looks to those who stared at him .

`` Eventually I said , ` That 's not me ' and would do the opposite , '' he said . `` I 'd give them the million-dollar smile that got me into my work in the first place and turn it into a conversation rather than a spectacle . ''

What 's vitiligo ?

June 25 marks World Vitiligo Day , which is aimed at raising awareness about the incurable disease .

Vitiligo does n't discriminate , affecting people of all skin colors , but it is most noticeable in people with darker skin .

Michael Jackson probably had the most well-known case of vitiligo ; rumor has it Jackson wore a single glove to hide some of the splotches on his hand . Thomas said he also , for a time , wore a single glove while reporting stories to cover his symptoms .

Though there is no cure for vitiligo , there are many treatment options that vary in effectiveness and cost .

Thomas wore makeup on his face anytime he was out of the house for nearly four years until he was no longer able to hide his vitiligo , he said . Being a TV personality , he worried that he would lose his job if his bosses and co-workers found out about his condition .

`` My bosses here at the time were always very supportive , '' he said . `` The conflict was within . ''

He now goes without makeup when he 's not working , but he still wears makeup on camera because his vitiligo is so visible he feels it distracts from the stories he reports .

Vitiligo is n't physically painful , but Lebwohl emphasized it 's not strictly a cosmetic condition either .

Yan Valle , who works with the Vitiligo Foundation , said he 's watched his pigment disappear since he was 6 . It started on his legs , then spread to his hands , face and neck .

Valle says he grew up with few resources to help him understand the condition or how to treat it . He helped found the Vitiligo Research Foundation in 2010 and now works full-time to provide resources to medical professionals and those with the condition .

Thomas has written a book , `` Turning White , '' and often speaks about his experience with vitiligo .

He met one woman and her brother at a support group he started in Detroit , which he says was the first vitiligo support group in the United States . The woman 's brother told Thomas she had n't left the house in months because of her insecurities with the disease .
