-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's an empirical fact : There are people out there who hate you .

Now , you have the potential to invoke someone 's wrath with every blog entry , Facebook update and tweet .

So how does one respond to this digital dislike ? Read on , dear readers -LRB- 10 % of whom we likely disdain , and vice versa -RRB- :

In the event of a passive-aggressive Facebooker

There are more than 650 million people on Facebook , and unless you 're a solid adherent to Dunbar 's Number and have carefully restricted those friend requests , you 're probably `` friends '' with a couple of people you would n't actually call `` friend '' in real life .

You know : high school classmates/tormentors , exes , former friends with whom you 've had a falling out . If you were to run into said people on the street , they would probably do the whole , `` I 'm staring at this poster for a children 's yard sale that occurred three weeks ago very intently and therefore do not see you '' thing .

On Facebook , some do the virtual equivalent : They block your access to photos and wall posts , -LRB- likely -RRB- remove you from their news feed and immediately toss out a `` Not Attending '' four seconds after you send them an invite to your `` Sock Puppet Sock Hop . ''

Yup , you 're trapped in `` I 'm being polite , but I hate you '' limbo , dear friend , and it 's time to go on to the next world : one in which only friends dawdle in the sweet groves of amity . Translation : Unfriend those people posthaste .

You have to grudgingly tolerate co-workers , extended family and B.O.-ridden elevator-sharers on a daily basis ; do n't let that same lenience spread into the realm of America 's Favorite -LRB- Eye-glazing -RRB- Pastime .

In the event of a Twitter war

We 've seen some pretty intense examples in the realm of the celebrity -LRB- Kanye West , Courtney Love and various and sundry reality stars are repeat offenders -RRB- , and , on a less buzzed-about scale , between friends and acquaintances .

`` Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter may bring -LRB- animosity -RRB- out more because of the massive and ready audience they supply , '' says Elias Aboujaoude , M.D. , a psychiatrist and author of `` Virtually You : The Dangerous Powers of the E-Personality . ''

Why ? Because Twitter fights are not courageous -- they 're tacky . If someone slights you in 140 characters , we suggest sending them a Direct Message -LRB- if you give a damn about their opinion -RRB- , or just blocking them and sticking to straight-up schadenfreude when it comes to entertainment .

As a general rule , if an under-the-bridge dweller sends you a mean e-mail , flames you in the comments section of your blog or pontificates on your unattractiveness under your latest cat grooming tutorial on YouTube , just do n't engage .

Still , that does n't mean you have to suffer in martyred silence all the time .

`` We should remember that any information attached to our name , whether it 's accurate information we supply ourselves without thinking or mean-spirited and inaccurate statements made about us by haters , is going to stay online forever , '' says Aboujaoude . `` That is why standing up to hecklers can be an important part of maintaining our online reputation . ''

A simple fix is simply deleting any outright racist , rude or misogynistic comments from your own personal domains , or flagging abusive sentiments on the domains of others , and then contacting the webmaster . Or , you could be a little more creative .

For example , after one commenter posted a scathing -- albeit horrifyingly misspelled -- rant under a game on content creation site Newgrounds , the actor who voiced the game teamed up with a graphic designer to create a video dramatizing the venom-tinged words in all of their grammatically incorrect glory .

That video , `` dot dot dot , '' went viral , in no small part because it was a clever retort to an impassioned troll , rather than a messy attack . The troll in question even `` Favorited '' the video .
