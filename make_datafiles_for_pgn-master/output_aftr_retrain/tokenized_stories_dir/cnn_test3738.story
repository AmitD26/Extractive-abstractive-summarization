`` The ratcheting up of rhetoric is of concern to us , '' the official said .

Another U.S. official said there is a lot of uncertainty about North Korea 's intentions .

`` North Korea is not a paper tiger so it would n't be smart to dismiss its provocative behavior as pure bluster , '' that official said .

North Korea earlier said it was cutting off a key military hotline with South Korea amid high tensions between the two sides .

Officials see steps such as cutting off communication are more substitutes for doing other more dangerous things rather than precursors to more dangerous things .

`` That is certainly our fervent hope , '' the official said .

At the same time , there is concern about a North Korean miscalculation during this time . The officials said the lack of communication could complicate and hamper the ability of all nations involved -LRB- including North Korea , South Korea and the United States -RRB- to control and moderate any action -- and cycle of reaction should one begin as the result of a North Korean miscalculation .

The intelligence community has been providing the Obama administration with assessments of Kim Jung Un 's control of the regime , but the official would not provide any details of that assessment .

Administration officials also regretted the tough talk from Pyongyang . State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell cited `` more bellicose rhetoric and threats -LRB- that -RRB- follow a pattern designed to raise tensions and intimidate others . ''

Pentagon spokesman George Little spoke on the government 's nuclear threats to the United States and `` its more achievable threats to attack South Korean military units and shell border islands . ''

`` We take their rhetoric seriously , whether it 's outside the norm which it sometimes is , or seems to suggest a more direct threat . And if you look at what they 've said recently , it 's been extremely provocative , threatening and bellicose . And it 's a complete mystery to me why they would deem it in their own interest to launch this type of rhetoric at us and our allies , '' Little said .

Korean nightmare : Experts ponder potential conflict

The North 's announcement Wednesday appeared likely to affect the movement of people in and out of the Kaesong Industrial Complex , a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas situated on the North 's side of the border .

On Thursday morning , the day after the North said it was severing the line , South Korean workers were able to cross the border and enter the industrial zone , the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap reported , citing the Immigration and Quarantine office in Paju , near the border .

An initial group of 197 workers went over the border at 8:30 a.m. local time -LRB- 7:30 p.m. Wednesday ET -RRB- after North Korea gave the regular approval for their movement by phone through the industrial district 's management committee , Yonhap said .

A total of 530 South Koreans were due to enter the Kaesong complex on Thursday , and 511 are scheduled to come back into South Korea , according to Yonhap .

A symbol of North-South cooperation , the Kaesong complex is also seen as an important source of hard currency for the regime in Pyongyang .

The North previously cut off the Kaesong military hotline in March 2009 -- also during annual U.S.-South Korean military exercises -- but later reinstated it , according to Yonhap .

The slew of recent fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea , as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is no longer valid .

On Tuesday , the North said it planned to place military units tasked with targeting U.S. bases under combat-ready status .

Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile , but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower , including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles .
