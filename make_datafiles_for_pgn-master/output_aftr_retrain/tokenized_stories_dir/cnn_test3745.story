-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Airborne for white , sandy beaches , turquoise Cuban waters and swaying palms , two women apparently broke out their duty-free booze on Wednesday and partied hearty in a passenger jet bathroom .

Prosecutors on Thursday charged Melana Muzikante , 26 , and Lilia Ratmanski , 25 , each with two counts of mischief , one count of smoking on an aircraft , one count of endangering the safety of an aircraft and with uttering a threat to cause death or bodily harm , according to Constable Lillian Fitzpatrick of Peel Regional Police .

A judge released them on $ 2,500 bail each after they spent a night in a Canadian jail , but Fitzpatrick said Muzikante 's surety wo n't arrive until Friday , meaning she 'll spend Thursday night behind bars .

It was not clear late Thursday who her attorney was ; attempts to reach Ratmanski were unsuccessful .

From champagne to swill

On Flight 656 , passengers were toasting their forthcoming R&R at their destination of Varadero on Cuba 's Florida-facing shore .

Apparently , it was n't enough for two passengers .

Out came the duty-free spirits , and to go with them , the ladies allegedly lit up a cigarette in the lavatory , the airline said in a statement . Then the bathroom smoke detector ratted them out .

Fight , threats , jail

Judge grounds partying

Muzikante and Ratmanski are due back in court September 29 , according to Fitzpatrick .
