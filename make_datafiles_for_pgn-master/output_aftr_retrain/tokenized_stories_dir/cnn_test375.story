-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An experimental Ebola drug that 's still in development may now be used to treat more people with the disease , according to Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation .

`` We have worked with the FDA and Health Canada to establish this framework and a treatment protocol allowing us to do what we can to help these patients , '' Dr. Mark J. Murray , Tekmira 's president and CEO , said in a statement .

In January , a small human trial of TKM-Ebola was put on hold after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication .

Then last month , the FDA modified the hold to a `` partial clinical hold . '' This meant that Tekmira could give the drug to doctors or hospitals that requested it on an emergency basis .

`` While the FDA can not comment on the development of specific medical products , '' Yao said , `` it 's important to note that every FDA regulatory decision is based on a risk-benefit assessment of scientific data that includes the context of use for the product and the patient population being studied . ''

According to the company , the FDA granted Tekmira fast track status to develop TKM-Ebola back in March . Murray said their supply is limited , `` but we will continue to help where we can . ''
