-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For many Muslims it 's the journey of a lifetime : making the Hajj pilgrimage . Almost 3 million faithful , together , in the city of Mecca , Saudi Arabia . But this year , the Hajj could become an incubator for the H1N1 virus .

Khan will take precautions to avoid H1N1 , also known as swine flu , at the Hajj . They 'll carry hand sanitizer and will be `` frequently washing our hands , trying to stay as clean as possible . ''

Dr. Asif Saberi gives them a short lecture on how to prepare and encourages everyone to have their shots at least seven days before traveling . He says the Saudi government is doing a lot to protect pilgrims , but `` the magnitude of the problem is the magnitude of the numbers of people who attend the Hajj . ''

When it comes to using hand sanitizer and wearing masks , Saberi says he encounters confusion about religious dictates and flu prevention . According to Muslim beliefs , for example , men in a state of pilgrimage should not wear any stitched items or touch alcohol . So what about wearing face masks or using alcohol-based sanitizers ?

Saudi Arabia has been preparing for the influx of millions of pilgrims . It wo n't turn away anyone who wants to come to the Hajj , but it is urging other countries not to let children younger than 12 , people older than 65 or pregnant women make the pilgrimage .

The kingdom also is using sophisticated technology -- thermal screening equipment at entry points and mobile devices to document suspected cases of the flu .

Dr. Ziad Memish , assistant deputy to the Saudi health minister and co-author of a paper on Hajj and H1N1 published in Science magazine , said the government consulted 25 international experts , who joined with 25 Saudi experts , to discuss how to prepare .

`` We had the team inspect the airport , the seaport , the regional lab that tests for the influenza , '' he said . `` And then we had a review of all the evidence regarding the different strategies that should be used to prevent the spread of the disease during the mass gathering of the Hajj .

`` We have relied on a collaborative program with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , where they are helping us setting up a system that was used in the Hurricane Katrina disaster , and I think the system has already been tested and it is working perfectly well . ''

In Washington , Louise Gresham , director of health security and epidemiology at the Nuclear Threat Initiative -- which also works to reduce global biological threats -- looks at a report tracking the spread of H1N1 in the Middle East . Gresham describes the risks :

`` They actually started writing a plan for food-borne disease outbreaks , but they started a pandemic preparedness plan , '' Gresham says . `` When H1N1 came along , this put them in a perfect position , because they were practiced , they were rehearsed and they had built great , great trust . ''

As part of this cooperation , Israel is supplying Gaza and the West Bank with H1N1 vaccinations for those who make the religious journey .

For those like Fayzah Abu Ayadah , faith outweighs fear .
