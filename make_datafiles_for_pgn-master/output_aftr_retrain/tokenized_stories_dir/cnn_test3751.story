-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When an official from the Internal Revenue Service decides to take the Fifth before a congressional committee and is then put on administrative leave , as Lois Lerner was recently , hearts on the political right surely beat a little faster . Does this mean that at least one of the controversies swirling around the Obama administration in recent weeks will gain strength , perhaps enough to pull him under ?

So far it appears that the administration 's trio of troubles -- the IRS 's scrutiny of the tea party , the Justice Department 's investigation of journalists , and the State Department 's handling of the Benghazi attacks -- lack some of the key ingredients required to brew a strong scandal , the kind that does some serious damage , that produces widespread public interest and intense emotional involvement , and stains an administration , leaving its mark on history .

The most resonant scandals take an already-existing concern and turn it into a concrete story , one that gets the popular blood boiling . To gain traction , it must demonstrate a clear-cut example of abuse of power that is part of a pattern , not just an isolated instance of incompetence , stupidity or poor judgment . It must lead directly to a powerful individual , and must represent a problem that is viewed as having serious implications , even if the case itself is not necessarily consequential .

Of the three controversies brewing in the U.S. , the IRS affair has the greatest potential to get the public emotionally involved , because the tax agency has power over everyone . Bureaucratic overreach feels potentially threatening to all .

A higher-stakes example can be found in the case of the impoverished Tunisian street vendor Mohammed Bouazizi . In 2010 , after a municipal employee confiscated his produce , Bouazizi , despairing at the injustice and his own powerlessness , set himself on fire . His case resonated . It was a minor instance in the larger scheme of corruption and dictatorship , but it sparked a revolutionary fire that keeps burning to this day across the Middle East and North Africa .

In Mexico , an incident that in the past would have passed without notice spread rapidly over the Internet , ultimately requiring presidential action . The daughter of the head of the consumer protection agency showed up at the trendy Maximo Bistrot in the capital without a reservation . When she could not get a table , she threatened to have the place shut down . Officials from her father 's agency , known as Profeco , promptly raided the establishment .

That explains why even though most Americans consider the cases `` very important to the nation , '' the approval rating for Obama has not suffered .

This presents a challenge to those who want to see the scandals demolish the Obama presidency and shut down his agenda . A scandal loses some of its power to demolish when it is viewed as a political game .
