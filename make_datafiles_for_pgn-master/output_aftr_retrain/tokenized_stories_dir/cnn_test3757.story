A pinger locator in the Indian Ocean has detected signals consistent with those emitted by aircraft black boxes , the head of the Joint Agency Coordination Center said Monday .

The sounds were heard at a depth of 4,500 meters -LRB- about 14,764 feet -RRB- , retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said .

`` We 've got a visual indication on a screen , and we 've also got an audible signal . And the audible signal sounds to me just like an emergency locator beacon , '' Houston said .

The search official said Monday he was much more optimistic in finding the plane than he was a week ago . Still , Houston said , `` I would like us to find some wreckage . ''

Along with the hints that searchers may be getting close to the plane , a fresh mystery surfaced .

The new analysis of the flight 's path means the plane may have been taken along a route designed to avoid radar detection , the source said .

But why would someone steer the plane that way , and where is it now ?

Investigators hope the signals could be locator beacons from the plane 's data recorders , but they 're not sure yet .

Time could be running out . It might be only a few hours or a few days before the pingers aboard the plane stop transmitting for good .

That 30th day has come -- though experts have said it 's possible that they could last several days longer if they were at their full strength .

Plane said to have flown around Indonesia

As searchers tried to find the aircraft , investigators pieced together new details about the plane 's path .

After reviewing radar track data from neighboring countries , officials have concluded that the passenger jet curved north of Indonesia before turning south toward the southern Indian Ocean , a senior Malaysian government source told CNN on Sunday .

Whoever was flying the plane , the source said , could have been trying to avoid radar detection .

But why ?

Like most details in the case that 's baffled investigators ever since the plane dropped off Malaysian military radar , it depends on whom you ask .

`` I think the plane 's being intentionally flown there , but I think it 's still a mystery as to why . ... I think they would probably guess they 're not avoiding anybody 's radar , because there 's a lot of radar in the area , '' he said . `` I think they 're avoiding getting shot down or colliding with another airplane . ''

`` This particular route that is laid out happens to coincide with some of these named intersections , '' he said . `` So what it shows is an experienced pilot somewhere in the mix on this . ''

Investigators have n't yet said who they think might have flown the plane off course or why .

Time is running out

But officials urged caution . In the lengthy search for the missing plane , promising discoveries nearly every day have fizzled out , with few facts to support them .

`` This is an important and encouraging lead , but one that I urge you to continue to treat carefully , '' Angus Houston , the head of the Australian agency coordinating search operations , said Sunday .

Houston also said that search authorities were informed Sunday that the Ocean Shield , an Australian naval vessel equipped with sophisticated listening equipment , has detected `` an acoustic noise '' in another area of the ocean to the north .

The Ocean Shield , which has a high-tech pinger locator borrowed from the U.S. Navy , will continue to pursue the sound it heard . If that lead turns cold , it will move to the other detection area , a journey that will take at least a day , officials said .

`` At the moment , the most promising lead appears to be the one associated with Haixun 01 , '' Houston said at a news conference in Perth , the Western Australian city serving as a hub for search operations .

The pulses registered by the Chinese ship are of particular interest because they occurred in an area that fits with the latest calculation by experts of roughly where the plane is likely to have entered the water , Houston said .

The area of detection is roughly 1,600 kilometers -LRB- 1,000 miles -RRB- west-northwest of Perth , according to coordinates reported by Chinese state media .

Caution urged

Several analysts on CNN said the information from search officials gave cause for optimism .

What 's more , white objects were spotted floating on the surface of the water about 90 kilometers -LRB- 55 miles -RRB- from where the sounds were detected , authorities said .

But Houston warned that the latest discoveries could turn out to have no connection to the missing plane .

`` I assure that we will follow up and exhaust every credible lead that we receive , '' he said .

`` It 's not a continuous transmission , '' Houston said . `` If you get close to the device , we should be receiving it for a longer period of time . ''

A former longtime Navy oceanographer said the Chinese equipment shown on TV did n't appear to be very sophisticated . Van Gurley told CNN that the gear was designed to be held by human divers and only had short-range capabilities .

`` The fact that they 're deploying it right over the side near the ocean surface , they 're getting hits a mile apart , kind of does n't add up -- but it does require investigation , '' said Gurley , now a senior manager at a consulting firm that uses complex mathematical methods to solve problems like finding a missing plane .
