-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Destructive graffiti wars are being waged by anonymous vandals , deliberately defacing many of the meticulously painted murals that vividly illustrate San Francisco 's streets .

If you 're going to San Francisco , keep in mind that the outdoor murals you see are ephemeral , so appreciate them -- and take lots of photos -- before they disappear .

Countless gorgeous , larger-than-life murals illustrate this city 's weathered exteriors , bestowing visual intrigue to homes , shops , parking lots , recreational facilities , derelict buildings and alleys .

Now , however , a rolling population of taggers has been wreaking havoc on many of the best murals , by hurriedly spray-painting initials , names , words , acronyms and other lettering across the majestic urban displays .

Gang intimidation at work

`` Some taggers come in large numbers , some are gang related . Their intention is to mess things up and possibly look for a fight , '' he said in an interview .

`` I can only hope taggers would appreciate the street arts , and truly see what are the possibilities that we are building , for artists to showcase their talents in public space , '' said Perez-Boza , who is also a muralist , painter , street and studio artist .

Mission District art targeted

The public alley runs parallel between 17th and 18th streets , linking Mission and Valencia streets -- you can visit anytime day or night for free .

His mural portrays a man 's huge turquoise head -- resembling himself -- laying on the ground , `` with two factions of ants battling it out in front of his very eyes , representing the sort of narcissism associated with all the latest social media gadgets , as well as the individual 's helplessness in the face of conflicts either nearby or globally , '' he said in an interview .

Stromberg was n't amused when his masterpiece was defaced in July .

Asked what punishment anti-mural taggers should suffer , Stromberg suggested perhaps the person should be `` tarred and feathered , and tied to the defaced wall for a few days and nights ? Spray-paint their faces ? ''

Compromising with taggers ?

`` My response this time is to collaborate with my tagger , and not return the piece to its original state , but see what happens , '' said Stromberg , 50 , while laboring to repair his mural .

`` The tags inspire new visual vocabularies I would not have thought to paint , had the piece not been tagged . ''

Stromberg 's Facebook friends analyzed the tagger 's motive .

`` You could think of it in terms of mental illness . It 's Tourette 's -- but they have to write their name over and over maybe , '' posted one colleague .

`` He is expressing some sort of superiority -- read : ` internalized inferiority ' -- over a real artist . I was just marveling at the tags on the toilet seat at a local establishment . How low do you have to be , to want to tag that ? '' someone else wrote .

`` I really just do n't get why he has chosen to target Mats Stromberg of all people . A legendary , grimy , old school Mission dude , underground pioneer , '' another dismayed artist wrote .

`` Stick a nanny cam on there , get a mug shot , and then paint the dude 's face on there , wearing a T-shirt that says ` I 'm with stupid ' and an arrow pointing the guy 's head , '' suggested another post .

`` I 'm guessing they see a legitimate commissioned or permitted works of art , as being part of the establishment , '' said Stromberg .

`` What started as a neighborhood-based project committed to diversity and inclusion , is now a magnet for lots of folks hoping to profit off of the image that CAMP has created -- from the developers and real estate agents who use CAMP as a selling point for the ` cool , hip Mission experience , ' to those who use the space for fashion shoots , to corporations hoping to include the ` gritty urban street art ' image to sell their products , to any number of paid tours by folks unrelated to CAMP , spreading misinformation about the project , artists and murals , '' she wrote on her website .

No control over taggers

Many of San Francisco 's large murals are the result of serious negotiations between artists and wall owners -- including shopkeepers , residents or city officials -- to ensure the painting remains visible and not erased for violating private property .

`` I believe taggers will always state their voice , '' said Perez-Boza . `` Whether it 's tagging a white wall , a mural , local mom and pop , venues , billboards , public transit or corporate buildings . ''

`` Or jealousy and envy . Or they just do n't care .

`` I do n't know what the punishment should be , if someone intentionally spray-painted over a mural .

`` It 's not like the law is involved , unless you 're tagging a McDonald 's ad , '' Perez-Boza said , laughing .

`` I had someone tag one of my work-in-progress murals .

`` The silly part about this was how they displayed it .

`` My wall was about 15 feet high , 20 feet wide . Their mark was no bigger then six inches . ''
