-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The CEO of Levis Strauss , Chip Bergh , has some advice for you : Do n't wash your jeans .

As in do n't wash them ... ever . Speaking at Fortune 's Brainstorm Green conference , Chip said he was sporting a pair that had `` yet to see a washing machine '' in over a year .

Worried about germs , you germaphobes ? No problem , he says . Just stick your jeans in the freezer once a month next to the frozen waffles to kill off the bacteria . Apparently getting them icy will neutralize the sweat , coffee spills and other bodily fluids that might collect in the zipper or `` seating '' area . He also suggests spot cleaning with a sponge or a toothbrush .

Bergh claims that not washing your jeans keeps them in mint condition and helps conserve water . Both noble pursuits . But what about conserving the cleanliness of your lower extremities and not subjecting your colleagues to the stench of dirty denim ? Have you ever cooked bacon or mucked a stall in a pair of jeans ? It 's a gift that keeps on giving .

And with this thought , it has dawned on me . He 's not talking to people like my Uncle Warren , who rise with the sun to work the Angus cattle farm that 's been in my family for generations . He 's talking to people who like to look fancy in their jeans .

And listen , science says this `` freezing jean '' phenomena does n't stand up to analysis . In plain English : No , freezing your jeans will not kill all bacteria , but throwing them in the microwave just might . Stephen Craig Cary , a University of Delaware expert on frozen microbes suggests `` you either raise the temperature to 121 degrees Celsius for at least 10 minutes or just wash them ! The latter surely is the best alternative to save energy . ''

He adds : `` One might think that if the temperature drops well below the human body temperature they -LRB- bacteria -RRB- will not survive , but actually many will . Many are pre-adapted to survive low temperatures . ''

Robbins : That 's gross

She says science does n't support this , even though there 's lots of online info on how to do it

Robbins : People who buy new jeans frequently could do it ; for the rest of us , it 's unsanitary
