-LRB- OPRAH.com -RRB- -- Every family has its own set of holiday traditions . Some spend the day opening gifts and stuffing themselves with turkey , while others volunteer at soups kitchens , sing in the church choir or take in a movie .

The families of America 's biggest music stars are no different . At country music star Tim McGraw 's house , the holidays are a time to celebrate his mother 's Italian heritage .

`` I grew up with pasta on Christmas Eve , '' he says . `` So it 's passed on to me now . I make the pasta every Christmas Eve . We have spaghetti and meatballs . ''

Tim says he does n't mind doing the cooking ... but do n't ask him to pick up anything at the mall . `` I like giving money so I do n't have to shop , '' he says .

While Tim 's favorite gift to give is one-size-fits-all , the best gift he ever received was a one-of-a-kind . `` Our youngest daughter was born under 4 pounds , and she was seven or eight weeks early , '' he says . '' -LSB- That year -RSB- , we got to bring her home right before Christmas . ''

For musicians who tour for months at a time , the holidays are the perfect time of year to reconnect with loved ones . Singer Alicia Keys says this is the one time of the year she and her family gather to enjoy each other 's company .

Christmas means different foods , carols and customs around the world , but the spirit of the season stays the same .

Many of Andrea 's soul-stirring songs are popular at the holidays , but when he wants to get into the holiday spirit , he says he listens to `` Adeste Fideles , '' also known as `` O Come All Ye Faithful . ''

`` It 's very religious , '' he says . `` A very simple and sweet song . ''

It also just so happens that Kristian 's favorite thing about the holiday season is the music . `` It 's one time a year where , on the radio , everyone 's sentimental , '' he says .

Sugarland 's lead singer , Jennifer Nettles , says she recently started a new holiday tradition in her home . While some people host cookie swaps , Jennifer prefers a soup party !

`` Ladies of America , I urge you to do this , '' she says . `` Everybody brings your favorite soup , and then one person does n't have to do it all . The leftovers are great because you can take it home and freeze it . It lasts forever . ''

Think beyond tomato and chicken noodle . `` All kinds of soup -- not just regular , '' she says . `` We 're talking like potato soup and vegetarian chili . ''
