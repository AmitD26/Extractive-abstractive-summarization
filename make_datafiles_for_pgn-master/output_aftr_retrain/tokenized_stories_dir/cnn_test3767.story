London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Some people believe football is a matter of life and death ... I assure you it is much , much more important than that . ''

The `` Football War '' between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969 is perhaps the most famous example of the sport 's wider implications . The two Central American nations famously came to blows following their qualification match for the 1970 World Cup .

But this was n't the first time , and definitely wo n't be the last , that the worlds of football and politics collide with remarkable results .

According to the BBC 's `` World Cup Stories '' book by Chris Hunt , there were suggestions that the Italian dictator himself picked the referees . In the semifinal against Austria , Mussolini 's Azzurri team won 2-1 , but after the game their opponents complained the game was fixed .

2 . Austrian star humiliates Nazis , 1938

Star striker Matthias Sindelar so opposed his nation 's loss of independence that he refused to play for Germany . He pleaded old age , but Germany 's manager Sepp Herberger would later recall : `` I almost had the impression that discomfort and rejection , linked to the political developments , had prompted his refusal . ''

During a so-called `` Reconciliation Game '' to mark the merging of the two sides , Sindelar made his feelings quite clear in a 2-0 win for Austria . According to German historian Nils Havemann 's book `` Fussball unterm Hakenkreuz , '' the center-forward scored his beloved country 's first and then , when the second goal went in , he danced in celebration in front of Nazi officials .

In 1939 , Sindelar and his girlfriend were killed in his apartment by a gas leak . Controversy still reigns over whether it was murder or suicide -- or just an accident .

3 . Algerians play for independence , 1958

Halfway through Algeria 's War of Independence , the French national team called up a handful of Algerians playing in the French soccer league for the World Cup in Sweden .

Given the chance of glory , fame and fortune , the players chose national identity instead . Rather than attend a pre-tournament friendly against Switzerland , they decided to flee France , gather at the headquarters of the Front Liberation National in Tunisia and launch an `` illegal '' national team , risking arrest for desertion in the process .

Rachid Maflouki had won the French championship with Saint Etienne before getting the call from Les Bleus , but decided there were more important matters at stake than his personal success .

`` I did n't hesitate , '' he told Ian Hawkey , author of `` Feet of the Chameleon . ''

`` Okay , I would have to give up my club . And yes , I was thinking about the World Cup , but what did that count for in comparison with my country 's independence ? ''

The Leopards , the first sub-Saharan African nation to reach the finals , had already been humiliated 9-0 by Yugoslavia before losing 2-0 to Scotland , and were told by President Mobutu 's henchmen that if they lost to Brazil by more than three goals they would n't be allowed to return home .

`` Do you think I 'd deliberately make myself look like an idiot ? You have to remember we were playing for our lives , '' he said in the book `` Death or Glory , the Dark History of the World Cup '' by Jon Spurling .

Mwepu 's act of `` madness , '' it turns out , was in fact a very sane attempt to waste time .

5 . The German nation divided , 1974

Although the game was actually the last in the group and it had become clear that both teams would qualify from the group stage , that did not diminish the tension surrounding the clash .

Ten shocking World Cup moments

East Germany heralded their triumph , but the victory was rendered a little hollow after they were knocked out in the next round and their bitter rivals went on to win the tournament .

6 . Argentine junta swaps grain for glory , 1978

Argentina 's junta , which had seized power just a couple of years earlier , was determined to use the World Cup it was hosting as propaganda for the regime .

In the group stages , Argentina needed to beat Peru by four goals in their last game to progress . General Jorge Videla made a timely pre-match visit to the Peruvian dressing-room to talk to the players about `` Latin American unity '' before the host nation rattled six past a side that had previously held eventual finalists Holland to a goalless draw .

Avignolo claimed that in the weeks following the Peru game , an impromptu cargo of 35,000 tonnes of wheat left Argentina for Lima and that the military regime issued an interest-free loan of $ 50 million to the Peruvian government .

7 . Iran 's football revolution , 1998

Although political relations were strained , the clash of civilizations never quite happened on the pitch . Instead , both sides showed the utmost respect , swapping flowers , gifts and photographs before the kick-off .

The Iranians won 2-1 , but , celebrations back home had a destabilizing effect as hundreds of thousands of young people , including women , partied in the streets in defiance of government warnings .

8 . Germany enjoys `` Partyotism , '' 2006

A combination of a flawless summer and coach Jurgen Klinsmann 's flee-flowing football injected a feel-good factor back into the national psyche , and Germans realized they could enjoy patriotism again -- or as the local media billed it , `` partyotism . ''

`` In the space of one month , Klinsmann managed to bring together a society ashamed of displays of nationalism and still divided along East-West lines , turning Germany into a nation of face-painting , flag-waving patriots , '' Hunt said in his `` World Cup Stories '' book .

`` Never mind the final , '' Britain 's The Times newspaper wrote . `` Germans are the real World Cup winners . ''

9 . The Koreas refuse to play nicely , 2008

So determined were the North Koreans that they were even prepared to play their `` home '' game abroad . In the end , the fixture took place in Shanghai , where the North Korean coach complained that their rivals had poisoned their food .

In a statement about the match , the North 's football association said : `` It was beyond all doubt that the incident was a product of a deliberate act perpetrated by adulterated foodstuff as -LSB- the players -RSB- could not get up all of a sudden just before the match . ''

No doubt the fact that neither side had a chance of qualifying for South Africa helped keep things civil .
