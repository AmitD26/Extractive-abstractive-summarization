Amsterdam Airport Schiphol -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was impossible not to be deeply moved by Harun Calehr when he and his family joined Chris Cuomo live on `` New Day '' on Wednesday .

We may have seen the bodies of the dead scattered across the Eastern Ukrainian countryside , distorted , rotting , a dog running from the crash site with something in its mouth .

Seen the scattered belongings , many strangely intact , the house keys , the Bali travel guide , the child 's toy perched on top of the wreckage , retrieved by a villager from where it had fallen from the sky .

We may have dashed along potted roads , finding new routes to avoid the shelling , pleading with the sun not to fall so we could be safer . Through check point after check point , guns aimed at us . Convoys of tanks and artillery on those same roads , belonging to both sides and wondered their destination , purpose and origin .

As journalists we are often fickle and fleeting in our gaze , but we remain proud and committed to impartiality . Too often impartiality breeds a lack of empathy , not wanting to be drawn too close to one side or the other .

But today was different . For the Calehr family , and those just like them , ripped apart , bereft and desperate for answers , this was never their war . We stood together , in front of the camera and then behind it , and we mourned too .
