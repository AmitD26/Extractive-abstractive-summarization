-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A state-run Chinese newspaper expressed relief Monday that senior Japanese officials had dismissed the country 's air force chief after he denied Japan 's aggression before and during World War II .

Gen. Toshio Tamogami lost his job as chief of staff for Japan 's Air Self-Defense Force , the Ministry of Defense said , after saying in an essay that `` it is certainly a false accusation to say that our country was an aggressor nation . ''

Japanese troops invaded China in 1937 and were widely accused of gross human rights abuses , including raping tens of thousands of girls and women and killing several hundred thousand others in what has come to be called `` The Rape of Nanking . '' Imperial Japan also invaded several other Asian nations , leading to the death and misery for an untold number .

Tamogami 's essay , published late last week , also stirred controversy in South Korea .

Japan controlled Korea from 1910 to 1945 . Its military is accused of forcing roughly 200,000 women , mainly from Korea and China , to serve as sex slaves -- they were known euphemistically as `` comfort women '' -- for soldiers in the Imperial Army .

`` His claim is distorting history , '' the statement said . `` International friendly relations are based on repentance for past wrongdoings and learning a lesson from history , ''

Several Japanese leaders have apologized in recent years for past Japanese aggression .

In 2005 , then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apologized for his country 's role in World War II on the 60th anniversary of the war 's end . He vowed Japan would never again take `` the path to war . ''

In 1995 , on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama also expressed Tokyo 's deep remorse and heartfelt apology for the damage and suffering it inflicted on its Asian neighbors .

And in 2001 , Koizumi apologized for Japanese treatment of Koreans during its occupation of the Korean peninsula during the first half of the 20th century .

At the height of the conflict , much of southeast Asia , China and the Pacific islands were in Japanese hands .
