LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From `` Gladiator '' to `` The Lion King '' , `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' to `` The Simpsons , '' film composer Hans Zimmer 's versatile and imaginative scores have added aural color , light and shade to the on-screen action .

Composer Hans Zimmer , interviewed by CNN 's Screening Room

Nominated for an Oscar seven times -LRB- he won for 1995 's `` The Lion King '' -RRB- , Zimmer had just two weeks of formal music lessons as a child . He worked as an assistant to film composer Stanley Myers in London where he learnt `` how to wrestle an orchestra to the ground '' while making the coffee . That led to a job with Myers on Nic Roeg 's epic `` Eureka '' -- and the rest is film history .

CNN 's The Screening Room talked to him about the magic that music can bring to the movies .

CNN : What is the reality behind the glamour of working as a film composer ?

Hans Zimmer : It 's an industry that relies so heavily on the idea that I will wake up tomorrow morning with a great tune in my head . This usually does n't happen , so it 's a whole industry based on the fallacy that we , the filmmakers , will actually come up with some good ideas and meet our deadlines , when really we sit in our rooms by ourselves and knock our heads against the wall until something happens .

Most of my ideas are terrible and occasionally there 's a glimmer of hope and a decent tune comes out ; but to make a movie you have to rely very heavily on the creative input of everyone else . I love speaking with the editors , hanging out with the director and whoever . The movie shapes itself through these conversations .

HZ : It changes all the time . You grab a fragment of something to start an idea with ; tiny ideas . It 's a complete hodgepodge of ways of sneaking up on the beast . For instance , on `` Pirates 3 , '' a lot of the music was written while Gore was shooting or before he went off shooting the movie . Finally , I moved the whole studio to Disney 's cutting rooms because being in the same space as the movie makes a difference and part of what I should do is try to inspire the production .

CNN : Your score for `` Gladiator '' really stands out . What inspired you on this film ?

HZ : It started off with Ridley phoning me . He goes , `` I 'm going to be shooting this big battle scene south of London . Why do n't you come over and we 'll have a chat ? '' And I 'm driving through this wood and I get to a dirt track ; and it 's a miserable day , only the way England in November can be .

CNN : Describe the moment of playing your first musical sketches to a director .

HZ : Terror . You ca n't defend it and it 's very simple : however it lands , this thing that you have slaved over , if it does n't resonate ; if it does n't communicate , you got ta start again . It 's -- I 'm hedging around having to say the sentence because it sounds pretentious -- you write stuff from your heart . When you play anything for anybody for the first time it 's terrifying because you 're letting them having a look at a very vulnerable part of you .

HZ : This was pretty early on in my career . I 'm a huge Elton fan and always was . Elton had done these piano demos . I took the first one , ` Circle of Life , ' and made up my mind there were two ways I could approach it : I could either be really respectful of Elton 's notes and what he had done , and very slavishly try to orchestrate it , or I could try to make it my own , usurp it , throw my stuff at it and go crazy , which is pretty much what I did . Then they had to show it to Elton and I 'm sitting next to him , pretty nervous -- and on the CD you get Elton 's version and my version and you can see how radically different they are -- and the great thing about him is he 's so secure in his artistry as a songwriter that he loved it . And it was the beginning of a very good friendship .

CNN : Are there particular challenges working on animated films as opposed to live action films ?

HZ : With animated film you have to create the sonic world ; there 's nothing there . You get to color things in more and you 're allowed to overreach yourself a little bit more and it 's great fun .

CNN : You 've also mentored a number of others . Why is that important for you ?

CNN : When do you think a score works best as opposed to a soundtrack of pre-existing songs ?

HZ : It depends . `` The Graduate '' must be the best use of songs ever in a movie ; it adds a layer to the movie you would n't ever get from a score . `` The Mission Law , '' `` Chariots of Fire , '' `` Lawrence of Arabia '' -- I ca n't imagine those movies would have worked as well with just a bunch of songs put into them . It does n't matter how good they are . They serve different purposes . Songs come with baggage . A score usually does n't -- a score is strictly for that moment in time .
