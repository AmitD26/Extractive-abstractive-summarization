Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia unsealed an indictment Friday accusing 45-year-old Eric C. Opitz of bilking Medicare out of more than $ 535,000 by claiming he was a dwarf who needed human growth hormone .

In reality , according to the indictment , Opitz was 450 pounds and 6 feet , 3 inches .

But for nearly a year , a pharmacy filled the physical trainer and body building consultant 's prescriptions for as much as 8 milligrams of growth hormone per day -- 40 times the FDA 's recommended maximum dose , according to prosecutors .

He sold , it , prosecutors say , at something like $ 450 for each kit . He found his customers through a brazen ad on Craigslist , according to the indictment .
