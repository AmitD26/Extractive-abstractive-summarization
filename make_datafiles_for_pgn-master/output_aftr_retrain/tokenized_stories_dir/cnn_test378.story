-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pot smokers traveling to Denver to take advantage of Colorado 's new recreational marijuana law are being warned it 's against the rules to carry it through the airport .

You wo n't be searched and there are no drug dogs patrolling Denver International Airport , but if you are searched for another reason , you could lose your weed and face a $ 999 administrative fine , Denver International Airport spokeswoman Stacey Stegman told CNN on Monday .

Denver police , who patrol the huge airport , will decide if a ticket will be issued , just as if it were a speeding ticket , Stegman said . An administrative law judge would hear any cases that are contested , she said .

`` Signs are going up , but we still have some processes to go through , '' she said . `` Warnings will be issued for a short period of time . ''

Colorado cities have authority under the new law to ban marijuana from public property , including municipal airports .

While some states are decriminalizing or legalizing pot sales and possession , federal laws against marijuana have not changed .

`` We share a space with federal agencies , so we also have to respect their rules and regulations , '' Stegman said . We are trying to make the best of the situation . It is new , and we 're all learning . ''
