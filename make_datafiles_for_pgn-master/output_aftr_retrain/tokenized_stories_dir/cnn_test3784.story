`` Police plan a large-scale security operation for tonight to protect Egypt 's Coptic Christians and their churches . '' Col. Alla Mahmoud of the interior ministry said Thursday .

Protests have broken out in Christian areas of Egypt every night since the car bombing outside the Church of the Two Saints in Alexandria .

Hundreds of officers -- outfitted in helmets with visors , body armor and carrying shields and night sticks -- lined the streets , leaving a path for demonstrators to pass .

`` The man in the picture is unknown and authorities are trying to confirm his identity , '' Mahmoud said .

The interior ministry used forensic technology to recreate the face of the suspected suicide bomber .

Coptic Christians base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark , who introduced Christianity to Egypt , according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria , the capital of Coptic Christianity .

The religion is known for its rift with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ .
