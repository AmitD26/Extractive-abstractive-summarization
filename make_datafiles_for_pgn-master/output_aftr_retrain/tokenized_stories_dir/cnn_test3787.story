On April 28 , 2008 , I found myself in the worst ambush of my life -- surrounded by 45 Taliban fighters , out of grenades , and running low on bullets . We had been fighting nonstop for an hour . A mortar round landed within a few meters of my position and sent me flying into a ditch .

I turned and saw my Afghan interpreter Janis Shenwary glaring down the barrel of his rifle at the bodies of the two Taliban fighters he had just killed . They had me dead to rights until Janis acted to save mine . On that April day he taught me the true price of loyalty and brotherhood forged through combat .

The Taliban retaliated by placing him on the top of its kill list .

Wars have consequences , many unforeseen . One of the most profound and seldom-discussed consequence is what happens to our Iraqi and Afghan allies .

Most important , many of these people chose to fight with us because we implored them to -- and now they are going to die because we failed to truly defeat our common enemies and we 're apparently comfortable with abandoning our allies as we retreat .

A common truth among U.S. military veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars -LRB- especially those of us who served on the front lines -RRB- is that our interpreters most likely saw more and worse combat than the majority of us . As a result , we tend to view our `` terps '' as full and equal combat veterans .

Almost all interpreters face some threat -- being a collaborator also has consequences . But many end up on the Taliban or al Qaeda 's hit lists . And that 's where we ca n't understand our government 's treatment of these fellow veterans .

If they were American citizens , we 'd spare no expense protecting them and helping them flee to the safety of U.S. soil . But , because they were born Afghan or Iraqi , they 're somehow subject to a lower standard of treatment . The truth is , these translators did a lot more than most Americans to protect and defend our country . They have earned their place in America .

The State Department estimates that it has a backlog of 6,000 Afghan applicants . If Congress fails to pass the law by September 30 , 2014 , the program will end and these applicants , many who have been waiting years for a ruling on their application , will likely never receive the visas they so bravely earned . We will simply abandon them to a gruesome and torturous death at the hands of the Taliban .

As an American soldier and a former Afghan translator who lives in America and dreams of the day he becomes a citizen , the prospect of abandoning our allies and breaking our promise disgusts us .

How many times in the last century have we vowed `` never again '' after profound human suffering ? We said it after we left Saigon in 1975 . And again as we watched from the sidelines in horror at Rwanda in 1994 . I fear we may be already saying it in Iraq .

The coming tragedy in Afghanistan is entirely preventable . We have n't yet abandoned our closest Afghan allies to Taliban slaughter . All we have to do is have the courage to act -- if we do n't soon , we 'll once more absently vow `` Never Again . ''
