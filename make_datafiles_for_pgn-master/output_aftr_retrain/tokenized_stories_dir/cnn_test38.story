-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egypt 's tumultuous political process took another dramatic turn Thursday when its Supreme Constitutional Court effectively dissolved parliament , ruling that the election of one-third of its members last year was unconstitutional . The court also ruled that former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq can remain a presidential candidate in this weekend 's runoff election , despite his close association with the former regime .

While some Muslim Brotherhood leaders are referring to the court 's decisions as a `` full-fledged coup , '' it is more accurate to see recent events as an energetic `` counter-revolution . ''

Egypt 's presidential runoff to go ahead despite concerns

The remnants of the establishment , including the economically privileged military and the Mubarak-appointed judiciary , are flexing the powers they never gave up to make sure they remain in control . The now dissolved parliament was supposed to establish a 100-member Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution ; instead , the military has announced that it will determine the composition of the committee .

On Wednesday , the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces also issued a decree giving the military police and intelligence service the right to detain civilians and send them to military tribunals . Essentially , the decree replicates the dreaded State of Emergency law that was in effect for most of the past 30 years under Mubarak until it was overturned on May 31 . The security forces are clearly girding for another round of massive street protests by Egypt 's revolutionaries when they rally to resist the counter-revolution .

Analysts : ` Soft coup ' court ruling could reignite Egyptian revolution

Undoubtedly , there are behind-the-scenes negotiations occurring as Brotherhood leaders meet with the SCAF to figure out what influence they can now expect . Egypt 's stability now rests on whether they can come to some accommodation that will lead to a gradual transition acceptable to the major players . The military must recognize that its attempts to reverse the democratic transition will eventually fail .
