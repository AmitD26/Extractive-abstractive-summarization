-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They were warned not to share it , but share it they did .

On Wednesday morning , the whistleblowing group , headed by Julian Assange , broke a suppression order , which was itself subject to a suppression order .

In the United Kingdom , such an order is known as a super-injunction , and is used by judges to ensure secrecy around specific events . And many people talking about the case on Twitter used the hashtag #superinjunction .

This one involves a court case , international politicians and allegations that a Supreme Court judge in the Australian state of Victoria deemed should not be repeated .

The Victorian Supreme Court declined to comment on the matter to CNN .

`` They -LSB- Wikileaks -RSB- have put themselves in the position of judge , jury and executioner , '' said Peter Bartlett , a media lawyer from Minter Ellison law firm in Melbourne .

`` The difficulty for the court is that WikiLeaks is not , of course , in the jurisdiction of Australia , '' he said .

`` If Assange ever comes back to Australia , you would expect that he would immediately be charged with breaking a suppression order . ''

Assange remains holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London where he sought political asylum two years ago after publishing reams of classified U.S. documents online .

He 's wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual assault in Sweden , which he claims are politically motivated .

The report found that in the five years between 2008 and 2012 , Victorian courts issued 1,501 suppression orders , including 281 in the Supreme Court .

`` These laws are quite draconian , '' said Chris Nash , a professor of journalism at Monash University in Melbourne , and the former director of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism .
