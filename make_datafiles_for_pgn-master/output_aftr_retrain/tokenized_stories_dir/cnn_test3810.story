-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday called for an overhaul of the 35-year-old federal law governing toxic chemicals in the environment , saying it fails to safeguard children and pregnant women .

`` It is widely recognized to have been ineffective in protecting children , pregnant women and the general population from hazardous chemicals in the marketplace , '' the academy said in a policy statement that will be published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics .

The American Medical Association , the American Public Health Association and the American Nurses Association have previously called for changes in the Toxic Substance Control Act .

Among the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations :

-- The health effects of chemicals should be monitored after they are on the market , and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should have the authority to remove a chemical from the market if it 's deemed dangerous .

`` Right now , a company manufactures a chemical and puts it out on the market and reaps the economic reward , '' said Dr. Jerome Paulson , lead author of the policy statement . `` And then the public is responsible for trying to figure out if there is any harm associated with the use of that chemical . And then it 's almost a criminal procedure , requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt . ''

Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey this month introduced the Safe Chemicals Act of 2011 . The law would require chemical manufacturers to demonstrate the safety of industrial chemicals used in everyday household products .

The American Chemical Council , the industry trade group , acknowledges the 1976 act needs to be updated .

`` Chemicals should be safe for their intended use and potential risks faced by children should be an important factor in safe use determinations , '' he added .

Also , the pediatricians ' organization noted , exposure to toxic chemicals in the environment can hurt fertility . For example , one study found women exposed to higher levels of the flame retardant polybrominated diphenyl ether took significantly longer to get pregnant .

As part of its policy statement , the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended its 60,000 member pediatricians familiarize themselves with the potential adverse health effects of chemicals in the environment .
