Even the typography and colors of a globe are indicative of the time and place of its origin , says Sylvia Sumira , a London-based conservator of ancient globes .

Contrary to the popular misconception that nobody knew the Earth was round before Columbus , the ancient Greeks described the making of globes -LRB- in verse , no less -RRB- in the third century B.C. . The oldest surviving globe dates back to 150 A.D. . But they really took off between about 1500 and 1900 , and it 's this period that 's the focus of Globes .

There are records of globes being brought on ships during the age of exploration , but they probably were n't used for navigation , Sumira says .

`` They 're more a symbol of navigation than a tool for navigation , '' she said . In the book , she writes that in the 17th century , globes were sold as `` handsome objects of status and prestige to a comfortable merchant class . ''

Not that ancient globes do n't convey some useful information . Much of it is contained in the horizon ring that surrounds many of them . Concentric circles printed or engraved on the ring indicate the degrees of the compass , the months of the year , zodiac signs , and sometimes information about winds .

They can be used , for example , to determine the sunrise and sunset on a given day of the year , Sumira says . `` Most of the globes were like little calculating machines . ''

Getting your bearings with the celestial globes is a little tricky . It helps if you pretend you 're God , looking down at the heavens from on high . The earth would be a dot inside the center of the globe . From this view , the constellations are mirror images of how they appear from Earth .

Among Sumira 's favorites are the pocket globes . `` They 're just delightful little things , '' she said . The smallest is just 1.5 inches in diameter . Many come in a wood or leather case that opens up to reveal a terrestrial globe that can be taken out . The concave surface of the case often contains a matching celestial globe .
