-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In her 1976 keynote address to the Democratic National Committee , Texas Rep. Barbara Jordan said words I will never forget :

That explains why I am a Democrat .

Today , unfortunately , the right to vote seems to have become a partisan issue . Democrats seek to guarantee and expand voting rights . Republicans try to undermine and suppress voting rights .

Clinton helps launch push against voter ` restrictions '

Dirksen responded , and the bill passed . His words remain relevant : `` The right to vote is still an issue in this free country . There has to be a real remedy . This can not go on forever , this denial of the right to vote by ruses and devices and tests and whatever the mind can contrive to either make it very difficult or to make it impossible to vote . ''

We agree . That is why I am proud to be launching the Democratic National Committee 's new initiative -- the Voter Expansion Project -- where we are taking action to expand voting opportunities for all . We 're moving beyond simply protecting the vote and becoming the leader in expanding the vote .

The Voter Expansion Project 's mission is clear : Ensure that every eligible citizen can register , every registered voter can vote , and every vote is accurately counted .

Let me repeat that -- our mission is to ensure that every eligible citizen can register , every registered voter can vote , and every vote is accurately counted . I believe in the marketplace of ideas . I also believe that every citizen should have equal access -- through their voice and their vote .

Today , too many Republicans are making it harder for working Americans , students , women , people of color and the elderly to participate in the process . In states like Ohio , North Carolina , Florida , Texas , Wisconsin and many others , we see Republican-controlled legislatures engaged in voter suppression efforts , such as curtailing early voting , requiring restrictive IDs , etc. .

That 's not the American way . As Ronald Reagan said , `` For this nation to remain true to its principles , we can not allow any American 's vote to be denied , diluted or defiled . The right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties , and we will not see its luster diminished . ''

But let me also be clear : As a Democrat and as an American , I do n't believe we can wait . I am committed to the Voter Expansion Project because it will expand the vote by creating more access , engage more voters , protect the vote by breaking down barriers , demystify the process and make sure every vote is counted .

1 . Voter education -- train campaign staff , volunteers and voters about the rules and regulations in order to demystify the voting experience

4 . Litigation -- fight laws that make registering to vote and casting a ballot more difficult to decrease participation
