Sitting inside the chapel of the San Juan Bosco shelter for deportees in Nogales , Mexico , Rey and Herlinda rest and wait for another chance to cross illegally into the United States with their children ages 4 , 9 and 11 in tow . Temperatures in this stretch of desert that straddles the U.S.-Mexico border hover around 100 degrees .

`` People are still driven by economic necessity to come to the United States by whatever means they can . Some come to join family members already here , others because they are hungry , '' said Isabel Garcia , a public defender and a co-chair of the Tucson , Arizona-based Coalition for Human Rights .

`` But the fact is that very few are prepared for such a hard trip . Many have to survive days and days in the desert , '' she said , `` and they can never carry enough water . ''

Some make it past the desert and go on to find jobs in the United States . But on the Mexican side of the border , deportations from the United States have become so common that shelters and businesses have opened up , catering to people who 've gotten kicked out of the United States .

Loureiro says she opened up the San Juan Bosco shelter after seeing deportees huddle in the back of her shop which is located just a few blocks from the fence that divides her city from Nogales , Arizona . She decided to build a place for them to spend a few days in safety .

Dozens of migrants arrive each day at her shelter for food and a chance to sleep on a soft mattress . Most of the time , she says , they leave not to go back to their homes , but to try and cross into the United States again .

Portraits of saints and other religious icon fill the chapel , where travelers say their prayers before chancing the desert again .

But from her point of view at the border , Loureiro says she does n't think any efforts in Washington to boost border security will have much of an impact on whether people make the dangerous journey .

`` The migrants are going to continue trying to get to the other side of the border no matter what . They will do this regardless of danger or consequence , '' Loureiro said . `` They will do it because they lack economic opportunities in Mexico and they lack the education and -LRB- job -RRB- skills to get ahead . ''

According to the office of U.S. Customs and Border Protection , in fiscal year 2013 a total of 414,397 undocumented immigrants were apprehended after crossing the border illegally into the United States . The previous year , the figure was 356,873 .

For those who make it across the border , it is n't an easy journey . Thousands of would-be immigrants have died in the desert of southern Arizona in the past 10 years , according to the Pima County Medical Examiner 's Office . Most of them die after suffering dehydration in the summer or fall to hypothermia in the winter .

`` Many fall into the abuses of the smugglers , sexual abuse , '' said Manuel Padilla , head of the Border Patrol 's Tucson sector . `` The only thing that matters to them is money , not people . ''

Padilla said Border Patrol agents often spot and rescue immigrants stranded in the desert , which is an important part of the agency 's job . However , the agency also focuses on prevention , by educating would-be immigrants of the dangers involved in trying to cross the border illegally .

They ask foreign diplomats at consulates in the United States to spread the word in their countries about the dangers of illegal border crossings , and they try to get the word out in Spanish-language media , Padilla said .

Even so , the phenomenon of deaths in the desert has become so bad that one group of investigators labeled it a `` humanitarian crisis at the border . ''

`` Since 2001 we 've had around 2,200 immigrant deaths , '' most of them Mexican citizens , said Gregory Hess , the Pima County medical examiner . `` When we find only a bone in the desert , a femur ... or an arm , it 's not here for long ... we take photographs and measurements and DNA '' samples .

Searching for clues

Since a majority of the bodies belong to Mexican citizens , morgue staff are in regular contact with the Mexican Consulate in Tucson .

'' -LRB- This one -RRB- has dental work . Sometimes teeth give us clues as to where they come from , '' Garcia said as he examined cadavers and bones at the Pima County morgue . `` Central Americans , particularly Guatemalans , often have ornamental work done . They put copper stars on their teeth . ''

Migrants sometimes sew documents into their underclothes , or conceal strips of paper with the telephone number of a contact in the United States or their country of origin , he says . This information can be a solid clue to track down identity .

After the extensive search at the morgue , the bodies are labeled and stored in a freezer . Personal effects and identifications are also stored , as any clue could lead to the identification of a cadaver .

Sometimes , there are n't many clues . If all that Garcia and the medical examiner 's office have to go on is a set of dry bones , DNA testing is the only viable option .

The Mexican Consulate sometimes pays for the tests when Mexican citizens are involved .

For immigrants from other countries , the medical examiner 's office relies on its growing ties with the New York-based Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team .

`` This is never a happy ending . ... We just try to reduce the time that families have to prolong their pain , '' said Mercedes Doretti , who directs the organization . `` What it means is ending the uncertainty of the family not knowing what happened to their relative , the suffering that everyone goes through . ''
