Eight performers sustained serious injuries when the apparatus holding them failed , and they plummeted more than 15 feet . A ninth employee was hurt on the ground .

An investigation by the Department of Labor 's Occupational Safety and Health Administration found the accident occurred because the carabiner -- a metal ring used as a connector -- supporting the performers was improperly loaded .

A spokesman for the circus said the company has not yet made a decision about whether to appeal . It has 15 days to decide .

`` We do not agree with the conclusion that they drew that the way the carabiner was loaded was the sole case of the accident , '' said spokesman Steve Payne . `` But we 're going to make changes out of an abundance of caution . ''

The hair-hanging act is no longer in the show , and the circus does not have any plans at this point to bring such a stunt back , he said .

`` The safety of our performers , our crew -- as well as our audience -- is our top priority , '' said Payne . `` No one wants an accident like this to ever happen again . ''
