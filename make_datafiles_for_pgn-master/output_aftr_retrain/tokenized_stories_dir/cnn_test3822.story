-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the backs of iPods , iPhones and iPads , and on the bottom of Mac laptops , an inscription reads : `` Designed by Apple in California . Assembled in China . ''

But as the most valuable tech company in the world , Apple is seen by many as a role model in business . And its reliance on cheap overseas labor -- most notably at factories in China run by manufacturer Foxconn -- has come under increased scrutiny in recent media coverage by CNN , The New York Times and other outlets .

During the last three months of 2011 , Apple sold 37 million iPhones , 15.4 million iPads , 15.4 million iPods and 5.2 million Mac computers , according to the company 's financial report . That netted Apple $ 46.3 billion in revenue and $ 13.1 billion in profit , which is double what Apple made during the same period a year before .

Where does all that profit come from ?

Take the iPhone , for example . The iPhone 4S sells for $ 199 if the customer signs a two-year cellular contract . But AT&T , Sprint Nextel and Verizon Wireless pay Apple much more for the phones in order to sell them at a lower price , a process called subsidizing . To get a so-called `` unlocked '' or contract-free iPhone , expect to pay at least $ 649 to Apple .

The costs of parts and manufacturing for Apple 's iPhone 4S is estimated to be $ 196 , according to industry research firm IHS iSuppli . That 's $ 453 less than Apple charges for a contract-free phone . Marketing and research can add up , but no matter which way you cut it , Apple is making a sizable profit on each phone it sells , said iSuppli analyst Tom Dinges .

Still , Apple tries to minimize the number of companies with which it signs deals , Dinges said . That way , Apple wields more influence because it 's among the biggest-spending clients , he said .

`` They 'd rather be a mile deep in a supplier than divide the business up amongst five , '' Dinges said . `` You 're going to take care of your biggest customers first . ''

Being anointed by Apple boosts a supplier 's credibility , but Apple is a shrewd negotiator , from how it develops an iPad to how it leases or builds the retail store it 's sold in . This reportedly forces Apple 's partners to push workers and cut corners in order to wring profits .

`` We care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain , '' Apple said in the statement . `` We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect , and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made . Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple . ''
