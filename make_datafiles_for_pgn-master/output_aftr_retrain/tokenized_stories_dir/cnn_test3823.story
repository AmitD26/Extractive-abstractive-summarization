Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Navy SEAL who says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden says he is worried the Pentagon might prosecute him for publicly telling his story of the May 2011 raid on the al Qaeda leader 's compound in Pakistan .

But Robert O'Neill said the value of sharing the details of the mission for the families of the September 11 , 2001 , victims and military veterans killed in the ensuing wars makes that risk worthwhile .

In his most extensive live television interview to date , O'Neill said he realized the power of his story while speaking with a group that included about 20 families of victims of the September 11 attacks . He said it was the first time he 'd really spoken about the mission , and that men and women cried and told him `` it was closure for them . ''

Responding to criticisms from former administration officials and current servicemembers that he should n't be talking publicly , O'Neill said , `` I think it 's important historically for this to get out there . ''

`` We were the end of a long , long time of grieving , '' he said . `` We were everybody on that mission . You know , we were the Port Authority , the police department , the NYPD , the FDNY , we were the American people , the 9/11 families , and we were able to go there -- and just that I was able to be a part of that is just the greatest honor that 's ever been asked of me . ''

O'Neill described many of the details of the mission -- and his preparation beforehand .

He said he believed there was `` about a 90 percent chance that we were n't going to come back . '' Among the possible threats : Pakistan 's military , unaware of the mission , could shoot the two helicopters down . Bin Laden 's house could be wired with explosives . Others in the house could be wearing suicide vests .

He said he called his family members beforehand -- not offering details on what he was doing , but knowing that they 'd soon find out no matter how the mission ended . He also wrote letters to his young children , only to be delivered if he did n't survive at a later date when , for instance , he was n't there for their weddings .

As the group reached the third floor , he said , the SEAL in front of him dove on top of an `` unknown '' person -- it turned out to be a woman -- to absorb what they feared could be a blast from a suicide vest . He said he thought `` let 's get this over with '' as he entered the room expecting to be blown up by bin Laden .

That 's when O'Neill identified the al Qaeda mastermind .

The magnitude of what he 'd done did n't register immediately . O'Neill first worried about eliminating other potential threats -- moving a woman and child out of the way , and then clearing the room .

`` It was n't until the room was cleared and there were more SEALs in the room that it kind of hit me . I had a moment of pause , '' he said .

A friend put his hand on O'Neill 's shoulder .

`` I said , ` Hey , what do we do now ? ' '' O'Neill said . `` He said , ` Now we go find the computers . ' I said , ` OK , I 'm back . ' ''

Later , O'Neill sat feet from bin Laden 's body , eating a breakfast sandwich and watching a flat-screen television , while watching President Barack Obama announce to the world that the United States had killed bin Laden .
