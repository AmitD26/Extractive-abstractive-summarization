COCHABAMBA , Bolivia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A hundred years ago a Brazilian physician , Carlos Chagas , showed that monkeys were susceptible to a rare parasitic illness carried by a particular Latin American bug .

A mother and baby visit a clinic in Bolivia to get tested for Chagas .

Today an estimated 16 to 18 million people are infected with Chagas , as the disease is now known , and it claims some 50,000 lives each year . Yet most people have never heard of it .

In Bolivia , an estimated one in five people are infected . So why is so little known about the disease ?

One crucial reason is that it only affects the poor .

Infected women can transfer chagas to their child during pregnancy , delivery or while breastfeeding .

`` Most people do n't know they 've been infected , '' says Dr. Tom Ellman , who works in Bolivia with humanitarian agency , Doctors Without Borders .

He told CNN : `` Many of them will drop down dead usually from heart problems cause by the disease 10 , 20 , 30 years after they 've been infected and no one will know why . ''

`` What we need now is more interest . We 're still using drugs invented over forty years ago , that have huge numbers of side effects and take sixty or ninety days to work , '' he told CNN .

Even after these extensive courses of anti-parasitic drugs , there is no definitive test to see if the patient has been cured . Doctors can only advise patients to return in two years .

Chagas can be detected via blood test . In the clinics where Doctors Without Borders work , they advise parents to have themselves and their children tested whenever they visit a clinic .

But the challenge they face is vast . How to make a population wise to the threat of a disease that is already plaguing them , and that many have still never heard of .
