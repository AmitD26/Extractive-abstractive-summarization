-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Away from the manicured glamor of the Croisette , there 's another Cannes -- a Cannes that lies beneath . Beneath the red carpet of the Palais du Festival in the basement , that is .

THIS IS THE CANNES YOU THINK YOU KNOW ...

It 's a galaxy away from the movie screenings of the Official Selection -- the elite group of films chosen by the festival 's selection committee from the thousands submitted each year -- of which just 18 go into competition for the feted top prize , the Palme D'Or .

THEY MOSTLY LOOK LIKE THIS ...

So if you find yourself not among those with Nicole Kidman on speed dial and if your budget is a few zeros short of a few million , then head to the Marche du Film you must , to make or break your fortune .

STIR UP SOME CONTROVERSY ...

Rupesh Paul Productions have announced that they are making a thriller based on the disappearance of Malaysian flight MH370 . The film 's promotional pamphlet says that it `` tells the story of five people who seek revenge for the death of their loved ones . They hijack a plane ... '' Paul denies that the timing of the movie could be considered offensive of the families of the 239 men , women and children aboard the airliner that disappeared on March 8 .

IF YOU CA N'T MAKE A BLOCKBUSTER , MAKE A MOCKBUSTER ...

Paul Bales is a partner at The Asylum , a movie production and distribution company based in Burbank , California . The Asylum is known for producing low-budget movies -LRB- around $ 500,000 -RRB- that riff off big-budget blockbusters and are often released around the same time .

On the books this year are `` Sleeping Beauty , '' a twist on Angelina Jolie movie `` Maleficent , '' and `` Apocalypse Pompeii , '' another take on Paul W.S. Anderson 's disaster epic `` Pompeii , '' which cost between $ 80 to $ 100 million to make , according to Forbes .

`` We would love to be able to take credit for the mockbuster . The practice is called drafting ... it 's been done almost since the industry started . Just like in bike racing , one racer will ride behind a faster racer and they benefit because there is less wind .

AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME POSTER ...

The movie studio has been running for 40 years and , according to co-founder , Lloyd Kaufman , Troma 's secret weapon is their fans .

At Cannes , Troma fans help the company put on the Troma Parade and street theater they 've become famous for , where characters like The Toxic Avenger act out scenes from movies .

`` That 's how we get attention because we can not afford to take the big billboards . ''

NOTHING BEATS PERFECT TIMING ...

Marc Price did n't expect much when he took `` Colin , '' a zombie movie he made with a $ 70 budget , to Cannes in 2008 . It was a movie he was proud of , but he also realized the timing of his no-budget horror happened to catch the zeitgeist at Cannes that year .

`` The global economic crisis was at its pinnacle , '' said Price . `` So , our story fit very snugly into a success out of that . '' The press picked it up and the rest was history : Price says the film picked up limited theatrical release in the UK , Japan , the U.S. and Australia .
