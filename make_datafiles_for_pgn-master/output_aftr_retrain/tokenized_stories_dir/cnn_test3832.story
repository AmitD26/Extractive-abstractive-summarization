-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In case you 've avoided reading what may be the more depressing reports in the history of the natural world , the awful take-away is basically this : Half the animals of planet Earth have disappeared since 1970 , and much of it is the fault of humans .

Yep , you read that right .

And it happened in only the span of two generations , according the Living Planet Report , which was published on Tuesday by the environmental group WWF , in collaboration with the Global Footprint Network , Water Footprint Network and the Zoological Society of London . `` In other words , '' the report says , `` vertebrate species populations across the globe are , on average , about half the size they were 40 years ago . ''

^ % & * !

That 's mind-blowingly infuriating .

The report overall considers 10,380 populations of 3,038 species of mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians and fish , and says populations have declined by 52 % between 1970 and 2010 .

Just wow .

The massive rallies around the recent UN climate summit should make that clear .

`` Climate change has already been linked to the population decline and possible extinction of a number of amphibian species in the Neotropics and in Australia , '' the Living Planet Report says . `` In the Arctic , the effects of a rapidly warming climate have been suggested as likely causes of decline in body condition and numbers in many polar bear and caribou populations . ''

It relays a case study from Belize , for example , which started estimating the financial value of protecting ecological resources , particularly those along the coast . `` Belize 's coastal and ocean ecosystems provide services worth up to $ 559 million per year -- equivalent to 43 % of GDP , '' the report says . Facts like that make it clear why there 's a financial as well as moral incentive to protect our remaining natural resources .

The authors cite wind farms in Denmark as another success .

`` December 2013 marked a significant milestone , when wind power provided an equivalent of 57.4 % of Denmark 's electricity consumption -- the first time ever that wind power supplied more than half of a country 's electricity needs for a whole month . December 21 set another record , with wind turbines generating the equivalent of 102 % of Danish electricity consumption , '' the authors write .

Pimm is an author of a study , published earlier this year , that found species are disappearing at a rate `` 1,000 times faster than they should be , '' as he put it .

But things are n't as bad as the WWF report makes it sound , he said .

And , for him and others , that 's not the case .

There 's much to be done .

We should move urgently in that direction .

It 's bad out there , but it 's sure not hopeless .

We need to celebrate the species that remain -- from the penguin to the pangolin -LRB- especially the pangolin -RRB- -- and commit to a path of global economic development that embraces the intrinsic and economic value of the natural world .

This report -- and a host of others -- should n't be a total downer . They should be read as a clarion call for action .
