But despite the fact that the main safari destinations in southern and eastern Africa are thousands of kilometers from the Ebola-stricken countries of the west , industry leaders say fears of the disease are keeping tourists away .

`` Numerous safari tour operators report to us that clients view Africa as a single country when it comes to risk assessment , '' Wouter Vergeer , Safaribookings.com founder , tells CNN .

`` Most people do n't realize how vast Africa is and that East and southern Africa are just as far from the outbreak area as Europe or South America , '' says Vergeer .

`` All safari countries have enacted strict precautionary measures and as there currently are no Ebola cases the risk of infection is effectively zero . ''

Jake McCormick , a safari specialist with Shadows of Africa , says the Ebola outbreak has caused a 70 % decrease in inquiries at his company , which offers tours in Tanzania , Kenya , Rwanda and Zanzibar .

Joao Oliveira , founder of It Started in Africa , which organizes safaris and Kilimanjaro treks in Tanzania and Kenya , tells a similar story .

`` We did not have any cancellations but we had much fewer bookings , '' he says .

`` The reason I believe there have been no cancellations is because the clients who have already paid -- safaris are usually booked several months in advance and a down payment is required -- do their own research and find out that the Ebola countries are more than 5,000 kilometers away from Tanzania or Kenya .

`` As for the reduction in bookings , I believe it is because those who are planning their vacations are now not even considering going to Africa because of Ebola . ''

Oliveira says 2014 was on track to be his company 's most profitable year to date .

Then , as news of the Ebloa crisis spread , panic set in .

`` In July , we projected that August would be our best month ever and then the panic started and August was the worst month of the last two years . September was the same . ''

`` It does not make sense , '' he adds .

`` You would not cancel your vacation in Paris because there are conflicts in the Middle East or in Ukraine . If something nasty was happening in Alaska , you 'd still go to New York . ''

` Africa is seen as a country '

`` Over the past month we have had numerous clients replying that they will be in touch after all the health scares are over , '' says Thomson .

`` It was hard to convince them that she tested negative for Ebola . I had to refer them to Ministry of Health website to read more details . ''

`` Although the Ebola virus is not airborne at this time and can only be caught through coming in contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person , and is currently limited to destinations in West Africa , we have recently experienced a small number of clients deferring their holiday plans to the rest of the continent , '' says Charlie Bateson , product director of high end travel company Abercrombie & Kent .

`` We remain in constant contact with the FCO , WHO and with tourist boards and our supplier partners across the world .

`` Our tour consultants are given the latest news on developments and have the ability to specifically advise clients on how the virus is transmitted so that they are able to allay clients fears . ''

According to the World Tourism Organization 's 2014 global travel report , Africa was due to see 4 to 6 % tourism growth this year .

In 2013 , the continent saw international arrivals increase 5 % over 2012 , the equivalent of 3 million more tourists , to reach 56 million .

`` This year is -LRB- now -RRB- written off already , '' says Njamwea , of Lilac Adventures .

`` Though this could have been due to other factors like cancellations of direct charter flights from Europe due to security risks , Ebola has too played a great part . ''

`` I wanted to go away for some winter sunshine , '' he says . `` I 've been to Gambia previously and it 's a good time zone , easy to get to and quite nice and warm . ''

Strawson , 26 , said media `` hysteria '' related to Ebola changed his mind .

`` I just looked at the headlines and thought , it looks bad now , who knows what it will look like in a few weeks ? ''

` World-class epidemiological detective work '

Since the outbreak started in March , about 9,000 Ebola cases and 4,493 deaths have been reported , mostly in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , according to the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- . More than half of the deaths have been in Liberia .

And the numbers are expected to skyrocket .

There could be up to 10,000 new Ebola cases per week in the three hardest-hit nations by the end of the year , the WHO said . It warned that things will get worse before they get better .

In August , WHO issued a warning saying Kenya had a high risk of experiencing an Ebola outbreak , but as yet the country has n't seen a single case .

The WHO says it 's due to declare the end of the Ebola outbreak in Senegal and Nigeria on Friday and Monday , respectively .

In Tanzania , all major border posts have mandatory health screening in place , including all international airports .

`` According to the WHO , the most severely affected countries are Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , however , the Africa tourism industry has felt stark repercussions across the continent through economic losses , canceled flights and bookings , closed borders and negative perceptions , '' it said .
