The cases in the Netherlands involve two family members who had traveled together to Saudi Arabia .

It is one man and one woman who contracted the disease , said Harald Wychgel , spokesman for the Netherlands ministry of health .

`` It is also known that both patients have underlying conditions that make them probably more susceptible to infection with this virus , '' the health ministry said in a statement .

The announcement comes as the World Health Organization said the spread of the virus has become more urgent , but at least for now , is not calling it a global health emergency .

The first cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were diagnosed in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 . MERS attacks the respiratory system , and symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure .

Two cases have been confirmed in the United States . Both patients are health care providers who were working in Saudi Arabia . Those cases are in Indiana and Florida .
