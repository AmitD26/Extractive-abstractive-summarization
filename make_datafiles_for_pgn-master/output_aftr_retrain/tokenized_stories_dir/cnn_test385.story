Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A third suspect in the videotaped beating of a gay Atlanta man could be extradited to Georgia early next week from Pennsylvania , where he has surrendered himself to authorities , officials said Saturday .

Darael Demare Williams , 17 , of Atlanta is being held on $ 250,000 bond in the Erie County , Pennsylvania , Prison , corrections officer Ed Yeaney said Saturday .

Yeaney did n't have further details on what possible charges await Williams in Georgia in connection with the videotaped beating of Brandon White , 20 , by three men outside an Atlanta grocery .

`` I have never seen one of those guys before . I go to that store plenty of times . Like I said , I do n't bother anybody . I do n't talk to anybody . That 's just me . No , I 've never seen one of those guys before , '' White told reporters on February 8 .

On Saturday , White 's attorney , Christine Koehler , reiterated that her client denies knowing any of the three suspects .

Another suspect , Christopher Cain , 18 , has been charged with aggravated assault and robbery , police said .

The case came to light after a video circulated online showing three men punching and kicking White after he stepped out of the JVC Grocery and Deli in southwest Atlanta 's Pittsburgh neighborhood . The men , believed to be members of a gang called Jack City , yelled : `` No f -- ts in Jack City . ''

The store 's surveillance video shows White , dressed in a purple shirt and black jeans with a cell phone to his left ear , exit the store along with another man . As soon as they step outside , White is accosted by his attackers .

The video was released on WorldStarHipHop.com , and was posted on The Smoking Gun .

When it went viral , White decided to talk to the police , he said .

U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates has said her office is looking into potential civil rights violations based on sexual orientation . Georgia does not have a hate crimes statute .

CNN 's George Howell reported from Atlanta and Michael Martinez from Los Angeles .
