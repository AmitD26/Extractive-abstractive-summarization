-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After the New Year , it 'll be `` Downton Abbey '' season .

Executive producer Gareth Neame also attended the TCAs with some `` Downton '' stars , delivering some juicy hints about what 's to come .

`` She 's embracing her new life , really , '' Dockery told reporters . `` She 's through the grief now and I kind of see -LRB- Season -RRB- 5 as the new Mary . ... She 's got a bit of her bite back , which we had in -LRB- Season -RRB- 1 . ''

And while she 's feeling more open to love -- although not with Allen Leech 's Tom Branson , to some fans ' dismay -- Mary and her sister Edith are still as combative as ever .

`` Mary does n't know Edith has a daughter , '' Dockery said . `` So Edith certainly wo n't get any sympathy from her unknowing sister . ''

Actually , quite the opposite : `` Mary 's mean to Edith especially in this season , '' Dockery went on . `` Me and Laura love it when they 're mean to each other , it 's more fun to do . ''

Producer Neame confirmed that we wo n't get more Shirley MacLaine or Paul Giamatti this season , but that we can expect some `` really substantial twists and turns . ''
