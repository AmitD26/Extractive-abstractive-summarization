Paris -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A librarian in northern France made what may be the discovery of his lifetime when he uncovered a rare Shakespeare 's First Folio in his library 's collection .

He was preparing an exhibition on Anglo-Saxon authors in September when he came across the First Folio . It was missing some pages , which is why it had been misfiled many decades ago .

At first , the director could not believe what he had found . `` I think I have 2.5 million pounds in my hands , '' he told his boss .

`` This is why I contacted Eric Rasmussen to make sure they did not already know about the First Folio . He was actually in London working on the Shakespeare year at the British Library and agreed to come to authenticate the document . ''

This discovery `` will add prestige to the region and help reconnect with our illustrious history , unfortunately forgotten for a century and a half , '' Cordonnier said .

The library still plans to make the First Folio part of the Anglo-Saxon exhibition , but it will not be put on display . `` It is going to be digitized to be accessible to the public , at least virtually , '' Cordonnier said .

According to the British Library , which holds four copies , the First Folio was produced by two of Shakespeare 's fellow actors and closest friends , John Heminge and Henry Condell .

Without the First Folio , much of Shakespeare 's work would have been lost to subsequent generations .

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington , with 82 First Folios , has the single largest collection of the books , representing one-third of the world 's existing copies .

Shakespeare turns 450 this year
