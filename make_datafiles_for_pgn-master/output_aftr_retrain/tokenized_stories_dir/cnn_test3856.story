Austin , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Any author or filmmaker seeking ideas for a sci-fi yarn about the implications of artificial intelligence -- good or bad -- would be smart to talk to Ray Kurzweil .

Kurzweil , the acclaimed inventor and futurist , believes that humans and technology are blurring -- note the smartphone appendages in almost everyone 's hand -- and will eventually merge .

`` We created these tools to extend our reach , '' he said -- something we 've been doing as humans `` ever since we first picked up a stick to reach a tree branch . ''

Asked by interviewer Lev Grossman whether artificial intelligence will lead to malevolent machines that will come to dominate humans , he said he was more concerned about what humans will do to themselves . `` I do n't see it as ` us vs. them . ' I see it as ` us vs. us . ' ''

Kurzweil believes technology is advancing at exponential speed -- so fast that previously unimaginable inventions will be a reality within decades . He cited nanotechnology -- microscopic computers -- that will be 1,000 times more powerful than human blood cells and injected in people 's bloodstreams to give them superhuman endurance .

He also believes computer technology is democratizing society by empowering anyone with creativity and and a broadband connection .

The 64-year-old author made a few other bold predictions in his hourlong talk :

-- `` As we go through this decade , search engines are n't going to wait to be asked . They 'll be listening -LSB- to humans -RSB- in the background . And -LSB- the search results -RSB- will just pop up . ''
