A new study published in British medical journal The Lancet says that up to 77 million people in Bangladesh are being exposed to toxic levels of arsenic , potentially taking years or decades off their lives .

An international team of researchers from Chicago , New York and Bangladesh followed 12,000 people over the past decade , monitoring their arsenic intake and mortality rates from contaminated wells .

By the end of the study , one in five deaths were determined to be directly related to elevated arsenic levels in their system . Stretch that over the entire population that takes its water from wells , and the impact is daunting .

Arsenic is a deadly poison with a history of use in intrigue and assassination . Some have even theorized that Napoleon Bonaparte succumbed to long term poisoning with the substance by his enemies while in exile on the island of St. Helena .

But the element and its derivatives are also used in many industries , such as metal smelting and as a component in products ranging from insecticide to micro-chips .

And unfortunately , it is also found in abundance in the soil and rock in Bangladesh . It 's leached up through the water table in tens of millions of water wells across the country .

The authors hope for more study , and a long term plan to deal with the damage already done . But a solution for those already poisoned may remain decades away .
