-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Investigators have pinpointed two men as `` possible suspects '' who were seen in images near the finish line of this week 's Boston Marathon -- moments before twin bombs there exploded , killing three and injuring about 180 others -- a law enforcement official said .

A circular sent out Wednesday to federal and state agencies features the photos `` in an attempt to identify the individuals , '' who were described as being of `` high interest '' to investigators .

One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack . An FBI official earlier said that authorities believe the bombs were placed inside a black nylon backpack or bag .

The source said that authorities had not yet identified the two men by name and that the photographs were not being released to the public for fear of impeding the investigation .

It was not immediately known if this man is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials .

This movement in the investigation came two days after the horrific blast shook the city , during what is traditionally one of its biggest and most beloved events each year .

By Wednesday , authorities had made `` significant progress '' in the case but no arrests , a federal law enforcement source told CNN 's John King .

A Boston law enforcement source told CNN , `` We got him , '' but would n't clarify whether that meant a suspect has been identified or arrested . Some federal sources said it was even too early to say investigators had identified the suspect , but several sources in Boston told CNN that they have a clear identification .

`` What I would say and I would ask of everyone is we give law enforcement the space to do their work , '' Patrick said . `` When they are ready with a complete picture , they will tell us what that picture is . ''

He added , `` I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe , but I understand from experience it 's going to take some time . ''

The lid of a pressure cooker thought to be used in the device was found on a rooftop at the scene , a federal law enforcement official with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN .

The second bomb was also housed in a metal container , but it was not clear whether it too was in a pressure cooker , the FBI said .

The bombs

Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene , along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings . Scraps of at least one pressure cooker , nails and nylon bags found at the scene were sent to the FBI 's national laboratory in Virginia , where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices , the agent leading the investigation said Tuesday .

The pieces suggest each of the devices was 6 liters -LRB- about 1.6 gallons -RRB- in volume , a Boston law enforcement source said . The recovered parts include part of a circuit board , which might have been used to detonate a device .

A law enforcement official said Monday 's bombs were probably detonated by timers . But the FBI said details of the detonating system were unknown .

While the clues moved the investigation forward , they did not make it immediately apparent whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism .

Opinion : Why is this so rare ?

Third victim identified

The attack left Boston police with `` the most complex crime scene that we 've dealt with in the history of our department , '' Commissioner Ed Davis said Tuesday .

Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips . They have pleaded for the public 's help in providing additional leads and images .

`` Someone knows who did this , '' said Rick DesLauriers , the special agent in charge of the FBI 's Boston office , said . `` The community will play a crucial role in this investigation . ''

Medical personnel treating the wounded found evidence suggesting the bomb maker or bomb makers sought to maximize the suffering .

Dr. George Velmahos , head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital , said his team found `` numerous '' metal pellets and nails inside patients ' bodies .

`` There are people who have 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 of them in their body , or more , '' Velmahos said .

` Human spirit ' still alive

Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails .

`` There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward , '' he said .

Boston Medical Center has two patients in critical condition , down from 11 just after the bombings , Dr. Peter Burke , chief of trauma care , told reporters Wednesday . Ten patients are in serious condition and seven are in fair condition , he said .

He remembers the explosion in vivid detail : the blast that was so strong that it burned his clothes off ; the carnage around him ; and the haunting , slow-motion daze of searching for his friends .

He told CNN he 's worried about the financial burdens his friends could face as a result of the explosion .

`` It 's not just the hospitals . It 's everyday life that does n't stop . ... We 're just hoping the mayor , the governor , President Obama do n't let us as citizens down . ''

Beyond those seriously wounded , the incident affected thousands , including Candace Rispoli , who was cheering on a friend when the festive atmosphere turned into a `` terrifying hell . '' She suffered minor injuries .

CNN 's Susan Candiotti , Fran Townsend , Matt Smith , Dave Alsup , Henry Hanks , Rande Iaboni , Gloria Borger and John King contributed to this report .
