-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rapper T.I. 's furlough from prison was cut short last week because prison officials objected to his manager and a reality TV producer riding with him on a trip to a halfway house , according to a prison document .

U.S. marshals removed T.I. from an Atlanta halfway house and placed him in the federal prison in Atlanta a day after his release from the Federal Correctional Center in Forrest City , Arkansas .

The popular hip-hop artist , whose real name is Clifford Harris Jr. , is serving an 11-month sentence for violating his parole on a gun conviction . Unless prison officials conclude he did not violate his furlough agreement , he is expected to stay locked up until that sentence is complete on September 29 , documents indicated .

Bureau of Prisons officials are expected to review the suspension of his furlough , but it is not known when a decision might come , Sadow said Thursday .

T.I. 's manager , Brian Sher , sent a statement to prison officials explaining that he had no idea it was a violation of the furlough for him to accompany his client on the trip .

Cris Abrego , a reality TV producer who was on the bus , wrote to prison officials that he also believed it was allowed since he `` was on the authorized visitor list , and had visited with Mr. Harris a couple of times prior to his release . ''

A book and a VH1 series , which publicists announced the day of T.I. 's release , had been negotiated months before , his entertainment attorney , Jonathan Leonard , said in another letter to prison officials .

`` We felt this could cause an accident and jeopardize our and other travelers ' safety , '' Tameka `` Tiny '' Cottle-Harris wrote . `` We knew we had a long trip and did not want to create an unsafe situation as we traveled so we thought it was a good idea to travel by bus . ''

When T.I. walked out of prison on August 31 , he tweeted , `` The storm is over & da sun back out . '' He had been expected to complete the last weeks of his sentence in a community service center , or halfway house , in Atlanta .

VH1 announced the reality TV show soon after he boarded his bus . The as-yet-untitled 10-episode series , which will premiere in December , will show T.I. `` as he re-adjusts to life as a free man after being incarcerated for nearly a year in a federal prison in Arkansas , '' VH1 said .

He was locked up behind the high walls of the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta the next afternoon .

His latest time behind bars was triggered by his arrest , along with his wife , after a motorcycle officer stopped their car on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills , California , a year ago .
