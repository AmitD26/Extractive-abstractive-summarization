The letter was posted on the district 's official account on Sina Weibo , China 's Twitter-like microblogging service .

The fine comes after Zhang apologized in an open letter for his `` excessive children '' in December . He and his wife , Chen Ting , admitted to having two sons and a daughter .

`` I will learn my lessons , and I 'm willing to cooperate with any investigation from family planning commission , '' Zhang said .

Local officials in Jiangsu province calculated the fine based on the couple 's combined annual income , the document stated . Nine investigation teams had been sent to `` collect evidence '' since November .

The couple have to pay the fine within 30 days of receiving the letter , local authorities added .

The Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress passed a resolution to allow couples to have two children if one of the parents was an only child , according to Xinhua .

Previously , a couple was only allowed a second child if both of them were only children .

Zhang 's breach of the policy has set off a firestorm , especially among some netizens who resent how the rich and famous in China flout rules and policies .

`` Zhang is a good fellow , '' wrote Sarah2007 on Sina Weibo .

The filmmaker also directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
