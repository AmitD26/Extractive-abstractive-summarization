But CNN has obtained some of the names of those subpoenaed , including top current and former Christie administration officials .

The committee is also looking at entities that had to do with the governor 's re-election , the source said .

Christie fired Kelly and asked Stepien to leave his political operation after last week 's release of explosive e-mails on the scandal .

One name not on the list so far is Christie , as Wisniewski said there was `` no intention '' to subpoena the Republican governor at this time because no documents made public so far showed a `` direct link '' to him .

Christie 's office announced earlier his administration retained an outside law firm to help deal with the scandal involving traffic gridlock around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last September .

Also Thursday , the New Jersey Senate announced its own investigation in coordination with Wisniewski 's panel , widening the political response to the controversial closing of access lanes to the nation 's busiest bridge .

U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman is also looking into the bridge matter , bringing the total number of investigations to four , including an internal review by Christie 's office .

Can Christie change the subject ?

Christie said last week he knew nothing about any decision by aides to close highway lanes as political punishment , but Wisniewski and other Democrats label such a scenario as implausible .

The traffic gridlock occurred two months before Christie was re-elected to a second term .

The authority 's response to questions from Rockefeller also said Christie 's top appointee to the Port Authority leadership , David Wildstein , ordered the lane closures and suggested that he failed to heed warnings about their impact .

In addition , Wildstein ordered a Port Authority manager `` not to communicate information about the lane reduction '' to officials in Fort Lee and indicated `` he would control the communication about the toll lane closures , '' according to the response .

Wildstein resigned from the Port Authority late last year as the controversy unfolded .

Despite polls showing Christie as the early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination two years from now , the bridge crisis has grabbed national attention and forced the normally combative governor to adopt a more conciliatory posture .

The Christie administration has retained Gibson , Dunn & Crutcher LLP as outside counsel in a move the administration hopes `` will bring an outside , third party perspective to the situation . ''

Opinion : Is Christie presidential ?

Randy Mastro , a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York , will head the legal team .

Mastro has experience in organized crime cases and led the federal racketeering lawsuit that forced the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to hold democratic elections and to undergo court supervision . Mastro also is a former deputy mayor of New York .

On Tuesday , Christie addressed the scandal briefly in his State of the State address , saying `` mistakes were clearly made . '' He also tried to shift the focus to policy initiatives , repeatedly imploring Democrats to work with him .

Kelly 's name appeared in e-mails with Wildstein , including one in which she wrote : `` Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee . ''

Other exchanges suggested that Stepien was aware of the maneuvering that led to traffic gridlock .

While the e-mails do not link Drewniak , the governor 's spokesman , to the traffic jam scandal or even suggest it , they indicate that he had dinner with Wildstein two days before the transportation official resigned . Wildstein thanked Drewniak for his `` sound advice , '' and the two men later e-mailed back and forth about how to announce his departure from the Port Authority .

Federal officials also are looking at New Jersey 's use of $ 25 million in Superstorm Sandy relief funds for a marketing campaign promoting the Jersey Shore 's recovery that featured Christie and his family .

In a statement Monday , Christie 's office said the `` Stronger than the Storm '' campaign was part of an `` action plan '' approved by the Obama administration and developed with the goal of showing that the New Jersey Shore was open for business several months after the storm that devastated parts of the mid-Atlantic in October 2012 .

The campaign took place the same year that Christie was running for re-election .

Opinion : Sure , Christie 's team did wrong , but Jersey Dems are just as bad
