Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- House Democrats are increasingly worried that an avalanche of outside spending by GOP groups will bury them this fall , putting more of their members at risk of losing , and jeopardizing their goal of winning back control of the House in 2016 .

Virtually no Democrat believes the party has a chance to pick up the 17 seats they need to regain control of the House after the 2014 midterms . But the House Democrats ' campaign arm has been focused on a strategy to bolster Democrats in competitive districts and try to knock off some GOP members in districts won by Obama in 2012 .

The thinking is that keeping losses to a minimum this fall better positions Democrats for the next national election in 2016 , especially if former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is at the top of the ticket and drives up party turnout .

`` We thought our friends would come in a way that they 're not , '' a Democratic strategist focused on House races told CNN .

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has consistently outraised its GOP counterpart over the course of this election cycle , anticipating it would need resources this fall to counter Republican affiliated outside groups . But those efforts may not be enough to counter the GOP groups .

House Democrats are watching their fundraising advantage erode as Republican outside groups begin moving more aggressively into blue territory in the hopes of defeating Democratic incumbents .

So far the House Majority PAC has reserved $ 21.5 million for television time this cycle . But without more outside spending help from others , that money needs to be used to defend incumbents instead of going on offense .

One labor union , the Service Employees International Union , spent close to $ 6.5 million in the 2012 election to help House Democratic candidates , but so far , according to an analysis of campaign contributions posted by the Center for Responsive Politics , the SEIU is spending roughly ten times less - $ 665,000 - on House races this year . In the last midterm election , 2010 , when control of the House was up for grabs the group spent over $ 6 million to help House Democratic candidates .

CNN reached out to SEIU but has not received a response .

The League of Conservation Voters -LRB- LCV -RRB- , a key Democratic ally focused on climate change and health issues , is on track to spent a record $ 25 million this cycle but almost all of that money is earmarked for the Senate . The group is n't making any excuses for keeping its primary focus on Senate races .

Gohringer notes that LCV did contribute to House Democratic candidates in a couple of House races in Maine and in California where climate change has been a key issue , and that they plan to spend $ 100,000 on a voter turnout effort to help Democratic candidate Emily Cain in Maine 's second congressional district .

But they have similar worries that the outside groups who are helping their candidates are n't on track to spend at the same level as House Majority PAC . And they acknowledge that while outside groups are investing heavily , the attention on the Senate has limited the amount of money they could use to pick up even more Democratic-held seats .
