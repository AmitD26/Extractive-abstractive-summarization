Unfortunately , stating the facts did little to stop the speculation . It 's almost as if people wanted to `` make it so '' as an easy way to explain the inexplicable . Every new story seemed to mention Asperger 's in the headline or opening lines . The implied connection was unmistakable .

Opinion : I have Asperger 's and I 'm just like you

Media talk of Asperger 's and murder -- even when it 's only speculation -- raises that threat level significantly . Insinuations like this dehumanize people with Asperger 's and label us as `` sociopaths '' or `` future attackers . '' Where does that lead ? Exclusion , bullying and mistreatment , even more than before .

Troubling legacy of Sandy Hook may create backlash against kids with autism

Prejudice affects us in many ways , most all of which are bad . My son found that out four years ago , when a state prosecutor decided that his scientific fascination with explosives was a terrorist threat and only she could `` save '' our community . She charged him with four felonies , carrying a maximum sentence of more than 60 years in prison .

Growing up autistic

Cubby was 17 years old when he was indicted . He 'd never been in trouble with either the law or in school , and was on track to make Eagle Scout , where he taught the chemistry merit badge course .

His only `` crime '' was turning household chemicals into experimental explosives , which he set off and filmed in the woods behind our house . Even the ATF agents who first investigated were impressed by Cubby 's scientific acumen and curiosity and certain that he intended no harm .

Asperger 's does n't make a person a killer or a terrorist . It 's the disturbing truth that anyone can turn violent or deadly , and it 's proven very difficult to identify who 's vulnerable and what the trigger might be .

Indeed , most of the rampage killers of the past 30 years apparently popped up out of nowhere . What did we miss ? The central question for us as a society should be : How can we identify those people at risk for aggressive violence , and get them support while help is still an option ?

Groups : Autism not to blame for violence

At the same time , we must learn to stop the rush to judgment when the person next to us acts `` a little strange . '' Eccentric people have brought humanity some of its greatest gifts and inventions , and we need to encourage difference , not chase it into hiding .

Imagine where we 'd be today if Alfred Nobel , who invented dynamite , had been prosecuted like my son -- instead of praised for his service to humanity .
