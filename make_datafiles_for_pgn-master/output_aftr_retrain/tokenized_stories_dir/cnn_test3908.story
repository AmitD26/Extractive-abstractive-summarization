French hostage Herve Gourdel was abducted and beheaded , a killing shown on video , French President Francois Hollande told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday .

`` You will understand that today I am speaking before you with a particularly high level of emotion because one of my compatriots has just been subject of a cowardly assassination , '' Hollande said . `` He was a man who was full enthusiasm . He loved the mountains . He thought he would be able to pursue his passion moving into the Ouzou area in Algeria . ''

Hollande said the attack wo n't affect France 's role in the battle against terrorism .

Gourdel was kidnapped over the weekend in Algeria 's Tizi Ouzou region east of Algiers , the French Foreign Ministry said . The video was posted online Wednesday . It shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in Algeria . They pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria .

France is part of a broad coalition that is working with the United States to combat the brutal extremist group .

According to his website , Gourdel was born in 1959 and when he was a teenager decided he wanted to become a mountain guide . He opened a guide office in Saint Martin-VÃ©subie in 1987 where he spent more than 20 years , the website says . He was also an active member of a mountaineering club that spent time in France 's Mercantour National Park .

The Algerian government called the beheading an act of `` criminals . ''

The new video came on the same day U.S. President Barack Obama addressed the United Nations , calling for all countries to unite against terrorism and brutality wrought by ISIS . The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria goes against everything Islam stands for , he said . Islam , Obama said , is about peace .

The U.N. Security Council issued a statement condemning the `` heinous and cowardly murder . ''
