President Barack Obama paid tribute Friday to the U.S. service members who `` defied every danger '' to pour onto the beaches of Normandy 70 years ago in defense of liberty .

His remarks at the American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer , which overlooks Omaha Beach where so many fell , were part of a series of solemn events to commemorate the D-Day landings in northern France .

Chief among them is an elaborate international ceremony on the stretch code-named Sword Beach , in Ouistreham , for which world leaders and veterans took places in stands set up on the sand .

As the ceremony got under way under brilliant sunshine , military bands marched on a map of the globe laid out across the golden strand in front of French President Francois Hollande .

Hollande spoke of the bravery of the young men who waded ashore under a deluge of German fire seven decades earlier , through waters turned red with blood , hailing them all as heroes .

The D-Day landings , in which mainly British , U.S. and Canadian troops invaded Nazi-occupied France , were a turning point in World War II .

D-Day : Exploring the myths of the Normandy landings

Obama , speaking earlier at the American Cemetery , said he was honored to be there `` to pay tribute to the men and women of a generation who defied every danger : among them , our veterans of D-Day . ''

He said , `` It was here , on these shores , that the tide was turned in that common struggle for freedom .

`` What more powerful manifestation of America 's commitment to human freedom than the sight of wave after wave of young men boarding those boats to liberate people they 'd never met ? ''

The cemetery , which sits on a cliff overlooking Omaha Beach and the English Channel , contains the graves of 9,387 U.S. servicemen , most of whom lost their lives in the D-Day landings .

The pair spoke on the margins of the lunch in what Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said was an informal conversation , not a formal bilateral meeting . It lasted 10 to 15 minutes , he said .

The run-up to the commemorations has been dominated by the crisis in Ukraine , which has sparked the worst East-West tensions since the end of the Cold War .

Putin and Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko also talked briefly before the leaders went in to lunch in Benouville , with German Chancellor Angela Merkel standing between the two as they spoke .

` Touching ' commemoration

More than 156,000 troops crossed the English Channel during the D-Day invasion on June 6 , 1944 . Nearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded .

Veteran Bernard Jordan , 89 , went missing from his nursing home in Hove , a town on the south coast of England , on Thursday , wearing his war medals underneath his jacket , according to CNN affiliate ITV .

He was bound for the French shores once more .

But the nursing home did n't know and called police , the station said .

Jordan was found in France a day later marking the 70th anniversary with his friends . Another veteran called the care home to say he met Jordan on a coach to France and both men were well in a Ouistreham hotel , according to ITV News .

`` That was the main reason I came over here , '' he told the affiliate . `` Touch wood ... if I 'm still about , I should try it the next few years as well . ''

Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II is the only living head of state who served in World War II , working as a mechanic and military truck driver in the Women 's Auxiliary Territorial Service .

Earlier , Hollande spoke at a war memorial in the city of Caen at a ceremony to honor civilian victims and paid tribute to all those killed in the conflict .

He recalled the `` strength of heart and bravery '' of those who helped to liberate France from Nazi Germany , as well as the many victims in Normandy -- more of them civilians than soldiers .

Although the war may be long over in Normandy , Hollande said , `` the war is still here in this tumultuous , uncertain and sometimes threatening world -- and in all wars , it is civilians who pay a heavy price . ''

Further along the French coast in Arromanches , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , William and Kate , attended a tea party for veterans , and each royal spoke separately with the silver-haired and beret-attired honorees .

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper was also in Normandy to honor the Canadian forces that stormed Juno Beach 70 years ago .

`` We are also deeply humbled by the enormous sacrifices made by our fellow citizens , who with grim determination , stood shoulder to shoulder with like-minded allies to fight evil . ''

A fireworks display was staged Thursday night along the Normandy coastline where the landings took place .
