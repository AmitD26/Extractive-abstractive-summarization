Many in the city take pride in what they say is a transparent and open financial system , in contrast to the situation across the border in Mainland China .

The plan would remove directors ' residential address and their full Hong Kong identification numbers from the Company Registry .

Information from the database was used in two high-profile stories last year that looked into the wealth of the families of China 's ruling elite , which appeared in The New York Times and Bloomberg News . A number of stories on property scandals within Hong Kong also relied on information from the database .

The petition declared the change an `` infringement of the public interest , '' which would have a `` great impact on professional and citizen journalists ' right to conduct investigative reporting . ''

Members of the business community and investors have also voiced concerns about the proposed change . David Webb , a well-known investor activist and editor of Webb-Site.com , says the change would make it harder for investment banks and IPO sponsors to determine a person 's real assets .

Hong Kong , a former British colony , is part of China but maintains freedom of the press , speech and no Internet controls .

Residents are often fiercely vocal in response to anything they see as infringement of these rights .
