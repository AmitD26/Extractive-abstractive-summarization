-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Beyond a vague familiarity with the world 's major airlines , most travelers know little about the hundreds of carriers transporting passengers across the globe . Sunday 's deadly air crash in Nigeria raises questions about the safety of international airlines . So how do passengers find safety information ?

There are several things travelers should look for to gauge an airline 's safety , according to Bill Voss , CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation , an international nonprofit organization .

The Federal Aviation Administration looks at international aviation regulators . The FAA program assesses the safety standards of the civil aviation authorities of countries with airlines operating in the United States .

`` We look at the ability of the aviation authority in the country to administer its aviation community in accordance with international regulations . We do n't look at individual airlines , '' said FAA spokesman Les Dorr .

Nigeria , the site of the crash that killed more than 160 people , has a Category 1 ranking .

Twenty-five nations , nearly a quarter of those assessed , hold a Category 2 ranking , including the Philippines , Bangladesh , Barbados , Cote D'Ivoire , Ghana , Indonesia and Israel .

Despite occasional catastrophic crashes , airline accident rates have seen `` massive improvements '' in the last few decades , he said .

Africa had the highest regional accident rate in 2010 of 16.8 , four times the global average , but Africa accounts for the lowest percentage of global traffic volume . North America 's accident rate , 3.3 per million departures , was below the world average in 2010 . The region had the highest number of accidents -- 35 -- but no fatalities . Europe also had an accident rate of 3.3 per million departures with 24 accidents , two of which included fatalities .

The trade group International Air Transport Association does its own safety audits on air carriers . The organization 's registry is searchable by airline . All of the association 's more than 240 member airlines must meet audit standards to maintain membership .

The cause of Sunday 's accident in Nigeria is still unknown .

The European Union 's `` black list '' provides another safety benchmark .

The EU takes a more aggressive approach to screening individual carriers and has banned more than 280 airlines from 25 nations from operating within the EU since 2006 . African , Indonesian and Philippine airlines figure prominently on the EU 's banned list , as do carriers in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan . The EU also has a list of carriers subject to operational restrictions . No Nigerian airlines appear on either list .
