Vice President Joe Biden spoke Wednesday night about how , as a child , he stood up to a local bully by smashing the boy 's head and threatening to kill him .

Biden set the scene during the speech by detailing how his family would stop by a doughnut shop after Mass every Sunday .

Biden then said he walked up behind the boy , who was with his parents , and `` smashed his head next to the counter . ''

When the crowd applauded , Biden said , `` I 'm not recommending it . ''

Biden has a substantial record of combating violence against women . As a senator in 1990 , he introduced the Violence Against Women Act , legislation that changed law enforcement response and criminal justice sentencing for crimes against women .

Scranton also appears to have molded Biden into a fighter , too .

` White boy ' Biden calls tea party ` crazy '

In a 2012 interview with the AP , Tom Bell , a Biden childhood friend from Scranton , retold a story about how he asked Biden to beat up a bully next time he was in town . Biden , according to Bell , did just that .

Richard Ben Cramer , in the seminal book `` What It Takes : The Way to the White House , '' also documented Biden 's fighting steak .

Cramer noted that this fighting prowess came as much out of necessity as it did out of desire .

`` Joe was kind of skinny , and he stuttered , and the kids called him Bye-Bye , for the way he sounded when he tried to say his name , '' Cramer wrote . `` But Joey would never back down , and he knew how to box , when no one else did . ''
