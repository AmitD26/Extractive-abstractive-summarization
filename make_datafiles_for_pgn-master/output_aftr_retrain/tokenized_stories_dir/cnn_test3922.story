Diving 27 meters underwater , the light turns a deep , hazy blue . Emerging from the darkness , three ballerinas in white tutus stretch their legs on the deck of a sunken military ship .

The 12 sumptuous images of everyday scenes -- from a housewife hanging out washing to a teenager watching TV -- take place against the eerie backdrop of sunken ship USNS General Hoyt S.Vandenberg .

`` Diving is already a dreamlike experience and I think these images really correspond with what people imagine an underwater world might look like . ''

Viennese artist Andreas Franke , who worked as an advertising photographer for more than 20 years , took the powerful images while on a diving exhibition last year .

Sunk just off Key West , an island in the Straits of Florida , in 2009 , the Vandenberg is the second-largest artificial reef in the world , attracting a diverse range of marine animals and plant life .

But before her most recent reincarnation as a divers ' paradise , the historic vessel cruised the waves as a U.S. transport ship during World War II .

It was this rich history that gave Franke the inspiration for his unique World War II era scenes .

The 45-year-old artist used specialist underwater cameras to capture the ship , before heading back to the studio to photograph models in 1940s and 1950s costumes .

Despite being protected between two sheets of plexiglass and sealed with silicon in a steel frame , the images were not left completely untouched by the ravishes of the ocean .

The all-pervasive sea water still left its mark , seeping into the frames and discoloring them with salt stains and algae .

The remarkable pictures , worth up to $ 30,000 , had crossed the realm from photographs to performance art , said Dodd .

`` The extra layer of growth tells the story of their voyage to the bottom of the seabed , '' he added .

While the Vandenberg photographs attract art lovers on land , Franke 's latest underwater project is bewitching divers again -- this time off the coast of Barbados .

Displayed on the sunken SS Stavronikita , the 12 new images depict Renaissance aristocracy gallivanting in a palatial underwater setting .

`` If you look at the elaborate hairstyles of the models it fits pretty well with this surrounding . ''

They may appear pristine now , but if the Vandenberg is anything to go by , the lavish ladies of the Stavronikita may not be so picture perfect when they finally come up for air .
