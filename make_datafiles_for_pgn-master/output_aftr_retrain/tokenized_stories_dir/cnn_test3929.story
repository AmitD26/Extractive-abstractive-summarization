It 's been a long journey for Richard III , the 15th century king whose skeleton was found under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester . But on Friday , his final destination became clear .

Archaeologists had been searching the site for Leicester 's long-lost Greyfriars Friaryhad and always planned for any bodies they uncovered to be reburied at the city 's cathedral .

That was challenged in the courts by a group calling itself the Plantagenet Alliance , which argued it was the medieval king 's wish to be buried in the historic northern city of York -- the city they claim was closest to his heart .

But judges at the Royal Courts of Justice ruled Friday that his funeral should be held in Leicester as originally planned .

The University of Leicester , which was behind the excavation project , celebrated the outcome on Twitter .

`` Richard III will be reinterred in Leicester . Great news for the University , our city and everybody involved in the discovery , '' it said .

`` We believe that the proposed location of Leicester is wholly inappropriate for the burial of King Richard III , who had no connections with the town beyond his horrific death , bodily despoliation and appalling burial in a foreshortened grave , '' it said .

`` As people who have died in a foreign place are ` brought home , ' so too King Richard should be brought to a place with which he had every possible connection and affection . ''

Richard III lost his life in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 -- the last king of England to die on the battlefield and the last monarch from the House of York .

That notorious history may make the battle over his reburial site appear all the more unlikely . But both sides insisted they have a strong claim to his remains .

Now Leicester could see a significant commercial benefit , if tourists flock to see his final resting place .

The city already has plans for a new tomb in the cathedral , where a memorial stone has long paid tribute to the last Plantagenet king , and for a visitor center on the site of the Greyfriars car park , telling the story of Richard 's life , his death , and his rediscovery .

In a statement , Leicester City Mayor Peter Soulsby said : `` I am delighted that Leicester Cathedral can now proceed with its plans to give King Richard lll a dignified reburial here in the city .
