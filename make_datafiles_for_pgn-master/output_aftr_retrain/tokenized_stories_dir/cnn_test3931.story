A new possibility for a diplomatic solution in the standoff between Syria and the United States surfaced unexpectedly Monday as the war-torn country said it supported a proposal to hand over control of its chemical weapons .

Asked whether the proposed idea was enough to avert a military strike on Syria , Obama said , `` It 's possible if it 's real . ''

The U.S. president spoke hours after Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told reporters in Moscow that his nation `` welcomes '' a proposal that Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made during talks on Monday . The idea : put Syria 's chemical weapons under international control to avert a U.S. military response over an alleged poison gas attack last month .

`` I declare that the Syrian Arab Republic welcomes Russia 's initiative , on the basis that the Syrian leadership cares about the lives of our citizens and the security in our country , '' Moallem said . `` We are also confident in the wisdom of the Russian government , which is trying to prevent an American aggression against our people . ''

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Washington remained `` highly skeptical '' of the Syrian regime .

`` The only reason why we are seeing this proposal is because of the threat of U.S. military action , '' he said .

Taking a ` hard look '

Obama said the United States will work with Russia and the international community `` to see if we can arrive at something that is enforceable and serious . ''

Latest developments

The new possibility of a diplomatic deal appeared to have started with comments from Kerry earlier Monday .

But as Russia and Syria later suggested that it could be done , one U.S. official called Kerry 's remarks a `` major goof , '' adding that America 's top diplomat `` clearly went off script . ''

`` There is no one in the administration who is taking this Syria proposal seriously , '' the official said .

Kerry 's comments caught Russia 's attention

`` I saw your comments this morning , '' Lavrov said to Kerry , according to a senior State Department official .

During a 14-minute conversation that had been previously scheduled , the Russian foreign minister said he would speak out about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table , the official said .

Kerry told Lavrov that the United States `` is not going to ` play games , ' '' the official said . `` If there is a serious proposal , we will take a look . ''

Hillary Clinton weighs in

The comments from Kerry and counterparts in Russia and Syria are the latest twist in an international crisis that has also become a fierce political battle in the United States .

The Obama administration says the al-Assad government was behind an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus . And the U.S. president is seeking congressional approval for a military strike in response .

So far he 's met resistance from lawmakers and the public who are concerned about the United States again intervening militarily in a foreign crisis .

`` In fact , the opposite . ... . We think this is why it 's even more important that Congress votes to authorize the president to use military action against Syrian regime targets , because we can be clear that if we do n't give authorization to do so and we do n't respond , then Assad will see that as a green light to continue using these chemical weapons . ''

Whatever happens , the prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the Obama administration 's attempts to make a case before Congress even more difficult , said Michael O'Hanlon , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . Lawmakers who are already debating whether or not to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them , he said .

`` It 's going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things , '' he said .

There 's already been at least one delay .

An initial Senate vote on whether to authorize a military strike against Syria had been expected on Wednesday .

Reaction in the United States , beyond

It would be acceptable under several conditions , Fabius said . Al-Assad should immediately hand over control of the weapons and allow their destruction , he said , calling for the U.N. Security Council to pass a binding resolution with `` firm consequences . ''

`` Since the beginning , France has set two goals : punishment and deterrence , '' he said . `` That is why we are now asking specific , rapid and verifiable commitments by the Syrian regime . ''

`` I believe that Russia can be most effective in encouraging the Syrian president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions , as well as storage facilities , under United Nations control until they can be destroyed , '' the California Democrat said .

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said getting Syria to surrender the stockpiles `` would be an important step . ''

`` But this can not be another excuse for delay or obstruction , '' Clinton said during an event at the White House Monday . `` And Russia has to support the international community 's efforts sincerely or be held to account . ''
