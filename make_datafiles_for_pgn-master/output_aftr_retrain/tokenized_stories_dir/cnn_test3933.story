This was not some amusing pop culture event in which a few `` hackers '' played games with celebrities .

This was not an entertaining series of embarrassing leaks that allowed us to learn how viciously and nastily some senior Hollywood bosses write about famous movie stars in internal emails .

This was a deliberate assault on sovereign American soil against an American company , costing it millions of dollars in direct damages and hundreds of millions in reputational damages while blocking most of its employees from using their internal systems to get routine work done .

Both critiques miss the core reality .

This attack on American interests began on November 24 when there was a massive hacking assault on Sony . After 24 days of government passivity and ineffectiveness , the theaters caved to the threat of terrorist attacks .

Thus with more than three weeks to find and defeat the attackers , the American government proved to be impotent .

There is a big difference between hacking for intellectual property theft and hacking to coerce a change in behavior .

The former is a crime . The second is an act of war .

We need three decisive steps to react to this defeat in a cyberwar .

First , we have to go on the offense in this campaign and refuse to accept that the fight is over . North Korea must be made to pay an extraordinary price for this attack . One step might be to simply confiscate North Korean ships until the dictatorship pays triple damages to Sony and the theaters for the cost of its attack . What must not happen is for the American people to be told it is too hard or too dangerous to defend America against an out-of-control dictatorship . That could lead to anarchy and chaos , with every predator on the planet feeling they have the right to wage cyberwar against Americans .

Third , we must develop vastly better defensive and offensive capabilities . This will require considerable congressional involvement in thinking through the realities of the emerging permanent cyberdangers and the patterns of cyberwar .

No one should kid themselves .
