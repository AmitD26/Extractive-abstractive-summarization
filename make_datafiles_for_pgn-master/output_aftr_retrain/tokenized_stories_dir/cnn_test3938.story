Before 14-year-old Philip Chism allegedly killed his algebra teacher , the pair had at least one more encounter as student and teacher , a witness said .

Chism had been doodling and listening to music during Colleen Ritzer 's algebra I class during the school 's final period , classmate Cambria Cloutier told CNN . Creating such drawings was unusual for Chism , and when the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. Tuesday , Ritzer asked him to stay after class .

Cloutier sat two desks over from Chism , who rarely participated in class discussion but was `` a really good student , '' she said .

At some point that afternoon , Ritzer went to a student girls ' bathroom on Danvers High 's second floor , as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom , a source close to the investigation said .

Chism allegedly followed her in .

How was Ritzer killed ? With a box cutter the suspect , Chism , had brought into school , a source close to the investigation says .

What happened to her body afterward ? It was stashed in a recycling bin , rolled outside , then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern Massachusetts high school 's athletic fields , adds another source . It was left there -- not buried , not even covered .

And where did the alleged killer go afterward ? After changing his clothes , he went to a Wendy 's fast-food restaurant and a movie , sources say , before police in a neighboring town saw him walking on a busy road under the pitch-dark sky early Wednesday .

Yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends , family and co-workers described as reserved and well-behaved -- continues to loom large .

Caring , compassionate teacher was ` brilliant ray of light '

Chism , who had moved to the Boston suburb of Danvers before the start of the school year , remains jailed without bond . A grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step : If they indict him for first - or second-degree murder , he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult , based on Massachusetts law .

`` It 's just surreal how quickly someone can go , and how much we take for granted every day , '' said Danvers High student Chris Weimert . Ritzer was `` the nicest teacher you could ever have . I ca n't believe it . ''

A member of the Ritzer family , who declined to be named , said the family is `` doing as well as can be expected . ''

One of those students was Chism , a freshman .

There , Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m. , said a source .

Her body went into a recycling bin , then outside the school where it was tossed . Authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment about 100 feet away from Ritzer 's body , a source said .

Before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they 'd started looking for Chism .

Scott Przybycien , the theater 's manager , told CNN that Chism arrived around 4:15 p.m. Tuesday and caught the start of the Woody Allen film , `` Blue Jasmine , '' about 15 minutes later . Surveillance video , which was turned over to police , confirmed that Chism was there until the movie let out around 6:15 p.m. , he said .

Whatever he told detectives in his subsequent interviews , whatever they saw in surveillance footage from the school , led to Chism 's arrest for murder . It also led them to Ritzer 's body in the woods .

A quiet and normal student

Chism did n't drink or do drugs , and he came from a good family , one of his closest friends said . He described Chism as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people , adding that he had n't been acting strangely lately .

Friends , relatives bewildered by arrest of ` storybook kid ' in teacher slaying

`` She was talking on Saturday about this year was a good year . She was teaching freshmen for the first time . She was happy , '' said Jen Berger , Ritzer 's best friend . `` I do n't even know what the world is like without her . It 's a scary thought . ''

Ritzer , a 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master 's degree at Salem State University , seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike , said Charlotte Dzerkacz , who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school .

Salem State issued a statement lamenting Ritzer 's death .

Ritzer was known to take to Twitter to dole out homework assignments and wisdom to her students .

`` No matter what happens in life , be good to people , '' she wrote in August . `` Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind . ''
