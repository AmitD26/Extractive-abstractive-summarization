The result is a cutting-edge medical village , called Hogewey . It 's the only place of its kind , on its scale , anywhere in the world . All of the residents have dementia . Everyone else , however , from the barber at the local salon to the chefs in the restaurants carry out their regular jobs in addition to being trained as specialized health workers . I have never seen anything like it in the world .

The media are rarely allowed inside , in an effort to minimize the disruption of the residents ' daily lives , but we were granted access in late March .

We do n't talk about dementia nearly enough as a society , and I know it can be uncomfortable to imagine yourself or a loved one in that position . But these conversations do need to happen , more than ever . When you consider the developed world , the number of people living with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050 .

But what if more of those wards could look like the picturesque village of Hogewey ? An entire village dedicated to caring for people with dementia . Here are 5 things I learned on the inside .

Yvonne van Amerongen , one of Hogewey 's founders , told me even the residents who make it to this door are n't necessarily trying to leave . Like many people with dementia , they simply see a doorway and want to walk through it . Most of the time , all a staff member has to do is suggest to the resident that the door is broken , and perhaps they should try another . I witnessed with my own eyes as residents simply turned themselves around and walk back in the other direction .

To that end , there are other safety modifications in place . An elevator -- something you or I can operate without much thought -- might prove perplexing to someone who suffers from severe dementia . At Hogewey , when a resident walks up to the elevator , a motion sensor summons the elevator , opens the door , and automatically takes the resident to the other floor when they step inside and trigger a weight sensor .

2 . Music makes the world go ` round

`` We ca n't talk anymore about everything , but with singing ... you can make a good concert together , '' Ada said . `` For me , that 's very important . ''

Music brings joy to the residents ' lives . They 're able to remember classic Dutch songs they learned when they were children , even if they have difficulty remembering much about their current day .

3 . Resist the urge to correct a person with dementia

At nearly 90 years old , Jo was still under the impression that she held a daily job , though she could n't recall what it was .

Additionally , not only was she under the impression that her parents were still alive , but furthermore that she had just seen them the day before .

I asked resident social worker Marjolein de Visser about her strategy when it comes to correcting confusion like this .

`` It depends on the phase of dementia , '' she said . `` In the beginning , you can ask , ` Well , how old are you ? ' And someone says , ` I 'm 84 . ' You say , ` How old would your parents be ? ' And they can think , ` Oh , that does n't make sense . ' ''

The memories are fading and their sense of judgment and logic has become impaired .

4 . Always keep up appearances

`` Sometimes I have customers that come in very unhappy , '' she told me . `` They look in the mirror , and they feel good . I think it 's very important . ''

5 . Hand holding is good for the heart and head

I spent the majority of my time at Hogewey with two couples , Ada and Ben Picavet , as well as Corrie and Theo Visser . Throughout my interviews with each pair , they sat holding hands .

`` It 's not possible to talk about everything -LRB- anymore -RRB- , '' Ada told me , `` but we still have this possibility . ''

Theo told me his marriage is the best it 's been in nearly 60 years .
