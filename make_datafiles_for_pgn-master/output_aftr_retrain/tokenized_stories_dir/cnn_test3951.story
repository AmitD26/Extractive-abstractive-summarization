So what should Brazilians expect ? In her speech , she mentioned wide-ranging political reform . A new direction in the economy ? Unlikely . A friendlier approach towards a fragmented Congress ? Who knows . A more positive dialogue with the private sector ? Possibly . Or nothing of that sort . Dilma Rousseff Part II is still to be revealed .

Brazilians endured three months of a fiercely fought campaign -- or as some have called it , `` dirty '' and `` shameful '' after a number of personal attacks that were both baseless and tasteless . Many voters lost their composure too , with political differences ruining friendships and keeping relatives apart . A wish that something new would come out of this battle was evident in late August when , after the tragic death of socialist candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane crash , his running mate and environmentalist Marina Silva took the helm on their ticket .

Dilma Rousseff was re-elected thanks to her party 's record in power . In the 12 years that the PT has governed Brazil , extreme poverty has been reduced by more than half . Social programs that increased the income of the poorest now reach 14 million families , most of them in northern regions . In those areas , Rousseff easily won the trust of the voters , beating her opponent by margins that reached 70 % . But she came close to losing the election due to poor recent economic results and the word that many today associate with her party 's red star : corruption .

Although the unemployment rate remains low , at 5 % , analysts expect layoffs to increase in the months to come . Brazil 's economy is technically in recession -- its GDP fell in the last two quarters -- and the IMF predicts only 0.3 % growth in 2014 .

Members of Rouseff 's PT party were convicted and jailed for illegal campaign funding and the bribing of Congressmen . And a new -LRB- and still ongoing -RRB- corruption scandal at the heart of Petrobras , the Brazilian state oil company , hit the government at its core . Poor economic data and sleaze are issues that tend to shock and concern the better-off and well-educated , mainly located in the south of Brazil , where Aecio Neves performed very well . In the State of Sao Paulo , the richest and most populated , he got 64 % of the vote .

Massive street protests , a stalled economy , corruption ; Dilma Rousseff survived it all -- just . Her main tasks now are to unite a divided nation , find a way of making Brazil 's economy grow again , bring down an inflation rate that is stubbornly high -LRB- 6.75 % -RRB- and change something . The Brazilian President knows that she has not won this contest because of what she 's promised to do in the future , as she did n't even present a formal plan for her second term . She 's won because of the past , and the future is still being planned .

In opinion polls , 70 % of Brazilians have repeatedly said they wanted change in the federal government . Unsure about how to achieve that , they decided to close their eyes , keep things as they are and hope for the best .
