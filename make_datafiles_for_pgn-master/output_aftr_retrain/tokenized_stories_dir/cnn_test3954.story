LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The father of Princess Diana 's boyfriend attacked the British Royal family Monday with a series of insults and accusations at the inquest looking into how the couple died .

Mohamed Al Fayed , father of Dodi , repeated his allegations of a massive cover-up involving the Royal family , paparazzi and for the first time Diana 's sister . He has previously included British intelligence services in the alleged plot .

Al Fayed , who spent most of the day in the witness box , let out a torrent of allegations that members of the royal family were racist .

`` Diana suffered for 20 years from this Dracula family , '' Al Fayed said Monday .

`` I will not rest until I die . If I lose everything to find the truth , '' Al Fayed , told the court .

Al Fayed , owner of London 's famed Harrods department store , began his testimony by reading a statement saying Diana told him in July 1997 , the month before the crash , that she feared for her life . Watch Al-Fayed have his day in court . ''

Diana said she had a wooden box with her initials on it containing all the details about why she feared for her life , Al Fayed said . He added she told him that if anything ever happened to her , he needed to know about the box .

At the inquest , Al Fayed testified that Diana and Dodi were engaged and planned an announcement the Monday after the crash .

When an inquest lawyer challenged Al Fayed as to why he did n't tell everybody once he knew about the alleged engagement , Al Fayed claimed he had only just found out himself .

During the five-month inquest , witnesses have been questioned about a mysterious white Fiat Uno which some witnesses reported seeing shortly before the crash but which was never traced .

The inquest has also heard testimony about whether the chauffeur , Henri Paul , was drunk on the night of the crash .

Al Fayed claimed Paul was sober and that French investigators botched the tests , though he did not give evidence to support the claim . Instead he alleged a coverup by two French investigators : Dominique Lecomte , who conducted the post-mortem on Paul , and Gilbert Pepin , who tested Paul 's blood .

Al Fayed also questioned the delay in transporting Diana to a hospital after the crash , adding she might have survived had she gotten treatment sooner .

It began in October 2007 -- after the French and British investigations into the crash concluded -- and is expected to last six months . E-mail to a friend
