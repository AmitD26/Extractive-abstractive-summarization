A child has died after contracting a rare but deadly brain-eating amoeba infection while visiting a home in Louisiana , according to state health officials .

The state health department has not released the child 's age or identity .

Out of what officials describe as `` an abundance of caution , '' St. Bernard Parish on Thursday began treating its water system with additional chlorine and flushing any potentially contaminated water from its lines . This treatment may result in changes in the smell , taste and color of the local water , the health department said , but it is still safe to drink .

`` We are working with the parish to make sure precautionary measures are being taken while we await additional test results on samples taken from the area 's water system , '' Assistant Secretary for Public Health J.T. Lane said in a statement .

Between 2001 and 2010 , there were only 32 reported cases of people getting Naegleria fowleri in the United States , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Most of the cases have been in the Southeast .

`` This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of , '' Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC about Kali 's case . `` Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die . ''

The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection , including headache , fever , nausea , vomiting and a stiff neck , according to the CDC .

`` Later symptoms include confusion , lack of attention to people and surroundings , loss of balance , seizures and hallucinations , '' the agency website says . `` After the start of symptoms , the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days . ''
