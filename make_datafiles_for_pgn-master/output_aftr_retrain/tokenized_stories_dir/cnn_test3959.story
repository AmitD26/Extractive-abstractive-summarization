During his travels , he was robbed at gunpoint , evacuated out of a war zone and almost eaten by crocodiles . He crossed swamps , climbed mountains , cozied up to scorpions in the Sahara desert , and dined on rat stew and grasshoppers .

Those months , he says , were the best of his life .

`` I 've always been interested in the stories of the great Victorian explorers , like Livingstone and those guys , '' admits Wood .

Wood 's journey began in Rwanda , took nine months and spanned 3,750 miles . It was necessary to make the trip on foot , he says , because `` walking is the only way you can really get under the skin of a country . ''

Occasionally , he was joined by a film crew from the UK 's Channel 4 -LRB- the network is planning to air a four-part documentary on his travels -RRB- . Sometimes he traveled with a local guide . Mainly , though , he walked it alone .

The kindness of strangers

Wood acknowledges that his survival was often dependent on the hospitality of local villagers , of which there was an abundance . The people of the Sudan , he says , were probably the most giving of all .

Even sharing water , he says , demonstrated an incredible act of kindness -- given it 's a 20-mile walk to the nearest source for many villagers .

Out of harm 's way -LRB- almost -RRB-

He made it halfway through the country , to Bor -- the front line of the war . It was there that he was arrested and brought before an army commander , who told him he was not welcome , and threatened to kill him if he crossed into the rebel side . He was evacuated to the capital , and flew to North Sudan .

Had he made the trip uninterrupted , he would likely have achieved a Guinness World Record . Now , he 's not so sure , though he says it does n't matter .

`` It was never about breaking records , it was about taking the biggest adventure in my life , and it was certainly that . ''

The finish line

It was a cathartic moment , he says , and one that was bittersweet .

`` The first thing I did was run into the sea , and just enjoy the moment , '' he says .
