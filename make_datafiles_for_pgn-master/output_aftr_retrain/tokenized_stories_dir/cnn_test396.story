Opinion : Airstrikes will not beat ISIS

At least four mortar rounds believed fired by ISIS forces have landed in Kobani , according to to Alan Minbic , a Syrian Kurdish soldier who was fighting in an area between Ayn al-Arab and Aidek .

A CNN crew witnessed the Kurdish fighters using artillery and heavy machine-gun fire to drive the ISIS fighters back from the ridge line they were occupying .

Denmark and Belgium also signed up on Friday , adding to a list of more than 50 European , Asian and Arab countries that have joined the fight , according to U.S. officials .

U.S. forces continue to hunt targets in Iraq and Syria , with aircraft taking off from the USS George H.W. Bush as often as every 55 seconds , according to CNN 's Becky Anderson , who is aboard the aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf .

While the most dramatic advances have been halted , Western leaders have warned of a long fight against ISIS , saying it could take years before the group is fully dislodged .
