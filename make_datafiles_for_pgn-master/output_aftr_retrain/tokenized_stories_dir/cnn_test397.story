-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We have all succumbed to city noise : A 5 a.m. call to prayer courtesy of a mosque after a lengthy flight , a late-night New York bar crowd living it up in the wee hours , a raucous Carnival scene in Rio during an important business trip .

Whatever the scenario , even the loftiest skyscraper accommodations ca n't always escape the din .

The party hotels of the 1990s gave rise to the sleep-friendly accommodations of the 2000s , which prioritized high-end amenities for comfort .

Money-saving hotel tips

But there is a more scientific approach that involves innovations you do n't necessarily see , like triple-paned windows , extra-thick walls and cork floor layers .

The true measure of a hotel room 's soundproofing is evaluated by how well it deflects its cacophonous surroundings .

Yet few major booking sites offer visitors the opportunity to single out quiet hotels in notoriously noisy cities like Cairo and Tokyo , relying instead on user-generated feedback .

This is where brand recognition comes in . Soundproofing styles have become proprietary secrets among hoteliers .

Technology aside , one of those angles can be as simple as choosing a quiet neighborhood , like those where several of our top choices reside .

Departures : Memorable hotel arrivals

Casa Gangotena , Quito , Ecuador

Finding a soundless refuge for a mid-afternoon nap or business briefing can be tricky , but the double - and triple-glazed windows in the 31 rooms at Casa Gangotena , a converted 1920s mansion that opened in 2012 in the city 's Plaza San Francisco , make it easier .

Luxury Rooms and the garden-view Junior Suite are the quietest , but thick Egyptian marble and dense leather also help absorb noise in the plaza-facing accommodations .

The Tokyo Station Hotel

Draft-free windows and soundproofed walls constructed with reinforced concrete and terracotta tiles were part of what made this property such a bastion of tranquility when it first opened in 1931 .

Triple-glazed windows in bedrooms and suites facing busy Park Lane block any additional noises .

It is also home to an open fireplace and a large , granite spoon-shaped bath , which is filled with green tea at night .

Peninsula , Shanghai

The property takes things a step further by adding discreet bed-and-bath-side buttons , which dim the lights and activate the do-not-disturb function on the phone and doorbell , and a signature valet box that allows housekeeping to quietly pick up and deliver shoes , laundry and dry cleaning without entering .
