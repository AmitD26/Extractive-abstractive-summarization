On Tuesday , three U.S.-trained scientists won the Nobel prize in physics , for finding definitive evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .

Flash back to the 1990s , when two independent research teams set out to `` weigh '' the Universe -- one led by Saul Perlmutter , a young physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , the other by a Harvard professor of astronomy , Bob Kirshner , with former graduate student Brian Schmidt , now at the Australia National University , and then-graduate student Adam Riess , now a senior astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute and the Johns Hopkins University .

These astrophysicists knew the universe was a vast , mostly empty space , dotted with galaxies of stars in a thin sea of atoms . Thanks to work 70 years earlier by Edwin Hubble -LRB- after whom NASA 's space telescope is named -RRB- , they also knew the universe has been expanding for billions of years . Like all astronomers , they expected the expansion to be slowing due to the pull of gravity between galaxies and other matter .

It 's pretty simple : The more stuff in the universe , the greater the gravitational `` braking '' of the expansion . So , the Nobel prize-winning experiments were designed to measure the rate of deceleration of the expansion , and thus the total amount of material in the universe .

Imagine the shock when the data indicated the expansion was speeding up . Supernovae appeared to be more distant -- fainter -- than if the expansion speed were unchanging . What ?! The accelerating rate of expansion signaled that gravity , a force we have known about and loved since the first apple fell from a tree , is a paltry thing compared to some new , utterly unknown , energy field that pushes galaxies apart .

We call this new thing `` dark energy '' -- signifying the energy that appears to push outward , with the adjective `` dark '' signifying that we know nothing whatsoever about its nature .

Moreover , in 2003 , NASA 's WMAP cosmology satellite showed convincingly that dark energy is the dominant constituent of the universe .

This stuff was n't predicted by any physics theory and was completely unknown until the Nobel prize-winning teams of astronomers and physicists made their measurements -- yet there is more of it than anything else in the universe . More than the atoms that make up you and me and our Earth , more than the hydrogen and helium that pervades the universe , more than the unknown dark matter particles that cause attractive gravity and allow galaxies to form in the first place . Whatever it is , it 's teaching us something utterly new about how matter and space and time behave . A fundamentally new physics theory is needed .

The fact is , dark energy is the biggest mystery in science . It has driven a huge amount of research in the past decade , and was a key driver in last year 's `` New Worlds , New Horizons '' report from the National Academies of Science , which prioritized future astronomy and astrophysics projects . Making better measurements of the properties of dark energy was very high on the list , using the James Webb Space Telescope , now nearing completion , as well as an infrared-optical space telescope to be built in the coming decade .

Instead the Perlmutter and Schmidt-Riess-Kirshner teams found the expansion was accelerating -- as unexpected as seeing a ball fall upward when you drop it .

Astrophysicists are hot on the trail of dark energy . A fellow physics professor asked me , following Yale 's Leigh Page Prize lecture on dark energy by Saul Perlmutter , one of the Nobelists , `` Does n't this just keep you up at night , wondering what this stuff could be ? '' It 's keeping a lot of us up at night .

What does this discovery mean for the rest of the world , for people not engaged in figuring out the laws of nature ? Dark energy does not directly impact our lives , at least not now . Our galaxy has billions of years to go before dark energy could be strong enough to rip it apart . Events move slowly on universe-al time .

But if history is any guide , understanding the physics of particles , space and time has proved incredibly valuable time and time again . Much of the technological innovation that drives our economy today is derived from physics discoveries decades ago , according to the 2006 `` Gathering Storm '' report from the National Academies of Science .
