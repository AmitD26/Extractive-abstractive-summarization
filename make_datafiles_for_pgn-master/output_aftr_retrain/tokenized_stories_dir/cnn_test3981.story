Freed from prison , former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko returned Saturday to the battleground capital the same day the country 's president said he left Kiev because of a `` coup . ''

Tymoshenko 's release was the latest in a day of dramatic , fast-paced developments that saw Parliament vote to remove President Viktor Yanukovych from office and call for new elections .

`` You were able to change Ukraine , and you can do everything , '' she told the crowd . `` Everyone has a right to take part in building a European , independent state . ''

`` I do n't plan to leave the country . I do n't plan to resign . I am the legitimate president , '' he said in an interview from Kharkiv , a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine 's border with that nation .

'' ... What I am going to do next is to protect my country from the split , to stop the bloodshed . I do n't know how to do it yet . I am in Kharkiv and I do n't know what I am going to do next . ''

He did not address reports that he attempted to leave the country by airplane .

According to the head of Ukraine 's Border Guard Service , Sergei Astakov , Yanukovych and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk . He was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces , Astakov told CNN , confirming an account he gave to Ukraine 's Interfax news agency .

When the inspectors refused the money , Yanukovych and others in his entourage exited the plane and got into two vehicles that drove up on the tarmac , Astakov is quoted as saying .

Ukraine 's dismissed interior minister , Vitaliy Zakharchenko , also was refused exit from the country in a similar incident at the same airport , Astakov said .

The vote came just 24 hours after Yanukovych signed a peace deal with the opposition intended to end days of bloody protests .

` People 's residence '

Government buildings , protest gatherings and the central city were devoid of police and security forces , who had opened fire on protesters this week , killing dozens .

Track how the crisis in Ukraine unfolded

As a CNN crew drove to Yanukovych 's residence , it passed checkpoints set up by protesters .

When the crew arrived , the gatekeepers said they were not allowing the general public onto the grounds , but they let journalists enter .

But not everyone in Ukraine was happy with the news .

The country is ethnically split , with many ethnic Russians living in the east . The rest comprises mostly ethnic Ukrainians .

In the Verkhovna Rada , Ukraine 's Parliament , lawmakers passed a resolution to free Tymoshenko , a hero of the country 's 2004 revolution that forced the questionable results of a presidential election won by Yanukovych to be thrown out .

Tymoshenko served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010 , and was forced out of office after losing an election to Yanukovych .

During the parliamentary session , resignations were announced for the speaker and another leading presidential ally .

Hours later , Parliament elected a new speaker , a rival to Yanukovych , and gave him the duty of coordinating the executive office until a new cabinet is in place .

Another opposition parliamentarian received the duties of acting interior minister .

Discord 's roots

The unrest began in November , when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia .

Russia , which has offered to lend money to cash-strapped Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices , has pressured Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators .

Western leaders , who have offered Ukraine a long-term aid package requiring economic modernization , urged him to show restraint , open the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out deep-seated political differences .

But the fight was also about corruption and control . The opposition called Yanukovych heavy-handed , with protesters saying they would n't leave Independence Square until he resigned .

Tensions boiled over Tuesday , when security forces charged into a Kiev crowd with stun grenades , nightsticks and armored personnel carriers . The violence escalated , leaving dozens -- protesters and police alike -- dead .
