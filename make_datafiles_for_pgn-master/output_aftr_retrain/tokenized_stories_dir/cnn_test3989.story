From then on , Henn -- Florida 's flea market kingpin -- sounded like a giddy schoolboy as he told his story about how he put down a $ 1 million deposit in April 2012 to become the first person to buy a Gulfstream G650 -- `` the hottest airplane out there '' -- with its distinctive , sweeping , curving wings and its roomy , swanky interior .

It made him `` feel like a million dollars , '' he said gleefully .

For a plane that costs $ 65 million , feeling like $ 1 million might seem like a disappointment . But you get the picture .

The jet 's top speed : 704 mph -- nearly the speed of sound -- makes it arguably the world 's fastest civilian aircraft .

Henn knows speed . He 's been around the track a time or two -- winning the checkered flag during the '80s at the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours event at Florida 's Sebring International Raceway .

Saving time and avoiding hassles are the main reasons the rich and famous want to fly private .

But none of these planes can smoke the G650 .

Speed aside , it 's got goodies like no other jet in its class . In the cockpit : an infrared night-vision system projects a pilot windshield display , increasing safety during landings . In the cabin : bigger 28-inch-tall windows and a ceiling height of 6-and-a-half feet .

`` if you fly from here to Tokyo , you have to fly with two crews , '' Henn explains . The G650 has `` a complete crew quarters and restrooms and galley and everything they need . So it 's a different breed of cat from what I 'm used to . ''

During the next half-century , that drive-in grew into the Swap Shop -- an 88-acre flea market and cash cow .

Keep in mind that `` very few celebrities own their own jets , '' says Doug Giese of Embraer Executive Jets . Owning a plane is still expensive , even if you 're rich . Giese says most celebs fly private by using brokers or buying memberships in fractional share programs .

Brokers

`` Private aviation is becoming more commonplace because there are more programs now , '' says PJS CEO Greg Raiff , a 23-year top broker whose business includes several college and professional sports teams . `` Thanks to the Internet , there are now 500 companies that can arrange something for you . ''

Split the cost among the passengers , and it 's comparable to the price of some luxury cruises -- and a possible option to celebrate an important life-event such as a golden anniversary or a retirement party .

Fractional shares

One downside , says Raiff : You have to pay well in advance .

Many jet cards start at a minimum of $ 100,000 , but Delta Private Jets offers a more affordable $ 25,000 card . Give them at least 48 hours notice , and they 'll get you a plane , says DPJ President Cyril Turner .

`` People can lock in today 's rate even if there are future increases , '' Turner says . `` With the cost of Jet A fuel approaching $ 6 a gallon and a burn rate approaching -- depending on the plane type -- 200 gallons an hour , that gets pretty costly . ''

Delta Private Jets charges about $ 5,000 per hour for jets seating up to eight people . Rates start at $ 9,800 per hour for jets seating up to 14 people .

BlackJet offers an even more creative idea : `` semi-private '' flying , CNNMoney reports . BlackJet books business class planes from carriers such as JetSelect and sells the seats individually . A BlackJet seat on a Challenger 300 from New York to L.A. might cost around $ 3,500 .

Unfortunately for Henn , enjoying his G650 wo n't be an option for the time being . Ultimately , he says , he 's a businessman , and the plane is an investment . He leased the jet back to Gulfstream so the company can use it as a demonstration model . `` It 's on its way to China , '' Henn says . `` It 's supposedly going to set a round-the-world record . ''

There 's a hint of disappointment in Henn 's voice , above the sounds of revving engines at the Daytona track . `` Sorry , it 's time to get back to it , '' he explains . His Enzo Ferrari is beckoning .

`` I 'm going to take my Enzo back out on the track , and then I 'm finished for today , '' he says . `` Then I 'm going back to work . ''
