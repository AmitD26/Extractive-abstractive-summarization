-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Transit officials in San Francisco reopened all downtown subway stations Monday evening after successively opening and closing them to stem the threat of spreading protests .

Police officers in response gear stood at the Civic Center station , with one officer on a megaphone telling people , `` This is your final warning , the station is closed . ''

On the streets , small groups of protesters could be seen gathering to criticize BART after several shootings involving its police officers -- the latest coming last month and resulting in the death of 45-year-old Charles Hill .

Meanwhile , an official with the system stood by the decision to shut off cell phone service ahead of a protest last week .

`` What we 're going to do is take the appropriate steps within the Constitution , '' he said . `` There are more constitutional rights than just free speech . There is the right to be safe . ''

In addition , Twitter traffic related to Anonymous boasted that hackers had been able to get into BART 's internal network . Several related items and documents were posted , including one claiming to be `` the User Info Database of MyBart.gov . '' This had e-mails and , in some cases , phone numbers and addresses of hundreds of people .

`` By -LRB- cutting cell service -RRB- , you have not only threatened your citizens ' safety , you have also performed an act of censorship , '' a seemingly computer-generated voice -- speaking over dramatic music and images -- said in a video posted online Sunday afternoon . `` By doing this , you have angered Anonymous . ''

`` We ... will be taking steps to hear from stakeholders about the important issues those actions raised , including protecting public safety and ensuring the availability of communications networks , '' said Grace .

`` We made a gut-wrenching decision that was forced upon us by the protesters , '' Johnson said . `` They made us choose between people 's ability to use their mobile phones -LRB- and -RRB- their constitutional right to get from point A to point B. ''
