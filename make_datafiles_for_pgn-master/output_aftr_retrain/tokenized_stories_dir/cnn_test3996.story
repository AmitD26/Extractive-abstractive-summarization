That 's all it took for the exchange to turn deadly .

The Police Department in Bridgeton , New Jersey , released video this week showing the death of Jerame Reid , 36 , who was shot on the night of December 30 .

He was a passenger in a car that got pulled over for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign .

The dashcam video shows what happened next .

Officer Braheme Days approaches the passenger side door . He asks how the two men inside the car are doing and identifies himself . The conversation is friendly .

Days asks to see a driver 's license .

Suddenly , he steps back from the vehicle and pulls his weapon .

Days shouts over and over : `` Show me your hands ! ... Do n't you f ****** move ! ''

He yells at his partner , Roger Worley : `` Get 'em out the car , Rog . We got a gun in this glove compartment . ''

`` I 'll telling you , I 'm going to shoot you ! You 're going to be f ****** dead ! '' screams the officer . `` You reach for something you 're going to be f ****** dead . ''

The vehicle 's other occupant did not appear to be injured . He got out of the car , lay on the ground and was handcuffed .

Bridgeton Police Capt. Michael Gaimari described Days and Worley as `` very good officers '' responsible for `` a lot of key arrests . ''

Gaimari said Days was one of four officers who arrested Reid last August on charges that included resisting arrest , drug possession , intent to distribute and failure to appear . The disposition of the case was not immediately known .

The Police Department reportedly released the video after a public records request was made by the South Jersey Times .

Does video of police tell the whole truth ?
