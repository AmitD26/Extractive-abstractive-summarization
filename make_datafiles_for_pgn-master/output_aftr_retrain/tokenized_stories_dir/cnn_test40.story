The free encyclopedia on Tuesday temporarily shut down access to most of its Russian-language site in protest of proposed legal action in Russia that it says would result in Internet censorship .

In January , Wikipedia shuttered its English sites for 24 hours in protest of anti-piracy laws that were being discussed in the U.S. Congress . That action was cited as evidence of a new wave of political power for the technology and Internet industries . Google and others joined in that protest , which essentially derailed two anti-piracy bills in the United States .

The Russian Wikipedia site compares proposed amendments to an `` On Information '' law to China 's hyper-restrictive firewall . If implemented , the changes to the law could result in access to Wikipedia being cut off permanently , the group says .

`` Given the precedent , there 's a good chance access to Wikipedia will be denied across the country . ''

The bills , according to news reports , would allow the government to blacklist certain websites . The aim , the government says , is to protect Internet users from harmful content like child pornography and websites that promote substance abuse .

On Twitter , Russia 's communications minister appeared to say the criticism from Wikipedia was healthy . `` I do n't support Wiki 's intentions to close , '' Nikolay Nikiforov wrote in a message translated from Russian . `` But this step is an important reaction of our society and a sign that we need to improve . ''

Wikipedia 's political stance and temporary shutdown could be viewed by some as hypocritical . The digital encyclopedia , run by a nonprofit , is dedicated to the spread of free information .

In January , however , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told CNN that it is the encyclopedia 's role to stand up when free speech and Internet freedoms are threatened .

`` Free speech includes the right to not speak , '' he said . `` We are a community of volunteers . We have written this thing that we believe to be a gift to the world . We do n't charge people for it . It 's freely available to anybody who wants to -LRB- use it -RRB- . We are a charity . And I think it 's important for people to realize that the ability of our community to come together and give this kind of gift to the world depends on a certain legal infrastructure that makes it possible for people to share knowledge freely .
