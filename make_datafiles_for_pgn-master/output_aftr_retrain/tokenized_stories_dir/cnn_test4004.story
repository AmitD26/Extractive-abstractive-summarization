I 'm not sure , hand on heart , that I genuinely thought it would happen . So much had to come together at the right time and Sydney was my third Olympic campaign . I knew how easy it was to get it wrong , how narrow the margin is between hero and zero .

But standing here 14 years on , waiting for a reaction , tears even , felt hollow , it did n't feel like `` my place . '' Perhaps too much time had passed -- children , work , another gold medal .

The next day we were out on the Harbor filming for MainSail , onboard the mighty Comanche , the favorite for the prestigious Rolex Sydney to Hobart race .

If the wind shifts , you can really smell the warmth of the city , another slight shift and you can smell the rich pine of the park -- or if the sea breeze is on its way , that all changes again , to the fresh aromas of the ocean .

Even the color of the water can help give clues to the shifting tides , the nuances in shade suggesting depth and movement , all potential aids in beating the fleet .

With Olympic success in the balance it 's too easy to keep that head in the boat , to miss the stunning beaches , the rugged beauty of the Heads , but the Harbor here in Sydney really is something else .

All those signs back then had helped me `` read '' this venue . It was so hard to race well here , it was complicated . Sure , I 'd always loved it , felt energized by the challenge , but I was also fearful -- with so many variables , this harbor could easily trip you up .

Sailing past Bradley 's head , beautiful , sandy and empty now , but back then , bursting with spectators , and as I raced past , within touching distance of the crowd , they 'd cheer me on . I 'd feel a wave of support from the beaches , `` come on the Pom ! ''

From the start of that week I had the lead . I was relaxed . Never confused or panicked , I trusted in my knowledge of the course . I 'd learned to read all those signs and now , I was making the calls , and they were paying off .

While others fell apart , I grew in confidence with each and every day .

I led until the penultimate race , when it all began to fall apart .

I was at 16th place -- I had finally choked . I 'd always wondered -- would I be one of those athletes ? Within sight of glory , one hand on the gold medal and it all slips away ?

He held me , he smiled , and he congratulated me . He told me how proud he was , that still with one race to go , I was on the Olympic podium , I had secured a medal for sure .

The final race would decide the color . `` Trust yourself Shirls , you know this crazy Harbor better than all of them . ''

And I did . I knew I did .

Back on Comanche , we had work to do . I had to focus on the now , with lots of filming to get through . But motoring back in , the work all done , in the shadow of the Opera House , the `` moment '' came .

It had been right here , the battle for gold , I had been calm , composed , confident even .

Despite the helicopter noise and spectator boats , it had been oddly silent . I had an eye on my opposition for sure , but to win here my focus could n't be them -- it was this harbor .

Sydney harbor could bite , you had to understand it , expect the unexpected -- and I did . By the last lap , gold was mine to lose . I held my nerve and crossed that finish line one last time .
