The sculptor , a 22-year-old artist who calls himself `` Milk , '' had yet to title his creation . But passersby were quick to nickname the mannequin `` Umbrella Man . ''

Built of wooden squares , the 10-foot tall statue of a man holding aloft a yellow umbrella has now taken its place alongside the posters , cartoons , banners and calligraphy that now decorate the streets and sidewalks of Hong Kong 's Admiralty district .

Umbrella inspiration

The sit-in has acted as a magnet attracting artists eager to make their voices heard .

One of the posters shows a helmeted police officer with riot shield yelling `` You 're such a thug ! '' while pointing his finger at an umbrella-toting cartoon that resembles the children 's book character Paddington Bear .

The artist who drew the cartoon is a 30-year-old graphic designer Carol Hung .

Hung , who described herself as a political neophyte , said she was inspired to produce a series of protest-inspired drawings after seeing reports of police clashing with protesters on September 28th .

On a recent afternoon , art teacher Josephine Lau sat in the middle of the highway now occupied by students , painting yellow ribbons onto Chinese paper . She hoped her posters would prove more durable than previous slogans she had made , which were washed away by rainstorms last week .

`` We can use different media to express ourselves ... to tell people what we feel about Hong Kong , '' Lau said . `` I like the peaceful and silent protest and I 'm supporting the students behind the scenes . ''

Not far away , 17-year-old Timothy Sun was designing his own posters on the asphalt with the slogan `` GOV YU NO LISTEN TO US ? ''

`` I want to use my way to show my voice to the public , '' the teenager said .

Thousands of pastel post-it notes bearing messages and drawings written by passersby in many languages coat the curved staircase that runs along the outside wall of one of the government office buildings in Admiralty .

Many of the messages profess love for Hong Kong . The wall serves as proof that , despite young Hong Kongers ' freedom to digitally post anything they like on social media , there is still a powerful attraction to expressing oneself using old-fashioned paper and ink .

`` This feels very much to me like Twitter , but paper Twitter , '' observed Young , the businessman and art aficionado . `` Old school Twitter , if there 's such a thing . ''

Young , who runs a chain of high-end design stores called Goods of Desire , was quickly inspired to add his own post-it message to the wall . It was an appeal to Hong Kong 's beleaguered top official to preserve the post-it monument : `` Mr. Chief Executive , Please do n't tear this wall down . ''

`` I see a lot of tenderness , a lot of passion ... a lot of imagination , which is fantastic , '' Young said , while gazing out on the largely empty encampment and its fluttering banners and posters .

`` I wonder where that 's from ? '' he asked . `` I wonder where these people will be after this , when it all ends . ''
