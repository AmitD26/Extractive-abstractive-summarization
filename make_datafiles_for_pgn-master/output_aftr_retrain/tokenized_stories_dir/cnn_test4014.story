Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- When Supreme Court justices opened the current term in October by declining to take up several gay marriage cases , it seemed they might avoid the blockbuster docket of the past few years .

In January , they decided to take up a challenge to gay marriage , and for good measure , also agreed to hear a case regarding Oklahoma 's lethal injection protocol .

Here 's a glimpse of some of what has been decided , what has been heard and what is to come :

WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED

WHAT HAS BEEN HEARD

Separation of powers : A 12 year old American boy , born in Jerusalem , is caught in the middle of a significant dispute between Congress and the executive branch . The disagreement began in 2002 when the parents of Menachem Zivotofsky sought to have `` Israel '' recorded in his passport as the place of his birth pursuant to a federal law passed in 2002 . Sounds simple right ? Not according to the State Department , which refuses to implement the law . The executive branch says that because Israeli and Palestinian leaders have long been engaged in a dispute over the status of Jerusalem , it avoids any official act that might be perceived as taking sides . The current policy is to list `` Jerusalem '' as the place of birth instead of `` Israel . '' The Zivotofskys seek to compel the State Department to follow the law . They argue that Congress has broad power over passports , and that this case is about the identify of a passport holder . A lower court disagreed holding that the law `` impermissibly intrudes '' on the president 's authority to decide whether and on what terms to recognize foreign nations .

Facebook and the First Amendment : `` There 's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you . '' That 's one of the messages Anthony D. Elonis posted on his Facebook account after his wife left him . Other postings were so violent that his former wife sought protection and Elonis was ultimately convicted under a federal threat statute . But he 's seeking to overturn his conviction . He argues he was devastated after his wife left him and that he turned to rap lyrics as therapy . He says much of what he wrote was similar to the work of his idol Eminem . The case offers the justices an opportunity to clarify the scope of the `` true threats '' exception of the First Amendment in the relatively new world of social media .

Obamacare : On March 4 , the Court will hear a challenge to a section of the Affordable Care Act concerning the subsidies available to individuals who purchase competitively priced insurance from the American Health Benefit Exchanges . As things stand now , 16 states and the District of Columbia have established their own exchanges , while 34 states have opted to have federally-facilitated Exchanges . At issue : who qualifies for the subsidies ? The federal government say that ALL qualifying individuals are eligible . But challengers say that the law is clear : only those living in states with state-run exchanges can receive the subsidies . If the Court agrees with the challengers , the ruling could impact more than 5 million people and severely destabilize the entire law . Members of Congress who crafted the law say in a friend of the court brief that it was `` widely understood that the tax credits would be available to all Americans who satisfied the statute 's income criteria regardless of where they lived . ''

Gay marriage : Sometime in late April , the Court will take up whether states can ban gay marriage . Attorney General Eric Holder has vowed to file a brief and urge the justices `` to make marriage equality a reality for all Americans . '' The justices will be reviewing the only recent appellate court decision that upheld state bans . The lower court said in part that the decision should be left to the democratic process . `` The people do n't get to decide what the Constitution safeguards , '' says Jon W. Davidson Legal Director of Lambda Legal , `` They do n't get to vote to violate the Constitution . ''

Lethal injection : Three inmates are challenging Oklahoma 's lethal injection protocol , after the botched execution of Clayton Lockett last April . At issue is the first drug -- midazolam -- used in the three drug protocol that critics say violates the Constitution 's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment . Lawyers for the inmates say the drug fails to maintain unconsciousness . In 2008 , the Supreme Court found that Kentucky 's lethal injection protocol was constitutional , but since then states have struggled to obtain drugs and frequently changed their protocols .
