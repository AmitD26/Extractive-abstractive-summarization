'' ` God is great , ' '' the Taliban militants shouted as they roared through the hallways of a school in Peshawar , Pakistan .

'' ` A lot of the children are under the benches , ' '' a Pakistani Taliban said , according to Ahmed . '' ` Kill them . ' ''

The death toll does not include the terrorists who attacked the school , bursting into an auditorium where a large number of students were taking an exam and gunning down many of them within minutes , Bajwa said .

`` They started shooting indiscriminately , '' Bajwa said , `` and that 's where maximum damage was caused . ''

The Taliban had `` 300 to 400 people ... under their custody '' at one point , said Khurrassani , whose group is called Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan , or TTP . But Bajwa said there was no hostage situation , as the attackers ' focus was shooting to kill rather than taking captives .

They were eventually met by Pakistani troops who pushed through the complex building by building , room by room . By 4 p.m. , they 'd confined the attackers to four buildings . A few hours later , all the militants -- seven of them , according to Bajwa -- were dead .

Pakistani authorities spent Tuesday night inside the school in Peshawar , a city about 120 kilometers -LRB- 75 miles -RRB- from the country 's capital , Islamabad , looking for survivors , victims and improvised explosive devices planted to worsen the carnage .

As they searched , they discovered that the school 's principal was among the terrorists ' victims .

`` We are undeterred . ... We will not back off , '' Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN .

But he said the ambush at the school is another example of how great his nation 's sacrifices have been in fighting that 's raged for more than a decade .

`` Even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror , '' he said . `` The smaller the coffin , the heavier it is to carry . ... It 's a very , very tragic day . ''

Minister : Most of the dead were 12 to 16 years old

Their nightmare began in late morning , when a car exploded behind the school . Pakistani education minister Muhammad Baligh Ur Rehman explained to CNN that the blast was a ruse , meant to divert the attention of the school 's security guards .

It worked .

Bajwa told reporters that Pakistani security forces reached the school 15 minutes after the attack began .

They found , he said , `` the children ... drenched in blood , with their bodies on top of each other . ''

Obama : Pakistan attack shows Taliban ` depravity '

It is the home base of the TTP , an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of Islam in Pakistan . The group has battled Pakistani troops and , on a number of occasions , attacked civilians as well .

`` I call upon the international community , leaders in Pakistan , all political parties -- everyone -- -LRB- to -RRB- stand up together and fight against terrorism , '' the 16-year-old added in another statement . `` And we should make sure that every child gets a safe and quality education . ''

Growing up scared in Peshawar

Still , even by Pakistan and the Taliban 's gruesome standards , Tuesday 's attack may be the most abominable yet .

It comes after peace talks between the Pakistan Taliban and Pakistan 's government as recently as last spring . The government released 19 Taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture , in fact .

But talks broke down under a wave of attacks by the Taliban and mounting political pressure to bring the violence under control .

Inside militants ' secret tunnels in Pakistan

In September 2013 , choir members and children attending Sunday school were among 81 people killed in a suicide bombing at the Protestant All Saints Church of Pakistan . A splinter group of the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility , blaming the U.S. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country .

And for the past few months , the Pakistani military has been conducting a ground offensive to clear out militants , spurring violence that 's displaced tens of thousands of people and sparked deadly retaliations .

The TTP spokesman challenged that ordinary citizens were targeted , saying that five army vehicles are routinely stationed at the school .

`` We are facing such heavy nights in routine , '' Khurrassani said , rationalizing the siege shortly before it ended . `` Today , you must face the heavy night . ''
