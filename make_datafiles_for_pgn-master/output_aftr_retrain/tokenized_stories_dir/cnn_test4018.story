-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Blood , sweat , and tears '' on the football pitch used to mean a very different thing in Sierra Leone .

Here , even a post-match handshake is an uneasy encounter .

In this fearful new climate , football has been banned . And to sports-obsessed Sierra Leoneans , the embargo is tantamount to forbidding God .

`` Football is like a second religion in Sierra Leone , '' explained the country 's Football Association president Isha Johansen .

On Sundays , the long stretch of sand at Lumley Beach , outside the capital of Freetown , would usually be filled with thousands of people playing the national sport .

That was before the outbreak which has had over 1,400 new cases in the last three weeks alone , making Sierra Leone set to eclipse Liberia as the worst-affected country on the globe , according to the World Health Organisation .

`` And that 's football . There 's a lot of interaction , there 's a lot of sweat and blood . ''

Do n't touch

Beyond the deadly virus itself , are the psychological effects on a naturally `` touchy , feely people who love to hug and hold hands , '' said Johansen .

`` It 's a very strained and difficult place to be in mentally . You have to reprogram yourself . So you find that when people reach out to you , it 's kind of like ` argh , ' she says , screwing up her elegant face and holding up her hands .

`` I think one of the vital things we 've failed to adhere to as a people , is not to touch a sick person , '' she says of a disease in which 20 % of transmissions happen during burials .

Invisible enemy

Just over a decade after the civil war which left more than 50,000 people dead , the country is now facing a new , invisible enemy .

Indeed , what initially appears to be a common cold , can quickly escalate into vomiting , diarrhea , and bleeding -- both internally and externally .

Transmission through bodily fluids makes football a ripe setting for infection , and last month Morocco reneged on hosting the 2015 African Nations Cup due to fears over the spread of the disease .

`` Let 's just say I was n't surprised , '' said Johansen , who is also owner of a premier league club called -- FC Johansen .

Her country 's players have reportedly suffered `` humiliating '' prejudice at away games , with opponents refusing to their shake hands and crowds chanting `` Ebola '' at matches .

Women 's work

Personally , Johansen also suffered `` the most humiliating attacks I have ever endured '' -- though rather than Ebola , she says they related to her gender .

Her coping method has been to switch off from local media and social networks .

`` I do n't see it , I do n't read it , '' she says . `` I kind of disconnect from that and just stay focused . ''

`` The FA was in total tatters before I came in , '' she says .

`` We had a bad reputation internally and externally . We had no structures . Integrity was at an all time low . There was no discipline . ''

And in a country where football and gambling go hand-in-hand , Johansen 's zero tolerance was a hard pill to swallow .

When it comes to corruption allegations at the highest levels of football 's international governing body , FIFA , Johansen is less willing to talk tough .

`` All these things that are swimming around , these controversies , is something that I really would n't like to get involved in , '' she says .

`` It 's really unfortunate , and I 'm really hoping that FIFA can rise above it much sooner than later , '' she says of the organization which this year gave Sierra Leone 's Football Association $ 750,000 plus another $ 50,000 towards social projects used for tackling Ebola .

Does that mean Johansen will be voting for FIFA president Sepp Blatter in next year 's election ?

`` Sepp Blatter has been very supportive of African nations and trying to build up our football development , '' she says , choosing her words carefully .

`` And in that respect I think , not just myself , but I most African countries will recognize that . ''

For now , her main focus is on the virus which has so far claimed over 1,400 lives across the country , and silenced its beloved football fields .

`` We 're just waiting for that day when they tell us -- boom ! -- the vaccine is out , go and take your jabs , '' she says .
