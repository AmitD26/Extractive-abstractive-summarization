The news comes amid increased focus on the National Football League and the way it handles players accused of domestic violence .

Until the team 's surprising announcement just before game time , Hardy was set to play Sunday . Ray Rice , recently released by the Baltimore Ravens , and Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson wo n't play either .

` Zero applause for the Panthers '

Authorities say Hardy in May choked his then-girlfriend , threw her around , dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her . He was sentenced in July to 18 months of probation and a 60-day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors with which he was charged .

`` Zero applause for the Panthers , '' Sports Illustrated 's Richard Deitsch tweeted . `` They ceded to press/public pressure . It was disgrace it took this long . ''

` Climate has changed '

The Panthers drew heated criticism over its handling of Hardy even while speaking out against domestic violence . Owner Jerry Richardson , while accepting a civic award last week , began to cry while speaking about domestic violence .

`` The climate has changed , '' he said . `` We really do have to get this right . Believe me . I understand that ''

Harsher penalties for domestic violence

In the wake of the Ray Rice incident , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced more severe punishment guidelines to the NFL 's personal conduct policy .

According to an August 28 memo sent by Goodell to all 32 teams , anyone in the league -- players or team personnel -- will be suspended for a minimum of six games for a first offense of domestic violence . Players are granted the opportunity to appeal . Ray Rice has until midnight Tuesday to file his appeal , if he chooses to do so .

What 's not clear is whether the NFL would apply these new guidelines retroactively , which is perhaps one explanation as to why Hardy -- sentenced a month before Goodell 's memo -- has not yet been dealt with by the NFL . Another explanation could be that the league is waiting for the legal process to play itself out . Hardy has another trial scheduled for November .

CNN reached out to the NFL Sunday but had not immediately heard back .
