-LRB- CNN -RRB- ISIS ' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an Israeli spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda .

As ISIS encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of Syria and Iraq where it imposes its brutal rule , the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing .

The deeply disturbing cases shine a light into the range of ways the militants are using children to further their aims .

In August , an Australian man who had taken his young family to join ISIS in Syria posted a photo on Twitter of his 7-year-old son using both hands to hold up a man 's severed head . `` That 's my boy , '' the father wrote alongside the photo , which was reportedly taken in ISIS ' Syrian stronghold of Raqqa .

In a video the jihadist group released in January , a boy with long hair wearing a black sweater and military fatigue pants appears to shoot two men in the back of the head . The boy then stands over one of the bodies , fires two more times , and later raises his pistol in the air .

Those examples reflect a broader effort to induct children into ISIS ' campaign of violence .

The jihadist movement has called the boys the `` cubs of the caliphate , '' a reference to the way ISIS fighters refer to one another as `` lions . ''

It has taken over schools with the purpose of indoctrinating children . Human Rights Watch has said that ISIS and other extremist groups `` have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks , including suicide bombing missions . ''

The United Nations has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training .

Another boy told CNN last year that ISIS forced his father to send him to one of its children 's camps in northern Syria when he was just 13 .

`` For 30 days we woke up and jogged , had breakfast , then learned the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet . Then we took courses on weapons , Kalashnikovs and other light military stuff , '' said the boy , who later fled to Turkey with his family .

Syrian activists say that some of the boys indoctrinated and trained at such camps are now being killed on the front lines of battle . CNN is unable to independently verify those claims .

But officials also admit they 're struggling to counter the relentless wave of propaganda churned out on social media by ISIS members and supporters .

`` There 's no question what we 're combating with ISIL 's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before , '' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told CNN last month .
