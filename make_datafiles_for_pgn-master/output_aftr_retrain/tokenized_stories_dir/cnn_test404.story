-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Outside of superheroes , young adult adaptations have become one of the few thing studios can count on .

That sounds de rigueur now , but in the '90s the book 's popularity was only eclipsed by its reputation among some as too disturbing for the classroom . Lowry 's story follows a 12-year-old named Jonas who is raised in what he believes is a utopia , a place where conformity is n't an option and being different can cost you your life . The residents ' world is void of color and strong emotion , but they also do n't suffer from war or pain , and have no memories to remind them of what they 're missing .

Grownups : Do n't be ashamed of your YA habit

When Jonas is elected to become the Receiver of Memory , he learns from The Giver -- the wizened , silver-haired gentleman seen gazing out from the book cover -- all that 's amiss in his world .

`` He was passionate about the book , '' Lowry said at the movie 's August 11 premiere in New York . `` What sold me on it was his passion . I knew he would n't let the themes and ideas of the books be lost . ''

A brief history of young adult literature

`` Originally I wanted to direct my father in the movie , and he is no longer with us , '' Bridges said of his dad , who died in 1998 .

With Bridges installed as The Giver , the movie tapped Australian actor Brenton Thwaites to play Jonas , who in the movie is already a teenager rather than on the cusp of becoming one .

Jonas ' older age is one of the tweaks the movie adaptation made to accommodate the story for the screen . For critics , the movie has n't exactly lived up to the book , but for Lowry the movie 's right on time .

`` If they had made the movie 20 years ago , or even 18 years ago when they first optioned it , many things could n't have happened , '' Lowry said . `` Jeff Bridges was n't old enough to play the title role . Some of the kids in the movie were n't even born and the technology was n't as good . They made a better movie because they waited . ''
