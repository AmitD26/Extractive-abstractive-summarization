Luckily , Katie -- a giraffe at the Dallas Zoo -- is a champ .

In an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by Animal Planet , Katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby -LRB- about 6 feet tall -RRB- early Friday evening .

The baby joins a sister , 4-year-old calf Jamie .

It was n't immediately known how many people online saw Katie go into labor and give birth . But the giraffe definitely did have watchers in the form of fellow giraffes who saw the scene unfold from an abutting barn , one of them being Katie 's BFF Jade .

The fact that the spunky Katie held up so well under the spotlight is n't a total shocker . The zoo describes her as the `` diva '' among a herd of 12 giraffes at the zoo who loves to `` toss her head around '' when she does n't like something .

As Animal Planet noted , `` She 's one of the only giraffes at the Dallas Zoo who can stick her long tongue out on cue . ''

CNN 's Justin Lear contributed to this report .
