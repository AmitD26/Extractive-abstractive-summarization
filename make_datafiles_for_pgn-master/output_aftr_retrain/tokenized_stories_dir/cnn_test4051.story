-LRB- CNN -RRB- It 's the simplest possible assignment , but it always teaches a huge lesson . Every year , Denver teacher Kyle Schwartz passes out Post-it notes to her third grade students and asks them to complete the sentence , `` I wish my teacher knew ... ''

Many of the students she teaches at Doull Elementary just wish they had something in common with her , that she knew soccer or video games .

But sometimes , their wishes bring tears to her eyes , and offer a glimpse of painful struggles in their young lives .

And other who has big hopes for the future : `` I want to go to college . ''

The assignment sprang from the kinds of conversations teachers have all the time , Schwartz said : `` What do our students need ? How can we best serve them ? ''

They sometimes reveal what kids are most worried about right now , like the child whose mother was sick , or another who had just experienced bullying .

One student just wants more attention from the teacher .

Occasionally , students want to reassure their teachers that that they 're doing a great job .

There 's a lot for teachers to learn , too : `` They are KIDS who deal with a lot as they grow up , '' one educator posted on Twitter .

Schwartz said she 's learned not to assume what her students wish . Although most of the students at her school live in poverty , not every message is about a material need .

There 's no pressure to share something they 're not ready to talk about , she said , and `` they 're acutely aware of their own needs . ''

So far , most have been fulfilled .
