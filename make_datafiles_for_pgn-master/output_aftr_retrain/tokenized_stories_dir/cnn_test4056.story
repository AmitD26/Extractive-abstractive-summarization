-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jena Johnson 's profession is not one that people go to college for . It 's also not work that gets easier with time .

Her definition of `` good '' goes like this : a death in which a person 's wishes for the end of his or her life are respected and carriecd out . No matter what those wishes are .

She found herself in this role because of what she perceives as a great need in America to make discussions about death more a part of life . Because no one likes to talk about this stuff .

From 9 to 5 , in the Portland , Oregon , offices of the end-of-life advocacy group Compassion & Choices , Johnson and her staff field up to 100 calls a day . The number of those calls has swollen after the death last week of Brittany Maynard , who had terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life with a fatal dose of barbiturates at age 29 .

`` I did not want this nightmare scenario for my family , so I started researching death with dignity . ''

Compassion & Choices partnered with Maynard and issued a statement saying that she `` died as she intended -- peacefully in her bedroom , in the arms of her loved ones . ''

Others choose not to die like that . And that 's OK with Johnson .

She 's had people tell her that they have the best benefits in the world , and they want to keep trying everything medically possible until the very end .

She became more keenly aware of how tough things can get when her mother was dying of lung cancer in 1990 .

`` We took our cue from her , '' Johnson says . `` She had very pronounced ideas of how she wanted to go . ''

Much of it was generational . Johnson 's mother was from an era when people rarely listened to anything but doctor 's orders .

She entered a hospice and in the end , she suffered a great deal .

Johnson says that had she known then what she knows now , she might have brought up other options for her mother .

`` Most people say , ` I 'm not afraid to die . I am afraid to suffer , ' '' she says . `` Or they say , ` I 've had a good life but I do n't want my illness to compromise my loved one 's memories . ' It 's very well thought out for these people . ''

Do you have an advance directive ? That 's a legal document that outlines a person 's wishes at the end of life .

`` No one eats , '' said the client , `` until you 've read this . ''

Johnson first assesses a client 's situation -- mobility , support system , treatment -- and then continues with tough questions .

Are your family members supportive of your wishes ?

Recently , the counselor discovered that the family had put her client on a feeding tube , even though an advanced directive underscored : `` No feeding tube . ''

`` It was a difficult conversation but a necessary one , '' Johnson says . `` They all knew what the answer was but it was so hard in their hearts . ''

Another time , a client called Johnson to say her doctor had recommended radiation .

`` Tell me again how old you are , '' Johnson said .

`` Wait . You are 97 and the doctor told you to go through this ? ''

That 's when she advised her client of other options , though she never tells anyone what they ought to do .

Brittany Maynard moved with her husband to Portland because Oregon is one of five states that recognize aid in dying as lawful medical practice . Among the 40 other states that are addressing `` assisted suicide , '' 38 criminalize it .

Polls show that most Americans support Maynard 's decision and favor a full consideration of end-of-life options .

About six in 10 Americans believe people suffering a great deal of pain with no hope of getting better have a moral right to end their lives , according to Pew . That 's up from 55 % in 1990 .

And that , too , can be a good death .
