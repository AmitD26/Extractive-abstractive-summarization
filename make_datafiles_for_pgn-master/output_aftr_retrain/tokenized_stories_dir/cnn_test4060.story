LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jamiel Shaw was just three doors from his house on March 2 . His father told the 17-year-old high school football star to be home before dark . That is exactly what he was trying to do when , just before dusk , gunshots rang out .

Gang members pulled up in a car and asked Shaw if he was in a gang . Shaw did n't have time to tell them `` no . '' He was mowed down before he could answer , police say .

His son was wearing the same shirt his dad had pressed for him that morning . `` He was laying on the ground and his face was so peaceful . I knew he was dead . ''

`` For three hours , I was just completely blacked out walking . ''

More than 7,500 miles away , Army Sgt. Anita Shaw was serving her second tour in Iraq . Her commanding officer called her into his office and told her to sit down next to the chaplain . He then informed her that her son had been killed on the streets of Los Angeles .

`` I freaked out , '' she said . `` I wanted to run out of the room . I was screaming and kicking . I was shouting , ` No . ' ''

Anita Shaw is now back in Los Angeles to bury her son .

Police announced Tuesday that an arrest had been made in the shooting . Pedro Espinoza , a 19-year-old member of the Hispanic 18th Street Gang , was charged in the killing and could face the death penalty if convicted , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Office said . Espinoza is scheduled to be arraigned March 25 .

Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton Tuesday called on the community to help police locate a second suspect who was with Espinoza at the time of the shooting .

Hundreds of family members and friends gathered Tuesday at West Los Angeles Cathedral to remember Shaw , a standout running back and sprinter at Los Angeles High School who had good grades and stayed out of trouble despite his rough neighborhood . Among the schools recruiting him was Stanford University . Watch as family , friends remember Shaw ''

`` I think what is particularly unnerving for all of us is just the random nature of these shootings , '' Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said last week .

Bratton and Deputy Chief Kenneth Garner met with community members from the South Side of Los Angeles over the weekend to try to calm tensions between black and Hispanic communities . Among those in attendance were Shaw 's parents and his younger brother .

Bratton acknowledged some neighborhoods are rife with underlying racial tensions that have `` taken too many young lives . '' He said he is in the process of hiring 1,000 new police officers to help combat inner city gang violence . Watch Bratton describe an `` always underlying tension '' ''

`` None of it is right , '' said Garner . `` We ca n't get so incensed that we lose focus that it 's going on on both sides . ''

`` Loved you lots babyboi ! Still do ! I know many , many , many people who are missing you right NOW !!! '' wrote Christina Stewart on the Facebook wall .

Another person , Harley Lally , wrote , `` Football will never be the same without you . I miss you every Sunday , and every time I step on that field . ''

The father and son years ago had made a pact : Keep focused , stay away from drugs and gangs , and get into college on an athletic scholarship . In return , the dad promised to do everything for his son , nicknamed `` Jas , '' to make that happen .

Shaw 's mother , the Army sergeant , compares the gang members who killed her son to those she 's fighting against in Iraq . `` To me , they 're terrorists . '' E-mail to a friend
