-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- More than 100 countries attending a conference in Dublin , Ireland formally adopted a treaty Friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict .

Countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday .

Though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs , including the United States , Russia , China and Israel , were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord , organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance .

The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , he said .

Cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the International Committee of the Red Cross calls a `` persistent humanitarian problem . ''

Most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not . Estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , the Red Cross says .

That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians .

Last week , Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull called it `` an absolute moral obligation '' to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle .

`` We think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions ... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use , '' Mull said . `` The United States relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy . ''

During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006 , the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the International Committee of the Red Cross .

More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended .

In more than 20 countries , according to the ICRC , cluster bombs have created lasting `` no-go '' areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields .

Still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape . A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles .
