We put them in our cocktails , but how well do we know them ?

Here 's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples :

Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin , he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica , including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti .

He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo , Panama .

He later looted and burned Panama City , but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671 .

Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics , Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica . Mental Floss : 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame

2 . Johnnie Walker

When his father died in 1819 , Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds , which the trustees invested in a grocery store .

Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky , Walker 's Kilmarnock Whisky .

Johnnie 's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men , though .

Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky , and came up with `` Old Highland Whisky , '' which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label .

3 . Jack Daniel

He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children .

By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg , Tennessee .

The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul .

4 . Jose Cuervo

In 1758 , Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico .

Jose used his agave plants to make mescal , a popular Mexican liquor . In 1795 , King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo 's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo .

Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila , so they built a larger factory on the existing land .

The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880 , and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo .

5 . Jim Beam

Jim Beam , the namesake of the world 's best-selling bourbon whiskey , did n't actually start the distillery that now bears his name .

In those days , the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of `` Old Tub . ''

Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business , Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down .

6 . Tanqueray

When he was a young boy , Charles Tanqueray 's path through life seemed pretty clear . He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen , so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself .

By 1847 , he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire , where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic .

7 . Campari

When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture , his concoction had over 60 ingredients .

The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari 's recipe , though , which includes quinine , orange peel , rhubarb , and countless other flavorings .
