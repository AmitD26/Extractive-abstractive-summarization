LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British TV channels could advertise abortion services for the first time under new advertising rules proposed Thursday by an ad industry group .

The new proposals will also allow condoms to be advertised more widely on television .

If an organization does not offer information about abortion , it would have to make that clear in the ad , BCAP spokeswoman Lynsay Taffe said .

There would be no restrictions on when such ads could air on British television , she said , but programmers would have to keep the sensitive topic in mind and not schedule the ads around religious programs , for example .

The proposal is among a number of updates to current advertising standards that the Committee for Advertising Practice and BCAP , its broadcasting arm , published Thursday after an 18-month review .

The public now has until June 19 to comment on the proposals before they come into force , likely in 2010 , the committee said .

New rules would relax the restrictions on advertising condoms , with the only requirement that they not be shown around programs intended for children younger than 10 .

Gould reported a survey that showed young people believed TV was one of the most effective ways of encouraging them to use condoms .

`` The presence of condom advertisements on television continues to be a subject of complaint to the -LRB- Advertising Standards Authority -RRB- , but numbers are very low , '' the committee said . `` Nevertheless , BCAP has to balance public sensitivities against a public health problem that is clearly urgent .
