JERUSALEM -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The international group Human Rights Watch is accusing Israel of firing weapons containing white phosphorus into Gaza . The group demands that the alleged practice cease .

Israel is declining to say whether bursts like this over Gaza involve white phosphorus .

The group 's researchers in Israel `` observed multiple air-bursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over what appeared to be the Gaza City/Jabaliya area '' on Friday and Saturday , the organization said on its Web site .

`` Israel appeared to be using white phosphorus as an ` obscurant ' -LSB- a chemical used to hide military operations -RSB- , a permissible use in principle '' under the laws of war , the HRW posting said .

Last week , an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN : `` I can tell you with certainty that white phosphorus is absolutely not being used . ''

Now , however , Israeli officials have a different response to questions about the possible use of phosphorus : `` Any munitions that Israel is using are in accordance with international law . Israel does not specify the types of munitions or the types of operations it is conducting . ''

Since January 3 , when Israel began its ground offensive in Gaza , news reports have circulated about the possible use of white phosphorus by the IDF .

Though most severely burned patients have been sent to Egypt , the ongoing fighting has made it impossible to evacuate all of them , including one man with deep burns over 47 percent of his body , the doctor said .

It 's intended to provide illumination or to create a smokescreen in battle . Under an international protocol ratified by Israel in 1995 , the use of such incendiary weapons is allowed when `` not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons . ''

There is no prohibition per se against white phosphorus in conflict . But the timing and location of its use are restricted .

A house north of Gaza City was hit Sunday by something that observers contend may have been white phosphorus .

Those characteristics match the properties of white phosphorus , which ignites on contact with air .
