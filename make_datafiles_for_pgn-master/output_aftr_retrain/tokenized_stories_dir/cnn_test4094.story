-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday insisted that his country 's nuclear arsenal is `` definitely safe , '' despite growing concerns about recent gains by the Taliban along the country 's border with Afghanistan .

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari insists his country 's nuclear arsenal is `` definitely safe '' from militants .

In an interview with CNN 's Wolf Blitzer , Zardari responded to the fact that the United States does n't know the locations of all of Pakistan 's nuclear sites . He also addressed the Obama administrations concern over whether the weapons are vulnerable to Taliban fighters who are gaining control of some border regions .

`` They ca n't take over , '' Zardari said , referring to militants . `` We have a 700,000 -LRB- person -RRB- army -- how could they take over ? ''

For the last two weeks , Pakistani troops have been battling Taliban fighters in Buner and Lower Dir , two districts bordering the Swat Valley -- a broad Taliban stronghold in Pakistan . Army generals claim to have killed scores of militants .

Last week , U.S. President Barack Obama said Pakistan 's government appears to be `` very fragile '' and argued that the United States has `` huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable '' and does n't end up a `` nuclear-armed militant state . ''

Asked whether the U.S. strategy bothered him , Zardari said , `` Let 's agree to disagree . ... We 're still in dialogue . ''

Zardari also denied speculation by some Congressional lawmakers that his country has used most of the $ 10 billion given by the United States to strengthen its arsenal against a threat from nuclear rival India -- as opposed to going after the ongoing militant threat .

`` They 've given $ 10 billion in 10 years , a billion nearly a year for the war effort in -- against the Taliban , and the war that is going on , '' he said .

Zardari also addressed his government 's apparent resistance to significant U.S. involvement on Pakistani soil . Recently , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates observed , `` There has been a reluctance on their part up to now . They do n't like the idea of a significant American military footprint inside Pakistan . I understand that . And -- but we are willing to do pretty much whatever we can to help the Pakistanis in this situation . ''

Zardari called Pakistan 's relationship `` pretty strong '' and said , `` We are asking . We 've been asking for a lot of help , and it has been in the pipeline for a long time . ''
