WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations .

The presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks .

A coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS 's Judy Woodruff .

Asked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 , are `` fading '' in the minds of many Americans , McCain said :

`` I would have called them to serve , '' said McCain . The GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want `` change '' in federal government .

McCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps , saying they and similar organizations do n't receive `` sufficient recognition '' from Washington . But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement . Asked about compensation for service McCain said :

`` I 'd be glad to reward -LSB- volunteers -RSB- them as much as possible . But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons , but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself . ... Finding new ways to serve . That 's what this next few years should be all about . ''

McCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin 's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama 's community service in Illinois .

McCain also said that politics is `` tough business , '' and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America .

Obama said his views do n't necessarily differ from McCain 's on national service .

Obama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service .

`` One of my central platforms in this campaign is we 're going to provide a $ 4,000 tuition credit every student , every year , but in exchange for giving something back . And so , young people of modest means , who are interested in going to college , this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time , pay for their college education . I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now . ''

`` The fact is that we have to have government . When a hurricane strikes , as it did with Katrina , we have to have a FEMA that works , which by the way , means that we should be encouraging young people , the best and the brightest , to get involved as civil servants , to pursue careers of public service so we 've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job . '' Watch Obama talk about service ''

`` Now , that does not crowd out the Red Cross . That does n't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there . What it means is that each area has a role to play . ''

The forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service . Nearly 500 leaders from business , foundations , universities and politics are meeting to `` celebrate the power and potential of citizen service '' and lay out a plan to address `` America 's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service , '' according to the organizers ' Web site .

Each presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways . McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a `` cause greater than oneself . ''

Obama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college . In a speech in December , the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president . `` This will be the cause of my presidency , '' he said .

McCain 's campaign recently attacked Obama for `` lipstick '' remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday .

`` John McCain says he 's about change too , and so I guess his whole angle is , ` Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy , health care policy , tax policy , education policy , foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we 're really going to shake things up in Washington , ' '' he said .

Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in `` lies '' and `` swift boat politics . ''

The phrase `` swift boat '' comes from the 2004 presidential election , when the group `` Swift Boat Veterans for Truth '' launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false .

The two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials .

`` Hundreds , if not thousands , of people at work in that building , when that fateful moment occurred , could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom , '' McCain said . `` They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph .

Meanwhile , a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting .

Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed , 62 percent , believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism , compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival , Obama , would be better on the issue .

Opinion Research Corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from September 5-7 for the poll .
