The Air Transport Association of American is projecting a 10 percent decrease in the number of air passengers flying over a 12-day period around the holiday , but airline capacity cuts prompted by record-high fuel prices over the summer mean planes will remain crowded .

Travel in the skies appeared to be off to a good start Wednesday afternoon . Only a few major airports were experiencing delays by mid-afternoon , and most delays were well under an hour .

`` You 'll see plenty of people on airplanes that are full , '' ATA spokesman David Castelveter said .

He urges air travelers to arrive at the airport early , be prepared to go through security checkpoints and travel light , as space in overhead compartments and underneath seats will be limited . iReport : Share your travel experiences

Ball State University student Katie Dorsey , 21 , planned to fly out of Indianapolis ' new airport for the first time . She usually makes the trip to Orlando , Florida , to visit her father a couple times a year .

`` I know they have more TSA checkpoint lanes , so it should be faster getting through security , but I 'm not sure as far as lines , '' Dorsey said of the new airport . `` I 'm going to try to get there at least two hours before my flight this time . ''

Last week the TSA expanded its family lane program to every security checkpoint . Families , individuals who are unfamiliar with security procedures , travelers with special needs and those carrying medically necessary liquids in amounts exceeding the TSA 's allowances can use these lanes to get through security at their own pace .

Dorsey planned to check a bag on her AirTran flight because her travel dates dodge the carrier 's fee for a first checked bag , going into effect December 5 . Many major carriers have instituted fees on passengers ' first checked bags , with higher fees for additional bags .

In addition to mounting airline fees , Thanksgiving holiday travelers are paying on average 8 percent more for tickets this year , according to AAA 's Leisure Travel Index .

He looked for tickets online four or five times a week for several months , but the lowest fare he could find was $ 348 per ticket . Wible said he drives to Indiana when he has time to make the 16 1/2 - hour trip .

Driving is n't an option for the long weekend , he said , even with average gas prices dipping below $ 1.90 a gallon .

Wible wo n't be among the 33.2 million Americans AAA expects to travel by car this year . The projected number of holiday drivers is down 1.2 percent from last year 's 33.6 million drivers .

AAA expects to assist five million stranded motorists during the holiday season . AAA 's Hyde urges motorists to get their vehicles checked out before hitting the road .

`` Even though people might be trying to tighten their purse strings right now , it 's not the time to let your maintenance lapse on your car , especially if you live in a cold-weather environment , '' Hyde said .

`` Every little bit helps , no question about that , '' said the ATA 's Castelveter . `` When we run into congestion in the airspace , having those extra lanes is a benefit . It 's not a solution to delays . It 's one of a number of solutions to reducing delays . ''
