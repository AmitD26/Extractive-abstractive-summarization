BAYAMON , Puerto Rico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama took their campaigns to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico on Saturday in an effort to woo voters before the June 1 primary .

There are 55 Democratic delegates up for grabs , though voters can not take part in the general election in November .

`` It 's fitting to be here today , not just because Memorial Day is around the corner but because Puerto Ricans are such an important part of the United States military . On this island and in Puerto Rican neighborhoods across America , you can go into almost any home and find a veteran living there or a photograph of a loved one in uniform hanging on the wall , '' he said .

Later Saturday , Obama marched along a street in San Juan , shaking hands with supporters as he walked in front of a banner that said `` Puerto Rico Con Obama . ''

Obama remarked to the crowd , `` I will never forget the support and the friendship that I 've seen here in Puerto Rico . ... I am absolutely confident that if that we keep on working hard , there 's no reason why we ca n't win here in Puerto Rico , and if we win Puerto Rico , we will win the nomination . ''

Clinton hosted a `` Solutions for Puerto Rico 's Families '' town hall meeting in Aguadilla on Saturday .

Before a crowd of a few hundred Puerto Ricans in a muggy high school gym , Clinton pledged to make it a `` personal priority '' to resolve the statehood issue before the end of her first term .

Clinton made each of those promises in English , abandoning a translator early on , despite the growing din among distracted audience members who could n't understand the full content of her stump speech .

She recalled a visit she made to the island in 1998 on behalf of her husband to inspect damage from Hurricane Georges .

She also reminded the audience that she represents more than one million Puerto Ricans in New York ; this week in Florida , she jokingly referred to herself as `` the senator from Puerto Rico . ''

Clinton has done well among Hispanic voters in this year 's primaries , and she is expected to have similar success in Puerto Rico .

On Thursday , Clinton sent daughter Chelsea to campaign in Puerto Rico , a sign that she is refusing to give up the race despite the delegate math in favor of her rival .

However , Obama does not have enough delegates to secure the nomination outright . He has 1,962 delegates , including superdelegates , short of the 2,026 needed to secure the nomination , according to CNN estimates .

Obama was in Florida on Friday courting the Cuban vote , a bloc that has tended to vote Republican in past elections .

He told Florida 's Cuban-American community Friday that his Cuba policy would be based on liberty and freedom for the island nation 's people . Watch more of Obama 's comments ''

`` My policy toward Cuba will be guided by one word : ` libertad , ' '' he said , using the Spanish word for liberty at an event celebrating Cuban Independence Day in Miami , Florida .
