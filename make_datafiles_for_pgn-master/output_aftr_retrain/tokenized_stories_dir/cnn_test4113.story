-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Oguchi Onyewu , who made his AC Milan debut in a 2-1 friendly defeat to Mexico 's Club America , is the first player from the United States to be signed by the Serie A giants and is a rising talent in world football .

The `` Rossoneri '' have put their faith in a 27-year-old defender , who has become a lynchpin of his national team in recent times -- but how did the stopper climb the ladder of success ?

The imposing Onweyu , who stands 1.93 meters tall and tips the scales at 95 kilograms , was born in Washington D.C. , one of a family of five to Nigerian-born parents .

While at high school in Maryland , he showed immediate promise and was selected for a soccer academy run by International Management Group -LRB- IMG -RRB- .

Because of his strong performances with Standard , Onyewu was constantly linked with a number of leading European clubs , but finally had his chance when sent out on loan to Newcastle United in the English Premier League .

Joining for the back end of the 2006-07 season , he formed an uncertain partnership with Titus Bramble in the center of defense , which , combined with the arrival of new manager Sam Allardyce , was to cost him his place .

Newcastle decided not to make his loan move permanent and Onyewu returned to Standard to help them win successive Belgian league titles .

The Times of London reported on June 2 that Onyewu had taken legal action in a Brussels court over the alleged slur , hoping it will help eradicate such incidents in the future .

His lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont said Onyewu felt compelled to take it further .

`` It is not a question whether Van Damme is racist . The issue is that these slurs are still used on the pitch , and are being used because they know it hurts . ''

Onyewu made his debut for the U.S. national team in 2004 and played all three games for the side before their exit from the 2006 World Cup .

The U.S. went on to lose the final 3-2 to Brazil , but Onyewu had again sparked renewed interest , including Milan , who had tracked him since 2004 .

Former national captain Alexi Lalas played for Padova in the 1990s .
