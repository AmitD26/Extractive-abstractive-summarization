Haylee Donathan was found with her mother and her mother 's boyfriend , fugitive sex offender Robbie Potter .

Haylee Donathan , her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch , a retreat in Valley Center , near San Diego , said Peter Elliott , United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio .

Potter is a registered sex offender , officials said . He was being sought by the U.S. Marshal 's Service .

Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children 's protective services agency in the San Diego County area , Elliott said . She was doing well but may have chicken pox , he added .

The journey west took them more than two thousand miles from Mansfield , the north-Central Ohio city where the girl and her mother live .

Watson 's hair was a bit darker and Potter also changed his appearance slightly .

But a tip from members of the ranch could have lead to the raid and arrest , a ranchmember told CNN .

Elliott also praised intense national news coverage from programs such as HLN 's Nancy Grace and Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell , as well as local media and Clear Channel , which put up missing child billboards across the country .

When she is returned to Ohio , Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother , Elliott said . The U.S. Marshals Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force had offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of 27-year-old Potter .

Potter was wanted on a state warrant for parole violation and a federal warrant for probation violation . He is a convicted tier three sex offender , according to the U.S. Marshals Service , a unit of the Justice Department .

Adding to concerns , Watson 's roommate , Samantha Covert , said last week in an interview on Nancy Grace that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared . Covert said Watson carried a basket of clothing , pillows and blankets .

In addition to other charges , he said Potter may be prosecuted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act , a federal sex offender registration and self-reporting law that carries a multi-year felony sentence if violated .

On its Web site , the Morning Star Ranch describes itself as `` a community of growers of organic , pesticide-free avocados , grapefruit , persimmons , nuts , and other produce . ''

Elliot said he believed it is a rehab facility and also called it a Christian retreat .
