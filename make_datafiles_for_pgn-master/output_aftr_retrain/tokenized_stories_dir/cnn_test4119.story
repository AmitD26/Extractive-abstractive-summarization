-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of people attending Comic-Con in San Diego , California , will transform into zombies on Thursday .

Comic-Con is an annual gathering of 125,000 people whose interests include comic book and science fiction film and TV , anime , toys and video games . Major movie studios and TV networks use the convention to launch their latest productions .

Fleischer , along with screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick , consulted a disease expert `` to get to the bottom of what the modern pandemic would be , '' he said .

`` When swine flu happened , it was after we finished shooting , but it just really reminded me of how these things can spread so quickly and a whole population can be devastated , '' he said .

While about 500 extras were hired to be zombies in Fleischer 's movie , even more Comic-Con participants could take part in Thursday 's zombie walk . Sony has hired professional makeup artists to get them ready .

Fleischer said those portraying a modern zombie should think like `` a rabid dog . ''

Do n't lumber along like Frankenstein 's monster , but move with `` a real furious anger and intensity '' and `` a lot of grunting and snarling and growling , '' he said . `` Zombies do n't talk . ''

Hunger is a modern zombie 's chief motivation , he said : `` I think that they 're definitely cannibalistic . They want to eat people . ''

`` It 's as if you were at the mall and some zombies attacked and everyone there got turned into a zombie , '' he said . `` They 'd be wearing the same clothes that they had before . They 'd be dressed in the same way . ''

Fleischer developed a list of 150 types of zombies for his film , including construction workers , moms , a punk rocker and preppie zombies .

`` They 're just people who got infected , like a modern pandemic , '' he said .

`` Zombieland '' -- which hits theaters October 9 -- brings out the humor in killing zombies , which is Harrelson 's specialty .

`` They 're not easy to kill , so sometimes you 've got to get them more than once , '' Fleischer said . `` You 've got to make sure you get them because they 'll keep coming if you do n't . ''

Harrelson blamed post-traumatic stress from filming for his scuffle with a TMZ photographer at an airport the day after shooting wrapped in Georgia in April .

`` With my daughter at the airport I was startled by a paparazzo who I quite understandably mistook for a zombie , '' Harrelson said .
