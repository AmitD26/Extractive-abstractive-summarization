The man drove the bus for less than a mile before a student confronted him and the bus crashed into a wall off the road , according to police .

The incident started Thursday afternoon when the bus stopped to let students out , said Atlanta police officer James Polite .

Some students were taken to area hospitals . Their conditions were n't available Thursday night .

Chiquita Rogers told CNN affiliate WXIA that the man had tried to hit some of the students , including her 16-year-old , Donte .

`` He pushed my son , and that 's when my son hit him . I guess everybody started swinging , and everybody just started out the back door , jumping . I 'm just grateful that my son is still alive , because it could have been worse . ''

Onlooker Corey Turner told WXIA , `` Children were jumping out the emergency door ... jumping off the bus . ... They were saying , ` Help , help , help ! ... Somebody hijacked the bus . ' ''
