Al-Shabaab militants ride through Mogadishu , Somalia , after a religious gathering in September .

The U.S. government , concerned about the challenges in delivering assistance in a country wracked by civil war , says allegations that Al-Shabaab is stopping aid from reaching the people are under review .

Although one U.S. government source said aid continues to flow to Somalia and has n't been suspended , another said aid might not reach `` some parts of the country '' because of Al-Shabaab , the al Qaeda-linked terror group that is trying to overthrow the government .

Located in the Horn of Africa , Somalia has long been a lawless , war-ravaged nation . The United Nations says that nearly half the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance , and one in five children are acutely malnourished .

Kiki Gbeho , head of office for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Somalia , said the United States is reviewing whether its aid helps fund Al-Shabaab .

The U.N. office , in a report issued in September , said the U.S. delay in reaching a decision on humanitarian funding `` is already impacting on many agencies and their programmes . ''

`` According to humanitarian principles , we have to serve people and need to deal with those in charge , '' Gbeho said .

Food supplies could run out for millions of Somalis in the next few weeks , according to the United Nations . The U.S. government is traditionally the biggest donor for food assistance .

The issue of breakdowns in humanitarian aid in Somalia has long concerned the United States . A senior administration official and an administration official spoke about the issue on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly .

The administration official said that the aid has never stopped , adding that food bound for the World Food Program in Somalia is on a vessel and should arrive in a few weeks .
