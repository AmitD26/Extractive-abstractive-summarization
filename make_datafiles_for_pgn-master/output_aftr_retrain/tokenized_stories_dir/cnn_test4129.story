LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Flannery O'Connor did not expect to become the subject of a biography . She thought the narrow borders of her life -- lived `` between the house and the chicken yard '' -- would n't give a writer much to work with .

Author Flannery O'Connor -LRB- here with two of her peacocks -RRB- remains a subject of fascination for many .

That she suffered from lupus and died before the age of 40 is well-known to fans of O'Connor . But Gooch uncovers much that even ardent followers of the author will find revealing , including details of her college career as a cartoonist , and her time in Iowa City at the Iowa Writers ' Workshop .

The book manages to synthesize what seems difficult to reconcile : how such a chaste , religious person could produce stories that are bitingly funny and filled with shocking violence . Watch O'Connor 's fascinating story ''

Gooch spoke with CNN about his experience researching the biography . What follows is an edited version of the interview .

CNN : When did you first discover Flannery O'Connor ?

CNN : She was n't always known as Flannery O'Connor .

-LSB- Near the end of her life -RSB- she was editing her final stories and hiding them under the pillow in the hospital from the doctors so that she could go on . She was still working on her last story after she had last rites . ... All of that is a sort of -LSB- a -RSB- level of commitment that is startling and unmatched .

Gooch : Her style goes under these names , like grotesque or gothic , but she was really crossing these two wires of humor and almost this kind of dark theological writing that had never been put together before . ...

-LSB- In `` A Good Man is Hard to Find '' -RSB- a family on vacation ... meets someone named the Misfit , this ex-con in the woods . ... And he winds up shooting the entire family while spouting existentialist , nihilist philosophy .

And in that story , there 's always a point where you keep laughing past this line , and suddenly someone 's being shot and you 're laughing and then -LSB- readers -RSB- get very uncomfortable . They ca n't tell whether this is supposed to be funny or not , and I think that O'Connor definitely works in that territory , where you ca n't tell if she 's being funny or tragic and serious .

CNN : The titles of her stories and novels are so wonderful -- `` A Good Man Is Hard to Find , '' `` Everything That Rises Must Converge , '' `` The Life You Save May Be Your Own , '' `` The Violent Bear It Away . ''

You see in a way how sophisticated she was in her approach to her writing . I think sometimes when people read the stories , they confuse O'Connor with the character in her story , and they think she is some Grandma-Moses-crazy-folk-artist , but actually she was an incredibly educated artist who had read everything , including a lot of theology . ... The titles ... are attracting and punchy , but you also see that she 's working kind of consciously with these reverberating references .

CNN : What do you make of her fascination with birds ?

So , I think it really stood in a way for this kind of transfiguration that would take place for her spiritually but also in the beauty of her writing . ... She definitely made an effort to make the peacock her own personal logo .

Gooch : She seems to be ever more popular . When she died she was considered almost a minor writer . Her second volume of stories had n't even come out ; her `` Collected Stories '' was published in the early 1970s and got a posthumous National Book Award .

And -LSB- she -RSB- increasingly shows up in funny pop culture ways . I think in the last episode of `` Lost '' the character was reading `` Everything That Rises Must Converge '' in the last scene . So , counterintuitively , she 's only growing in importance .

CNN : It 's amazing that she had a literary career at all , given how debilitating her illness was .

Gooch : What became inspiring to me , unexpectedly , writing this book -LSB- was how she dealt -RSB- with her illness , and that she finally was nobody 's victim . ... Everything we think of as a Flannery O'Connor story came after she had been diagnosed as having lupus and settled in to life in the South . You get the sense that this was almost a magical thinking , where she thought that writing these stories was keeping her alive .
