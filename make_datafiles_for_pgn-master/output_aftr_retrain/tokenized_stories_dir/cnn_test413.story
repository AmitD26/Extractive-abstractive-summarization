-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Accolades for the good Samaritan who rescued an abducted girl continued to roll in Thursday as California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called Victor Perez a `` true action hero . ''

The city of Fresno proclaimed the day `` Victor Perez Day '' and sponsored the visit from Schwarzenegger , who said the abduction of the girl , 8 , `` had a great and heroic end . ''

Early Tuesday , Perez , 29 , chased after a vehicle carrying the girl , who had been sexually assaulted hours earlier .

The governor called for an employer to hire him .

Perez said he is happy the girl and mother are back together .

Around 6:45 a.m. Tuesday , Perez was outside his house talking with his cousin about the abduction when they saw a vehicle matching the suspect vehicle 's description : an older-model , reddish-brown Chevrolet with a white stripe on the side .

That 's when he sprang into action . He jumped into his 1988 white Ford pickup and followed the vehicle , cutting in four times before he eventually forced it to a stop .

The chase had taken him about a mile from his house and into another neighborhood . He yelled for residents to get the girl a blanket .

About 40 minutes later , police caught up with the truck , then parked , and arrested Gregorio Gonzalez , 24 , of Fresno . Charges against him will include kidnapping , false imprisonment and sexual assault , Police Chief Jerry Dyer said . The suspect was not armed .
