When Obama described the attacks `` and he described how the whole world was with us , it emotionally took me right back to that moment , '' Wolf said . `` It was all I could do to keep from totally losing it . ''

It 's been eight years since the attacks of September 11 killed 2,976 people . A lot of memories have faded , Wolf said , but he still thinks of the little things : `` holding her hand , falling asleep next to her , waking up next to her , the companionship , the partnership . ''

`` She was great . ''

Those words brought it all home : the memories of his wife with the beautiful smile and short-cropped red hair . `` I was biting my lip , '' he said .

That said , Wolf is critical of the president 's strategy , mostly his announcement to begin withdrawing the American contingent in July 2011 .

`` That is a tactical and strategic mistake , '' he said . `` If you 're playing chess , do you tell your opponent your next move ?

`` To broadcast that for the sake of politics , to me , that is very wrong . ''

And so he was divided : pleased about the renewed commitment to the Afghanistan war but upset by the planned pullout date .

Veteran New York firefighter Lee Ielpi lost his son , Jonathan , a fellow firefighter , on September 11 .

`` I support President Obama 's decision to send more troops to Afghanistan and the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban , '' he said .

The office of Joe Daniels overlooks ground zero , an every-day reminder of what happened on September 11 , 2001 . He was standing outside the Twin Towers when they were hit . Daniels is now the president of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum , charged with the monumental task of building a living tribute to those who perished that day .

`` This is not a war of choice , '' Wolf said . `` This is a war of necessity . ''

He hopes the American people understand that . It 's why he can hardly speak when he sees U.S. soldiers in uniform . `` I am so grateful of the fact that they will lay their lives on the line for us , '' he said .

For military families who will soon send their loved ones off to Afghanistan , Wolf said , `` Thank you . It 's all you can say . Thank you for making the decision to do it . Thank you for loving your country . ''

`` I just ask every person out there if it was your wife who went to work one day and never came home , '' he said , `` would you do anything to make sure it does n't happen again ? ''
