Editor 's note : John Rice is founder and CEO of Management Leadership for Tomorrow -LRB- MLT -RRB- , a New York-based national nonprofit organization seeking to develop `` the next generation of African American , Hispanic and Native American leaders in major corporations , nonprofit organizations and entrepreneurial ventures . ''

John Rice says there 's a tremendous need for new leaders in the nonprofit world .

He recently introduced the Social Innovation Fund , intended to help increase the impact of the most effective and innovative nonprofits in our communities . This is a tremendous step in the right direction , but in order to expand these initiatives , we need a broader pool of leaders with a deep understanding of the communities they are serving and who have the skills , experience and relationships required to succeed in leadership roles .

According to the Bridgespan Group , a leading nonprofit consulting firm , the number of vacant senior manager roles in the nonprofit arena is ever increasing , with 24,000 positions available in 2009 alone . Over the next 10 years , this sector will need to attract and develop more than two times the number of people currently employed in order to fill these roles . This next generation of leaders must come from within the communities that struggle most , as these leaders are the most passionate about making change and have the most to gain if successful . Watch John Rice on preparing for leadership roles ''

The good news is that there is an incredible desire among young African-Americans to give back to their communities .

Smith is one of thousands of talented African-American students and young professionals eager to become corporate or entrepreneurial leaders in sectors such as finance , technology , consulting and entertainment , where they have a broad sphere of influence that extends into their communities .

To address this issue , I founded Management Leadership for Tomorrow -LRB- MLT -RRB- , a nonprofit that provides high-potential young people such as Smith with the `` key ingredients '' they need to realize their career potential -- the step by step career roadmap , coaching and mentoring , hard and soft skill development , door-opening relationships and a high-performing peer community .

Here at MLT , we have had exciting results to date : nearly 40 percent of the minority students at top business schools such as Harvard , Wharton and Kellogg completed MLT 's MBA Prep program and 95 percent of the undergraduates who complete our Career Prep program land fast-track jobs at America 's leading firms across all sectors .

While participating in MLT 's Career Prep program as a college student , Smith and several other MLT fellows founded a mentoring organization that prepares high school students from New York 's most underserved communities for college . Like Smith , nearly 90 percent of our alumni desire to launch or lead a nonprofit organization at some point in their careers , and many are already well down the path .

To harness this potential , MLT has built a robust curriculum that prepares our fellows to enter and succeed in the social entrepreneurship sector , and we partner with leading nonprofits and foundations such as Teach for America , Stand for Children , New Profit , The Knight Foundation and Blue Ridge Foundation to connect MLT alumni to other talent pipelines .

By helping to grow organizations such as MLT and other successful talent development initiatives , I believe that we will succeed in filling the growing leadership gap in corporations , nonprofits , entrepreneurial ventures and the government .

Once there , African-Americans and other under-represented minorities will have the passion , financial capital , experience and relationships they need to be change agents in the communities that are in desperate need of our support . The success of our nation depends on it .
