-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 2 Novak Djokovic suffered a shock defeat by sixth seed Mikhail Youzhny in the semifinals of the World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam on Saturday .

Youzhny , who won the Dutch indoor tournament in 2007 , will play second seed Robin Soderling in Sunday 's final after the world No. 8 edged out sixth-ranked Nikolay Davydenko 7-6 -LRB- 7-3 -RRB- 6-4 .

The signs are good for the world No. 20 , who also defeated Djokovic in the semifinals three years ago .

The Muscovite will bid to win his sixth ATP Tour title , having won one in each of the past three seasons .

Soderling has bounced back from a poor start to the season that saw the Swede lose in the first round of his first two tournaments in 2010 , including the Australian Open .

`` This is a really tough tournament and it 's not easy to reach the final here , '' last year 's French Open finalist told the ATP Web site .

The Spaniard won 6-3 2-6 6-4 to set up a clash with the top seed Andy Roddick who overcame a first set loss and two tiebreakers to defeat fellow American Sam Querrey 2-6 , 7-6 -LRB- 5 -RRB- , 7-6 -LRB- 4 -RRB- .

Unseeded Czech Safarova upset Italy 's Flavia Pennetta , the second-ranked player in the field , as she also rallied from a set down to win 4-6 6-3 6-4 .

In Thailand , top seed Vera Zvonareva will seek home hope Tamarine Tanasugarn from winning her first Pattaya Open title on Sunday .

The Russian is on course to defend her title following a 6-2 4-6 6-3 victory against fourth seed Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan , reaching her 21st career title .
