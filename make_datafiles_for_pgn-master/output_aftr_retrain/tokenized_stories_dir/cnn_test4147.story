-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Organization of American States commission condemned Monday the slayings last month of three Honduran political activists opposed to a military-led coup that removed the elected president in June .

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also said it deplores the kidnappings , arbitrary detentions , torture , sexual violations and illegal raids that the panel maintains other members of the political resistance have suffered since the June 29 coup .

The commission cited more than 50 detentions , eight cases of torture , two kidnappings , two rapes and one raid on a residence during the past month . The attacks have been made against members of the resistance , union members and journalists , as well as their children , the panel said .

`` Honduras must adopt urgent measures to guarantee the rights to life , humane treatment and personal liberty , '' the panel said in a report . `` All persons , without distinction , must be equally protected in the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression , assembly , and political participation . ''

Honduras ' top law enforcement official said he `` laments and deplores '' violence that resulted from the coup that removed President Jose Manuel Zelaya from power and installed interim President Roberto Micheletti .

Micheletti instituted martial law during his seven-month rule , and some Zelaya supporters say they were harassed , arrested or worse .

Another activist , union member Julio Funez Benitez , was chatting outside his home in Olancho on February 15 when two men on a motorcycle fatally shot him twice , the rights commission said .

Dara Gudiel , 17 , was found hanged February 17 in Danli , the commission said . She was the daughter of journalist Enrique Gudiel , who broadcasts the resistance radio program `` Siempre al Frente con el Frente '' -LRB- `` Always Up Front with the Front '' -RRB- .

`` Days before she was found hanged , Dara Gudiel had been released after having been kidnapped and held for two days , during which time she was alleged to have been physically mistreated , '' the panel 's report said .

When the occupants offered to turn over the car keys , the report said , the men answered that they wanted the young woman , `` to see if she would report them this time . ''

`` The five were forced at gunpoint to walk into the mountains , where two of the women were sexually violated ; the third was the victim of robbery and death threats , and the two men were subjected to physical torture , '' the report said . `` They were released hours later . ''

Analysts note that violence is not new to Honduras , nor is it limited in scope . The violence can be political , from all sides of the spectrum . It can be criminal , either random or organized . And it can occur in urban or rural areas .

`` Unfortunately , Honduras has a history of violence , '' said Otto Reich , who served the past three Republican presidents in a number of high-level Latin American posts .

A State Department advisory admonishes that `` crime is endemic in Honduras and requires a high degree of caution by U.S. visitors and residents alike . U.S. citizens have been the victims of a wide range of crimes , including murder , kidnapping , rape , assault and property crimes . ''

Poverty , gangs and low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to a critical crime rate , including mass slayings , the State Department said .

`` People from all political sectors have the right to fully and freely exercise their right to freedom of expression and their right to assembly , without violence and in accordance with the law and with inter-American standards for the protection of human rights , '' the report said .

Reich , who supported Micheletti , spent three days in Honduras last week and met with Lobo , the new president . The new administration , Reich said , is committed to reconciliation and putting an end to divisions that resulted from the coup .

`` Any allegation of violations of human rights has to be taken very seriously , especially in a country with a history of human rights violations , '' Reich said . `` There 's a lot of ad hoc violence , but if there 's organized violence against political supporters of Zelaya , then that is wrong , and it should be condemned . ''

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an autonomous panel created by the OAS . The commission consists of seven independent members who act in a personal capacity , without representing a particular country . They are elected by the OAS General Assembly .
