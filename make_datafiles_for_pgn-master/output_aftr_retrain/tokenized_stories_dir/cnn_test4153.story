-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's about that time of year , when dyed green rivers and Guinness beers flow , the shamrock sunglasses and leprechaun T-shirts come out , and corned beef and cabbage enters the mainstream menu .

Harvey Losh felt and showed his Irish spirit as he marched in a Seattle St. Patrick 's Day parade .

For hundreds of years in Ireland , people have observed the feast of St. Patrick , a fifth-century missionary credited with saving pagans on the Emerald Isle . On the feast day of March 17 , which falls during the Lent season , the Irish can cut loose : sing , dance and enjoy meat , even on a Friday , when it would otherwise be prohibited .

Irish Americans , who account for more than 12 percent of the U.S. population according to the U.S. Census Bureau , mark St. Paddy 's Day and celebrate their heritage in numerous ways that may go unnoticed to the casual observer or outsider . Here are glimpses into how some of them do it .

Political wit a hit in Boston , Massachusetts

Neither Sen. Ted Kennedy nor Sen. John Kerry is expected this year , but getting a call from the nation 's highest office is n't unheard of . Vice President Joe Biden has attended , and Hart said they 're working on getting the attention of President Obama . Or is that O'Bama ?

Honoring their ancestors in Savannah , Georgia

They may not match the Irish population numbers of Boston , New York or Chicago , but several Southern cities , including Savannah , Georgia , have deep green roots .

The city 's annual parade , which dates back 185 years , draws about 400,000 and is reportedly the second largest in the country , according to the parade committee Web site .

`` That 's just a big day for us , '' Forbes said . Away from all the commercialism , `` to us , it 's in honor of our ancestors . ''

Kicking up their feet in Chicago , Illinois

Drawing 400 to 500 participants ages 4 to 17 , the 3-year-old event showcases the Irish step dancing skills learned in six area schools that are dedicated to passing along this piece of culture . It begins at 7 p.m. March 13 .

For parents who usually spend time carting their children around , the event offers them a chance to `` finally get to see their kids perform ... showcasing the styles they have , '' said Kathy O'Neill , a spokeswoman for the Irish American Heritage Center , which hosts the weekend 's kickoff event .

`` It 's important to carry on heritage , '' she said .

A taste of tradition in Seattle , Washington

The decades-old Irish soda bread baking contest , which happened Saturday , attracts more than 100 competitors each year .

The bread dates back to about 1840 , traditionally features a cross on top `` to ward off evil '' and uses bicarbonate of soda -- instead of yeast -- for rising , said Mike McQuaid , a spokesman for Seattle 's Irish Heritage Club .

When Mary Moriarty and her husband , a retired New York police officer , moved to the `` valley of the sun , '' she was n't sure what to expect . Looking around during their first St. Paddy 's Day parade in the Southwest , she said , `` I remembered thinking , ` This is it ? ' ''

But 14 years later , the chairwoman of the St. Patrick 's Day Faire and operations manager for the Irish Cultural Center knows that the desert connection to the lush green Emerald Isle is as real as anywhere else .

This year 's parade starts at 10 a.m. Saturday and is followed by festivities in the park adjacent to the cultural center .

`` We will naturally have liquid libations , '' Moriarty said . `` You ca n't have an Irish party without liquid libations . ''

And the center , today , is a place where the estimated 400,000 Phoenix-area residents with Irish heritage can learn about their culture , including traditional foods , music and dance .
