The Filipino , dubbed `` Pac Man '' , stopped the Puerto Rican in the 12th and final round to boost his claims to be known as the world 's best pound-for-pound fighter with a victory in his seventh weight category -- his Ring Magazine and IBO crowns are not universally recognized .

Cotto weighed in at 145 pounds in front a 5,000 strong crowd at the MGM Grand Arena , with Pacquiao tipping the scales at 144 pounds .

But Cotto found himself on the canvas in the second round after Pacquiao struck him with a flash knockdown

Pacquaio followed this in the fourth round with a right-hook left-hook combo , and continued to punish his opponent , who suffered swelling above both eyes .

`` Our strategy for the fight was not to hurry , take our time , because we knew his strategy was that he was going to counter . We were very careful in the early rounds then I controlled the fight and tried to put him under pressure .

`` We tried our best to knock him out because that 's what my trainer said . I thought they were going to stop the fight in the 11th round and I was surprised he made it to the 12th round . ''

Pacquiao , who has won 49 fights , lost three and drawn two , is being lined up for a money-spinning fight with American Floyd Mayweather Jr , who has also won five major titles in five weight divisions .
