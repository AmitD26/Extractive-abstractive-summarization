The Juventus player underwent the operation on Sunday to repair a herniated disc in his back , and said afterwards he is in no hurry to return to action .

`` I feel relieved now , '' Buffon told Juventus ' official website . `` The intervention went well and this gives me faith and serenity . I must not hurry .

The world champions suffered without Buffon , finishing bottom of the group as they failed to make it past the first round of the competition .

`` Considering my role , I think my career is still a long one and without the hernia I would have been able to lengthen it further , '' Buffon told Italian newspaper La Repubblica .

`` My future with the national team ? I believe I deserve my place .

`` I 've had Prandelli as a rival coach since my youth years and I knew back then that he has an exceptional rapport with his players . He is part of the group and I think that is very important . ''

Meanwhile , Juventus announced the season-long loan signing of Udinese defender Marco Motta on Monday .

The Turin club has the option to buy the right-back at the end of the loan deal .
