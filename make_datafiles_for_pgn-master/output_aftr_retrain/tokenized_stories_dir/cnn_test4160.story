-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rep. Maxine Waters , D-California , who is under investigation by the House ethics committee , said Tuesday she has not been given due process and she `` will not be a sacrificial lamb for anyone . ''

The 10-term congresswoman is alleged to have helped steer federal bailout money to a bank in which her husband had a financial stake .

The House ethics committee released a report Monday detailing three counts against Waters and rejected her request for the charges to be dismissed .

The 71-year-old Waters has been pushing the ethics panel to set a trial date before the midterm elections in November . But she told Martin Tuesday she does n't expect that request to be granted .

OneUnited Bank ultimately received $ 12 million in bailout funds .

`` A meeting was in fact granted , however , the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- OneUnited . Rep. Waters ' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and , at the time of the meeting , was a stock holder of the bank , '' the report said .

She said Kevin Cohee , OneUnited 's chairman and chief executive officer , spoke up at the meeting , `` and said , ` I 'm an example of what 's happening with minority banks ' and went on to try and make his case for the fact that OneUnited was losing $ 50 million that they had invested in Fannie Mae . ''

Waters , `` according to -LRB- Frank -RRB- ... knew she should say no , but it bothered her . It was clear to -LRB- Frank -RRB- that this was a ` conflict of interest problem . ' ''

Frank 's advice to Waters , the report states , was to ` stay out of it . ' ''

In the Tom Joyner Show interview Tuesday , Waters admitted she had spoken to Frank , but described the circumstances much differently than the report .

`` So then I said , ` Perhaps you need to take a look at this ' and he said , ` Fine . Do n't worry . You do n't have anything to do with this . I will take care of it . ' And , as a result of that , he started to work on it . '' she said .

Following the September 9 meeting between Treasury and National Bankers Association officials , Moore `` was actively involved in assisting OneUnited representatives with their request for capital from Treasury and crafting legislation to authorize Treasury to grant the request '' for financial assistance , the report said .

`` Reasonable '' people could construe Moore 's `` continued involvement in assisting OneUnited as the dispensing of special favors or privileges to OneUnited , '' the report concluded .

Waters refuted that allegation as well Tuesday .

The prospect of inquiries into the two high-profile Democrats has compounded the fears of congressional Democrats nervous about their prospects in mid-term elections in November .

The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation . Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus , and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America .

Waters alluded to race Tuesday on Joyner 's show , which is broadcast over the Internet on BlackAmericaWeb.com .

`` The OCE -LRB- Office of Congressional Ethics -RRB- is poorly constructed . You do n't know who is charging you with what or brought a claim against you or who brought the information to the OCE ... of all the information claimed or accusations brought to them , they think that African-Americans are the only ones who they move further with investigation on , '' she said .
