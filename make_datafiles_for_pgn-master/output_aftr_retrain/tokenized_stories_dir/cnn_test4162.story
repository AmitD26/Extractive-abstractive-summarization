`` He said , ` I just killed the five most racist people , ' and I knew he was n't playing because he do n't talk like that , '' Holliday told CNN 's Soledad O'Brien in an interview that aired Tuesday .

Holliday said when she looked at her caller ID and saw that the phone call was coming from her son 's place of employment , `` I just kind of lost it . ''

Manchester police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination , and the president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination . Instead , the company said it had asked him to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages .

Holliday disputed that statement in the interview , saying , `` I know he reported the -LSB- racial -RSB- problems because he brought home the papers that they signed . ''

Thornton 's girlfriend , Kristi Hannah , has said Thornton reported seeing drawings of a hangman with a noose around its neck as well as hearing the N-word directed toward him .

Holliday said she had few clues as to what Thornton was planning , but noted , `` I could just kind of see slowly he was just getting frustrated and aggravated . ''

`` I wish he was still here with me , '' she said . `` I miss him so much . ''
