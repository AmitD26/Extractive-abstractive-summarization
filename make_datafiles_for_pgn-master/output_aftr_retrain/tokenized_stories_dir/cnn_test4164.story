Cameron made the remarks in the Turkish capital of Ankara , which he was visiting to forge a new relationship with Turkey and show his support for Turkish membership in the European Union .

`` Let me also be clear that the situation in Gaza has to change . Humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions . Gaza can not and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp , '' Cameron said , according to a transcript of the speech provided by his office .

Ron Prosor , Israel 's ambassador to Britain , reacted quickly to the prime minister 's remark , saying that Hamas is responsible for the misery in Gaza .

`` The people of Gaza are the prisoners of the terrorist organization Hamas , '' Prosor said in a statement . `` The situation in Gaza is the direct result of Hamas ' rule and priorities . ''

The ambassador also raised the issue of Gilad Shalit , the Israeli soldier taken hostage four years ago who is being held in Gaza .

Cameron 's comments came in a country that once had close relations with Israel , but ties between the two nations have been strained recently over the Jewish state 's policies toward the Palestinian territory .

Cameron -- who touted Turkey 's unique ability to make peace between Israel and the Arab world -- stressed that the Israeli action was `` completely unacceptable . '' He said he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain expects Israel 's inquiry into the raid to be `` swift , transparent and rigorous . ''

He also believes Turkey can also help bring together Palestinians and Israelis as they work to meet in direct negotations .

`` But as , hopefully , we move in the coming weeks to direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians , so it is Turkey that can make the case for peace and Turkey that can help press the parties to come together and point the way to a just and viable solution , '' the prime minister said .
