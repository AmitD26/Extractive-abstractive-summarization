Mukesh Kapila said atrocities in Darfur could have been prevented if the world had taken action sooner .

`` What happened in Darfur would be classified as obscene , '' he told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour . `` It 's a combination of a horror movie and a snuff movie . ''

The government 's retaliation was so harsh that a U.N. human rights monitor issued a prophetic warning . His March 2003 report said that in the `` escalating conflict , '' Sudan 's government may be `` engaged in ... ethnic cleansing aimed at eliminating African tribes from Darfur . ''

Since 2003 , according to U.N. estimates , 300,000 Darfuris have been killed in the violence or died in the ensuing disease and starvation . Another 2.5 million have been uprooted from their homes .

`` The most bitter lesson of Darfur , '' said Jan Egeland , former U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs , `` is that the world let a small conflict slowly but surely degenerate into a full-blown catastrophe . ''

As reports of atrocities mounted in late 2003 and into 2004 , Kapila and Egeland saw a pattern : Sudanese forces and government-armed Arab militia members known as janjaweed -LRB- `` devils on horseback '' -RRB- were using scorched-earth tactics against civilians from Darfur 's African tribes . They burned villages , poisoned wells and raped women and girls , according to reports from U.N. workers and aid groups .

Sudan claims that its forces were only putting down an armed insurrection .

Unlike cyclones and earthquakes , the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Darfur was man-made , so Kapila and Egeland began a crusade to get Darfur onto the U.N. Security Council 's agenda . They knew from experience that getting an issue in front of the Security Council brings , as Egeland says , three things : `` attention , attention , attention . ''

Both Egeland and Kapila approached Western governments but came away disappointed because most diplomats were focused on resolving another conflict , in southern Sudan , which had claimed 2 million lives over 20 years .

Out of frustration , Kapila went outside proper channels and screamed to the media . In a March 2004 interview with BBC Radio , Kapila compared the situation in Darfur to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .

His comments , which Sudan called a `` heap of lies , '' were picked up by newspapers around the world . Kapila so angered the host government in Khartoum that he had to resign his post .

Even after the Security Council put Darfur on the agenda , it would take three more years of resolutions and debate to authorize a large U.N. peacekeeping force . China , which has veto power on the Security Council and extensive commercial and military ties to the government of Sudan , was one of the major obstacles to taking decisive action .

But as conditions in Darfur became more widely known , a grass-roots movement began to grow , putting pressure on the White House and a spotlight on the U.N. Security Council . According to Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel , `` no other tragedy since 1945 has caught the imagination of so many people as Darfur has . ''

Would earlier action by the Security Council have made a difference ? `` Yes , '' Egeland said . `` We would have kept it to a medium-sized African disaster . Not this mega-disaster . It could have been stopped when it was a small emergency . ''

In July , the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court applied for a warrant to arrest Sudan 's president , Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir , on charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity . Read the charges against Sudan 's president -LRB- pdf -RRB-
