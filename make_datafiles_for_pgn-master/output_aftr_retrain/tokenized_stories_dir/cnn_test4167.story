The men were taken into custody after landing in Amsterdam on a flight from Chicago , Illinois , Dutch prosecutors said . Both men were being held at Amsterdam 's Schiphol International Airport at the request of Dutch national police , airport spokesman Robert Kapel said .

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said they were arrested after `` suspicious items '' in their luggage raised concern .

`` The items were not deemed to be dangerous in and of themselves , and as we share information with our international partners , Dutch authorities were notified of the suspicious items , '' the U.S. agency said . `` This matter continues to be under investigation . ''

The source identified the men aboard United Airlines Flight 908 , from Chicago , Illinois , to Amsterdam , as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al-Soofi and Hezem al-Murisi . Al-Soofi began his trip by boarding a flight in Birmingham , Alabama , and al-Murisi originally flew from Memphis , Tennessee , the law enforcement source said .

Another U.S. law enforcement official said both men were in the United States legally , but their countries of origin were not immediately known . That official said neither of the passengers were carrying items that are barred from aircraft , and federal air marshals were aboard the Chicago-to-Amsterdam flight .

A U.S. government official said items in at least one of the bags were being examined by law enforcement authorities at Dulles on Monday night .
