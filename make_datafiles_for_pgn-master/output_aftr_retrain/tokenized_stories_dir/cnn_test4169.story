-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal judge has ordered the reinstatement of an openly lesbian former Air Force major who was dismissed from the military under the government 's `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' policy .

Maj. Margaret Witt , a decorated flight nurse with 20 years of service , had sued to return to the Air Force Reserve . She was honorably discharged in July 2007 on the grounds that she had a six-year relationship with another woman , a civilian .

`` Her discharge from the Air Force Reserves violated her substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution . She should be restored to her position as a flight nurse with the 446th AES as soon as is practicable , '' wrote the judge .

The Senate this week temporarily turned aside legislation to repeal the law .

Witt joined the Air Force in 1987 and was suspended in 2004 , after her superiors discovered her personal relationship with the civilian woman . At the time , she worked for an air-medical transport unit that evacuated and treated wounded soldiers .

She was described in employee reports and by trial witnesses as an `` exemplary officer '' who was an effective leader , caring mentor , and skilled clinician . She had hid her homosexuality for years .

The judge found no compelling reason for her dismissal .

`` The application of ` do n't ask , do n't tell ' to Major Margaret Witt does not significantly further the government 's interest in promoting military readiness , unit morale and cohesion , '' he wrote .

`` My colleagues -- my friends -- said , ` Ron , you got it wrong , '' ' Leighton said near the end of the trial , referring to his earlier decision . `` They told me what I needed to do , what I needed to ask . ''

The judge is a 2002 Bush appointee .

Witt was released just before she was set to retire with full benefits . The judge rejected a separate argument from Witt that her procedural due process rights were violated . Leighton said the Air Force gave her full notice of the charges against her and she was given the opportunity to challenge the charges .

President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the controversial policy . A bill that would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December is currently before Congress .

More than 12,500 gays have been booted from the military since `` do n't ask , do n't tell '' went into effect .
