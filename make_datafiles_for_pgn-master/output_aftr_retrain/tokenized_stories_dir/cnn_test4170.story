-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nationalists held a narrow lead in Kyrgyzstan 's parliamentary elections , the country 's election commission said Monday .

The pro-government SDPK -LRB- Social-Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan -RRB- won 7.97 percent of the counted votes ; followed by the

Arnamys Party -LRB- 7.12 percent -RRB- ; the Republic Party -LRB- 7.02 percent -RRB- and the Atameken Party -LRB- 5.94 percent -RRB- .

The election commission has to announce final results within two weeks , said Klara Sooromkulova , a member of the election commission .

Voters in the Central Asian nation went to the polls Sunday to elect a new parliament . The elections come after a year that has seen the president flee the country and ethnic riots that left hundreds dead .

International monitors did not report any major complaints on election day , though local observers from the political parties were more vocal with their concerns , Sooromkulova said .

Voter turnout was high , especially in the south of the country , she said , including a 56 percent turnout in the capital , Bishkek .

Two months later , at least 356 people were killed and about 400,000 fled their homes in a wave of violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks .

Kyrgyzstan hosts a United States air base which is an essential supply route for NATO personnel and equipment into Afghanistan , called Manas Transit Center , as well as a Russian military base , Kant , just outside of the capital Bishkek .

Nearly 2.9 million people were eligible to vote for 120 lawmakers in a parliament called the Jogorku Kenesh , the Central Election Commission said .
