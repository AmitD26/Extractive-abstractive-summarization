-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A JetBlue pilot has been indicted , accused of interfering with a flight crew just over two weeks after several passengers wrestled him to the floor after he exhibited what authorities described as erratic behavior .

According to an FBI affidavit , a JetBlue copilot became concerned about Osbon 's bizarre behavior early in their March 27 flight from New York to Las Vegas .

At one point , Osbon said , `` We 're not going to Vegas , '' according to the affidavit .

The concerned co-pilot suggested they invite an off-duty JetBlue captain into the cockpit . Instead , Osbon `` abruptly left the cockpit to go to the forward lavatory , '' the affidavit says .

When Osbon tried to enter his code into the cockpit door , the co-pilot announced over the public address system an order to restrain Osbon . Several passengers wrestled Osbon to the floor and restrained him .

The flight was diverted to Amarillo , after which Osbon was taken into custody .

Last week , U.S. District Court Judge Mary Lou Robinson ordered Osbon to be transferred to an unnamed medical facility for federal prisoners so he could undergo a psychiatric evaluation as part of the process to see whether he was sane during the incident and whether he is competent to stand trial .
