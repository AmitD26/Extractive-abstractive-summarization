Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Trailblazing White House journalist Helen Thomas has died at age 92 after a long illness , sources told CNN Saturday .

Thomas covered 10 presidents over nearly half a century , and became a legend in the industry .

Thomas began covering the White House for United Press International when John F. Kennedy became president in 1961 and was a fixture there until her retirement in 2010 .

She was considered the dean of the White House press corps because she was the longest-serving White House journalist .

Thomas will be buried in Detroit , and a memorial service is planned in Washington in October , according to her family .

Her career , however , came to an end under a cloud of controversy .

Thomas , then working for the media conglomerate Hearst as a syndicated columnist , was blasted for comments she made regarding Jewish people .

Thomas apologized for her remarks , writing , `` They do not reflect my heartfelt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance . May that day come soon . ''

In 2012 , Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi presented Thomas with an award .

In describing her job , Thomas once said , `` I 've never covered the president in any way other than that he is ultimately responsible . ''

Along the way , she broke some barriers by becoming the first female president of the prestigious White House Correspondents ' Association and Washington 's Gridiron Club .

Two months later , Hearst News Service hired her as a syndicated columnist , and she returned to the White House for fodder for her columns .

No question seemed off-limits

Colleagues remember her as a genuinely fearless woman who asked the toughest questions of presidents , no matter their party .

In January 2009 , as President George Bush was preparing to leave office , Thomas aimed her editorial guns at him and his administration .

Among her criticisms : that before the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks , administration officials ignored `` significant early warnings of an imminent strike against the U.S. ''

In a commentary , she slammed Bush for what she considered his failings , including leading the country `` into a senseless war against Iraq , a calamity still under way as he leaves office almost six years after the invasion . ''

Thomas embraced the freedoms of a columnist with vigor .

Health care reform was being debated at the time , and Thomas asked Gibbs every day whether a public option would be part of the package .

`` Then why do you keep asking me ? '' Gibbs inquired .

`` Because I want your conscience to bother you , '' Thomas replied .
