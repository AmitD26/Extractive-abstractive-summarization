-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the wife of at least one survivor of the Deepwater Horizon disaster , April 20 , 2010 is the day she lost her husband . Meccah Boynton-Brown says although her husband Doug made it off the ill-fated rig , he will never be the same .

First 100 days of oil disaster

`` My life has come to a stop . My daughter 's life has pretty much come to a stop ... the first thing I think Doug wants is to sleep a whole night without having a nightmare , '' she said .

Another survivor 's wife , Amanda Barron , admits she feels guilt from knowing her husband Dan could 've suffered a much worse fate while , at the same time , still lamenting that he 's not the man she married .

Dan Barron too has been diagnosed with PTSD and depression , according to medical records provided to CNN . He witnessed one of his good friends , who he calls a `` fallen brother , '' die right in front of him when a second explosion rocked the Deepwater Horizon rig .

Barron says one night the psychological pain , and the guilt of surviving when so many friends did not , became overwhelming .

Witness to explosion saw a `` bunch of smoke ''

`` I had a 6-shot pistol , and I just wanted it to be over , '' he said .

`` I had a hard time getting it -LSB- the gun -RSB- from him , '' she said . `` It was like he was playing Russian roulette to see how many times it would take to click it until the bullet went , '' she said , adding , `` I still have nightmares . ''

Both survivors are suing Transocean for pain and suffering and loss of wages . While technically still employees of the company , they have not worked on a rig since the disaster and stopped getting paid by Transocean last December but do still get some health costs covered .

Both families worry how their children are being affected by the fallout from the disaster . The Barrons 11-year-old daughter Faith is autistic and so far seems unaware of changes in her father , but their 15 year-old son Austin has gone from being an exemplary student to getting C 's and D 's .

`` I do n't know how she stays with me , you know ? I really do n't , '' Dan Barron said of his wife Meccah , adding , `` She 's a saint . ''
