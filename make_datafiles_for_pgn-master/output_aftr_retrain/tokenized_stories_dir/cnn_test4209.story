-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and three other former heads of state arrived in North Korea Tuesday , as part of the latest diplomatic effort to restart talks between the North and South , state media reported .

The group is collectively known as `` The Elders '' -- an independent group of global leaders founded by former South African President Nelson Mandela .

The Elders expect to meet with ailing North Korean leader Kim Jong Il , along with other senior officials and diplomats . They are going to Pyongyang at the invitation of the North Korean government , Carter said

Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang 's nuclear development program .

South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010 , killing 46 sailors . In November , North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island , killing two South Korean marines and two civilians .

In August , Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes , a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $ 600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea .

Earlier this month , North Korea reported through state-run news agency KCNA that it had arrested U.S. citizen Jun Young Su last year for `` committing a crime '' against the reclusive nation .

KCNA did not provide details on the nature of the alleged crime .

Two State Department officials , speaking on condition of not being identified , previously told CNN that the man is a Korean-American businessman . One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea .

It was not known how Carter 's visit might affect his detention .

Two American journalists -- Laura Ling and Euna Lee , who had entered North Korea in March 2009 and were arrested and sentenced to 12 years hard labor -- were released in August 2009 after an intervention by former U.S. President Bill Clinton .
