Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Los Angeles County authorities exhumed the remains Wednesday of a woman whose mysterious disappearance and death in Malibu Canyon have been the subject of a family crusade for justice , the coroner 's office said .

The cause of Richardson 's death remains undetermined , Winter said Wednesday .

`` We just do n't know , '' Winter said about the cause of death .

The bones , found on two different occasions following the discovery of her body , underwent DNA analysis to confirm that they were Richardson 's , Winter said .

Last January , after an emotional public appeal , Richardson 's mother persuaded Los Angeles County authorities to exhume the remains and involve the FBI crime lab in examining them and Richardson 's clothing .

At one point in the controversy over her death , Richardson 's father , Michael Richard , blamed the Sheriff 's Office for releasing his daughter without any assistance even though she had mental health issues and was in a manic state . He accused local authorities of providing special treatment and transportation to celebrities running afoul of the law such as Mel Gibson and Charlie Sheen , but said his daughter did n't receive similar courtesy .

Richardson 's skeletal and mummified remains were found about eight miles from the sheriff 's station , in the Monte Nido section of the Santa Monica Mountains , which bisect Los Angeles , Latice Sutton said .

`` We 've been working with family ever since her remains were recovered , '' Winter said Wednesday .
