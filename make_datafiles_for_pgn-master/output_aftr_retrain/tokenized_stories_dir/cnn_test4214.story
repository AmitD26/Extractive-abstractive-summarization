-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- American Robert Kendrick , ranked 105 in the world , has been banned from tennis for a year after testing positive for banned stimulant methylhexaneamine during May 's French Open .

The International Tennis Federation -LRB- ITF -RRB- accepted Kendrick 's claim that the stimulant was in a capsule he took to combat jetlag and was not intended to enhance his performance .

What does the future hold for African tennis ?

However , the Tennis Anti-Doping Program makes it clear it is up to each individual player to ensure that no prohibited substance enters their body .

`` Methylhexaneamine is a prohibited substance under section S6 of the 2010 WADA List of prohibited substances and is therefore also prohibited under the Tennis Anti-Doping Program . Mr Kendrick was therefore charged with an anti-doping rule violation under Article C. 1 of the Program . ''

However , he took the first two sets against Rafael Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon in 2006 before eventually going out .

Top seed Nicolas Almagro joined fellow-Spaniard Fernando Verdasco , seeded four , and Russian third seed Mikhail Youzhny in the last four .

However , second seed Stanislas Wawrinka disappointed the home fans by losing 6-3 6-2 to eighth seed Marcel Granollers , ensuring three Spaniards reached the semis .

There was a major surprise in the WTA tournament in Stanford as top seed Victoria Azarenka was beaten 4-6 7-5 6-2 by New Zealand 's Marina Erakovic .
