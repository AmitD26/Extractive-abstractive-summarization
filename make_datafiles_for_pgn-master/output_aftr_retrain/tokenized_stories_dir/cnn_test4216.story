Tokyo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japan will on Friday begin enforcing an evacuation order on a 20-kilometer zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant , a top government official said .

The restriction -- in place since the early days of the nuclear disaster -- has often been ignored .

Many of the about 78,000 people who have homes in the evacuation zone have gone back in recent weeks to retrieve belongings , and check on farms and businesses .

The time limit for such visits will be two hours and everyone who enters will be required to go through a decontamination process .

Police are currently stationed at checkpoints leading into the area , but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer .

The disaster , now the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl , occurred when the Fukushima Daiichi plant was struck by the March 11 tsunami that devastated northern Japan , knocking out its coolant systems and causing its three operating reactors to overheat .

The plant 's operator , Tokyo Electric Power Co. , said Thursday that a meltdown could be taking place at the troubled facility , but also acknowledged that there 's no way to know for sure .

TEPCO told CNN that it can not say that the nuclear fuel rods at the three reactors have never melted or that they are not melting right now , nor can the company say for certain that the rods have melted or are melting now .

The Japanese government says it has no detailed readings of radiation levels inside the 20-km zone . But journalists who have entered the areas have recorded radiation levels that typically range around a few thousandths of a millisieverts per hour . By comparison , a typical resident of an industrialized country receives about 3 millisieverts per year .
