It was a repeat of their success in the inaugural competition on their home soil in 1987 , but it was far from the easy victory that many had predicted .

Scrum-half Piri Weepu , missed the conversion and two other penalty kicks that would have given them a more comfortable advantage .

Stephen Donald , who replaced the injured Aaron Cruden at fly-half , put the home side 8-0 ahead when he slotted home an early second half penalty .

But back came France as a sustained attack led to a try for captain Thierry Dusautoir , converted by Francois Trinh-Duc , who was on as a replacement for the injured Morgan Parra .

Trinh-Duc had an excellent chance with 15 minutes left to kick a penalty which would have put Les Bleus ahead but his effort went wide .

There were also wild scenes of celebration among the estimated 150,000 people who had gathered to watch the final on giant screens in Auckland .

All Blacks coach Graham Henry admitted the closing minutes had been tense before his side closed out a long-awaited victory .

Captain Richie McCaw echoed Henry 's sentiments after his side hung on for their slender win .

Dusautoir , whose team had been subjected to such criticism as they scraped into the final , believed their display had been the perfect riposte .
