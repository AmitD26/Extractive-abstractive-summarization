By early Thursday evening , many had crossed the bridge -- the same place where more than 700 had been arrested last month -- chanting , `` This is what democracy looks like -- This is what America looks like , '' according to the New York movement 's official Twitter feed . This time , they marched in the pedestrian walkway , not blocking the roadway . Nearby , pro-Occupy slogans were projected onto one side of the Verizon Building .

Roundup of protests across the country

The group twice squared off against riot police in Zuccotti Park , where they 'd been evicted two days earlier . They 'd also engaged in several confrontations with police , leading to scores of arrests .

During a late afternoon press conference , Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that at least seven police officers were hurt Thursday during exchanges with protesters .

And a 24-year-old police officer was injured when a star-shaped glass object was thrown at him , Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters during a visit to Bellevue Hospital Center where the officer was being treated .

CNN and CNN affiliate New York One broadcast images of the exchanges , including video of one man -- whose face appeared to be covered in blood -- sitting near police who wielded shields and batons .

Authorities constructed barricades at Zuccotti Park , in front of the New York Stock Exchange and along Fifth Avenue in an apparent attempt to keep demonstrators off the roads and on pedestrian walkways .

Residents and workers near the New York Stock Exchange were required to flash identification cards as police cordoned off the area amid concerns that demonstrators would try to disrupt trading .

Earlier in the day , protesters lifted metal barricades that ringed Zuccotti Park , a former home-base for the movement , defying authorities and blocking traffic .

In Lower Manhattan , CNN iReporter Alvaro Perez shot video showing protesters being pulled away by police , including one woman who appeared to be dragged by her jacket and backpack .

`` I do n't want to speculate on what happened in advance of that , '' police spokesman Paul Browne said of the incident .

He said the `` big picture '' of how police have handled demonstrations has so far been mostly positive .

`` People were able to get to work '' and `` protesters were able to protest , '' Browne added .

Occupy roundup : Movement marks 2 months

Earlier , on CNN 's `` American Morning , '' Howard Wolfson , a New York City deputy mayor , vowed , `` We 'll make sure , if people want to peacefully protest , they have the right to . '' But , he added , `` if people break the law , we 'll have to deal with that . ''

While the city has come under fire from protesters and other critics for arrests and removing protesters from Zuccotti Park , Wolfson insisted that `` we had to act '' to stop illegal activity , such as drug use , and to eliminate fire hazards .

`` This is a place where we honor the First Amendment , '' he added .

The Occupy movement , likewise , showed few signs of abating elsewhere in the United States .

In cities such as St. Louis , Milwaukee and elsewhere , thousands responded to the `` day of action '' plea .

The next highest arrest figure was in Los Angeles , where 25 people were arrested early Thursday and another 25 were arrested later in the day , Officer Andrew Neiman said . Bail was set at $ 5,000 for those detained , he added .

In Portland , police reported 48 people arrested in three separate incidents . That includes 25 taken into custody on the east end of the Steel Bridge , nine inside a Wells Fargo bank and 14 in and around a Chase Bank . In the latter incident on Thursday evening , Sgt. Pete Simpson said that police used pepper spray to get individuals to move off a street and from the path of a commuter rail line .
