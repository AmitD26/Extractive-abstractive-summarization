`` Our goal has been to foster interfaith ties , build a system of understanding and ask the Iranian leadership to show compassion and mercy for the American hikers by allowing them to come home , '' said Nihad Awad , national executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations -LRB- CAIR -RRB- who went to Tehran last week as part of a religious delegation .

`` The delegation was informed by the Iranian authorities that its work prior to this trip and during its current stay in Iran was very helpful and important in the decision to release the hikers , '' according to a CAIR statement released Sunday . Awad told CNN the delegation traveled to Tehran at the invitation of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .

The appeal for the release of Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal began with a series of personal letters addressed to Ahmadinejad and other Iranian leaders in September 2010 , CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said .

In May , boxing legend Muhammad Ali joined more than a dozen prominent Muslim American and various interfaith leaders -- including CAIR -- at a news conference in Washington to publicly ask for the release of the two hikers .

Their appeal to the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khameni , was endorsed by the group , which has maintained a dialogue with clerical leaders in Iran , said Awad .

`` We can only hope the two men are freed soon on humanitarian grounds and that our visit fosters a better dialogue between Iranian and American leaders of faith , '' he said .

The delegation was granted permission by government officials to visit Baur and Fattal in prison on Sunday but their request was postponed , said Awad .

The delegation also met with family members of Iranian citizens held in the United States adding that government officials there emphasized the need to work more effectively at `` securing the freedom of Iranians in American jails , '' Awad said .
