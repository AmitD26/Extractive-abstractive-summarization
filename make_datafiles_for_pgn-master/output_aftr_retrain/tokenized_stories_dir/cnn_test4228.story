One of the victim 's hunting partners eventually shot and killed the grizzly , according to the sheriff 's office .

Authorities received a cell phone call about 10 a.m. reporting the incident near Buckhorn Mountain , the sheriff 's office said . Officials from multiple government agencies were at the site by Friday evening , Weland added a short time later in an e-mail to reporters .

At that point , authorities determined that the incident -- initially believed to have happened in northern Idaho -- actually occurred on the Montana side of Buckhorn Mountain , according to Weland . Boundary County sheriff deputies remain on site , but jurisdiction was being transferred to authorities from Lincoln County , Montana .

The name of the victim , who was not from Boundary County , was not being released until authorities could notify his next of kin .

The incident follows a series of bear attacks in recent months in the United States .

Two men were killed this summer in Yellowstone National Park by grizzly bears , Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said . In August , a lone 50-year-old man was bit by a grizzly bear in Montana 's Glacier National Park but was able to continue hiking until he found help , the National Park Service said .

And earlier this month , two young campers were injured when they were attacked by a black bear at Stokes State Forest in northwestern New Jersey , the state 's Department of Environmental Protection said .
