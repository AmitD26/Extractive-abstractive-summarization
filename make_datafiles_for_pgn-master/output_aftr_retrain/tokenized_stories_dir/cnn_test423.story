-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of Jeffrey Edward Fowle , an American tourist detained in North Korea for apparently breaking an unspecified law , has apologized to the reclusive state and asked for his release .

Fowle 's wife and their three children appeared at a news conference in Lebanon , Ohio , Tuesday , in which the family 's lawyer , Timothy Tepe read a statement .

Fowle 's family has been writing to U.S. President Barack Obama and previous presidents including George W. Bush , Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter to help his case . In previous cases of arrested Americans in North Korea , visits by U.S. former heads of state helped secure their return . Carter visited Pyongyang in 2010 to free American Aijalon Mahli Gomes and Clinton also made the trip to free U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee in 2009 .

There was no official announcement of a trial date from North Korea 's state-run , Korean Central News Agency -LRB- KCNA -RRB- .

Plea for help

In the interview released on August 1 , Fowle told the wires service , that `` the window is closing on that process . It will be coming relatively soon , maybe within a month , '' Fowle said of his trial .

`` They 're desperate for his release and his return home . As you can imagine , Jeffrey is the primary financial provider for his family and -LSB- his wife -RSB- Tatyana is struggling to manage by herself , '' Tepe said at Tuesday 's news conference .

Three Americans in custody

Citing unidentified sources , Japanese news agency Kyodo reported that Fowle was part of a tour group and that he was detained in mid-May after allegedly leaving a Bible behind .

Fowle is one of three Americans detained in North Korea , including Matthew Todd Miller , who was taken into custody on April 10 , according to KCNA and Korean-American missionary , Kenneth Bae , who has been sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013 .
