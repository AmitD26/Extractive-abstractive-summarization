The then-student , Dharun Ravi , is on trial on a 15-count indictment for allegedly spying on and intimidating his roommate , Tyler Clementi , because Clementi was gay .

Ravi said that he was `` creeped out '' by the September 19 romantic encounter between Clementi and another man , which he suggested he witnessed -- via his hidden camera -- with several others .

`` Mad people are going to do it , '' she said he texted her , using slang to suggest large numbers planned to watch . `` People are having a viewing party with a bottle of Bacardi and beer in this kids room for my roommate . ''

That `` viewing party '' never happened , Ravi wrote in a subsequent text exchange .

Yet on September 22 , 2010 , Clementi took a train to New York and posted a mobile status update on his Facebook page that read , `` Jumping off the gw bridge sorry , '' before killing himself .

Ravi 's lawyer , Stephen Altman , meanwhile , introduced a message sent the next day in which his client told Huang that his roommate had committed suicide and described it as `` crazy . ''

`` I guess he was quiet because he was depressed , '' wrote the defendant .

Last week , Rutgers graduate Geoffrey Irving testified that Ravi had told him after an ultimate Frisbee practice that he set up the webcam and was planning to do it again the evening of September 21 .

Yet previously , Altman has argued that his client had switched on the webcam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate 's visitor , not necessarily because Clementi was gay .

The trial of Ravi , now 20 , began February 24 .

When it 's complete , the jury will weigh his guilt or innocence on various charges including bias intimidation , invasion of privacy , tampering with physical evidence , witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution .

If convicted , Ravi faces up to 10 years in prison . Last year , he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time .

He was n't the only one charged after Clementi 's suicide . Molly Wei , who admitted joining Ravi to watch the September 19 , 2010 , webcam encounter , was charged with two counts of invasion of privacy .

She reached a plea deal in May 2011 that required her to testify against her friend and former high school classmate , as well as to complete a three-year program on cyberbullying and do 300 hours of community service . The charges will be dropped if she does all of those things .

`` I was very surprised because my friends brought it up , and I had no idea how they knew , but they said that Dharun had told them . ... They told me about these Twitter , tweets , that they received on Tuesday about him trying to have a viewing party , '' she said .

Clementi 's suicide stirred national discussion regarding bullying , with President Barack Obama releasing a videotaped message less than a month later condemning such treatment .

And Clementi 's family consented in November to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the `` Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act . ''

The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid `` to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student , '' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg , D-New Jersey .
