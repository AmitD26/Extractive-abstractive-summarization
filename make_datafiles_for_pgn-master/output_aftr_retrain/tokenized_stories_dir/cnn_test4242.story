After rainy weather hits New York City , Charlot takes to the streets collecting umbrellas from roads , subway stations and trash cans . Then she totes them back to her Brooklyn studio and transforms them from trash into fashion .

After watching the film `` Breakfast at Tiffany 's , '' Charlot was inspired to make her own version of the little black dress , thinking , `` I really love that black dress , but I do n't want to do the same kind of little black dress . What about I try something out of umbrellas ?

`` And I took 3 umbrellas and I designed a beautiful gown . ''

Wet-weather months provide an abundance of fabric for Charlot . `` In March , during the rainy month , I collected 237 umbrellas , '' she said .

The job can lead to interesting situations . One woman who came across Charlot digging deep in a trash can mistook her for a homeless person and offered her lunch .

But Charlot does n't mind . She believes she is helping to reduce the amount of garbage on the streets . `` I think I 'm doing a lot . I 'm helping a lot because all those umbrellas and all those fabrics are going to end up in a landfill . ''

Charlot believes she is making a difference at home , too . `` By purchasing and buying one dress , a bag made out of a recycled umbrella , right there you 're showing your support , you 're doing something that is right , that is good for the environment , for you , for your kids , or for everybody , '' she said .
