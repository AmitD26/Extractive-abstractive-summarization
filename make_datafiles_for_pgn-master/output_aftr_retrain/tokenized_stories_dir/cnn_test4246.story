Alisa Medunjanin , a 30-year-old nurse , gave a tearful account of how she , her brother and their parents were awakened in the middle of the night by more than a dozen FBI agents who stormed into the family 's Queens , New York , apartment during a September 2009 raid .

She testified that she and her mother were later escorted to the lobby of the apartment building while federal agents questioned her father and brother .

Speaking through a Bosnian interpreter , Medunjanin 's mother , Favila , told jurors that FBI investigators showed up at her work and told her that her son should `` tell them what he knows . ''

Defense lawyers want to show that federal agents intimidated the family and unfairly coerced Adis Medunjanin into making incriminating statements .

Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and receiving terrorist training from al Qaeda .

Closing arguments are expected Thursday .
