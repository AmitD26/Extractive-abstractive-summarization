2 . You will see commercials featuring famous professional athletes , doing their best to persuade you to purchase the products they are endorsing .

Which brings us to a seldom-questioned oddity about contemporary life :

What do you think would happen if there was a highly publicized court case , and the defense lawyer asked the jury to acquit the defendant because of the emotional testimony of an eyewitness -- and the prosecutor announced that the witness had been paid a huge fee by the defense ?

Or :

How would you feel if you read an ecstatic movie review that made you want to run right down to the theater and buy a ticket -- and then it was reported that the reviewer had received a large check from the movie studio to make sure he gave the film a rave ?

You 'd want your money back . You 'd realize that the review meant less than nothing . The reviewer 's opinion of the movie was based not on genuinely admiring it , but on being paid to make you think it was good . If it turned out that the critic was taking money to say he liked certain films , his days as a reviewer would be over . And it would n't matter if he swore to you that he truly enjoyed the movie , and that the money had nothing to do with it .

What if a friend told you that you should go to an allegedly wonderful restaurant , and then you found out that he or she was being paid by the owner to send people there ? Chances are that your enthusiasm would wane -- both for the restaurant , and for the friend .

This is all elementary . If someone accepts cash in exchange for offering a positive evaluation of something , then the evaluation must be tossed out . It 's worse than meaningless .

Yet in the arena of celebrity endorsements -- most notably , endorsements by prominent athletes -- not only is the public 's disbelief suspended , but people do n't seem to particularly care that the recommendation is bought and paid for .

When I have tried over the years to make the case for the inherent undependability of these endorsements , people have said that yes , of course , that position is correct -- but that it does n't matter . When celebrities are paid to say they like something , studies show , it generally translates into increased sales for the companies that hire them .

Same thing with soft-drink bottlers and energy-bar manufacturers and pain-relief purveyors . The companies know that nothing sells with the public -- and particularly the young male segment of the public -- like a smiling word of affirmation from a top-tier athlete . So one company raises its offer , to be topped by a competing company , to be topped again until there is only one company remaining .

You ca n't blame the athletes for taking the money . Who would n't ?

And that conversely , in a sensible world , the only recommendations in which we should have any faith would be the ones for which athletes and celebrities were paid nothing at all .

`` I could n't have done it without my -LSB- insert brand name of shoe or energy drink -RSB- . And the funny thing is , they told me that they could n't pay me any money for this commercial . -LSB- Brand name of competing shoe or competing energy drink -RSB- offered me $ 40 million over 10 years to tell you that I like their -LSB- shoe or energy drink -RSB- , but the fact is I like this -LSB- shoe or energy drink -RSB- better . That 's why I 'm telling you to buy it -- because I buy it , too , and with my own money . ''
