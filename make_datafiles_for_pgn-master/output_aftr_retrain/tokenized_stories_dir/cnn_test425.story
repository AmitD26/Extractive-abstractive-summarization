-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal judge struck down key parts of a new Texas abortion law , considered among the most restrictive in the country , on Monday , one day before they were scheduled to take effect .

The lawsuit specifically targets requirements under the new law that doctors obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services , and usage controls on RU486 , a drug that induces abortions .

He also blocked a part of the law that deals with medication-induced abortions but allowed restrictions on the same issue to move forward . Provisions such as requiring strict use under Food and Drug Administration protocol and mandatory follow-up visits remain in place .

`` The medication-abortion provisions may not be enforced against any physician who determines , in appropriate medical judgment , to perform a medication-abortion using the off-label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother , '' Yeakel wrote .

Conservative groups were disappointed by the ruling .

The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis . Texas Gov. Rick Perry then called the legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill .

In response to the judge 's ruling , Perry vowed he and others will keep fighting .

If the state decides to appeal , the case would head next to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans .

He added : `` We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly-elected officials of our state , laws that reflect the will and values of Texans . ''
