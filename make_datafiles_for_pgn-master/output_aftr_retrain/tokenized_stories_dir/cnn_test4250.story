-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Identifying the moment when a political regime begins to decompose is as difficult as dating the onset of a recession . But in histories of the decline of the order built by Vladimir Putin in Russia , last Sunday 's parliamentary election is bound to feature prominently .

Almost as striking was the surge in backing for three opposition parties that until recently had seemed on their last legs . The Communists won 20 % , followed by the social democratic Just Russia party with 13 percent and Vladimir Zhirinovsky 's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats with 12 percent .

Putin 's regime is unlikely to collapse anytime soon . In many countries , leaders would be delighted to control 53 % of the legislature 's seats -- the share United Russia will receive after parties that failed to reach the 7 % threshold are eliminated .

But the election makes it official : The downward slide has begun . All previous ballots saw United Russia increase its vote . The party held 70 % of the seats in the last Duma , enough to change the constitution at will . Those days are gone . Speaking as results came in , a chastened President Dmitri Medvedev even uttered the dreaded word `` coalition . ''

Personally , Putin still enjoys the approval of 67 % of Russians . But his ratings , too , have been slipping . His peak -- 87 % approval -- came , oddly enough , in December 2007 , the month of the last parliamentary ballot . His negatives are also rising , with one-third of Russians now disapproving of his performance and 53 % faulting that of the government he leads .

Some members of the disaffected third were evidently among the sports fans at a martial arts fight last month who booed and jeered after Putin stepped into the ring to congratulate the winner . For Putin , himself a judo black belt , it was an unprecedented humiliation .

The souring mood has two main causes . First , the regime 's popularity has always rested on the buoyant economy of the oil boom years . From 2000 to 2008 , Russians ' real disposable income rose by more than 10 % a year on average . The global financial crisis put an end to that . Last year , massive government spending on pensions and public-sector wages boosted incomes by a little more than 4 % . But so far this year , disposable income has fallen .

Putin 's victory in next March 's presidential election remains all but assured . But the last two times he ran , in 2000 and 2004 , three months before the vote his ratings were respectively 79 and 81 % , far above their current level . This may be the hardest fight he has faced .

Whatever else they reveal , Sunday 's results undercut the image , common in the West , of Putin 's regime as an effective authoritarian state . In fact , it is a regime that can not even steal an election decisively .

Another option is to woo the masses with additional bursts of populist spending , at least until the presidential vote is over . Yet with the budget already swelled by anti-crisis measures , such a strategy is dangerous . The long-serving finance minister , Alexei Kudrin , was fired last September after publicly criticizing Medvedev 's plans to increase military expenditures .

That leaves the most likely outcome a continuing downward slide , perhaps temporarily slowed by improved economic performance or accelerated by striking government failures and scandals . The turbulence is just beginning .
