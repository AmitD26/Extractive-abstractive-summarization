Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Opposition fighters continued to push west , entering territory loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , but were quickly beaten back , rebels told CNN , as diplomats arrived Tuesday in London to discuss the crisis .

The setback for the rebels highlights the tenuous nature of their recent gains and suggests they might face more resistance in the days to come .

CNN could not independently confirm details of the report .

Earlier , a wounded rebel with bandages on the left side of his head and face described what happened Monday about 30 kilometers -LRB- nearly 20 miles -RRB- from Sirte , near the city 's main entrance .

Coalition officials say they are enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that creates a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians .

Taking Sirte would be a symbolic victory for the rebels , who regained control of several significant towns over the weekend as coalition airstrikes continued . Rebels said the fight to take over Sirte could be their toughest and bloodiest battle yet .

On Monday , opposition troops and Gadhafi 's security forces battled over the town of Nawfaliya . Rebel forces told CNN they had gained control of the city .

CNN could hear explosions and see plumes of smoke in the area of Nawfaliyah and Sirte .

In Misrata , where rebel fighters have said they have been under siege for weeks , CNN 's Nic Robertson saw evidence of heavy fighting and damage Monday when the government organized a trip for reporters to the city .

Government forces said they were in control of Misrata , though they did not allow Robertson and others into the city center , which rebels have said they control .

Meanwhile , diplomats from around the world began arriving in London Tuesday for a conference on the crisis in Libya .

More than 40 foreign ministers , representatives from regional groups and top diplomats are expected to attend , including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , British Prime Minister David Cameron , Chairman of the African Union Jean Ping and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .

U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a speech about Libya Monday , making his case for military intervention amid tough calls for him to clarify the United States ' role in the U.N.-authorized military mission .

He stressed the United States has a strategic interest in stopping the Libyan leader , and said `` history is not on Gadhafi 's side . ''

`` There are reports -- which go undenied -- that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on Gadhafi 's troops and support the military actions of rebels . There is an obvious controversy there , '' he told reporters in Moscow . `` We believe that the interference into what is , essentially , an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution . ''

Libyan government officials have also argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to Gadhafi .

`` The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them . And no one is even talking to them or saying , ` Where are you going ? ' or ` Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities ? ' '' Moussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli Sunday .

`` They are trying to weaken our spirits . They are not trying to protect civilians , '' he said .

Also Monday , video footage emerged online purporting to show forces loyal to Gadhafi abusing prisoners . CNN was not able to confirm the authenticity of the video or determine exactly when and where it was shot .

In the clip , soldiers are seen taunting and slapping prisoners , who are crouched in the back of a truck with their hands bound .

Qatar announced Monday that it would recognize the Transitional National Council , composed of opposition representatives , as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people .
