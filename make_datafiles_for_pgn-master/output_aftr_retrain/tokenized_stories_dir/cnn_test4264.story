The vote came the same day Pakistan 's Supreme Court ordered Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to face a contempt of court hearing this week , a notice related to the government 's failure to reopen thousands of corruption cases against politicians and bureaucrats , including President Asif Ali Zardari .

The resolution calls for support for the democratic system in general -- something a majority of lawmakers are unlikely to vote against -- without naming any political parties or individuals , suggesting that it was designed to bolster the government while avoiding the risk of hurting the prime minister or the PPP .

`` This house endorses and supports the efforts made by the political leadership for strengthening democracy and reposes full confidence and trust in them , '' part of the resolution reads .

Two days earlier , the embattled Pakistani president , Zardari , met with Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani -- a sign , some say , that shows tensions between Pakistan 's civilian and military leadership are cooling down .

The meetings came a day after Pakistani and British official denied a report that Gilani had contacted the British High Commission to express fears that a military coup was imminent in his country . Officials from both countries said such a call never took place .

Saturday 's meeting signaled an easing of tensions between the military and the president , said retired Brig. Mehmoud Shah .

During the prime minister 's meeting with leaders , he stressed that Pakistan 's sovereignty is non-negotiable , according to a news release .

`` We would reject any approach that would tend to compromise our sovereignty , honor and national dignity , '' Gilani said . `` Our contribution and steadfast commitment to stability and peace at home and in our region is unquestionable and second to none . ''

`` Together in complete harmony with each other and other vital institutions we can change the country 's destiny and accord , its rightful place in the comity of nations , '' he said .

Military officials did not immediately comment on the meetings and their outcomes .

The military and the government have been locked in an uneasy standoff after allegations of a secret effort by the government last year to ward off a possible military coup by curbing the army 's power with Washington 's help .

A Supreme Court panel also held a hearing Monday to investigate an unsigned memo sent to the Pentagon that allegedly called for Washington to help avert a military coup and curb the military 's powers .

The court is pushing the government to pursue old corruption charges against thousands of politicians and bureaucrats , including Zardari . The politicians were granted amnesty by a decree issued by then President Pervez Musharraf in 2007 .

In 2009 , the Supreme Court ruled the decree was unconstitutional , but the government has yet to pursue and reopen the cases .

The Supreme Court is running out patience and last week threatened to censure the government if it did not taking action -- including the possibility of disqualifying Gilani .
