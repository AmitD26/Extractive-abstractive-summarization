Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A decision on if researchers can study Junior Seau 's brain for clues to the NFL veteran 's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their Samoan culture , his family said Monday .

Seau , 43 , died of a gunshot wound at his Oceanside , California , home wound last week in what the coroner concluded was a suicide .

Seau 's parents , who are from the island of Aunu'u , American Samoa , were meeting Monday with Samoan elders , according to Shawn Mitchell , who was Seau 's pastor .

`` The Seau family is currently revisiting several important family decisions and placing them on hold in order to confer with their elders , '' a family statement said . `` All possibilities are being considered , but none will be acted upon until the Seaus arrive at an agreed upon direction . ''

While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests , among the institutions the family could donate Seau 's brain to is Boston University 's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy , the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits .

`` Him taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined , '' Mitchell said .

As a linebacker , Seau played `` the most havoc-ridden position on the team . He suffered many concussions , so there is a strong sense that it played a role , '' said Mitchell , who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers , the team for which Seau played 13 seasons .

Seau 's death follows last month 's suicide of former Atlanta Falcons safety Ray Easterling , the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit against the NFL over concussion-related injuries . The lawsuit names more than 1,000 professional players .

The NFL has repeatedly dismissed the lawsuit 's allegations that the league concealed links between football and brain injuries , saying player safety is a priority . `` Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit , '' it said .

Seau does not appear to have participated in any of the pending lawsuits against the NFL .

`` We ca n't know , '' unless Seau 's brain is analyzed in this way , whether his death was related to CTE , he said .
