Researchers found that women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who protectively had their ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian , fallopian tube , or peritoneal cancer by 80 % , and their overall risk of death by 77 % .

The new research provides doctors with additional information to support the risk-reducing surgery , said ovarian cancer expert Dr. Shannon Westin .

Westin is an assistant professor in the Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston . She was not involved in the study .

According to the American Cancer Society , previous studies have shown that removing the ovaries of a premenopausal woman with BRCA mutations can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by 85 % to 95 % , and the risk of breast cancer is cut by 50 % to 60 % .

`` To me , waiting to have oophorectomy until after 35 is too much of a chance to take , '' said Steven Narod , professor of medicine at the University of Toronto in Canada , and the study 's lead author . `` These data are so striking that we believe prophylactic oophorectomy by age 35 should become a universal standard for women with BRCA1 mutations . ''

BRCA mutations grabbed national headlines last year when actress Angelina Jolie announced she carries a mutation of the BRCA1 gene and had underwent a preventive double mastectomy at age 37 to reduce her risk of breast caner .

Jolie 's mother , actress and producer Marcheline Bertrand , died of ovarian cancer in 2007 at the age of 56 .

`` My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer , although the risk is different in the case of each woman , '' Jolie wrote in a New York Times op-ed article in May .

`` Once I knew that this was my reality , I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much I could , '' she said . `` I started with the breasts , as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer , and the surgery is more complex . ''

Dr. Agustin Garcia , an associate professor of Clinical Medicine at Keck Medicine of University of Southern California , said another important aspect of the study is how it breaks down the differences researchers saw between BRCA1 and BRCA 2 carriers .

`` These results could make a real difference for women with BRCA mutations , who face tough decisions about whether and when to undergo a prophylactic oophorectomy , '' Don Dizon , a member of the cancer communications committee at the American Society of Clinical Oncology , said in a statement .

`` Importantly , for women who will be undergoing this surgery early in life , it 's reassuring to see that it carries long-lasting benefits , substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk , '' he added .
