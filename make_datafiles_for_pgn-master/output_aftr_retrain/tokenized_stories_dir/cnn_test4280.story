5 . Tour package organizer

When Ludus Tours organizes trips to events such as Oktoberfest in Munich , Germany , or the recent Winter Olympics in Vancouver , Canada , someone needs to make sure that the clients are having a good time .

Karen Hoxmeier of Murrieta , California , not only benefits from finding a good bargain -- she gets paid to pass it along . What started out more than a decade ago as a hobby has developed into MyBargainBuddy.com , a website devoted to great deals , coupon codes and other ways to save .
