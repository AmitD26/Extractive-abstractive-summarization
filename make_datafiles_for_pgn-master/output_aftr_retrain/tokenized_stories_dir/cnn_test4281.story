The Local Coordination Committees of Syria , which opposes the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , said the pro-government Shabiha militia tortured Ghanaja to death and `` set his house on fire to destroy the evidence of their heinous crime . '' The killing comes amid tensions between Syria and Hamas and sectarian strife inside Syria .

Hamas official Ahmad Yousef said Israel could be behind the attack . `` Because of the political and security vacuum on the ground , it will be for Israel 's interest to take advantage and conduct something to that extent , '' he said .

`` He was not one of the greatest saints of our generation , '' he said .

It is expected that Ghanaja will be buried in Jordan , Hamas sources said .

`` The brother Abu Mujahid served his lifetime devoting himself for the path of God in the ranks of the Islamic Resistance Movement , Hamas , and in the service of the Palestinian cause and his people , '' the group said .

But the movement 's senior officials decided to leave Syria as the 15-month-long uprising against the al-Assad regime intensified , leaving a `` security vacuum , '' Hamas ' Yousef said .

The Hamas offices remain open in Damascus , and lower-level officials -- some of whom have ties to Syria , such as family -- handle daily business , he said .

Jordan 's King Abdullah II met with Hamas Politburo Chief Khaled Mashaal and his delegation on Thursday to discuss a range of issues , Jordan 's state-run news agency Petra said .

The Local Coordination Committees said the Ghanaja `` assassination '' is the latest example of Syrian-Palestinian sectarian violence fomented by the government .

The pro-regime militia called Shabiha has been entering Palestinian refugee camps under the guise of `` safeguarding the camps '' but they `` commit murder and engage in kidnapping , '' the Local Coordination Committees said . It said the regime is recruiting `` drug dealers , drug users , and other criminals '' into the militia .

The group said the Syria 's `` rejectionist policies '' toward Israel `` have only been attempts to enslave the people . ''

`` The Palestinian experiences in the past demonstrate that the Syrian regime views the Palestinian people as mere cards with which to gamble , regionally and internationally . A regime that kills its own people will not shy away from spilling Palestinian blood for the sake of its own survival , '' the Local Coordination Committees said .

CNN 's Saad Abedine , Kareem Khadder and Guy Azriel contributed to this report .
