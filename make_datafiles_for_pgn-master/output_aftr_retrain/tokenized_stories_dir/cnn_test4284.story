Poland has a lot riding on the tournament it is co-hosting with Ukraine , and is no stranger to football violence .

Even before that incident , UEFA , European football 's governing body , had criticized Poland for football violence which it said was ruining the country 's reputation .

However police in the capital have spent years preparing for Euro 2012 and reducing the potential of trouble from homegrown and international football hooligans . Like all major international events terrorism is the main security concern .

`` The sites that needed to be renovated for the tournament have also been completed . And now it 's a time to put all that we have done into practice . ''

The new National Stadium in Warsaw hosted a friendly match between Poland and Portugal in February this year , when the local police force was able to test their readiness . It was called a success by UEFA .

`` We are absolutely the best prepared for Euro 2012 and welcome everybody who wants not only to see football games , but also to see how hospitable we are and how beautiful the country is . ''

`` The less we are visible and less we need to act the better the event will be as it will show that Euro 2012 will be a very safe event , '' says Sokolowski .
