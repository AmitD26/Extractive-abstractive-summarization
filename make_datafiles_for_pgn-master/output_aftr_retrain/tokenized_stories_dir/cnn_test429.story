Tokyo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The return of electricity spread slowly Saturday across northern Japan , where hundreds were injured and tens of thousands remained without power after one of the strongest aftershocks following last month 's devastating earthquake struck the region .

Nearly 250,000 were still waiting for their lights to come on as crews rushed to repair damaged water and gas lines .

At least 283 people were injured by Thursday 's 7.1-magnitude aftershock alone . It was blamed for two deaths ; intial reports indicated a few more deaths , though the causes of those could not be directly tied to the aftershock .

Communities across northern Japan planned to hold solemn commemorations Monday , including moments of silence to mark one month since the disaster struck .

`` We should not be surprised to have magnitude-7 level aftershocks even a year afterward anywhere as wide as east Japan in the wake of such mega-quake of magnitude 9 , '' said Satoko Oki of the Earthquake Research Institute of Tokyo University .

ANA said it will make three `` relief '' flights daily to and from Tokyo 's Haneda airport , while rival Japan Airlines said it will operate three flights a day into the airport from Tokyo and Osaka .

Currently , the airlines believe that , at the earliest , they will be able to restore regular service by the end of May .
