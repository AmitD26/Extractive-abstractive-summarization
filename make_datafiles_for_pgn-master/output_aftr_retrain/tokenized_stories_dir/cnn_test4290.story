As much as I have come to abhor Joe Paterno 's indifference and arrogance and self-serving loyalty -LRB- to himself and his image and his stupid little football program -RRB- , I fail to see how digging out a statue does anything but conflict with -LRB- what should be -RRB- one of the most important elements of higher education : Open and honest and intelligent dialogue . Were I in command of this decision , not only would I make certain the statue stays , I 'd surround it with flood lights and fireworks and hire Flavor Flav to hype its very presence . `` Come one , come all ! Camp out ! Bring classmates ! Observe the bronze Joe Paterno ! Debate away ! ''

Mostly , we need to discuss statues themselves -- and what they reflect . The reason Jerry Sandusky was able to perpetrate his evil is because at Penn State -LRB- as at hundreds of other Division I schools across America -RRB- sports have exceeded academics in importance . The athletic programs are responsible for large dollars ; for large enrollments ; for national attention ; for eternal glory . They are not to be stopped or interfered with or questioned .

That 's pathetic .

Bronze Joe Paterno needs to stay because , deep within his metallic eyeballs , there is a story to be told . Years and years from now , when most of us are gone and this scandal is merely a blip in history , he will hopefully serve as the essential reminder that , once upon a time , we deified people for their ability to win ultimately meaningless and trivial games .

And we paid a dear price for doing so .
