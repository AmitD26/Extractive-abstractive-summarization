-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Within 24 hours , Joe Paterno 's statue at Penn State University came down and his record as the winningest coach at the top level of college football disappeared .

` Stark wake-up call ' with $ 60 million fine for Penn State

The NCAA sanctions included a $ 60 million fine against Penn State , a four-year ban from bowl games and the loss of 20 football scholarships .

Perhaps most painful to the Paterno family and his fans was the removal of 14 seasons of football victories , covering 1998-2011 , which cost Paterno the record as winningest coach in Division 1 history .

`` In our minds and hearts , those victories are still there and they still count , which is what makes him a great coach , '' said Penn State graduate Ujas Patel , who heads the university 's alumni association chapter in London .

Do sanctions alter history books on Penn State and Paterno 's legacy ?

Freeh 's report held four top Penn State officials , including Paterno , responsible for failing to stop the abuse . That failure began in 1998 , according to the report .

Paterno 's family called the penalties premature and challenged the veracity of Freeh 's investigation .

`` Punishing past , present and future students of the university because of Sandusky 's crimes does not serve justice , '' the Paterno family 's statement said . `` This is not a fair or thoughtful action ; it is a panicked response to the public 's understandable revulsion at what Sandusky did . ''

Others with strong ties to the Penn State community also condemned the NCAA sanctions .

`` We expected large sanctions but this is overkill , '' said Daniel Byrd , president of the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the PSU Alumni Association , in a e-mail to CNN .

Byrd praised some of the penalties , such as $ 60 million the university will give to groups helping victims of child sex abuse , but he argued that the cut in football scholarships and four-year ban from bowl games `` benefit nobody . ''

Across the Atlantic , Patel said the penalties unfairly target the future of the football program that he described as vital to the university .

Experts : What happens to Penn State football ?

`` I do n't see the program recovering in the next 10 to 15 years , '' he told CNN by telephone , adding that `` by essentially taking away the main pillar of the university , you are almost pulling the university down . ''

`` They can take away whatever games they want to , I know I was apart of win 400 , 409 and all the other games WE won while at PSU , '' posted former wide receiver Derek Moye on Twitter .

Supporters of the tough sanctions sounded equally vehement , at least according to online comments to CNN .

`` I don -LRB- ' -RRB- t think the defenders of Joe Paterno and Penn State here fully comprehend the barely imaginable severity of the CRIMES that were committed , '' wrote a reader with the online handle FlyingfFish . `` Not just crimes by Sandusky , but by nearly all of Penn State 's football and academic leadership . This was -LRB- literally -RRB- institutional sanctioning of child rape for the continued benefit of the football team . I can not think of anything lower or more despicable . Penn State is getting what they deserve . ''

Byrd , who leads the oldest of the university 's scores of alumni associations around the world , disagreed .

`` Rodney Erickson and any one else who signed off on these sanctions should resign today , '' said Byrd 's e-mail to CNN .

While the university removed Paterno 's statue from public view , the university library that bears his name will remain unchanged .

To Patel , the university is trying to get rid of Paterno 's football legacy while conserving his academic legacy . He complained of media coverage that focused solely on the Sandusky scandal and Paterno 's failure to intervene while ignoring how Paterno required his players to succeed in the classroom as well as on the football field .

Patel , who completed six years at Penn State in 2008 with a graduate degree in aerospace engineering , said he has kept in touch with college friends by phone and e-mail ever since . The main topic is always the same -- Penn State football .

`` Once you graduate , '' he explained , `` it ties back to the football program . ''
