With the 2012 elections approaching , we again wanted to include artists in our coverage of a major news event . Artists provide unique insight and provoke thought , conversation and community in a critical way and are especially vital during such important times for our country and our world .

We then reached out to a broad yet select group of artists representing different , influential perspectives in the art world and the broader community and asked them to submit work and participate in building the gallery with us .

Our search began in the spring when we met Brad Downey , an exciting American performance artist who was in Atlanta for a collaboration with flux projects . After watching a presentation of his work -- which included videos of creative street art that many would call vandalism -- we asked if he 'd be interested in contributing to `` Power , '' the only caveat being that he could n't vandalize anything .

The work he submitted is provocative -- a photograph of a CCTV camera on a pole in Karl Marx Allee in Berlin that appears to be on fire . His statement for `` CCTV Sacrifice '' sums up his approach : `` Some people say the world will end in fire , while others say it will end with ice . FREEZE , we are watching you ! '' -LRB- Downey promises us that nothing was damaged and no laws were broken in producing his work . -RRB-

Another video performance artist we 're excited about featuring is Liz Magic Laser . Her `` Push Poll '' video , complete with actors , a focus group moderator and a pop-up newsroom in New York 's Chinatown , `` explores the power of polls to influence public opinion and the persuasive effects of the so-called ` man on the street ' news segments . ''

Jarnot , a French illustrator whose work has appeared in major publications and ad campaigns , took part in `` Ripple . '' His work this year features `` over-smiley portraits '' of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney , which he says represent `` violence and power in a fight between ... two different energies . ''

This is only a taste of what you 'll find in `` Power , '' our effort to create a space in which different voices can be heard in ways other than words .

We hope it will be thought provoking , and we invite you to join the conversation by posting your comments on the gallery .
