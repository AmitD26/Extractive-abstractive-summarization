`` The results we found in hamsters are consistent with what we know about depression in humans , '' Tracy Bedrosian , the first author the on the new study , told reporters .

Mood disorders are by no means the only health condition linked to artificial lighting and screen time at night . Earlier this year , the American Medical Association -LRB- AMA -RRB- put out a disturbing summary of adverse health effects from nighttime lighting , noting that artificial lights disrupt circadian rhythms and alter the body 's normal hormonal responses .

In particular , when people spend too little time in darkness , it seems that the body suppresses release of the hormone melatonin , which -- among other things -- is thought to fight tumor growth and cancers . Other health conditions affected by changes in circadian rhythms , according to the AMA report , may include obesity , diabetes and reproductive problems .

`` The good news is that people who stay up late in front of the television and computer may be able to undo some of the harmful effects just by going back to a regular light-dark cycle and minimizing their exposure to artificial light at night , '' Bedrosian says . `` That 's what the results we found in hamsters would suggest . ''

Those animals ' depressive symptoms , at least , went away once the hamsters returned to a schedule that included eight full hours of total darkness per day .

Bedrosian and her colleagues say that , among humans , exposure to artificial lighting at night has surged over the past 50 years , a trend that happens to coincide with large increases in depression prevalence .

For their study , the Ohio State researchers also investigated molecular mechanisms that may cause the brain changes associated with nighttime lighting . The scientists found that a cell-signaling protein , or cytokine , known as a hippocampal TNF -LRB- tumor necrosis factor -RRB- played a limited role .
