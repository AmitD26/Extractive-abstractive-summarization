Officer Ben Tobias announced that the Gainesville police department charged Pedro Bravo with the death of Christian Aguilar . He did not offer further details .

Ron Kozlowski , one of Bravo 's attorneys , told CNN on Friday night that he has `` not been presented with any new evidence thus far . '' Bravo 's family is distraught and worried about the murder charge , Kozlowski added .

The 18-year-old Aguilar was last seen about 6 p.m. September 20 , according to a police statement .

His body still has n't been recovered , said Tobias , who urged the public to reach out to authorities with any information on the case .

`` Christian 's family is heartbroken , as expected , '' the police spokesman told CNN by e-mail .

Bravo told investigators that he 'd gotten into `` an altercation with Aguilar '' on the night the college student went missing , police said . Bravo then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city , prompting police to warn that Aguilar may be disoriented and/or seriously injured .

Authorities have used helicopters and K-9 units to search for Aguilar , to no avail . The young man 's family members , meanwhile , have plastered the area with fliers , taken to Twitter to generate leads and invited a nonprofit search group to help look for him alongside family members and police .

Gainesville police posted a fresh plea Friday night , on the department 's Facebook page , asking volunteers to report to the Florida Farm Bureau at 9 a.m. Saturday to resume the search for Aguilar .

The lawyer said his client will make his first court appearance Saturday morning . At that time , a judge will assess the case and set bail for Bravo or decline to , thus assuring that the suspect will remain in custody .
