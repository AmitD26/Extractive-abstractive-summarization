It had been a place of innocence , a haven where boys and girls learned , laughed and played .

Now , it was a place of shock and sorrow , a grisly crime scene .

The shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary shattered sleepy Newtown and it shattered America 's notions of what constitutes a safe place .

It happened just days after a gunman shot three people , killing two of them , at an Oregon mall filled with Christmas shoppers . For three days that place also became a crime scene .

Timeline : School violence in the U.S. .

There have been other recent slaughters that have rattled America including one at an Arizona shopping center where people came to meet Rep. Gabrielle Giffords .

These are not places of darkness . They are not places where people expect the worst of mankind to surface .

`` There really is no safe place . That is just our imagination , '' said Daniela Schreier , a forensic and clinical psychologist at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology .

Places like the Newtown school are part of an assumptive world , said psychologist Robin Gurwitch of Duke University Medical Center . They are places where people take their safety for granted .

`` Events like the Connecticut school shooting shatter that notion and we are left reeling . '' Gurwitch said . `` What we held as our ideal has now been turned upside down . ''

`` Our hearts , '' he said , `` are broken today .

It 's not that violence has not occurred in elementary schools before .

In 1989 , a 24-year-old drifter aimed his AK-47 and killed five children on an elementary school playground in California . As far back as 1959 , a convict exploded a suitcase of dynamite on a school playground in Houston and killed five people , including three children .

But the school shootings that have made recent headlines , starting with Columbine in 1999 , have mainly occurred at high schools . The fact that the Connecticut shootings , one of the deadliest in U.S. history , involved such young children makes the tragedy that much harder to fathom , Gurwitch said .

`` You have to tell yourself that , '' Schreier said . `` Otherwise you will never go to a mall or to a school . ''

It 's already intimidating enough with metal detectors everywhere from airports to libraries .

As horrific as the Newtown shootings are , the reality is that most schools in America still are safe , said Howard Kassinove , director of the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Anger and Aggression .

He likened it to a news story about a shark attack .

`` What you have is this notion of one person being bitten by a shark in Australia and the news goes around the world and all of a sudden , you think shark bites are prevalent , '' he said .

Friday 's shooting was almost instantly on television : images of horror repeated many times . That is why , perhaps , that some people worry more , Kassinove said .

And they become anxious .

`` It was only a week ago we were talking about this type of situation and I said the chances of it happening are one in a zillion at Sandy Hook , '' he said . `` I was wrong about that . ''

`` It 's funny -- a bomb hit and there is a lot of smoke and it 's still here , '' he said . `` I have n't had enough time to really plan , but hopefully by the time they do go back to school , I will have done a good enough job of making them feel as comfortable -LRB- as I can -RRB- . ''
