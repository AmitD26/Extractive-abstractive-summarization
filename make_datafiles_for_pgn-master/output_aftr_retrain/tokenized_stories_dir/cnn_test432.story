-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- So your daughter will just die if she does n't wear a princess costume for Halloween ? And of course it has to be pink . And every little girl you know wants to be a princess for Halloween , except for the neighborhood tomboy down the street ?

Is this desire to be a princess hardwired ? Do girls just come that way , wanting to look pretty in pastels ? And does this explain why teenage and adult women are drawn to `` feminine '' careers , and likely to be less competitive in sports and at work than their male counterparts ?

That 's what some research scientists think .

The bottom line , according to this school of thought , is that it does n't much matter how parents raise girls . Their paths are predetermined before birth .

There 's little point in giving girls gender-neutral toys or encouraging them to think beyond their wedding day . Most girls will naturally gravitate toward pink princess dresses and white wedding dress fantasies , and most women will avoid traditionally `` masculine '' activities and aspirations .

We found that the level of testosterone exposure in utero did have a small effect on how adult women described their personalities . On average , women exposed to more testosterone reported being less passive and were more likely to exhibit `` go-getter '' personalities . But this only explained about 4 % of the differences in the adult women 's personalities .

Far more important , indeed two to three times as important , was what parents had encouraged their daughters to do and be . Women who were more assertive and confident as adults were much more likely to report that their parents had encouraged them to be active and independent .
