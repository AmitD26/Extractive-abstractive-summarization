Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf pledged in a speech Sunday to return to his country later this month , despite word from authorities that he will be arrested when he does so .

He pledged to return between January 27 and 30 .

`` They are bound to execute the order unless a higher court sets aside the orders , '' Ali said , adding that Musharraf is accused of conspiring in the assassination .

Musharraf 's attorney , Chaudry Faisal , said the threat of arrest is politically motivated and has no legal bearing . The warrant is being challenged in court , the attorney said .

The former president said Sunday that he will return even at the risk of his life . Speaking to CNN after addressing the crowd in Karachi , Musharraf said he had declined to provide a specific date because of security concerns . He spoke about the possibility of arrest , but said he expects he will be fine , so long as `` the judiciary plays its just role , and there are no interruptions . ''

`` There is a vacuum in Pakistan of trustworthy leaders , which is being filled by others . To exploit this vacuum , I have to be back now , '' Musharraf said .

He described his support as scattered , and said he needs to build it again from the ground up .

`` This is a do-or-die moment for me and my party . I need to muster all the support I can , '' he said .

`` President Musharraf told me that although the possibility of arrest is there -- there is no way of knowing what will happen , and how dangerous the situation is , until one jumps into the situation head first , '' he said .

Elections are set to take place in Pakistan next year ; Musharraf intends to run .

On Sunday , he told Pakistanis that other politicians have failed leading the country , but `` I succeeded 100 % . ''

Musharraf resigned in 2008 as the country 's ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him . He was succeeded by Asif Zardari , Bhutto 's widower .

In 2010 , the United Nations released a report that said Musharraf 's government had failed to protect Bhutto before her 2007 assassination .

Bhutto 's assassination turned public opinion strongly against Musharraf in 2008 and led to his resignation and self-exile in London .

In 2010 , Musharraf said the timing of his return to Pakistan would depend on the environment there .
