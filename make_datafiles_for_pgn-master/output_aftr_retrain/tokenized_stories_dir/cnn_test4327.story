-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man is nothing if not mercurial .

He spoke to reporters via a Ustream video from an immigration detention center in Guatemala City . McAfee emerged in that capital to ask for asylum last week , after weeks of living in hiding . His bid was rejected , but a Guatemalan judge granted a stay of deportation .

`` Our intent is to return to America , if at all possible , and settle down to whatever normal life we can settle down to under the circumstances , '' said McAfee . `` There is no hope for my life if I am ever returned to Belize . ''

`` I believed then , and I believe even stronger now that the intent to question me has nothing to do with Mr. Faull 's murder , '' said McAfee .

He also explained why he was taken to a police hospital last week , the same day his asylum bid was rejected .

`` At 67 years old , well , your health is not the best no matter what . However , it is improving . The problem I had the other day is I did not eat for two days , I drank very little liquids and for the first time in many years , I 've been smoking almost nonstop . I stood up , passed out , hit my head on the wall , came to in total confusion , '' he said . `` I am fine now . ''

His legal team initially said he was treated for cardiovascular problems , though his attorney later said McAfee suffered a nervous breakdown and that tests had shown he did not have heart issues .

Sunday 's developments are just the latest in a story that reads like a bestselling mystery , complete with murder , poisoned dogs and international intrigue .

McAfee founded his computer security software company , McAfee Associates , in 1987 , initially running it from his home in California . Seven years later , he sold his stake in the company . He moved to Belize in 2008 .

Two days after the dogs were poisoned , Faull 's body was found , fatally shot in the head .
