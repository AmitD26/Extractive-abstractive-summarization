-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the Arab Spring to a global economic crisis to the killing of Osama bin Laden , 2011 has been defined by historic and dynamic events that will shape the world in the years ahead .

A revolt across the Middle East and North Africa began with the self-immolation of a struggling merchant in Tunisia and spread across the region . Egyptian protesters toppled the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak , and rebels in Libya battled against supporters of long-time strongman Moammar Gadhafi .

Gadhafi was eventually killed in October after months on the run from rebel forces and NATO bombardments .

The significance of the Arab Spring is indisputable , but was it the biggest story of the year ?

The long-term effects from the stricken plant remain unknown .

Natural disasters hit the United States hard , too . The largest tornado outbreak ever recorded swept across across the South , Midwest and Northeast -- with a record 207 touching down on April 27 and killing 346 people . Alabama bore the brunt of the destruction , with a massive twister turning the college town of Tuscaloosa into a disaster zone .

Three weeks later , a mile-wide tornado ripped through Joplin , Missouri , killing more than 150 people and wreaking havoc across the blue-collar town at the edge of the Ozark Mountains . It marked the deadliest single tornado in 60 years .

From Washington to New York residents in August braced for Hurricane Irene , a powerful storm that forecasters feared would cause catastrophic damage . The storm weakened before landfall , but it still was blamed for at least 20 deaths in eight states .

For President Barack Obama , the bin Laden raid marked a high point of his presidency . Sometimes considered soft on terror , Obama achieved something his predecessor failed to do : bring the terror mastermind to justice .

As the U.S. saw unemployment hit 9 percent , the Occupy Wall Street movement -- a grassroots protest against policies favoring the richest 1 % -- spread to dozens of cities across the country and Europe .

Meanwhile , Republican presidential candidates looked to seize their campaign to retake the White House in 2012 . In October , former VP candidate Sarah Palin and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie disappointed supporters by saying they would n't run , and by early December the GOP field seemed to be down to two serious contenders : Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich .

A car bomb exploded in Oslo targeting government buildings , while miles away , an armed man opened fire on a youth leadership camp , killing 77 .

Casey Anthony was found not guilty in Florida in her daughter 's death , while Conrad Murray was convicted in the death of superstar Michael Jackson .

Charlie Sheen 's raging narcissism captivated the nation for a couple weeks as his bizarre behavior prompted his TV bosses to fire him from `` Two and a Half Men '' . Other bad boys popped into the news : Rep. Anthony Weiner of New York tweeted a picture of himself in his underwear and soon was forced to resign , and Maria Shriver filed for divorce from Arnold Schwarzenegger after a family housekeeper came forward about her love child with the former California governor .

Scandal struck far and wide in 2011 . Dominique Strauss-Kahn , once seen as a future leader of France , quit as head of the International Monetary Fund after he was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper in New York -- a charge that was later dropped . British tabloids run by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch were hit by a phone hacking scandal that resulted in the flagship News of the World folding .

Yet not all news was bad in 2011 . The world got a brief respite from doom-and-gloom headlines in April when Prince William and Catherine Middleton wed at Westminster Abbey .

Their wedding was one of the most-watched events of the year -- from TV to the Internet . On the streets of London , many captured royal images on their mobile devices and instantly shared them with friends .

Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in October . His final words , according to his sister , were `` Oh wow . Oh wow . Oh wow ! ''

Fitting words for 2011 .
