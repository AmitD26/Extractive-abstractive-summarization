-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Armed men attacked a displaced persons camp in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo early Sunday , raping women and looting at a facility where tens of thousands of people have taken refuge , a U.N. official said .

Simplice Kpandji , a spokesman for the United Nations ' refugee agency , said it was unclear whether anyone had been killed at the camp , which is about 10 kilometers from Goma , the border city that has been a flashpoint for fighting between government troops and the M23 rebel group .

The Mugunga III camp houses more than 30,000 displaced people , many of whom fled to the camp when rebels advanced on Goma , Kpandji said . The attackers ' identity was unknown , he said , and officials were working on gathering more information .

Fighters from the M23 rebel group boarded trucks and other vehicles to head north to outside of the 20 kilometer buffer zone stipulated by regional leaders , U.N. peacekeepers in Congo said in a statement .

Earlier they had begun leaving Sake , a town to the west of Goma . M23 rebels also left their posts at the border crossing with Rwanda .

`` We welcome this withdrawal , but emphasize that this is an early step and that stability in the region remains very fragile , '' said Kieran Dwyer , spokesperson for U.N. peacekeepers .

Regional leaders and the African Union had called for the rebels ' withdrawal from Goma , supposed to have been completed by Thursday , as a condition of starting negotiations .

The regional leaders ' plan foresees an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at Goma airport , Ugandan Gen. Aronda Nyakairima said earlier this week . It would include a 100-strong neutral force , which would be in command , 100 troops from the Congolese army , and 100 members of the M23 , Nyakairima said .

Two military observers would also be deployed from each of the neighboring regional powers , while MONUSCO would be responsible for securing the buffer zone outside Goma , he said .

Why Congo needs our help

However , they broke away from the Congolese army in April , complaining they were n't being promoted as promised , and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions .

The latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern DR Congo , a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east , Uganda and Rwanda .
