Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Texas GOP upstart Ted Cruz claimed victory Tuesday with a familiar tea party rallying cry .

`` Millions of Texans and Americans are rising up to reclaim our country , to defend liberty and to restore the Constitution , '' he told supporters .

Cruz claims victory in Texas runoff

`` Politicians cut deals ; principled conservatives deliver , '' is the way a Cruz television ad summed up his message .

Democratic Senate leaders reacted to Cruz 's primary win with a warning : If he wins the general election in November , gridlock in the Senate will be even worse than it is now .

`` Anyone elected to the Senate who starts off by saying ` I wo n't compromise ' is n't going to help us , '' Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin told CNN .

`` You know what the Senate is like , '' said Durbin . `` One senator stands up and says no , we stop the train , until we figure out how to bring that senator around . ''

And Cruz would n't be the only possible new senator willing to do that . In Indiana , Richard Mourdock beat veteran Republican incumbent Sen. Richard Lugar , vowing confrontation over compromise .

Lugar 's loss further polarizes Senate

`` What I 've said is , and what I continue to believe , certainly , is one side or the other must prevail . And I 'm hoping this candidacy will help move the Republican Party forward to become a permanent majority , '' Mourdock said the day before his GOP primary win in May .

The Senate was already bound to be a more polarized place next year because so many moderates chose to leave . Nearly half a dozen from both parties are retiring this year , including Sen. Olympia Snowe , R-Maine ; Sen. Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut ; Sen. Ben Nelson , D-Nebraska ; Sen. Kent Conrad , D-North Dakota and Sen. Jim Webb , D-Virginia .

Still , it 's an open question whether tea party rhetoric on the campaign trail translates into action in office .

`` Ted Cruz is going to be a new voice , and he 's going to be a variable that we do n't know what to expect -LRB- from -RRB- yet , '' said Bonjean . `` He can hold everything up if he wants to or he can go against the Senate Republican leadership . ''

That streak continues this year with Cruz . DeMint told CNN the political action committee he started and still advises gave Cruz $ 2 million in addition to critical help with the conservative grassroots .

'' -LRB- When -RRB- Ted Cruz comes in ... I think he can help empower some of the Democrats to make those hard decisions , '' DeMint told CNN .

The South Carolina lawmaker believes the more staunch conservatives in the Senate , the more Democrats will be forced to compromise and come the GOP 's way .

`` I think there are enough Democrats , if we have a strong mandate election , who will work with people like Ted Cruz and -LRB- Sen. -RRB- Marco Rubio and -LRB- Sen. -RRB- Pat Toomey and these senators here , in a sensible way to change the course of our country , '' said DeMint . `` The good news is this : because the rest of the world is in such bad shape , if we make a few hard decisions about fixing our tax code , fixing our entitlements so that we 're on a sustainable course , America could be the best place to do business overnight . ''

Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , is the man in charge of electing enough Republicans to the Senate to take the majority . In a Capitol hallway conversation , even he nodded and smiled in agreement with the notion that it 's a lot easier to coordinate and control the caucus when you 're in the majority .

It 's a problem he and Sen. Mitch McConnell , the current Senate minority leader , relish having .
