Editor 's note : Wayne LaPierre has served as the executive vice president and chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association of America since 1991 . His latest book is `` The Global War on Your Guns : Inside the U.N. Plan to Destroy the Bill of Rights . ''

Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war is n't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S.

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Here 's a summary for the time - or attention-challenged : Never surrender freedom for laws that ca n't affect criminals ; they disobey laws for a living .

Now we do . It 's the drug-driven death and violence in Mexico at the hands of ruthless criminal cartels .

Barely a month on the job , Holder cited the Mexican cartel killings as the excuse to resurrect the Clinton gun ban .

Even earthworms learn from experience

Ask any anti-gun politician to define an `` assault weapon , '' and the honest answer is , `` I know one when I see one . ''

The gun-ban lobby and national media lied with lockstep conformity by playing endless footage of fully automatic machine gun fire . They fooled the American people and the U.S. Congress into thinking they were banning `` high-powered , '' `` rapid-fire , '' `` battlefield-bred '' guns designed to `` spray fire from the hip . ''

None of that was true .

Then Sen. Dianne Feinstein convened anti-gun bureaucrats to conduct a firearm beauty pageant . They browsed photos of hundreds of perfectly legal semiautomatic rifles . They picked 19 they deemed most military looking . And they banned them .

Nor are they the choice of terrorists in Afghanistan or drug gangs in Mexico . They prefer fully automatic machine guns , which our soldiers use .

Congress was so doubtful about the ban 's effectiveness , they limited it to a 10-year experiment . So it expired in 2004 , and for good reason . It was useless all along .

Nobody can substantiate claims that U.S. guns cross the border `` by the thousands '' or `` account for 95 % of weapons used by Mexican drug gangs . '' Because it 's not true .

Replying to Feinstein in subcommittee hearings last week , William Hoover , assistant director of field operations at the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , said , `` The investigations we have , that we see , for firearms flowing across the border do n't show us individuals taking thousands of guns a day or at a time flowing into Mexico . ''

Yet reporter after politician after news anchor parrot the lie as readily as high schoolers gossip , and with equal disregard for truth .

That 's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our `` weak laws '' -LRB- read : freedoms -RRB- are to blame for `` fueling the violence '' in Mexico .

Well , to believe that :

• You have to believe Mexican drug lords -- who make Forbes magazine 's list of billionaires -- do n't get large lots of weaponry on the transnational black market but instead choose to trifle with paperwork at U.S. gun stores .

• You have to believe that narco-terrorists who buy fragmentation grenades , grenade launchers , explosives , body armor , biometric security equipment , infrared surveillance technology and intelligence-grade reconnaissance gear will salute and obey a new American gun law -- if only we 'd pass one .

Get real , get tough , but get away from our rights

Those that make possible Mexico 's colossal corruption wear the garb of not only drug lords and gun runners , but also of too many city mayors and police chiefs , state bureaucrats and military officers .

But leave American freedoms alone .
