`` Of course , '' he said .

Rock-Ola jukeboxes were gorgeous ; they were icons of the early days of rock and roll .

He assumed the same thing most people always assumed : `` Rock-Ola '' was a combination of `` rock and roll '' and `` Victrola , '' the storied brand of early phonograph-record players .

`` Nope , '' I said .

I had always thought the same thing . But then , years ago , I spoke with the founder of Rock-Ola .

But how did it become Snickers ?

Well , the Mars family , who introduced the candy bar , had a favorite horse they owned . Snickers . So when they needed to call the candy bar something ...

How about Q-tips ? Everyone knows what they are , but what does the name mean ?

A man named Leo Gerstenzang , in the 1920s , saw his wife applying cotton swabs to toothpicks . This gave him the idea to come up with a pre-made cotton swab for use with infants .

What about Conway Twitty , the late singer ? -LRB- I know we 're getting a little far afield here -- Twitty was a person , not a product -- but he was terrific , and his name begs the question . -RRB-

He was Harold Jenkins in the 1950s , trying to make it big in the recording industry , and finding that `` Harold Jenkins '' did n't exactly translate to thrills and excitement .

Soon his records were enormous hits in Rock-Ola jukeboxes from coast to coast .

Next up : Weejuns , the classic penny loafers made by the G. H. Bass shoe company .

It refers to a similar kind of shoe that was worn by Norwegian farmers . Norwegians : Weejuns , for short .

Haagen-Dazs ? A made-up combination of make-believe words to make a brand of ice cream sound Scandinavian and inviting . The words mean nothing at all . Except huge profits .

Popsicles , on the other hand , started out as Epsicles , named for their inventor , Frank Epperson . When he applied for a patent , the product was officially titled the Epsicle ice pop . His children , though , called this confection dreamed up by their dad -- their pop -- a Popsicle . Pop 's sicle .

Taco Bell ? In California after World War II , a fellow named Glen Bell decided to sell hamburgers from a stand . He called his store Bell 's Burgers .

He had some competitors nearby : a couple of brothers with their own stand . Last name McDonald . The brothers had a splendid hamburger product .

Bell arrived at the conclusion that , when it came to burgers , he probably could not outcook and outsell McDonald 's . So he chose another food specialty : tacos . He tried a few names before settling on a variation of Bell 's Burgers , altered to connote Mexican cuisine : Taco Bell .

Nehi soda pop .

The founder wanted customers to understand that his soda pop came in tall bottles , offering good value for the money . Knee-high bottles , to be hyperbolic . In marketing , hyperbolic is good . Thus : Nehi .

Its founder , John F. McCullough , liked to proudly proclaim to all who would listen that the cow was `` the queen of the dairy business . ''

He died in 1993 ; when I spoke with him , six years earlier , he was 90 . I told him that it must be really cool to be able to have a jukebox in his home -- especially one with his name on it .

No , he said . No jukebox in the Rockola home :
