Cairo 's stock exchange plunged amid the new turmoil , while Saturday 's images of the woman 's beating appeared to draw more people to the streets .

`` I will go down and fight the army and retrieve the honor of this woman and those martyrs killed for the sake of Egypt 's future , '' taxi driver Ahmed Fahmy told CNN .

The woman and a male companion were set upon by more than 20 police officers during Saturday 's demonstrations in Cairo . She been dressed in a traditional robe and headscarf -- but as police clubbed her and dragged her down the street , those items were pulled away , exposing her midriff and blue brassiere in a country known for its Islamic conservatism .

Then one of the police officers aimed a foot at her upper abdomen and stamped squarely on it , while another officer jumped on the man as he lay on the pavement nearby .

A CNN crew that managed to escape Saturday 's chaos witnessed other beatings , with children , the elderly and people on their way to work finding themselves on the end of police truncheons .

`` What was woman like her doing in a conflict zone ? '' asked the spokesman , Maj. Mohamed Askar . `` She must have participated in the attacks on the military and the Cabinet . ''

`` Our troops do not just attack people for no reason , '' he said . `` If she had nothing to hide then she would have presented herself . Where is she ? ''

Two people who know her , including the man seen being beaten alongside her in the video , told CNN the woman is a political activist and student . She does not want to speak to reporters now , but a journalist who saw the incident and was beaten as well said the woman suffered `` serious bruises and cuts '' as a result .

Some Egyptians questioned the authenticity of the video . Cairo businessman Shehab Ali said there was `` something fishy '' about it to him .

`` I grew up admiring our army and chanted , ` The army and the people , one hand , ' '' he said . `` This seems like the enemy . ''

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the reports of violence on Sunday and said her thoughts are with the families of those killed or injured .

`` I urge Egyptian security forces to respect and protect the universal rights of all Egyptians , including the rights to peaceful free expression and assembly ... Those who are protesting should do so peacefully and refrain from acts of violence , '' she said in a statement .

Tahrir Square has been the epicenter of anti-government demonstrations since last January , when the revolt against Mubarak began . Fresh protests sprouted in November , when the generals named Mubarak-era premier Kamal Ganzouri as a caretaker prime minister until parliamentary elections are complete .

Hundreds of police and troops swept through the plaza on Saturday , barricading nearby streets , chasing off protesters and setting tents on fire . Authorities arrested 14 people Friday and 150 on Saturday , nine of them women , said Adel Saeed , the spokesman for the general prosecutor 's office .

`` They have been accused of inciting violence , resisting arrest , throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks at security forces , burning public property , '' Saeed said .

Ganzouri criticized the unrest as an `` attack on revolution '' Saturday and condemned protesters for throwing stones and damaging public property . He also denied that security forces were using live ammunition against demonstrators .

The original manuscript of the `` description of Egypt '' and `` irreplaceable maps and historical manuscripts preserved by many generations since the building of the Scientific Center in August 1798 during the French Campaign '' were destroyed in the fire , Ganzouri said in a statement .
