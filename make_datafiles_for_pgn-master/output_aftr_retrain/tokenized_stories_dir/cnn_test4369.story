`` We are human beings , not animals , '' Mahmoud Al Houli told CNN by telephone . `` I would like to call for the international community and the U.N. to save our souls , to help us find a solution . We only want freedom . ''

`` We are very afraid that there will be another massacre , '' Al Houli added . `` Military reinforcements have been brought in , and artillery , and we are afraid that the massacre will happen again . ''

On Tuesday , a United Nations official said it was `` clear '' that Syrian government forces were involved in the slaughter last Friday , which he said was `` an abominable crime . ''

But Al Houli said more needed to be done to prevent further tragedy .

`` Four checkpoints have been set up around the town , and nothing can enter -- no food or medical supplies can come in . The electricity has been cut off . Things are desperate . ''

Al Houli told CNN he was at a protest rally in the town on Friday when members of the military opened fire .

`` We had a demonstration after Friday prayers , and all the men were there , '' he explained . `` The military started shooting at the demonstration . ''

`` After that , thugs from the regime came from the surrounding towns , to make a big massacre .

He said he believed the men who carried out the attack were trying to incite a sectarian conflict in the region .

As he spoke to CNN , a voice boomed from a loudspeaker nearby . `` Another person has died , '' he explained . `` They are making the announcement at the mosque . ''

Al Houli was clear who he held responsible for the tragedy in Houla . '' -LSB- President Bashar al - -RSB- Assad is a killer of children and women .

`` He needs to leave Syria and get out of the country -- that 's the best solution .

`` If he leaves , we can go back to normal life . ''
