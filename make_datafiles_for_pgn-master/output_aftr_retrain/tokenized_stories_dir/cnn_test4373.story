-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Digital cameras are now as common and affordable to the average family as the Polaroid of the '60s .

Here 's a roundup of 10 free , and mostly free , online tools for the budding digital photographer :

1 . Picnik -- Summed up from the site : `` Picnik makes your photos fabulous with easy to use yet powerful editing tools . Tweak to your heart 's content , then get creative with oodles of effects , fonts , shapes , and frames . '' If you already use Flickr for your photos -LRB- here 's what I do with mine -RRB- , you 're only a click away from taking a Picnik . That 's how I discovered it , and it 's worked fairly well for me to this point .

2 . Splashup -- Splashup `` is a powerful editing tool and photo manager . With all the features professionals use and novices want , it 's easy to use , works in real-time , and allows you to edit many images at once . '' You 'd wonder how something this extensive could be free - and it all runs within the browser .

5 . flauntR -- flauntR is a suite that includes the ability to edit images , add effects , add text , and print the results on everything from mugs to posters . You might be overwhelmed with the options here , but ... is n't that better than being underwhelmed ?

6 . Photoshop Express -- Adobe 's Photoshop was really the first image editor of its kind to herald in the age of digital photography , though it was designed for professionals and its endless options could be daunting -LRB- and bank - breakingly expensive -RRB- for the layman . Now , Photoshop.com is on the Web to help that very same layman -- for free or plus levels of membership -- edit , store , and share his photos . Lots of helpful tutorials promise to guide the casual user through editing pickles .

8 . Aviary -- Aviary lets you : `` edit images , create mind-blowing effects , design logos , find colors , collaborate , and more . All you need is a Web browser . '' This particular brand looks to be the one to beat , as they have several different tools in development . I 'm guessing that within five years , this one is going to be at the top of every person 's list of Web-based image editors .

9 . DrPic -- DrPic says it 's `` the easiest free online picture editor '' and that it has `` processed over five million pictures . '' I say they 're easy enough , but not necessarily THE easiest . Everything 's relative , no ?

10 . Cameroid -- Cameroid lets you `` take crazy -LRB- or not -RRB- snaps with your webcam straight from your browser . '' I featured this one in a CNN.com live video a while ago , and it certainly deserves to be mentioned again . If you 're looking for something else to do with your webcam , give it a cameroid -LRB- which is n't as painful as it might sound -RRB- .

As you can see , there are plenty of options for photo editing , storing , and sharing out there . Some are going to fit your personal workflow more neatly than others , so it 's worth it to try a few and see what works best for your needs .
