Kuznetsova lifted the trophy at Roland Garros in 2009 but was unable to repeat her success despite breaking the world No. 1 's serve for the first time in the tournament .

Williams cruised to the first set in 28 minutes but that was an inaccurate barometer of what was to come , with the remainder of the match taking an hour and a half .

Despite Kuznetsova taking an early break in the third set , Williams found another level to reach the French Open semifinals for the first time since 2003 .

The 31-year-old may have 15 grand slams to her name but she will be conscious that only one of those came in Paris , back in 2002 when beating sister Venus in the final .

`` I was so determined to get through that match , and I really , really , really wanted it more than anyone , I think , '' she told reporters afterwards .

`` I was really just fighting , giving it everything I had out there . I 've been able to come back a lot throughout my career . I do n't think anything really changed . ''

Victory extended Williams ' record winning streak to 29 matches , a run that has only been bettered by her sister Venus -LRB- 35 -RRB- and Belgium 's Justine Henin -LRB- 32 -RRB- this century .

She will face Italian fifth seed Sara Errani in the semifinal after last year 's runner-up continued her fine form at Roland Garros when beating fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4 7-6 -LRB- 8-6 -RRB- .

The victory was Errani 's first against a player ranked in the top five and now she must beat Williams for the first time if she is to return to the final , where she was beaten by Maria Sharapova last year .

`` I think Serena is playing the best clay court tennis of her life , '' she told CNN .

After paying tribute to Kuznetsova , who came into Roland Garros ranked No. 39 after missing the second half of last year with a knee injury , Williams turned her attentions to an opponent against whom she boasts a 5-0 record .

`` She has won this tournament before so I am happy to get through such a tough match . It was very difficult and I am very tired .

On Wednesday , defending champion Sharapova takes on Jelena Jankovic and Maria Kirilenko faces Victoria Azarenka in the remaining quarterfinals .
