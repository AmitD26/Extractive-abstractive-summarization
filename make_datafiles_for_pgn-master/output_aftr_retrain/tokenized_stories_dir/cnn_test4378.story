Many of the customers -- a range of ex-military men , off-duty law enforcement officers and a sprinkling of women learning how to handle a firearm for self-protection -- said they have grown up around guns and are leery of interference by the federal government on gun rights .

Sen. Mary Landrieu -LRB- D-Louisiana -RRB- is well aware of those concerns . The veteran Democrat will face her states ' voters in a 2014 election , and despite her three terms in the Senate , Landrieu 's seat is widely considered vulnerable .

Landrieu , in an interview with CNN during a small business event in Boston , emphasized her independence from Washington .

Background checks on gun sales : How do they work ?

When asked about recent polls finding 90 % of Americans support universal background checks , Landrieu said : `` I do n't know what the number is in Louisiana . ''

`` I 'm not the president of the United States , I 'm the senator from Louisiana , '' Landrieu said . `` So I really will follow what the people in my state want me to do on that issue . ''

CNN Poll : Background checks popular , worrisome

Months after the massacre of elementary school students in Newtown , Connecticut , there is intense pressure for Congress to address gun violence .

And there are some signs that a bill like one announced by a bipartisan group of senators Wednesday on background checks may be more palatable to voters .

A Quinnipiac poll released in early April found 91 % of voters across the country support universal background checks .

`` I think responsible gun owners would agree that 's a reasonable request that our government or local law enforcement put on us . When you start going past that is when I think people get nervous about it or have strong feelings one way or the other , '' Moody said .

Before the play date , the gun talk

`` If there is a lot of support and we can get background checks done and not infringe on the right of people to own guns or to pass them down to their children or grandchildren , we 'll figure out a way to do that , '' Landrieu said . `` I do know that people in Louisiana want the right to own a gun and feel that it 's , you know , part of our culture and history , and we 're not going to infringe upon that right . ''
