On December 30 , the president sat down for an interview with David Gregory on `` Meet the Press . '' Gregory asked the president , `` So what is your single priority of the second term ? What is the equivalent to health care ? ''

President Obama replied , `` Well , there are a couple of things that we need to get done . I 've said that fixing our broken immigration system is a top priority . I will introduce legislation in the first year to get that done . '' He went on to say , `` The second thing that we 've got to do is to stabilize the economy and make sure it 's growing . ''

During his first term in office , coming off `` the worst recession since the Great Depression , '' to use the president 's own words , it appeared to many that he prioritized Obamacare over the economy . Now it appears that the economy , and all that goes along with it , like the ever-growing national debt , will again play second fiddle , this time to immigration reform .

If $ 16 trillion of national debt and the huge deficits each year are n't spending problems , then what is ? The United States most certainly has a spending problem . For the president to insist otherwise is dumbfounding but at the same time entirely consistent with his policies .

There is no easy answer , but perhaps they should begin by explaining to the American people `` the politics of reality , '' as William Buckley aptly defined conservatism .

The recent elections seem to indicate that a majority of the American people want lower taxes for themselves but approve of the president 's increased spending programs . In the end , they can not have both . A vibrant and prosperous private sector can not coexist with a one-size-fits-all caretaker state . One relies on low taxes and limited government interference , the other on high taxes and government redistribution of resources .

The debt ceiling is just the first of many opportunities to bring this choice to the public . Republicans should make it clear that they will fulfill our debt obligations in a responsible manner , but they will only give the president short-term debt ceiling extensions until we get this problem under control . If Obama does n't want to cut spending in a meaningful way he 's going to have to explain that to the American people every couple of months for the next four years .

The purpose is n't to thrash the president and his party or be ideological shock troops , as Ronald Reagan once warned against , but to hold a national education seminar on fiscal responsibility . Republicans have not won the argument , and will not win it , when these fiscal deals are made behind closed doors before the strike of midnight .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett .
