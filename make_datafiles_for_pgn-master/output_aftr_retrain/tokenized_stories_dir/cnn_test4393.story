NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He 's only 5 1/2 years old , and yet he 's practically memorized the entire New York subway grid .

Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor-X passed on a genetic component to her son , Dylan , who is autistic .

Gwenyth Jackaway , Dylan 's mother , is a professor at New York 's Fordham University . She 's single but had always wanted to have a child . So she contacted California Cryobank , one of the largest sperm donor banks in the country .

What she could n't know then is that her son would have autism . So she started to wonder whether Donor X might carry a gene that could have contributed . Dylan tells Randi Kaye how to take subway back to work ''

The cause or causes of autism are not known and are hotly debated . Most experts believe that genetics are a component , making a child predisposed to autism or responsive to an environmental trigger .

Researchers have found some genetic areas associated with autism , but it could take years before the gene or genes that cause autism or contribute to it will be determined .

`` When you 're handed a diagnosis of some sort of developmental disorder , you have to let go of the child you thought you were going to have , '' Jackaway said . `` There 's a sense of loss of the child , a grieving process . There 's denial , there 's rage , and then there 's the tremendous sadness , and hopefully you get to a place of accepting . ''

Jackaway says she had to accept that `` I do n't have that child I thought I was going to have . But I have this child instead , who 's right here in front of me . ''

`` He was walking on his toes ; he was flapping his hands . There seemed to be eye contact issues , '' recalled Jackaway , who immediately suggested screening Joseph for autism .

Pergola says she was afraid because she had an image of autism in her head and believed her son would be `` in the corner and rocking and not talking . ''

One month later , a test confirmed what Pergola already knew : Joseph was autistic . The diagnosis brought her to tears , and now these two women whose sons share a father were immediately connected by another bond : autism .

`` She was terribly upset , '' Jackaway remembered . `` That moment is a terribly frightening moment . You get handed a diagnosis , and you get handed an entirely new future . ''

In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X , three of the children are autistic , and one is showing signs of autism .

But would Jackaway be happier today if there had been a way to screen Donor X for an autism gene ?

`` I 've done a lot of thinking about this , and to say yes to that is to say that I wish Dylan is n't Dylan , '' Jackaway said . `` I love my son and everything about him , and that means loving his autism also . Loving your children means loving everything about them . Our children do n't have autism ; they are autistic . It 's part of who they are . '' There is currently no way to screen for autism , and in a statement , the company said in part :

Since the discovery of autism in some of the families that used Donor X , Cryobank had this to say about his samples :

'' ... per CCB policy , the donor 's samples were removed from the general catalog . These vials may only be sold to a client who has previously used specimens of this donor and is interested in ordering additional specimens . In this case the client is made aware of the new medical information and potential issues ... ''

The families do n't blame the sperm bank . In fact , Theresa Pergola says she 's still uncertain about an autism screening process , if and when it ever becomes available .

`` It can go either way , on the one hand it could be helpful so that people could make choices about what risks they want to take , '' says Pergola . `` On the other hand it 's like , what else are they going to screen for , you know ? Are they going to screen for certain personality traits ? It 's hard to say . It 's really hard to say . '' E-mail to a friend

Her son , Dylan , two other kids connected to Donor-X are autistic

Expert says genetic component , environmental trigger linked to autism

Since autism discovery , Donor X samples are no longer available for reproduction
