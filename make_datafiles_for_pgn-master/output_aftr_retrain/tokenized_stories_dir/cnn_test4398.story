Armed police held rallies in several cities in Xinjiang over the weekend , the local government news website Tianshannet reported . The site carried images showing convoys of armored vehicles and trucks full of police officers in riot gear .

China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs defended the action Monday , saying the government will `` make every effort to ensure the long-term stability and development in Xinjiang . ''

The measures follow an outbreak of violence Wednesday in which a group attacked police stations and other government buildings in a remote Xinjiang township , Chinese state-run media said . Authorities have described it as a `` terrorist attack , '' but overseas Uyghur groups have questioned the official version of events .

State media reported further unrest in a different area of Xinjiang on Friday in which there were an unspecified number of arrests but no casualties .

Periodic bursts of violence have hit Xinjiang , a resource-rich region where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs , a Turkic-speaking , predominantly Muslim ethnic group .

But Wednesday 's events appeared to be the deadliest clashes since July 2009 , when rioting between Uyghurs and Han Chinese left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in Urumqi , the regional capital .

As the anniversary of the Urumqi unrest approaches , Chinese authorities are taking a tough line .

Meng Jianzhu , secretary of the Party 's Commission for Political and Legal Affairs , asked armed police `` to take precautionary and preemptive measures to strike hard on violent terrorist crimes so as to ensure a peaceful and happy life for people of all ethnic groups in the region , '' the agency said .

A Xinhua report Sunday said police had arrested one of them who had been on the run after the clashes . It gave his name as Yiblayan Eli , an apparently Uyghur name .

The Xinhua article reported that the group had been planning the attack since mid-June and carried it out after one of its members was arrested Tuesday .

Complaints of discrimination

In China as a whole , Han Chinese account for 92 % of the population .

They now make up about 40 % of the population of Xinjiang , where Uyghurs used to be predominant .

In April of this year , clashes killed 21 people in Xinjiang 's Kashgar prefecture . Regional government officials called those events `` a terrorist act '' carried out by `` mobsters , '' an account that overseas Uyghur groups disputed .

The U.S. State Department has also commented on the situation , which has irritated Beijing .

`` We 're deeply concerned about ongoing reports of discrimination against and restrictions on Uighurs and Muslims in China , '' State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week . `` And we 've urged China to address those counterproductive policies , and we 've urged a thorough and transparent investigation into some of this violence . ''

CNN 's David McKenzie , Steven Jiang , Dayu Zhang and Feng Ke in Beijing contributed to this report .
