Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A psychiatrist who treated John Hinckley Jr. in the 1980s and who interviewed him in recent months described the presidential assailant Tuesday as having `` a sense of entitlement '' and being `` absorbed with himself . ''

During federal court testimony , Dr. Raymond Patterson also said Hinckley `` dives right in '' when it comes to romantic relationships with women , but has not always shown a lot of empathy toward them .

Federal prosecutors called Patterson as an expert witness in their effort to block a proposal from St. Elizabeths , the Washington mental hospital where Hinckley has undergone treatment for three decades , to increase Hinckley 's periods of visitation to his mother 's home in Williamsburg , Virginia , and his possible eventual release as a permanent outpatient .

In March of 1981 , Hinckley shot President Ronald Reagan , his press secretary James Brady , Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy and Washington policeman Thomas Delahanty . All four men survived , and Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity

Patterson , the former director of forensics services at St. Elizabeths , said Hinckley continues to suffer from both narcissistic and schizoid personality disorders . He said the latter problem has led Hinckley to be somewhat removed in personal relationships .

In December , experts called by Hinckley 's lawyers testified his two most serious mental problems -- major depressive disorder and an unspecified psychotic disorder -- are in full remission .

Patterson said that in his opinion , Hinckley `` continues to be mentally ill now . ''

Hinckley 's mother was concerned CB might have a mental breakdown . Patterson said Hinckley showed `` little regard '' for his mother 's views .

The psychiatrist said he asked Hinckley what the impact would be on CB if he were to go to Williamsburg and no longer see her , and Hinckley replied that she has other friends . Patterson said Hinckley showed `` not a lot of empathy . ''

In his opening arguments in late November , attorney Barry Levine said the central issue is whether Hinckley is dangerous and said no one has offered any proof that he represents a danger to himself or others . Levine said Hinckley is `` flawed , '' but insisted he is `` fundamentally decent . ''
