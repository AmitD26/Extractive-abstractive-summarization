The bar has been set -- and it 's awfully low .

So now comes Herman Cain , accused of sexual harassment by four women . He calls the charges baseless and defends his integrity . His political campaign and supporters have gone into full damage-control mode , scrutinizing the women . All predictable -- and reflexive -- enough .

Then , as they say , the truth will out .

And there 's another plus : The partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts . And the public can decide for itself .

Now the tables have turned . Feminist groups are outraged by the charges against Cain and lots of Republican partisans are defending him , choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead . -LRB- We 've come a long way , baby , in that some conservative women 's groups are criticizing Cain 's I-don ` t-recall defense . -RRB-

Conservative CNN contributor Bill Bennett sees the hypocrisy of those who raised the red flag about Clinton , but not Cain . `` For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply does n't matter makes us the hypocrites as well , '' he wrote on CNN.com . He is , of course , right .

When declarations of innocence do not seem to be enough , there 's the change-the-subject tack : How about fingering a leaker , say from Rick Perry 's staff ? When that 's denied , back off . Then take a turn , and start decrying `` anonymous '' charges . When the charges are on the record , take on the accuser . And when all else fails , blame the media . And the liberal `` Democrat machine . ''

But here 's what we learned in that case : The fact that Monica inappropriately bared her underwear to the president did not excuse his behavior . And the fact that Hillary was right about those who were `` out to get '' Clinton does not mean he was in the clear . It 's just not that simple .

The voters will figure it all out , as always . The bar may be set low for the politicians , but the public somehow manages to rise above it .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger .

She says Cain 's best strategy would be to seek release of all the details
