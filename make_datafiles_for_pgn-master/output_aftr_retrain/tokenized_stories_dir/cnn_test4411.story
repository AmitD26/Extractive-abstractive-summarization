CNN Poll : Republicans divided on Romney VP choice

It 's worth mentioning that the Romney campaign faces some of the deficits that plagued McCain : a gender gulch and a lack of enthusiasm among much of the very conservative base . So it would be easy to pull a Palin , circa 2012 -- that is , look for an appealing , conservative female pol to excite the unexcited .

Except that it wo n't -- and should n't -- happen that way .

One reason : because Palin happened that way .

And while the situations are somewhat similar , there are also some key differences in the political environment : It 's not as bad for Republicans in 2012 as it was in 2008 . The country had Bush fatigue ; McCain was seen as offering a Bush third term . There was a massive fundraising deficit , which wo n't be the case this time around . And the McCain campaign culture itself was chaotic and often dysfunctional -- not so with the Romney folks .

The Romney search is being led by Beth Myers , a longtime adviser who some believe channels Romney as well as anyone . She 's thorough and understands what the candidate is looking for , and who would make him comfortable . She and Romney also understand the process from the other end since he was vetted by McCain four years ago .

Most of all , of course , there is the obvious lesson learned from Palin : that the vice presidential pick needs to have a pre-existing base of expertise on a variety of issues . One of the many mistakes the McCain people have admitted is that they assumed that a sitting governor , by virtue of her position , would be up to the task of answering substantive questions of vital interest to the nation . `` It 's the threshold , '' says one former McCain adviser .

Sure , Romney will want a running mate who balances his weaknesses with conservatives and maybe can lend a hand in a key state or two . But post-Palin , the vice presidential nominee needs to be one thing more than anything else : competent , prepared and ready to lead . McCain 's credibility went down the tubes when the 72-year-old candidate offered the slogan `` America First , '' and then picked Palin as his potential successor .

McCain chose the Hail Mary ; that 's who he is . Romney wo n't do that . His choice will be more staid and more subdued -- and someone he knows he can work with across that conference table .

That might not be exciting , but it would be authentic . Which is exactly what Romney needs to be .
