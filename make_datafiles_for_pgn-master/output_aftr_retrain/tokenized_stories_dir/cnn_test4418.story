-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chaos and a lack of communication are common threads among American survivors ' stories of the Costa Concordia sinking , and making it to shore was only the beginning of a long ordeal for passengers trying to get home .

Melissa Goduti of Wallingford , Connecticut , boarded the ship about three hours before it ran aground Friday night , killing at least 11 passengers .

`` I called my husband , not knowing if I 'd see him again , '' she said . `` I thought we were going to die . ''

There were no announcements for a long time , and Goduti and her mother did n't see signs directing them toward lifeboats .

Goduti and her mother feel lucky they found a lifeboat .

Costa staff in Lofaro 's lifeboat were debating who would drive the boat , and they did n't seem to know what to do , she said .

In a letter to passengers , Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi disputes that assessment : `` The crew of the Costa Concordia acted bravely and swiftly in an extremely difficult situation and succeeded -- despite the terribly demanding conditions -- in evacuating more than 4,000 people in the shortest possible time : we are proud of our commitment and dedication to your safety . ''

He goes on to outline crew training , safety procedures and regulatory oversight .

The people of the island came out in force to help the stranded travelers , and a local priest opened up the church . Fleser and her family stayed at the home of a local family overnight .

Nancy Lofaro and her husband wandered around on shore , finding a church , a local cafe and a small hotel all packed .

`` The Marriott had no idea we were coming . All these refugee boat people land on their front door , and they say , ` Who are you ? But we 'll take care of you , ' '' Fleser said .

There were two Costa cruise representatives at the hotel , `` but every time we asked them if they could do something for us , they said they had no authority , '' she said .

The cruise line did pay for food , the hotel and their airfare home , Fleser said , although they booked them on a flight to Albany , Georgia , instead of Albany , New York -- a mistake the family discovered in the Atlanta airport .

`` Oh my god , we were just ready to lose it at that point . ''

More than 1,100 Costa employees have been working to assist passengers and crew since Friday night , Foschi said in his letter to passengers .

The CEO of Costa 's parent company , Carnival Corp. , pledged support to passengers : `` I give my personal assurance that we will take care of each and every one of our guests , crew and their families affected by this tragic event , '' Micky Arison said in a statement .

Before Fleser and her family could make the journey home , they needed new passports to replace those lost on the sinking ship .

The U.S. Embassy 's response was a big disappointment , Fleser said .

State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the agency arranged with the cruise line to have American passengers transported to a Rome hotel and to the embassy for documents . More than 100 emergency passports have been issued to stranded travelers .

`` We also provided all kinds of advice , telephone contacts to families , helped families create travel funds , provided them with passport photos , warm clothes , there were even a couple of families that needed diapers , '' she said during a State Department briefing Wednesday .

In addition to arranging lodging , transportation and counseling for passengers , Costa will address possessions lost on board and is in the process of refunding cruise fares and costs incurred while on board , the company said in a statement .
