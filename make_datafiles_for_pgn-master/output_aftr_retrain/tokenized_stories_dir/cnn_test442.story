-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Florida judge 's ruling Wednesday will allow a foreign-born high school basketball player who was ruled ineligible and his team to compete in the playoffs , even though they could ultimately be stripped of any title they win .

Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Spencer Eig temporarily barred the Florida High School Athletic Association from disqualifying Brian Delancy , who was born in the Bahamas , and Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School from the district playoffs , which begin Thursday .

Delancy `` is very happy and relieved and he feels happy for his teammates , '' said attorney David Baron , who helped represent the athlete , 19 , and two other players .

The board of the athletic association , which said Krop did not file proper paperwork on Delancy 's eligibility and immigration status , on Tuesday ruled he was ineligible and that the top-ranked team must forfeit the 19 games it won when the senior guard played .

Eig did not rule on Delancy 's eligibility , but granted a temporary injunction to allow Krop to play until a full slate of hearings and appeals can take place within the athletic association ,

Roger Dearing , the association 's executive director , said it was too late to appeal Eig 's ruling and Krop will compete .

Dearing said the association will hear new appeals after the tournament , likely in April .

Now that Krop is in the playoffs , North Miami High School will be bumped from the four-team field in the district playoffs , Dearing said .

`` There is no win for kids here , '' said Dearing . `` What about the schools that played fair ? ''

Goldfarb said the association only recently decided to act .

Dearing said Krop reported the paperwork issue last week and sought the emergency board appeal .

The association keeps such records so that `` there is a fair and equitable playing field for all student athletes '' and to discourage recruiting , association spokesman Seth Polansky said Tuesday . Where athletes come from `` is not an issue , '' he said . `` It is the paperwork . ''

Dearing said public schools must have such student visa forms and that Delancy 's form had expired .

The emergency petition that was taken before Eig argued the athletic association never set a hearing or requested information from Delancy before making a `` unilateral '' determination on his eligibility .

The athletic association believes Krop is being `` disingenuous '' about its knowledge and compliance with rules , Dearing said . The school was walked through proper paperwork last year because of another case involving international students , he said .

`` These kids are only concerned about playing for the championship , '' he said .
