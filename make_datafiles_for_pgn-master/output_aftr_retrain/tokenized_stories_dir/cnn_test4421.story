-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The night that ended with Cherish Perrywinkle 's disappearance started with a generous offer at the dollar store .

Investigators said a man met the 8-year-old 's mother at a Dollar General in Jacksonville , Florida , Friday evening . He told her that the family looked like they were down on their luck and that he wanted to take them to Walmart and buy them new clothes .

The mother and her three children had spent hours shopping at Walmart with the man when he offered to buy hamburgers at the store 's McDonald 's , according to Michael Williams , director of investigations and homeland security for the Jacksonville Sheriff 's Office .

The man set off toward the front of the store with Cherish .

That , Williams told reporters , is when something went horribly wrong .

On Saturday morning , investigators found Cherish 's lifeless body in a wooded area near a church 4 miles away .

Authorities accuse the man who offered to buy her family clothes at Walmart , Donald James Smith , with kidnapping and killing her .

Suspect appears in court

Court records show he was sentenced to a year in the county jail and was released on May 31 .

Investigators have not released information about how Cherish died or what they believe Smith was doing from the point of the abduction until his arrest .

Her mother , Rayne Perrywinkle , has n't spoken publicly about what happened Friday night , and she declined to discuss the case with WAWS on Sunday .

Cherish 's father , Billy James Jarreau , issued a statement Saturday through his attorney thanking law enforcement for their investigation and the public for their condolences .

`` Mr. Jarreau hopes that his daughter 's death sheds light on the dangers of allowing dangerous pedophiles to remain in our community , '' said the statement from attorney Gerald Wilkerson .

Williams told reporters that investigators had used all the resources they could to find the child . He said the tragic case offered a sobering reminder .

A makeshift memorial of flowers , balloons , cards and stuffed animals has piled up in front of the church near the area where Cherish was found over the weekend , WAWS reported .

`` We talked about stuff like TV shows , like girly things about dolls and fairies , '' Cabanda said , `` about stuff that is imaginary . ''
