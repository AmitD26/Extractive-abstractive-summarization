-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama 's plan to review U.S. surveillance programs has validated fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden 's role as a whistle-blower , the head of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said Saturday .

The statement came a day after Obama outlined steps to reform intelligence gathering measures , saying the classified leaks by Snowden created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans .

`` As Snowden has stated , his biggest concern was if he blew the whistle and change did not occur , '' Julian Assange said in a written statement .

`` Well , reforms are taking shape , and for that , the president and people of the United States and around the world owe Edward Snowden a debt of gratitude . ''

Obama has refused any characterization of Snowden as a `` whistle-blower '' or `` patriot , '' telling reporters there were `` other avenues '' the former National Security Agency contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information .

Among the steps being taken , according to the president : Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program ; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative ; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public , including the legal rationale for government collection activities ; and appointing a high-level , independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies .

`` The simple fact is that without Snowden 's disclosures , no one would know about the programs and no reforms could take place , '' Assange said .

Assange released the statement from Ecuadorian Embassy in London , where he sought refuge to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sex crimes .
