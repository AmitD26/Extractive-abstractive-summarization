-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With two TV shows , an entertainment company and a new style website to her name , Tyra Banks is a 37-year-old businesswoman at the top of her game . She has already reinvented herself once , adding entrepreneurial acumen to her modeling portfolio .

As conceptions of what constitutes `` reaching the top '' change , we look at what some executives do after reaching CEO status .

Learn to do business even better

A mogul in the making , Banks has signed up for the Owner/President Management -LRB- OPM -RRB- program at Harvard . The nine-week program , spread out over three terms , accepts candidates who `` hold a significant equity stake '' in a firm with `` annual sales of at least $ 5 million . ''

Harvard 's OPM program gives its participants a chance to plan how to build on their success -- and head in new directions -- `` using a set of analytical tools and lenses that allow you to do things on purpose as you go forward , '' according to Applegate .

Business owners from around the world come to campus to start with fundamentals like risk management , marketing and finance but segue into big decision-making subjects like growth strategies and legacy planning .

Applegate said the peer group is intended to build a confidence-boosting community , one that can let already successful business owners contemplate taking on big new projects .

`` The content of what we teach is important and it 's been tailored to what business owners need to know , but what 's really , really the value of program is the community you form , '' Applegate said . It can be lonely at the top , particularly if you run a company that 's independent rather than supported by venture capital .

In the OPM program , `` You 've met people here who know exactly what you learned , sat in the same class with you and debated in the lunchrooms . You can get a couple people that you really respect and form an advisory board . ''

Try a new occupation

Some leaders approach the top of the corporate ladder and decide to head in another direction entirely rather than stay in the game . Mike Volpi made his name in high-tech as a senior vice president at Cisco and as CEO of internet TV company Joost , but bailed on corporate management two years ago .

Volpi said that packing it in for a sailboat in the Mediterranean did n't have the same appeal as finding a new job , one that tickled his intellect in ways that overseeing a company 's operations had not .

When Charlie Knowles sold his tech company Rubicon , he did n't plan to stay on as CEO after the merger . Faced with a chance to go back to the basics , he discovered that reinventing yourself carries uncertainties .

`` The question we all hope we get faced with is , ` If I could do anything in the world what would it be ? ' But it 's also pretty daunting , '' he said . `` That kind of dovetails into a whole bunch of other fears -- of whether you can get traction in a new area , as you become exposed to different languages , different jargons , different networks . ''

Pursuing a personal passion in a non-profit context did n't mean it was all smooth sailing for Knowles . Non-profit CEOs still have to operate businesses , raise funding and management personnel -- just in a context with very different rules and culture , he said .

`` The thing I did n't anticipate , ultimately , was it 's just a completely different perspective , '' he said .
