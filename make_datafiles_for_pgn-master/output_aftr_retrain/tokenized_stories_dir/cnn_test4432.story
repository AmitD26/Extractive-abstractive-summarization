`` It 's ironic that what is meant to be a key benefit for travelers becomes a key frustration quite quickly , '' says James Berry , product director for Collinson Latitude .

Jay Sorensen , the president of IdeaWorksCompany , which consults airlines on how to build and improve their loyalty schemes , says he does n't find the study surprising .

`` The UK is a bit of an enigma in the market , as their three largest airlines do n't encourage people to sign up to their programs , '' he says . British Airways ' scheme , titled the Executive Club , is almost exclusively geared towards business travelers , he says , while neither Ryan Air nor EasyJet have designated programs .

Still , if a good loyalty scheme is rated on the ease of acquiring a reward seat , the British carriers are n't the only ones letting customers down .

IdeaWorksCompany recently conducted research as part of the Switchfly Reward Seat Availability Survey . Throughout March , they made 7,560 queries for free seats on 25 leading airlines , and tallied the percentages that were available .

Air Berlin , GOL and Southwest tied for top spot , each able to accommodate queries 100 % of the time . Delta and US Airways tied for last place , with only 36.5 % of requests resulting in a potential booking .

The discrepancy , Sorensen says , simply comes down to the fact that some airlines think making reward seats available is good business practice , while others just do n't see it as a priority . Arguably , some airlines are more interested in selling reward miles to third parties , such as banks , who can distribute the miles as rewards to their own customers . The practice is a multi-billion dollar earner for many carriers .

`` They love cashing the checks from the banks , they just hate to give up those seats , '' quips Sorensen .

Gary Leff , the cofounder of frequent flyer community milepoint.com , and a consultant on the Freddie Awards , which recognizes airlines with the best loyalty schemes , notes that some carriers have hidden value that one might not realize from simply skimming their policy page online .

As only 60 % of those polled seem to make use of their frequent flyer program , it 's understandable to question whether these schemes succeed in building allegiance to a brand . Sorensen says sadly , it 's a difficult prospect to measure .

`` If we had an airline that would turn their program off , we would have empirical evidence one way or another , but no one has done that , because these programs are a weapon no one wants to be without . ''
