-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Now on the waiting list for a heart transplant , Anthony Stokes had a procedure Friday to insert a device to support the failing heart he has , a family spokesman said .

The 15-year-old had a ventricular assist device , or VAD , implanted on Friday at Children 's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston , family friend Mark Bell told CNN .

Bell says Anthony is doing `` extremely well . ''

Citing patient privacy , a hospital spokeswoman declined to confirm Anthony 's VAD procedure , and referred CNN to the family for related inquiries .

An August 7 letter , which Bell provided to CNN , said that `` Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance , which is one of our center 's contraindications to listing for heart transplant . ''

Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow-up appointments .

In a statement Tuesday , Children 's Healthcare of Atlanta said , `` While there has been misinformation circulating , Children 's can not discuss the specifics of this case or any other case due to privacy rules . ''

Children 's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston is in good standing , according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the United States .

A matter of compliance

But Bell said a doctor told the family that Anthony 's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment .

`` The doctor made the decision that he was n't a good candidate because of that , '' Bell said . `` I guess he did n't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen . ''

Anthony 's mother , Melencia Hamilton , told CNN affiliate WGCL-TV that doctors said Anthony would live only three to six months if he did n't get the heart transplant .

Mosteller said Anthony was judged based on `` tattoos and an ankle bracelet '' from a `` juvenile agency . '' Bell said the detention was because Anthony got into `` an altercation to protect his younger brother . ''

On Tuesday , Bell said , a doctor delivered the groundbreaking news to the family : `` He said that Anthony has been approved to receive a heart . He put him on the transplant list . ''

Anthony had no health problems before this summer , Bell said ; the heart problem is not congenital . But he started to have trouble sleeping and then complained about his chest hurting . His mother took him to the hospital because of the chest pains .

The complexity of transplants

Federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012 , but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed . While waiting for a heart transplant , 331 people died .

As part of the evaluation process , organ transplant patients undergo a complete psychosocial evaluation so doctors can get a sense of whether they and their families will follow through with a complicated medical regimen , Weill said .

`` A few times a year , we run into people who ca n't , '' he said .

Some patients have been denied because they do n't have anyone in their lives who can take care of them and accompany them to appointments . After a heart transplant , patients are too sick to do these things alone , Weill said .

`` When we fear that someone 's not going to do well , it 's because the patient could n't comply with the regimen or they do n't have any support in their life , '' he said .

Psychosocial factors do n't change a person 's priority on the waiting list , but they could lead a person to be denied a spot on that list , he said .

Teenagers are n't automatically ruled out for heart transplants , but `` the consequence that ` you are going to die if you do n't take these medicines ' is far from the mind of a 17-year-old , '' said Davies , the cardiothoracic surgeon .

Instead of denying Anthony a spot on the transplant list , Caplan suggested that the boy should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what 's expected post-transplant -- that is , if the teenager can get a heart .

Bell said the family did n't press the doctor on what led to overturning the decision regarding the transplant list .
