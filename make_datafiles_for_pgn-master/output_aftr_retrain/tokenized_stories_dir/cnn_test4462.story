Some off-kilter comments are too slight to sink a candidacy , but when they play into preconceptions of a candidate , the remarks -- and even sometimes a gesture or sound -- can be potent .

Obama 's recent statement about the private sector plays perfectly into Republican arguments on multiple levels . Although Obama was referring to data showing that if not for cutbacks in government jobs , the recovery would be far more robust , the statement has been used to argue that the White House is out of touch with average Americans .

It also tends to confirm the notion that Obama does n't really know much about the private sector , Republicans say , in contrast to Romney . Finally , the statement can be used to support the criticism that Obama inhabits a world of celebrity , living in a bubble and unaware of the negative sentiment about his policies .

Both men join a long history of politicians who have been criticized for a wrongly chosen phrase or gesture . A quick look at history shows what can happen :

2 . George Romney , `` Just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get when you go over to Vietnam '' -LRB- 1967 -RRB- : Michigan Gov. Romney , Mitt 's father , then seen as one the most promising Republicans in the party because of his ability to compete for moderate voters , said this upon returning from the war 's front lines . He was becoming more critical of the war and the lack of accurate information about it from the Johnson administration . But Romney 's comment was used by critics to question his mental stability .

4 . Gerald Ford , `` There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe '' -LRB- 1976 -RRB- : When President Ford said these words during a televised debate with Democrat Jimmy Carter , in an effort to counteract right-wing criticism about his policy of dÃ © tente with the Soviet Union , Democrats pounced on the statement to claim that the president was not competent on foreign policy .

5 . John Kerry , `` I actually did vote for the $ 87 billion before I voted against it '' -LRB- 2004 -RRB- : The statement was prime fodder for GOP commercials to demonstrate Sen. Kerry 's flip-flopping and the inability of the Democratic Party to take a tough stand on foreign policy .

8 . Howard Dean screams -LRB- 2004 -RRB- : After coming in third in Iowa , Dean 's exuberant scream in front of reporters was used by his opponents to argue that the Vermont governor was less stable than he appeared to be .

9 . George H.W. Bush checks his watch -LRB- 1992 -RRB- : When asked by a citizen about how the recession had affected him , the president appeared to be distracted , even checking his watch , which played directly into Democratic criticism that he did not take domestic policy seriously .

10 . Al Gore sighs -LRB- 2000 -RRB- : Vice President Gore 's multiple sighs during a debate with George W. Bush played into impressions that Gore was arrogant and aloof .

Though this list is far from exhaustive , the history should provide a powerful reminder to Obama and Romney that a few words can come back to haunt a campaign .

Obama has made several moves that could change the conversation , including his announcement Friday of a policy against deportation of many young illegal immigrants . In coming months , we 'll find out whether those moves are working .
