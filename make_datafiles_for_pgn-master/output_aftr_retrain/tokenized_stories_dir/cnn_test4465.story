The project is an attempt to simulate the experience of a manned trip to Mars , with an international team of researchers locked in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half -- time required for a round trip to the next planet out in the solar system .

Two other such walks are scheduled for Friday and February 22 , according to Igor Ushakov , director of the Moscow-based Institute for Biomedical Problems , the main organization coordinating the project .

Organizers at the European Space Agency and Russia 's Institute of Biomedical Problems hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future Mars astronauts will experience .

The researchers communicate with Mission Control via the internet , with occasional disruptions and a 20-minute delay to imitate the effects of space travel .

The latest isolation test is the last and longest part of the Mars500 experiment , which began in 2007 .

Actual missions to Mars have thus far been unmanned .

Speaking at a press conference at Mission Control on Monday before the walk , Vitaly Davydov , deputy head of the Russian Space Agency , said that the `` main task of the project is to determine the list of problems '' that real space crews flying to Mars might be encountering .

He said such a manned flight to the planet could take place in two decades .

`` Twenty years is a good time to prepare for such an expedition . I think it is quite realistic , '' he said , adding that no specific date for that is scheduled yet .
