The charter school 's board decided Monday night to change its dress code , but when I first learned about the story , and saw Tiana in tears , it reminded me of a time in my life when I yearned to have long , straight flowing hair . Hair that looked nothing like the hair that grew naturally out of my head . Hair that my mother would have to pay someone else to create through chemical processing . Hair that , when it was `` done , '' still did n't look `` did '' -- at least not like the tresses that garnished the heads of all the little girls that other children and adults named `` pretty . '' Hair that forever escaped me . Hair that , in its absence , made me cry .

Whereas I spent most of my youth chasing beauty , at only 7 , Tiana and her parents are simply seeking affirmation for a beauty that is the child 's own ; a beauty that would take me another 17 years to find . Seeing that precious little brown girl break down and cry in front of news cameras , I became instantly focused on her . And her spirit . And her self-reflection . And I wanted to do something for her .

It was n't until I was an adult that I learned about the politics of black beauty . We live in a society in which normative standards tend to reflect those ideals established by the dominant group . And in a racialized society such as our own , one in which the white ideal is constantly pedestaled as the ideal against which all other bodies are measured , black bodies are often regarded substandard -- `` unacceptable '' as is . For black women , our ability to be perceived as beautiful in this society depends upon our ability to emulate a white ideal for feminine beauty . The closer our features are to white ones -- straight hair , light skin and aquiline features -- the more likely it is that we will be regarded as beautiful . So when compared to a white ideal , natural hair is not beautiful , especially not dreadlocks .

But the issue here is n't just one of beauty . Tiana was not asked to leave her school because her hair was judged `` ugly . '' She was asked to leave because school officials opined that her hair was `` faddish '' and `` unacceptable . '' The problem lies in perspective : On what grounds and on whose terms do we determine what is `` acceptable ? '' Dreadlocks are rooted in our cultural history and are as old as humanity itself . Yet Tiana 's African-American led school , one chartered by Langston University , a historically black university , did n't view her hairstyle in the truth of its own cultural significance . And therein lies the issue .

Tiana 's story is the one that made the news , but so many young girls question their beauty every single day . Our girls need constant affirmation . Girls need to know they are beautiful , even though there are people in this world that would have us believe that natural hair is `` ugly '' and `` nasty . '' If they ca n't pick up a magazine in the checkout line of the grocery store , turn to any page , and see themselves reflected , then we as adults have to provide them that reflection . And affirmation .

`` A Care Package Full of Locs '' is one such reflection -- my attempt to begin to ground Tiana and all the little Tianas in their own culture , and in their own norms , and in their own beauty , lest they be forced to compare themselves to others , lest they look in the mirror and find something wrong . Plus , I just want them all to know that they have an army of sisters , cousins , aunties , mamas , grandmothers and elders all over the world who support them .

I sent the care package to Tiana and her family . When I spoke to them Sunday , they were extremely thankful for the outpouring of love and support . And when I asked Tiana how she was feeling , she responded , `` Much better . Thank you . '' A few hours later she sent me a text to tell me her message to little girls -- `` Believe in yourself . ''
