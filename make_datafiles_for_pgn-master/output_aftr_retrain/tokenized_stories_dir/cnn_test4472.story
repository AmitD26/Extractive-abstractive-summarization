`` It 's such a shock that for the first 30 seconds you ca n't remember your name , '' Gamble said . `` But then it all falls into place . ''

The hijacker threatened to take the lives of the 57 passengers and crew aboard the plane if Gamble did n't fly him to Havana .

In addition to the small pistol he had smuggled aboard , the hijacker claimed to have a bomb in his suitcase .

`` He said he had a detonator , '' Gamble remembered , `` and that he was prepared to blow up the airplane . ''

Q&A : When hijackings were common

The airline told Gamble to comply with the hijacker 's demands . The pilot remembers seeing U.S. military C-130s accompany him south and then , as he approached Cuban air space , turn back .

Shortly after landing in Havana , Gamble said his plane was surrounded by a bright green swarm of Cuban soldiers .

`` I only got a glimpse of him , '' Gamble said . `` I never understood what he was trying to do . ''

This week , the world is getting another glimpse of the hijacker , a former Black Panther named William Potts , now 56 , who returned to the United States on Wednesday to turn himself into authorities for the 1984 hijacking .

`` In a Machiavellian sense , the Cubans changed , '' Potts said . `` They simply changed . They used to do it and now they do n't do it . ''

Instead of becoming the next Che Guevara , Potts found himself a foreigner who spoke little Spanish in crowded and often violent prisons . But he refused Cuban offers to return home .

`` If you are not able to suffer for the cause you are just a play revolutionary , '' he said .

Potts served his time and after leaving prison married and had two daughters with a Cuban woman .

Although a minor celebrity in his neighborhood of crumbling Soviet buildings east of Havana , Potts never fully fit into Cuban society .

Potts said he yearns to see family , including two daughters born in Cuba who now live in the United States . And he said he no longer feels the same zeal he once did for Cuba 's political system .

Even though he 's a fugitive after being indicted by a U.S. court for the hijacking in 1985 , Potts has been trying to turn himself over to U.S. authorities for more than a year . Federal prosecutors have never explained the year-long delay in bringing him into custody .

In a statement Wednesday , U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer `` commended the investigative efforts of the FBI and the assistance of the Diplomatic Security Service , Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration in securing Potts 's return to the United States . ''

`` I did the crime but I did the time , '' Potts said before his arrest in the United States . `` I paid the price for that crime I committed , I am entitled to a second chance . ''

It 's not clear whether Potts will ask for forgiveness from the passengers and crew of Flight 451 , many of whom are no longer alive or only dimly recall their brief diversion to Cuba .

Now retired after 37 years of flying , Carl Gamble vividly remembers the ordeal of the hijacking , trying to keep the plane 's passengers calm while complying with Potts ' orders .

Asked whether he would accept an apology from Potts , Gamble said he holds no grudges . `` I would consider it , '' he said .
