-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Los Angeles Times headline said it all : `` Rep. Paul Ryan Fails to Close Republican Divide . ''

When this became Ryan 's job , or whether his now `` controversial '' Wall Street Journal op-ed was even an attempt at doing that , is anyone 's guess .

Where we 're divided is over tactics . Incidentally , Ryan hinted at this in September to Politico :

`` Yeah , there 's a bit of frustration . ... We all believe the same thing , we all want to achieve the same goal , and so we should n't be questioning each other 's conservatism over tactical disagreements . ''

Cruz speechwriter Amanda Carpenter tweeted , `` There is one big word missing from this op-ed . It 's start -LRB- sic -RRB- with an O and ends with BAMACARE . ''

Heritage Action spokesman Dan Holler was similarly snarky : `` Much like White House press , Paul Ryan does n't mention Obamacare in WSJ oped . #shutdown . ''

But the thing that defies logic -LRB- and good manners -RRB- is the necessity of this kind of puerile bullying . Ryan 's plan is n't in competition with or heretical to Cruz 's message . It 's simply another objective conservatives should fight for , both in the short term and the long term .

I do n't recall Ryan jumping into the fray when plenty of Republicans were criticizing the strategy to defund Obamacare -- a position by Cruz that I have applauded as heroic . When Sens. Bob Corker and Orrin Hatch and Rep. Peter King were scolding Cruz for a plan they knew was ill-fated , Ryan was virtually silent on the move . This , even though Cruz has never been shy about his disdain for Ryan Republicans . Back in March , Cruz criticized Ryan 's budget plan for its Medicare cuts . And he 's made it clear he does n't trust Ryan when it comes to budget negotiations .

It 's hard to argue that Ryan is n't a staunch conservative . To treat him like a traitor is preposterous and unproductive . And while I admire Cruz 's conviction , and stand by his commitment to peel back a program as odious and ruinous as the Affordable Care Act , he has to learn to work with others on his own team .
