-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week we mark Constitution Day , commemorating the electrifying moment on September 17 , 1787 when the Philadelphia framers went public with their proposed Constitution .

But America no longer leads the world in the integrity and inclusiveness of our elections ; several states are now shamelessly trying to roll back voting rights ; the Supreme Court has renounced a key piece of the landmark Voting Rights Act ; and Congress has yet to mend the tattered statute .

Perhaps because the Constitution 's supporters did not try to muzzle skeptics , these skeptics , when outvoted , acquiesced . In several states , the document squeaked through only by the narrowest of margins -- for example , 30 to 27 in New York .

Yet everyone accepted the basic principle of majority rule , even though the document itself did not explicitly specify this voting rule . Here , too , there are lessons for today .

The entrenched filibuster has made the current Senate a deeply dysfunctional body , yet some senators seem to think that a supermajority-rule system has deep roots in founding principles and practices . These senators are mistaken .

Finally , let 's note the extraordinary religious inclusion championed by the document first unveiled in mid-September 1787 . Unlike most revolutionary state constitutions and the contemporaneous rules generally in place elsewhere on the planet , the Constitution opened its doors to office seekers of all faiths and philosophies .

Last year , three of the four men atop the major party tickets -- Mitt Romney , Paul Ryan , and Joe Biden -- were not members of the mainstream Protestant churches that dominated society at the founding . Today 's speaker of the House is a Catholic , the Senate majority leader is a Mormon , and no Protestant sits on the current U.S. Supreme Court .

One is tempted to say , `` only in America ! '' but in fact there are other modern countries that are democratic and religiously pluralist . However , many of these democracies have been powerfully influenced by the American constitutional experience .

Before the Constitution went public in 1787 , pluralistic democracy existed almost nowhere on the planet , outside America . Thus it had always been throughout recorded history . Today , constitutional self-government reigns across half the globe , and it does so thanks largely to the legal , political , cultural , moral and military success of the American constitutional project .

In short , the world is becoming more American -LRB- and America itself , thanks to trade and immigration , is becoming more global -RRB- . So we should not say `` only in America , '' but rather `` only because of America '' -- and in particular , because of America 's Constitution and because of the year that changed everything .
