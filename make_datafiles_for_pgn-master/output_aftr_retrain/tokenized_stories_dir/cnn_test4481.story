But some of the impacts are less obvious , more outrageous , or a little bit of both .

Here 's a sampling of some of the spinoff effects of the shutdown showdown in Washington :

State Department defends $ 5 million for high-end glassware

In the digital equivalent of throwing a sheet over unused furniture , many federal agencies have replaced their websites and all the information on them with static pages announcing the government shutdown .

Whether a website will be up or not , however , is something of a guessing game .

The National Parks Service site is down . It sends visitors to the Department of Interior 's website , which is up but not being updated .

The Department of Justice website is up , but the website for its subordinate agency , the Bureau of Justice Statistics , greets visitors with a stark white page reading , `` Due to the lapse in federal funding , this Office of Justice Programs -LRB- OJP -RRB- website is unavailable . ''

That you can still reach the websites mean the computers that serve the data are still up and running , and the government is either paying a private company to operate them or they 're using taxpayer-funded power to continue running .

But it does n't matter if running the sites with big `` closed '' sign draped across the front costs the same or even more than letting them run , the White House said in a September 17 memo to federal employees .

So it 's putting the program into `` caretaker status , '' leaving research stations and other facilities staffed with only the bare number of people necessary to `` ensure human safety and preserve government property , '' the agency said .

The agency says it will try to restart the research program once funding resumes , but says that it could be tough once seasonal workers are let go and the seasonal window to do some of the work has passed .

The shutdown also could make its way to your seafood dinner plate .

Without federal employees to set rules and quotas for the fishing season , crab fleets in Alaska are in limbo -- unsure whether they 'll be able to head out in pursuit of lucrative crab that bring in millions of dollars each season .

A delay of even a few days could be costly , Rep. Suzan DelBene , D-Washington , said in a House speech last week . Her district includes the home port for some of the fleets that fish for Bering Sea crab .

Move along , nothing to see

But federal officials did -- for a time at least -- put traffic cones up at a pull-off where people stop to view the carving from a distance . Depending on whom you ask , the cones were either to block motorists from pulling off or to guide them into viewing areas .

`` They wo n't even let you pull off on the side of the road , '' the Argus Leader newspaper in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , quoted state Tourism Department Secretary Jim Hagen as saying . `` I just do n't know what they 're trying to accomplish . ''

On shutdown 's 9th day , survivors of fallen troops take center stage

The area around the Grand Canyon is a ghost town . It 's no different inside , and park rangers are working to keep it that way , according to The Republic newspaper in Arizona .

Park officials have written about two dozen citations for people trying to sneak into the park . Some have been caught at the canyon 's South Rim , others on trails or attempting hikes , the newspaper reported .

Do n't ` recreate '

According to the Eagle-Tribune newspaper of North Andover , Massachusetts , tourist Pat Vaillancourt said National Park Service Guards held her tour group under armed guard in a Yellowstone National Park hotel and brusquely told tourists who had filed off their bus to take pictures of bison that they were n't to `` recreate . ''

`` She responded and said , ` Sir , you are recreating , ' and her tone became very aggressive , '' the newspaper quoted Vaillancourt as saying .

Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash , who despite being furloughed was asked by park officials to respond to some media inquiries when available , said hotel guests were never held under armed guard .

And stay out !

Retirees Joyce and Ralph Spencer own a cabin on federal land , and were told last week they had 24 hours to clear out and stay out until the government reopens .

Park officials gave KTNV a statement saying overnight stays are not allowed in the park until funding is restored , but said owners can visit their properties to retrieve belongings .

While they 'd like to be allowed back in their home , the worst impact has been that she had to buy her husband new clothes they forgot while packing up to leave their cabin .

`` We 're not hurt in any way except it might cost me if I have to go buy more pants , '' she told KTNV .
