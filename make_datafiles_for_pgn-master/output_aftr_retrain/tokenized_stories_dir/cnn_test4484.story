Phillip Greaves was arrested in his home state of Colorado in December and extradited to Polk County , Florida . Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said at the time his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation , buying a copy of the book `` The Pedophile 's Guide to Love and Pleasure : A Child-Lover 's Code of Conduct , '' through the mail .

Greaves even autographed it . Police paid $ 50 for the book , which they received on December 8 .

Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children , grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents . Judd said last year Greaves ' book outlines a `` code of ethics '' that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children .

Asked if he is a pedophile , Greaves said , `` I only have sex with grown-ups . '' He said he has no children and `` I do n't keep children around my house . ''

On Thursday , as he was leaving jail , Greaves told CNN affiliate WESH he still supports the sale of the book .

`` I do n't think I did anything wrong , '' he said . `` It backfired on me . ''

`` We believe this agreement accomplishes our objectives : to see he does not do it again and give a warning to others who may want to create such materials , '' Thullbery said . `` If he publishes this book again or sells it further , he would be subject to re-arrest . '' If that occurs , Greaves could be sentenced to the maximum for the charge : five years in prison .

However , while the probationary terms apply to Florida , Thullbery did not know what action , if any , Florida prosecutors could take if Greaves sells the controversial book in another state where it could be considered legal .

`` We 'll have to address that issue at that time , '' Thullbery said .
