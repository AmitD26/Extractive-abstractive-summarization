-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Courtesy of the U.S. government shutdown , Chinese President Xi Jinping finds himself in the box seat at his first Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation -LRB- APEC -RRB- forum as leader of the world 's second largest economy .

Usually the United States makes the running at the annual APEC get-together of China , the U.S. , Russia , Japan and 17 other Asia-Pacific economies that between them account for half the world 's output , 45 % of its trade and 3 billion of its inhabitants .

Obama 's cancellation was no surprise . He had already trimmed Malaysia and the Philippines from his Asia itinerary because of the failure of the U.S. Congress to pass a new budget . The possibility that the U.S. government shutdown could escalate into the almost-unthinkable disaster of a debt default later this month prompted him to drop the visit entirely .

Obama 's comments have been dismissed by his Republican opponents as scare tactics , but the world economy can do without this sort of drama . As Putin said after the G20 summit in St. Petersburg , Russia , last month , the global economy is doing better than it was five years ago , `` but the risks are still very high . ''

Obama 's withdrawal is a gift for Putin and Xi . Putin , who was scheduled to follow Obama on the APEC speaking agenda , has as his conversation theme the evocative `` Taking another look at the Asia Pacific : Where are the new opportunities for growth ? ''

Xi is APEC 's final speaker and will deliver a keynote address entitled `` China in transition : What can the Asia Pacific expect ? '' China 's economy may have slowed a little in 2013 and its structural employment , environmental and social issues present big challenges ahead , but it remains very much the regional engine of growth and its Asian neighbors know their prosperity is intimately linked to what happens in China .

With Obama out of the APEC picture , Kerry is doing the heavy lifting in discussions with Xi , Putin and other key leaders such as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indonesian host President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono .

In particular , Kerry is pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership -LRB- TPP -RRB- trade negotiations that have the ultimate objective of creating a free trade pact for Asia-Pacific nations . Twelve countries are in the TPP talks -- Australia , Brunei , Canada , Chile , Japan -LRB- which entered in July this year -RRB- , Malaysia , Mexico , New Zealand , Peru , Singapore , the United States and Vietnam .

When Xi and Obama met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in St. Petersburg last month , the focus was on Syria , greenhouse gases , global economic growth , job creation and investment . In part , it was a continuation of their informal discussions in California in June this year , when Xi made it clear that he wanted to work with Obama on building what he called a `` new model of a major country relationship . ''

For Xi , APEC would have been another opportunity to talk to Obama about rebalancing the U.S.-China relationship , to give due weight to what Xi regards as China 's role as a world power not just economically , but in strategic terms as well .

Instead , he has more time this week to talk with Putin about the growing Sino-Russia relationship and with other Asia-Pacific leaders on regional free trade agreements , economic integration , expanded investment co-operation and sustainable long-term growth .
