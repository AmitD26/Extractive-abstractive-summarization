We respect the fact that some of our fellow brewers would want to differentiate themselves , but we 're convinced that the ultimate assessment of our beers will not come from an industry organization , but instead from America 's beer drinkers .

We know that no matter what style of beer it is , we will ultimately be judged by the quality of our beers . We like that , because we are confident that the quality of our beers stacks up well versus that of any brewer of any size , anywhere .

Now , because we are best known for brewing some of America 's biggest light beers , some people may be skeptical about that claim . We urge those people not to confuse the style of a beer with the quality of the beer . Whether it 's a light lager designed to provide the refreshment many American beer drinkers seek , or a vigorously hopped IPA designed to provide the nice bite many other beer drinkers desire , our brewmasters are obsessed with crafting superior-quality beers within each style .

While we may be big , we are still a company of beer people who take great pride in our beer culture and heritage , tracing our roots to two visionary immigrant entrepreneurs who opened breweries in the mid-19th century , Frederick Miller and Adolph Coors .

The brewers of Leinie 's , Blue Moon and other smaller craft and import beers operate autonomously so they can maintain their own unique personalities and keep experimenting and pushing limits .

As a large brewer , we do not view the emergence of craft beer as a threat , because we know that innovation is essential to the American beer industry . In fact , we appreciate the vital role craft beers play within our industry . And we believe it 's good for beer that there are more breweries and more brands available to American beer drinkers than at any other time in U.S. history .
