-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Sandy Hook Elementary School students returned to class Thursday for the first time since last month 's massacre , Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy set a two-month deadline for a commission to address the state 's gun laws , mental health policies and public security issues .

`` We can work together to make our state a model for the rest of the nation , '' said Malloy , who also called on Congress to enact stricter national gun control laws .

The move comes just weeks after a gunman killed 26 people at the Newtown elementary school , including 20 children , ages 6 and 7 .

On Thursday , Sandy Hook parents accompanied their children to an emotional first day back in school .

`` There was a little bit of anxiety , but everybody was happy to be back in the swing of things , '' said Sarah Swansiger , the mother of a kindergarten student .

Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson has said that part of the Chalk Hill building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school and that security had also been increased , incorporating an upgraded system of new cameras and locks .

'' -LRB- We want -RRB- to have as much -LRB- of -RRB- a normal routine as possible , '' said Robinson . '' -LRB- Thursday -RRB- is a regular schedule , and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids . ''

Counselors were also on hand to help parents , students , teachers and administrators in coping with the emotional toll of returning to class .

Swansiger said that while there were `` some emotional moments in the beginning of the day ... you could n't walk around the corner without someone asking if you were OK . ''
