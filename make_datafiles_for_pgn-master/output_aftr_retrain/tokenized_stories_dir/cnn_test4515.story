-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Days after a deadly Metro-North train derailment in New York , a top federal transportation official said Tuesday that he has `` serious concerns '' about safety on the railroad .

In addition to Sunday 's derailment in the Bronx , which killed four people and injured dozens more , Federal Railroad Administration chief Joseph Szabo listed three other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains .

The letter also describes a May 17 train derailment and collision in Bridgeport , Connecticut ; the death of a Metro-North employee on May 28 in West Haven , Connecticut ; and a CSX freight train derailment in the Bronx on July 18 .

More needs to be done immediately to improve safety , Szabo said .

`` A C3RS is in place on other rail lines across the country ... and has proven effective in identifying safety issues and lowering injury and accident exposure , '' he wrote .

`` We have significant concerns about the current situation at Metro-North , and are actively considering other ways that FRA can use its federal oversight authority to provide additional safety enhancement of MTA operations , '' he wrote .

`` The safety of the MTA 's customers and employees has always been , and will always continue to be , our top priority . We look forward to working with the Federal Railroad Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation to improve safety , '' MTA spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said . `` We have been moving forward on a confidential close call reporting system , and we look forward to working with the FRA to implement it . ''

The May collision between two Metro-North passenger trains in Bridgeport sent dozens of people to the hospital after a train heading from New Haven to New York City derailed during rush hour and smashed into a train heading in the opposite direction .

Less than 10 days later , a train hit and killed a Metro-North employee who was doing maintenance work on tracks in the vicinity of the construction of a new station in West Haven , CNN affiliate WFSB reported .
