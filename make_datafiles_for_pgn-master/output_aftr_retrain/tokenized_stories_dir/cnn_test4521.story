-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lady Gaga -- the flamboyant and provocative New York-based pop singer -- has been removed from a Chinese government blacklist , allowing her chart-topping new album `` ARTPOP '' to go on sale legally in China .

But Chinese censors have placed conditions on the album art , inflating a large ball between her legs to cover more of the naked singer 's body and adding a pair of black tights to the singer 's bare legs .

The cover of her latest album was designed by the American artist Jeff Koons , who specializes in garish and kitsch representations of the banal and everyday .

Singling out songs from her album `` Born this Way , '' Chinese authorities identified six Gaga tracks -- `` The Edge of Glory , '' `` Hair , '' `` Marry the Night , '' `` Americano , '' `` Judas '' and `` Bloody Mary '' -- as among 100 foreign songs to be placed on a blacklist .

Katy Perry 's `` Last Friday Night '' and the Backstreet Boys ' `` I Want It That Way '' were also included in the sweep .

The ministry at the time said that foreign songs would be subject to the same censorship requirements as domestic artists . All albums for release must be screened by the State Administration of Radio , Film and Television .

Lady Gaga last week responded with enthusiasm to the lifting of the ban on her Twitter feed .

`` I do n't think ban is the way to put it , '' a spokeswoman told CNN . `` All Lady Gaga 's albums are on sale in China . The newest one is already on sale . ''

Posters on China 's lively social media site Sina Weibo were typically mordant about the lifting of the ban .

'' ' X Dream ' implies the ` China Dream ' , '' said one poster , in reference to Chinese President Xi Jinping 's slogan about the country pursuing the ` Chinese Dream . ' `` That must be why those high up in the administration have given it a special pass . ''
