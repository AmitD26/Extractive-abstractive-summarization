Glendon Scott Crawford , 49 , and Eric J. Feight , 54 , were arrested Tuesday after an undercover operation by the Albany FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force . They were charged with conspiracy to provide material support for use of a weapon of mass destruction , according to the criminal complaint .

Crawford and Feight were developing a device `` intended to be mobile ... designed to turn on remotely from some distance away '' that would emit `` some dangerous levels of X-ray radiation , '' according to John Duncan , executive assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York .

Individuals who might have been `` subject to this X-ray radiation , would not immediately know that they had been harmed until some days later when they would either be injured , or it could result in their death , '' he said .

Crawford and Feight appeared in court Wednesday . If convicted , each faces up to 15 years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine and five years of supervised release .

Feight appeared with a lawyer , while the judge appointed one for Crawford . CNN attempted to contact the attorneys late Wednesday but was unsuccessful .

Andrew St. John , a friend of Feight 's for 30 years , called Feight a `` pacifist '' and a `` smart guy . ''

Crawford , a manufacturing employee at a GE plant in Schenectady , New York , worked with Feight , an employee at a nearby automotive company often contracted by GE , according to the investigation report . The automotive company did not comment .

Since the arrest , Crawford has been suspended from the company , which is fully cooperating with authorities , according to GE spokesman Shaun Wiggins .

`` We have no reason to believe the act took place on GE property , nor is there any information indicating that our employees ' safety was ever compromised , '' Wiggins said .

Crawford contacted two Jewish organizations in April 2012 for funding assistance of an `` off the shelf '' technology that could be used by Israel to defeat its enemies by killing them while the slept , according to the criminal complaint .

A lengthy federal investigation then began . Agents met with Crawford and Feight , posing as both potential middle men and customers for this `` radiation emitting device , '' according to the criminal complaint .

In October , Crawford traveled to North Carolina to meet with a high-ranking KKK official and two businessmen affiliates , all working with the FBI , to discuss his scheme and raise money , according to the complaint .

Feight was introduced to undercover FBI agents in November and called the design of the lethal machine `` incredibly smart '' because it gives `` a lot more isolation from the ... issue , '' according to a recorded dialogue in the criminal complaint .

According to the criminal complaint , Crawford made arrangements with colleagues to contact his wife to retrieve his computer and phone , containing important data , so they could move on with the operation . In an e-mail to an unidentified person , Crawford said : `` if something happens I do n't want this to go away , it can serve our people well . ''
