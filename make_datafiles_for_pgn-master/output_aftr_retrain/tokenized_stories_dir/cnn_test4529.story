Bjoerndalen , 40 , became the oldest individual gold medalist in Winter Games history on Saturday by winning the men 's biathlon 10 km sprint . He tied cross country skier Bjorn Daehlie of Norway for a record 12 Olympic Winter medals .

He could become the outright record-holder if he wins a 13th medal Monday in the men 's 12.5-km pursuit .

Curling

For people who do n't know anything about winter sports , curling is a hoot . It 's a lot like shuffleboard on ice , relying on strategy more than strength or quickness . Two teams of four players each slide heavy polished stones across the ice toward a circular target . Points are scored by placing stones closest to the center of the target .

The U.S. women will face Switzerland on Monday . One of the United States ' top players is Ericka Brown , 41 , who comes from a curling family . Her husband , father , mother and brother have all competed on the Olympic or national level .

Who else to watch : Canada has dominated men 's curling for the past decade and won gold at the 2010 games in Vancouver . Sweden won gold for the women at the last Olympics .

Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein hopes to follow in her mother 's ski tracks . Mom Hanni Wenzel won gold in the alpine skiing slalom at Lake Placid in 1980 , making her the only woman from Liechtenstein to ever win an Olympic gold medal .

Who else to watch : Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany won gold in two events at the 2010 games . Teenager Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States is a favorite in the slalom .

Short track skating

This is one of the Winter Games ' newest and most exciting events . It did n't become an official Olympic competition until 1992 . With extremely tight turns , each race presents the possibility of collisions and spills .

Charles Hamelin of Canada is the favorite to win the 1,500 meters . In the 2010 games at Vancouver , he won gold in the 500-meter event as well as the 5,000-meter relay .

Who else to watch : Some other contenders in the 1,500 include Lee Han-Bin and Sin Da Woon , both of Korea .

This is going to get bumpy . In perhaps the most jarring of all winter sports , mogul skiers try to fly through a course while bouncing over huge mounds of snow . Oh , and they throw in some flips and aerial turns in between , too .

On Monday , a new king of the mounds will be crowned . Canada 's Mikael Kingsbury is a favorite to win the gold . The 21-year-old has been skiing moguls since he was 8 years old .

Who else to watch : Another Canadian , Alex Bilodeau , and American Patrick Deneen are also strong contenders .
