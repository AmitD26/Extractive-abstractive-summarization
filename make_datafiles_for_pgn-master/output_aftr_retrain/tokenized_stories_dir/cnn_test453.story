-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia , Yemen , and now Syria and Iraq . The decade-plus duration of America 's confrontation with al Qaedism offers lessons not only on how we battle extremist ideology but also how we should calibrate our expectations .

The traditional goal in warfare is simple : Defeat the adversary by destroying its will and capability to pose a threat . Force the adversary to capitulate .

We know by now that in no cases have the adversary 's radical ideology been defeated . The most striking successes , such as Indonesia 's evisceration of the Jemaah Islamiya organization and African forces ' push against Al-Shabaab in Somalia , have only limited the reach of al Qaedism but failed to fully stem the flow of recruits to al Qaeda affiliates or squelch the ideology that underpins its festering .

In Somalia , Al-Shabaab has been pushed out of large swaths of territory and its leader killed , but it is nowhere near finished in East Africa . French successes in Mali were stunning but have not come close to defeating al Qaedism in the Sahel .

Despite these lessons , commentators across the political spectrum speak today about the defeat of an even larger , more geographically diverse , and more brutal adversary , in Syria and Iraq , as if somehow the lessons of the durability of al Qaeda ideology has proven brittle in other , equally complex , battlefields . It has n't .

We need to manage not just our expectations . Our rhetoric , too , matters more than we think . When we declare that we will defeat ISIS , what do we mean ? What is a sufficient condition to declare victory ? Unless we define that condition , we risk involving ourselves in yet another unending conflict .

There is a more modest way forward , though , and one that has proven successful without overreaching . How about rolling back ISIS gains , confining it in and preventing the flow of fighters both into the battle area and back , as one goal ?

Yes , and that has already begun . Simply showing to its local adversaries that ISIS is n't invincible , that it folds under pressure , is an early win . And it is n't just American airpower that can accomplish this . Shia in Baghdad 's outskirts , Kurds in Syria , the Peshmerga in northern Iraq , have begun to push back and have had early successes . This will be a long , tough battle , but ISIS has made too many enemies and has too few friends to succeed in the long term .

Truly degrading the ISIS menace will involve eliminating the minds who manage the operation . The leaders , including not just ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi , but also his so-called ministers , media advisers and field commanders , need to be killed or captured .

Pakistan 's Waziristan region offers other important lessons . Gains against the entrenched al Qaeda network there did n't come overnight . Likewise , America 's years of engagement against key targets in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen provide a blueprint .

Along with our allies , we want to free the people who now come under the cruel ISIS boot . Defeat of ISIS may come . In the meantime , a good dose of degrade will be more than sufficient .
