The bill comes on the heels of Arizona passing the nation 's toughest immigration law .

John Kavanagh , a Republican state representative from Arizona who supports the proposed law aimed at so-called `` anchor babies , '' said that the concept does not conflict with the U.S. Constitution .

`` If you go back to the original intent of the drafters ... it was never intended to bestow citizenship upon -LRB- illegal -RRB- aliens , '' said Kavanagh , who also supported Senate Bill 1070 -- the law that gave Arizona authorities expanded immigration enforcement powers .

Kyrsten Sinema , a Democratic state representative , strongly opposes the bill .

`` Unlike -LRB- Senate Bill -RRB- 1070 , it is clear this bill runs immediately afoul of the U.S. Constitution , '' she said .
