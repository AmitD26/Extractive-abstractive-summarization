He added , `` Much of what has been speculated or reported on blogs and/or reported in the media is wrong . While I would like to be able to talk about this more , until the legal issues are resolved , this is all I can say except that I have not written any messages or made any posts to Facebook , on blogs or any place else . Those posts or writings under my name are frauds . ''

Police are investigating the incident .

A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney 's Office said Wednesday the office needed more information before deciding on whether to charge Brown .

Brown , who did not appear at the awards show , was released from jail that night on $ 50,000 bail and given a March 5 court date .

Brown 's lawyer did not respond to repeated requests for comment .

Police said Brown and a woman were in a vehicle near Hollywood 's Hancock Park early February 8 when they became involved in an argument .

Police did not identify the woman , but sources close to the couple told CNN the alleged victim was his girlfriend , the 20-year-old singer Rihanna , whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty .

She has made no public comment . Her spokesman issued only a short statement on the evening of February 8 , when she canceled her performance at that night 's Grammy Awards . `` Rihanna is well , '' her spokesman said at the time . `` Thank you for concern and support . ''

CNN 's Jennifer Wolfe and Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report .
