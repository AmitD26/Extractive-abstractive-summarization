For over a quarter of a century , Weird Al has made a career out of his two passions : music and comedy . His parodies and satirical songs and videos have amassed an army of devoted fans -- 2 million of them follow him on Twitter . He 's won three Grammy Awards and has sold more comedy albums than any other artist in history .

And now , the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing , accordion-playing , curly-haired pop satirist can also call himself a children 's book author .

`` As my father used to tell me , the only true sign of success in life is being able to do for a living that which makes you happy , '' Yankovic said . And what made him happy turned out to be a career that , Yankovic admits , no one in his family ever thought would go in the direction it has .

`` He said , ` Oh there 's no future in comics , you 're not going to make a living doing that . ' He said , ` Well , you 're good at drafting , you 're good at math , you 're creative , why do n't you be an architect ? ' So I decided , OK , I 'm going to be an adult , I 'm going to grow up , and this is what I 'm going to do for a living . ''

`` I suppose I had my rock star fantasies while I was singing into my hairbrush in the bathroom mirror , but I never really consciously said , ` OK , this is what I 'm going to do for a living and I 'm going to be Weird Al. ' My hobbies just sort of gradually became my vocation , '' he said .

Yankovic 's favorite career in Billy 's possible future ? `` Master debater , '' he said , with that instantly recognizable laugh . `` I ca n't believe I got that through the censors . Actually I was on the speech team in high school so that probably is pretty close . ''

`` I do n't know if Billy is obsessive-compulsive , '' Yankovic said , `` but he seems to have a lot of ideas , his head is filled with a lot of random thoughts . I do n't know if that 's typical of all nerds , but that 's sort of how my brain is . If I can extrapolate it , maybe that 's something I share with Billy . ''

`` I mean , it 's an extension of who I am , so I do n't have a lot of choice in the matter , '' he said .

Even Yankovic 's recent album `` Straight Out of Lynwood '' rides the nerd wave to success . The video for `` White and Nerdy '' has been viewed online over 100 million times .

Nerds are focused and probably obsessed about a few things , Yankovic said . `` Their field of vision is narrowed , that 's part of the description of a nerd , I think , but it 's that kind of laser focus and attention to detail and passion that also makes them very successful in their chosen field . ''

This was the first time Yankovic has ever worked with an editor , Anne Hoppe from Harper Collins . For someone who has enjoyed the unhindered control of an artist , it turned out to be a positive experience .

`` Anne was a great partner in this , '' he said . `` I would write her four lines of verse and she 'd write me back four pages of notes . ''

`` We finessed this text for a very long time and I 'm very happy with the way it turned out . It was just really great to have somebody that I could have those kinds of dialogues with . ''

Likewise , Yankovic is happy with the presentation of his ideas by illustrator Wes Hargis . The whimsy Hargis brings to the collaboration is something Yankovic feels is just right .

`` He really has a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality . I think it was just the perfect partnership for this picture book and I 'm very glad that Anne put us together , '' he said .

What could be better news for longtime Weird Al fans who want to make their favorite satirist a family affair ?
