-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A nurse who was quarantined at a hospital in New Jersey after returning from West Africa was released Monday , her attorney said .

Kaci Hickox , who told CNN the quarantine was violating her rights , was discharged after testing negative for Ebola .

Nurse to return to Maine

Hickox was put in isolation Friday after returning to New Jersey from a month in Sierra Leone .

On Sunday , she spoke by phone with CNN 's Candy Crowley and Elizabeth Cohen .

Hyman said there 's a `` legal basis '' to challenge the quarantine policies in New Jersey and in New York , but the nurse is n't sure she wants to do so .

Each state has a different quarantine law , said Steven Gravely , an attorney who helped rewrite Virginia 's quarantine law so the state could more easily respond to outbreaks .

The U.S. Constitution gives states authority over how to approach health matters , though the federal government has control over what happens concerning public health in airports and shipping ports , Gravely said .

Mandatory quarantines -- now what ?

CDC issues new guidelines

Someone who had direct contact of infected body fluids , for instance , would be classified as high risk . Someone would be considered low risk if she traveled on an airplane with a person showing symptoms of Ebola .

Frieden has long argued against travel restrictions , saying they could hurt the global health community 's effort to tamp down the West Africa outbreak .

What states are doing

The director of the CDC said that active 21-day monitoring began Monday in the six states where about 70 % of air travelers enter the United States from Liberia , Guinea and Sierra Leone , hard-hit countries in West Africa . Those states are New York , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Virginia , New Jersey and Georgia .

State and local officials will maintain daily contact with all travelers from the three affected countries for the entire 21 days after the last possible date of exposure to Ebola virus , Frieden said .

New York , New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days .

`` This protective measure is too important to be voluntary , '' Quinn said .

Christie said Monday that he was glad that Hickox had been released from quarantine .

`` The reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic . If you live in New Jersey , you 're quarantined in your home . That 's always been the policy . If you live outside the state , and you 're symptomatic , we 're not letting you go onto public transportation . It makes no common sense . The minute she was no longer symptomatic , she was released . ''

Virginia is implementing an `` active monitoring program '' for all returning passengers from Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , `` with a special emphasis on returning health care workers , '' Virginia governor 's spokesman Brian Coy has said .

Should health care workers be quarantined ?

Could quarantines backfire ?

Arguments against the quarantines are that they could deter health care workers from traveling to West Africa to fight Ebola and could greatly hurt their livelihoods .

`` If I lose three weeks on my return and do n't get to do the work I 'm supposed to do ... means this would n't be workable for me , '' said Dr. John Carlson , a pediatric immunologist at Tulane University .

Doctors Without Borders was even more direct .

Samantha Power , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , is traveling in Ebola-affected nations in West Africa .

`` Ambassador Power and the traveling party were obviously aware of the discussions of potential quarantines by state and local officials prior to departure and will , of course , be prepared to abide by requirements upon return .

Doctor with Ebola at Bellevue

`` We learned a lot from Dallas , '' Raju said , referring to all that went wrong in Texas when a Liberian national arrived from West Africa with Ebola and two nurses treating him contracted the virus .

They needed the nurses , not the space , the worker said .

`` They are appropriately isolated and receiving further assessment and care , '' the hospital tweeted on Monday .

How the Ebola virus spreads

Ebola and the U.S. military

On Sunday , the Pentagon would not say whether it 's willing to still send an active-duty military Ebola response team to states ordering mandatory quarantine for Ebola health care workers .

The 30-person team finishes training Monday and will then be ready for deployment on 72 hours ' notice . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel would have to approve any deployment .

On Monday , CNN learned from military officials that Army Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams , who 's commander of U.S. Army Africa , and about 10 other personnel are now in `` controlled monitoring '' in Italy after landing there following a West Africa trip over the weekend .

They will be monitored for 21 days at a separate location at a U.S. military installation in Vicenza , Italy , according to military officials . It 's not yet clear if family members can visit them .

`` The Army Chief of Staff has directed a 21-day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance . He has done this out of caution to ensure soldiers , family members and their surrounding communities including host nations are confident that we are taking all steps necessary to protect their health , '' the Army said in a statement .
