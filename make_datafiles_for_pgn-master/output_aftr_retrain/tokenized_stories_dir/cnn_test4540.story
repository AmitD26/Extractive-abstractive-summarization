-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Manchester United 's sorry defense of the English Premier League title continued Sunday as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford by bottom club Fulham .

Rene Meulensteen 's men bravely held on until the 78th minute when Robin van Persie equalized .

The dropped points heap further pressure on under fire manager David Moyes with his team nine points adrift on arch-rivals Liverpool , who are occupying the fourth and final Champions League spot .

`` We made a couple of defensive lapses and it costs us , '' he added .

Fulham , who were avoiding defeat for only the fourth time in 17 games , showed redoubtable spirit and after Sidwell had converted on-loan Lewis Holtby fine pass , Kieran Richardson , a former United player , missed a great chance to put the visitors 2-0 ahead .

With United dominating possession , Van Persie leveled from new signing Juan Mata 's pass .

Everton had the better of the first half and home goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made crucial saves , but after the break Spurs offered more threat , with Emmanuel Adebayor grabbing the only goal of the match .

He was alert after Kyle Walker 's quick free quick and blasted a fine shot past Tim Howard in the 65th minute .

The victory left Tim Sherwood 's team three points adrift of Liverpool , who thrashed Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield Saturday to underline their credentials .
