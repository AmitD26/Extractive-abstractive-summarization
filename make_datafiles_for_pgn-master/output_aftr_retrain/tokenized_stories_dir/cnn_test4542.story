-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- About halfway through The New York Times review of TV chef Guy Fieri 's Manhattan restaurant , I realized that the author was wielding a meat cleaver .

It was at once delicious and stomach-churning -- a perfect reflection of our rip-their-lungs-out culture .

Let 's face it : Media meanness sells . Why slice someone with a surgical precision when you can whack him upside the head with a 2-by-4 ?

Watch : Why Matt Lauer Is getting a bum rap from mean folks on Twitter

But has this trend gone too far in an age when anyone can instantaneously diss anyone else with a single mouse click ? Does it amount to pandering to our collective mean gene ?

Some public figures revel in the insult wars . Donald Trump has called Rosie O'Donnell `` a big fat pig , '' among other choice phrases , and she 's said he keeps returning `` like a raging herpes rash . '' It 's a cheap way of getting attention . And the thing is , it works .

Watch : Is it time for Chelsea Clinton , gay marriage activist , to leave NBC ?

The most popular pundits on television tend to be pugilists who draw cheers from their partisans for punching out the other guy 's lights . When Bill O'Reilly denounces pinheads and loons , his fans eat it up .

The virus long ago spread to the political realm .

Watch : Sex and Sesame Street -- are the media exploiting the Elmo tragedy ?

Maybe Twitter has played a role in fostering succinct snarkiness . Everyone tries to break through the static and get retweeted .

The new nastiness is evident in scandal coverage as well .

It would be nice if folks with access to the biggest megaphones did n't cater to the lowest common denominator . But that 's not the world in which we live .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz .
