-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Google must remove the inflammatory film `` The Innocence of Muslims '' from YouTube.com , a federal appeals court ordered Wednesday . The film had been connected to violent demonstrations in several countries

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a district court 's earlier denial of an injunction that would require taking the film down . Wednesday 's order resulted from a lawsuit filed by Cindy Lee Garcia , one of the actresses in the film , against YouTube , its parent company Google , and the producer of the film , Nakoula Basseley Nakoula , among others .

Garcia 's lawsuit also alleged that the copyright of her performance had been infringed . Google argued `` that Garcia did n't make a protectable contribution to the film '' since Nakoula -- whose aliases include Mark Basseley Youssef , a name cited in the lawsuit -- wrote the dialogue that Garcia spoke , managed the production and dubbed over part of the scene , Kozinski wrote .

Google sent the following statement to CNN Wednesday : `` Today the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an actress in the Innocence of Muslims trailer may have a copyright claim over her five-second appearance in the video . As a result the court ordered Google to remove the video from our services . We strongly disagree with this ruling and will fight it . ''

The anger faded , however , particularly after filmmaker Nakoula 's arrest on September 27 , 2012 .

Although the film was not the direct reason for his incarceration , authorities found that his actions producing `` The Innocence of Muslims '' violated the terms of his probation for a 2010 bank fraud conviction .

He was released from prison in May 2013 .

Garcia had begun receiving death threats after an Egyptian cleric called for everyone involved with the film to be killed , Kozinski wrote .

CNN 's Stella Chan , Stan Wilson , Carey Bodenheimer and Greg Botelho contributed to this report .
