Winter Park , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man who police say fled the scene after his SUV hit a car , sending it into a Winter Park day care center and killing a 4-year-old girl , turned himself in Thursday , Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Maj. Cindy Williams said .

Bond was set at $ 100,000 , according to an arrest affidavit .

Williams said Corchado , 28 , rented a black Mazda CX-5 on Wednesday afternoon after fleeing the accident .

Lily Quintus , 4 , was among 50 children at a KinderCare in Winter Park when a car slammed through a wall . She died later at a hospital .

Lily 's 7-year-old brother aspires to be an engineer and is building a time machine out of his Erector set so he can bring his sister back , the Daily News reported .

Lily 's father is a paramedic with the Groveland Fire Department and one of his co-workers set up a page so people could donate funds for medical and funeral expenses . As of Thursday night , people had given more than $ 33,000 .

Two children and a teacher were released from hospitals on Thursday , according to a statement from Knowledge Universe , which operates KinderCare .

At Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando , where eight of the victims were taken Wednesday , five children remained hospitalized , including one in critical condition . Two were listed in serious condition , one was fair and one was in good condition .

The hospital said two patients were discharged Thursday , but it was unclear whether they were among the people cited in the KinderCare release .

After the incident , which occurred about 3 p.m. on Wedesday , 12 children and one adult were taken to four hospitals , said John Mulhall , a spokesman for Orange County Fire Rescue . Two other people were treated at the scene .

One child was pinned by the car that was knocked into the day care through a front wall .

Teachers gave kids CPR

`` It was just kids on the ground and there was teachers giving CPR . It was horrible . I 've never seen nothing like that before , and I hope I never have to see something like that again . ''

The driver of the car that was forced into the day care center was n't injured . He waited at the scene as workers loaded his car onto a tow truck .

`` We are heartbroken that several of the children in our care and an adult were injured in an accident today , '' KinderCare said in a prepared statement . `` We are pulling for those who have been injured to quickly recover from this tragic accident . ''

Highway Patrol spokeswoman Sgt. Kim Monte said a telephone tip helped authorities find the missing Durango .
