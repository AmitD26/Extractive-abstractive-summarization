-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If most new moms would breastfeed their babies for the first six months of life , it would save nearly 1,000 lives and billions of dollars each year , according to a new study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics .

`` The United States incurs $ 13 billion in excess costs annually and suffers 911 preventable deaths per year because our breastfeeding rates fall far below medical recommendations , '' the report said .

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American Academy of Family Physicians and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all agree that breast milk alone is sufficient for newborns and infants until they are 6 months old .

However , a 2009 breastfeeding report card from the CDC found that only 74 percent of women start breastfeeding , only 33 percent were still exclusively breastfeeding at three months and only 14 percent were still exclusively breastfeeding at six months .

Bartick and her co-author Arnold Reinhold found that most of the excess costs are due to premature deaths . Nearly all , 95 percent of these deaths , are attributed to three causes : sudden infant death syndrome -LRB- SIDS -RRB- ; necrotizing enterocolitis , seen primarily in preterm babies and in which the lining of the intestinal wall dies ; and lower respiratory infections such as pneumonia .

Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of all of these and seven other illnesses studied by the study authors .

There are a lot of factors contributing to low breastfeeding rates in the United States , and Bartick says moms should n't be blamed , because they receive mixed messages and often lack support from the moment their babies are born .

Bartick says many hospitals delay immediate urgent skin-to-skin contact between mom and baby , which can make things harder for the newborn to act on its natural instincts to suckle .

Dr. Alan Fleischman , medical director for the March of Dimes , was not surprised by the findings of the report . Fleischman , who did not work on this study , says if a new mom is struggling with breastfeeding , she may end up in a situation where `` grandmother suggests to stop the silliness and give formula instead .
