New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man whose murder conviction was overturned after he served 22 years in prison will receive a $ 6.4 million settlement from New York City , according to attorneys on the case .

David Ranta , 60 , who was imprisoned for the killing of a Brooklyn rabbi in 1990 , was granted the settlement this week before his claim against the city was even filed in federal court , his attorney Pierre Sussman said Thursday .

New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer settled the pre-litigation claim for wrongful conviction and imprisonment in response to a $ 150 million claim that Ranta filed last year , according to a statement from his office .

`` After a review process and negotiations , my office was able to reach a settlement with Mr. Ranta that is in the best interests of all parties and closes the door on a truly regrettable episode in our City 's history , '' Stringer said in a prepared statement .

`` It is such a significant case , '' said Sussman , who said he believes the quick settlement is a testament to the weakness of the city 's defense against the suit .

`` This is the first time in an exoneration case that a settlement has been reached without the claim making it to the city 's law department , '' he added .

Sussman said Ranta still plans a lawsuit against the state .

Prosecutors have determined the evidence underpinning Ranta 's conviction `` has been degraded to such an extent '' that it would no longer support the verdict , John O'Mara , the deputy district attorney in charge of Brooklyn 's conviction integrity unit , said in March 2013 .

`` No way that happened , '' said Louis Scarcella , one of the detectives who investigated the case . He told CNN last year that Ranta admitted his involvement in the heist attempt and that he stands by the arrest .

Upon Ranta 's exoneration in March 2013 , his attorney told CNN , `` The detective work that was done on this case was at best shoddy and at worst criminal . And I do n't use that word lightly . But when a closer examination is done of the detective work ... it becomes clear that there were so many leads that were n't followed , there were so many notes that were n't taken and just a general lack of attention to an investigation that required nothing but close scrutiny of the scene , of witnesses and so forth . That did n't happen . ''
