-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba made a successful defense of her Olympic 10,000 meters crown to round off the first night of track and field finals Friday .

It was the third Olympic gold medal for Dibaba , who is a seven-time world champion and holds the world record for the 5,000 m.

Dibaba 's teammate Werknesh Kidane pushed the pace after halfway in the grueling 25-lap event to whittle down the medal contenders to two Ethiopians and two Kenyans .

Kidane paid for her efforts but an ever confident Dibaba hit the front before the bell and victory was a formality with Kipyego claiming the silver .

Reese Hoffa of the United States took bronze with 21.23 m .

The Pole took the lead in the third round and finished off in style with his best effort .

Ennis , the poster girl of the 2012 London Games , set personal bests in the 100m hurdles and 200m on the way to a first day score of 4,158 points , 184 clear of Lithuanian Austra Skujyte .

With the long jump , javelin and 800m to go , Ennis has a healthy lead over defending Olympic champion Natallia Dobrynska of Ukraine and Russian world champion Tatyana Chernova , who were 10th and ninth respectively .

Her old rival Sanya Richards-Ross of the United States also progressed . Amantle Montsho of Botswana was fastest qualifier in 50.40 seconds .
