Soldiers from the Welsh Guards carry the coffin of Maj Sean Birchall , killed on patrol in Afghanistan in June .

Following the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States and the Taliban 's subsequent refusal to extradite members of al Qaeda , the United States allied itself to the Northern Alliance and moved to bring down the Taliban . Following this , the UK and other NATO member states stepped forward to help rebuild the country under a United Nations mandate .

While critics of the war have claimed that al Qaeda and the Taliban are separate entities , the links between the two organizations were quite strong ; both share a strict interpretation of Islam and a deep antipathy for the West and modernism more generally . And this affinity has not been played out in the ideological sphere alone : before 9/11 , an elite al Qaeda formation called the 055 Brigade fought alongside the Taliban in northern Afghanistan and provided training and strategic support . This military co-operation is likely to continue today .

Gordon Brown 's statement in 2007 that two-thirds of all terrorist attacks originate in the region reveals not only the severity of the threat but also the fact that many of these plots are hatched over the border in Pakistan . And yet sending British troops across the border is not an option . The Pakistani military has been engaged in a low-level war in the border regions with elements of the Taliban since 2001 , when they streamed into the country , chased by U.S. and Northern Alliance forces .

These elements have successfully taken over the region by emphasizing their Pashtun kinship , the predominant ethnic group in the area , and by killing or intimidating pro-Pakistani government tribal elders . They have been able to negotiate one false cease-fire after another with the Pakistani security forces , while at the same time regrouping and repairing their losses .

If the military part of the campaign is to succeed , there must be positive results in diplomacy , development and security sector reform .

The first will be necessary to bring regional actors like Iran , Pakistan , and India to the table , and to buy over local Taliban commanders and their fighters . In development terms , northern Afghanistan is already showing some results , but there is much more to be done in the south where the fighting is the most severe .

Development efforts should instead focus on cultural-neutral projects such as building a civil service , developing agriculture , building lanes of communication like bridges , roads , and train lines . Local and national markets should be developed , for nothing breeds peace like prosperity .

We should not be imposing our vision of how society should be , but rather building an Afghan state that can survive and thrive in the cultural context in which it sits . Furthermore , development efforts should be reformed with government agencies taking more of the brunt of the work than private contractors .

The first result would be the rejuvenation and galvanization of al Qaeda and other similar fundamentalist groups around the world . While victory is possible , it must be carefully defined . Already , signs of success are evident in other parts of the country that detract from the gloomy view that we regularly receive from our newspapers and television .

According to a UK Department for International Development report released in April , the number of Afghan children in school has increased from one million in 2002 to six million in 2008 . Healthcare is now available to more than 82 per cent of the population , and 40,000 more children will live beyond their first birthday than in 2002 .

A sudden withdrawal by the West would send the wrong message to both friends and enemies alike in the region and would result in the probable collapse of the infant Kabul government . Furthermore , given that UK losses -LRB- to take one example -RRB- have been lower than those experienced in the Northern Ireland and the Falklands campaigns , withdrawal would question the UK ability to stomach losses defending itself and its allies .
