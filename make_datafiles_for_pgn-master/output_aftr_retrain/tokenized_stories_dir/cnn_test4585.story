-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was smooth sailing in the House , but things are looking much tighter in the Senate for a bipartisan budget proposal that aims to avert another government shutdown and relax sweeping forced spending cuts .

At least four Republicans told CNN they are committed to backing procedural votes needed to pass the measure .

Final congressional approval of an elusive budget agreement that was overwhelmingly approved in the House and supported by the White House would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off .

Other key GOP members

In addition to McCain , Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a moderate who often votes with Democrats , said she will vote for the bill . Sen. Richard Burr , R-North Carolina , and Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Arizona , said they are undecided on the bill itself , but both will vote with Democrats on the critical procedural motions .

Democrats think they have a chance of getting the support of Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , and Sen. Roy Blunt , R-Missouri . Each seemed to be struggling with their decision .

`` It needs to get done for a lot of good reasons ; we want to avoid a shutdown , clearly , '' Murkowski said . `` Do I like a lot of the stuff in it ? Eh , no . ''

Most GOP Senators , raising a variety of concerns , are expected to vote against the bill .

Budget deal struck

The budget agreement , which was months in the making , eases spending caps for the next two fiscal years while softening the impact of across-the-board spending cuts , known as the sequester , on hard-hit defense and non-defense programs .

Current federal spending expires in mid January , raising the possibility of another shut down at that time without a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled .

But after reading details of the agreement , many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill .

`` I 'd really like to stay within the caps , '' complained Sen. John Boozman , R-Arkansas . `` This busts the caps and as a result I 'll vote against it . ''

`` I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees , '' said Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , in announcing his opposition .

`` We need to find a better way to save $ 6 billion than take it out of the hides of our retired veterans , '' said Sen. Roger Wicker , R-Mississippi who said he would vote against the bill .

Graham , Wicker , and Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-New Hampshire , sent a letter to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits .

The retiring first-term lawmaker predicted the bill will pass the Senate regardless of the way he votes .

The top Senate Republican , Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky , has hinted strongly he will vote against it . He cites the weakening of budget sequester as a key complaint . The same is true for his top two lieutenants -- Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota -- both of whom have declared they will oppose the compromise .

McConnell and Cornyn are up for re-election and both facing primary challenges from the right . That might explain some of their sensitivity to giving up on the budget cuts , which are very popular with conservative voters .

Three leading tea party-backed senators -- Rand Paul of Kentucky , Ted Cruz of Texas , and Marco Rubio of Florida , -- each with 2016 presidential aspirations , also have come out against it for similar reasons .

`` The new budget deal moves in the wrong direction : it spends more , taxes more , and allows continued funding for Obamacare . I can not support it , '' Cruz said .
