-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- George H.W. Bush turns 90 today -LRB- June 12 -RRB- , only the fourth American president to reach that age . He 's the last of the World War II presidents , the last American leader to preside over the Cold War , the last of a generation of elected leaders who saw themselves as old-fashioned public servants rather than cutthroat campaigners .

It starts with what Bush said to a group of young people in one of the last speeches he gave as President : `` What all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure . It 's through service that all of us can find both . ''

He certainly has had 90 years of `` meaning and adventure '' â € '' flying as one of the youngest Navy pilots in World War II ; serving in Congress during the 1960s ; as US liaison to China in the days of Mao ; as chair of the Republican Party during Watergate ; as head of the CIA after the Church Commission ; as Ambassador to the United Nations during the Cold War ; as Vice President during the Reagan Revolution ; as President during the collapse of the Soviet Union .

And as a post-presidential humanitarian , he has raised millions for cancer research and disaster relief alongside the man who was his most bitter political rival .

Bush had a front-row seat to most of the major events of the second half of the 20th century , and he did it by dedicating his life to service to others .

`` Public service is a noble calling , '' something he 's said so often that it 's engraved on a bust at his Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University . -LRB- The students rub its brass nose for good luck ; he once quipped , `` Thank God it was only a bust ! '' -RRB-

`` This man has affected this country and served this country in so many ways , '' said sports commentator Jim Nantz , `` and he 's done it every step of the way with a kind heart , with good intentions , with real concern that he 's doing the right thing to help people . ''

`` He remembers sitting in an Andover -LSB- High School -RSB- auditorium right after Pearl Harbor was attacked , '' Pierce said . `` There was this spirit that he wanted to be a part of . He wanted to go and defend America , he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself . ''

Condoleezza Rice is concerned that young people have only seen the worst of elected officials in a gridlocked Washington that seems to feed on character assassination . She knows how hard it is to decide to go into public service in such a poisonous environment .

`` I would say to young people : Never forget that democracy depends on its citizens to care about it , to promote it , to work for it , '' Rice said . `` Democracies do n't survive if citizens simply leave it to others to do the hard work of governing , and so if you get a chance to be in public service , do it . The greatest thing that you can do in your life is to serve your country . You could have no better role model than George H. W. Bush . ''
