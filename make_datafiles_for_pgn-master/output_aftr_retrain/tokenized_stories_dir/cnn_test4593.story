LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eleanor Coppola met her husband , Francis in Ireland in 1962 .

Eleanor Coppola with husband Francis . They have been married for 47 years .

It was on the set of splatter flick `` Dementia 13 '' -- she was the shy set decorator ; he was the ambitious rookie director . They began dating and three months later she became pregnant and the couple married .

That was 47 years ago and since then the retiring artist has become something of a chronicler of the extraordinary Coppola family , which includes her flamboyant Oscar-winning husband , daughter , Sophia and actors Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman .

Most famously , she was in the Philippines in 1976 during the notoriously difficult production of `` Apocalypse Now , '' the war epic that almost destroyed Francis ' blossoming career .

Her little camera captured revealing footage of her husband as he and his actors and crew unraveled psychologically , much like the characters in the film . The footage was subsequently immortalized in the documentary `` Hearts of Darkness : A Filmmaker 's Apocalypse . ''

Here Eleanor Coppola talks exclusively to CNN about her pride at seeing Sophia win an Oscar , what Francis is really like and just how close `` Apocalypse Now '' came to disaster .

The Screening Room : Is Francis different on set than at home ?

TSR : What does Francis enjoy most in life ?

EC : People might not realize what a good sense of humor he has . He really likes to sing , he can sing a song about anything . He 'll make up a song , set to a major show tune about anything . If he were here this moment he could make up a song about you .

But once he got out there , he found that he got delving into the research for the material -- he realized this was no lightweight thing . This was a war and people lost their children , sons , husbands . He realized it had more serious themes and considerations and it took him deeper and deeper into himself , the issues of life and death and all the heavy questions of war an epic brings to life .

TSR : How did `` Apocalypse Now '' affect Francis ' state of mind ?

The script was evolving and the scenes were changing -- it just got larger and more complex . And little by little he got out there as far as his characters . That was n't the intention at all at the beginning .

EC : I never intended to make the documentary of all documentaries . I was just trying to keep myself occupied with something to do because we were out there for so long . I just had never shot a documentary before . They wanted five minutes for a TV promotional or something and I thought sooner of later I could get five minutes of film and then it went on to 15 minutes . I just kept shooting but I had no idea ... the evolution of myself that I saw with my camera . So , it was a surprise for both of us and a life changing experience .

EC : When you do something that 's the most extreme and hardest thing you have ever done -- everything is in jeopardy ; your personal life , your financial life is in jeopardy and people 's lives were literally in jeopardy . Two people lost their lives in that production , in the course of building . It involved 700 people to build the temple and there was an accident . So , it was a powerful experience and I think we came back in a new place . When you stretch yourself that far , you are able to come back in a deeper more thoughtful way .

TSR : Francis is known to fight for his actors , like when he insisted on having young unknown Al Pacino in `` The Godfather '' against the studio 's wishes

EC : I think his vision is extremely clear . That is just the way his life is . So , when someone says you ca n't have the green chair on this set , that is n't acceptable to him . He just does n't see it that way . It is the way his vision perceives it and there are n't any alternatives . So , if people say `` no '' to him , he just brushes that aside and he pays no attention .

TSR : What 's it like to watch your children , Roman and Sophia who are both film directors on set ?
