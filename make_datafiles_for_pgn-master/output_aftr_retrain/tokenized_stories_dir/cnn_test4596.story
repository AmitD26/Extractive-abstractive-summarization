`` I misled the American people , '' Jackson , 48 , said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed the term , which also included an order for restitution and community service .

The pair pleaded guilty in February to various charges -- Jackson to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud , and false statements ; and his wife to filing false tax returns .

`` I still , believe in the power of forgiveness . I believe in the power of redemption . Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways , '' he said before climbing into a waiting vehicle .

A smooth politician and the son of a civil rights leader and one-time political heavyweight , the younger Jackson admitted to using campaign money to pay for things such as vacations , furs and Michael Jackson memorabilia .

In a statement read in court , Jackson said he wanted to be held accountable for his actions and he knew what he did was wrong .

`` I ask that my kids not suffer from my actions , '' Jackson said of his two children , 9 and 13 . `` If probation is not available to my wife , give me her time . ''

Jackson 's lawyers reiterated that sentiment and asked the court for an 18-month sentence for Jackson and probation for his wife .

`` This is not Madoff , '' Reid Weingarten , Jackson 's lawyer , said in court , referring to notorious Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff . `` There was no Ponzi scheme . ''

Sandi Jackson sobbed through part of her courtroom statement and said she `` put her family unit in peril '' for filing false tax returns .

`` I stand before you today asking for mercy , '' she said . `` My heart breaks every day with the pain it 's caused my babies . I ask the court for mercy . ''

`` This is a sad day that involves a waste of talent , '' prosecutor Matthew Graves said . `` They were in the top 10 percent of household earnings in the United States . There 's just no need for this kind of conduct . ''

Graves said that Jackson did not `` deserve credit '' for his job as a congressman .

`` That 's what he was paid to do , '' he said .

`` The real remorse you 've shown is palpable in this courtroom , '' she said . `` There 's no question you 've suffered . Your remorse is real . ''

After sentencing , the judge gave the couple a few minutes to discuss who wanted to serve their sentence first .

Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery , Alabama , the judge said .

In addition to jail time , Jackson must repay in full the money he misused , while his wife was ordered to make restitution of $ 22,000 .

Jackson and his wife also were ordered to perform community service .

Jackson in Congress until 2012

According to court records , Jackson misused about $ 750,000 in campaign funds from August 2005 through July 2012 . Some of the eye-popping spending included $ 60,000 at Antiques of Nevada , where Jackson bought two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $ 8,000 ; a $ 5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents ; and memorabilia involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee .

The Jackson 's also use campaign funds to purchase Blu-Ray DVD players from Best Buy , dresses and jewelry from a small boutique and fur capes and parkas from a Beverly Hills , California , furrier .

In total , prosecutors said Jackson made more than 3,000 purchases .

He was succeeded by Democratic Rep. Robin L. Kelly , who won a special election this year to fill the vacancy in the Illinois 2nd Congressional District .

In 1997 , Newsweek named him one of the 100 people to watch in the next century .

`` He 's a hit in Congress , '' read the Newsweek article . `` Will he be the first black president ? ''

Outside the courtroom , Jackson Sr. told reporters that his son was `` unbelievably sick '' a year ago , but is now doing better .

`` I do n't know how I missed so many signs , '' the elder Jackson said .
