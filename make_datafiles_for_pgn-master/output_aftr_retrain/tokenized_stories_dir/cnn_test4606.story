Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A year later , President Barack Obama will likely talk differently about Syria .

Exactly one year earlier -- on September 10 , 2013 -- Obama also spoke to the nation from the White House to explain why he called off asking Congress to approve air strikes on Syria over its use of chemical weapons .

A lot has changed in the ensuing 12 months , particularly the rise of the Sunni extremists who call themselves the Islamic State and who seek dominance over a swath of the Middle East .

Here 's a look at what Obama has learned about Syria in the past year :

1 -RRB- Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is n't going anywhere

`` I have resisted calls for military action , because we can not resolve someone else 's civil war through force , particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan , '' Obama said last year .

That forced Obama to start providing military aid to opposition forces it considers legitimate and like-minded to Western desires for democratic governance in Syria .

He added that failure to respond militarily to al-Assad 's use of chemical weapons would allow al Qaeda to `` draw strength in a more chaotic Syria . ''

In the end , there was no U.S. military response after Britain 's Parliament voted against taking part and Obama knew he would lack congressional approval .

3 -RRB- The question of U.S. military action in Syria is complex

Now he may propose some kind of air campaign against ISIS targets in Syria , and voices in Congress are calling for ground troops from a coalition military force -- but no Americans .

4 -RRB- Secure the coalition first

This time , he is expected to detail support from global allies -- including some Middle Eastern countries -- in going after ISIS wherever the threat exists , possibly including Syria .

In addition , many in Congress question if Obama needs congressional approval to launch air strikes on ISIS in Syria , with several legislators saying Tuesday they doubted a vote would occur before November elections .

5 -RRB- It 's an election year

`` America is not the world 's policeman , '' Obama said last year . `` Terrible things happen across the globe , and it is beyond our means to right every wrong . ''

Expect to hear the same thing Wednesday night , less than two months before the congressional elections , as the President straddles the political fault line between conservative calls for exerting military power and liberal opposition to a renewed war footing .

His goal is to satisfy moderates and independents crucial to Democratic hopes of holding on to control of the Senate while not angering the party 's liberal base .
