The Marlins ' brand new $ 634 million ballpark is in the city 's Little Havana , and not surprisingly , Guillen 's words ignited a powder keg of emotion and anger from Cuban-Americans . Since then , Guillen apologized and received his punishment -- suspension from five games .

Guillen joins a long line of people in powerful positions in sports saying offensive things ; salty-tongued Marge Schott , former owner of the Cincinnati Reds , went so far as to praise Hitler .

Cuban-Americans were kicked out of Cuba by a hateful despot . As such , their view of Castro is imbued by violent , tragic experience and memory , and by a profound appreciation for the freedoms they now enjoy in the United States . That a public figure in sports claimed respect -- even love -- for Castro is despicable .

Amid the furor , some major leaguers refrained from any comment , for fear of repercussions in Cuba . Braves pitcher Livan Hernandez , who defected from Cuba 17 years ago , did n't want to risk expressing an opinion , so strong is his fear of Castro . `` I do not talk about politics , '' Hernandez said . `` I still have family down there . ''

Dan Le Batard , a journalist for The Miami Herald , explained , `` Without getting into comparison shopping on atrocities ... for Cuban-Americans , he 's our Hitler . ''

Older Cubans still recount with great pain their memories of Castro 's infamous `` paredons , '' or firing squads , to which he summarily subjected thousands of his enemies at the beginning of his revolution . As Amnesty International 's reports document , the terror , torture and repression that Cubans continue to experience under Castro 's brutal regime seem boundless . Activists against the regime are held for days in detention centers subject to `` interrogations , intimidation , and threats . Beatings during detention have also been reported . ''

Dr. Bernie Fernandez , a renowned Cuban-American doctor in Miami and CEO of the Cleveland Clinic Florida , recalled that when he was 5 and living in Cuba , his father Bernardo , a doctor , became disillusioned with the Castro regime and sought permission to emigrate . This sole act was considered treason , and he was summarily sent to a forced labor camp indefinitely .

The Cuban police took an inventory of the family 's possessions -- thereby taking ownership of them on paper -- and Bernie and his mom and sister were forced to survive on their own . Seven years later Bernardo was released . In 1973 , when Bernie was 12 , Castro 's police conducted another inventory to seize their possessions before letting them leave Cuba .

Bernie Fernandez chokes up remembering how he boarded the plane in a shirt and pants cut out from a sack of potatoes . The family arrived in Spain , penniless . Fernandez eventually made it to Miami , where he struggled to learn English and make something of himself . `` Our experience , '' he says now , `` was mild compared to millions of other Cuban-Americans . ''

Guillen 's insensitive comments and the subsequent explosive reaction from Cuban-Americans have exposed a raw , painful vein in the U.S. Hispanic experience . And such a vein should not be dismissed or ignored .

In that light , Guillen 's five-game suspension hardly seems just . Castro is not Hitler , but Le Batard 's claim that Castro is `` our Hitler '' -- a sentiment echoed by many exiles -- points unavoidably to the fact that the way Cuban-Americans feel about Castro is a lot like the way Jews feel about Hitler .

Such a wake-up call will bring a greater understanding of what it means to be Cuban-American and what it means to be American -- and a much-needed appreciation for the freedoms we often take for granted in this country . Freedoms that Guillen 's beloved Castro ripped so viciously away from his countrymen .
