Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When I first came across a `` virtual lover '' service on e-commerce site Taobao , China 's version of Amazon , I thought it was hype .

The service varies but it includes wake-up calls , text and voice messages , phone calls and goodnight wishes .

Usually I would be skeptical about such a service but I was drawn to a comment left by one `` virtual girlfriend '' enthusiast .

`` It was awesome -- she shared my happiness and cheered me up when I was down . She has a beautiful voice , and an intelligent mind ... I so do n't want to leave her . ''

This glowing review got me interested in having my own `` Miss Right '' on my smartphone . I contacted the Taobao vendor and she asked if I had any preferences .

Options included `` doll-like girls '' and `` mature women , '' while ladies had the choice of different types of `` boyfriends , '' including `` comforting man , '' `` funny lad , '' and `` understanding uncle . ''

I said that I 'd like the girl to be cheerful but not too `` doll-like . ''

Then she asked for my WeChat number , an instant messaging app with 450 million users , and told me there was no refund if I changed my mind .

Confidence boost

A virtual girlfriend may sound seedy but psychologist Paul Yin says this kind of service appeals to men who do n't have the confidence to enter a real-life relationship .

`` They can gain confidence and feel loved through this experience and there 's no risk in getting frustrated from setbacks , '' he told CNN .

`` Many young men ca n't find enough courage to approach girls they find interesting because they fear to be rejected . ''

`` I 've had some quite dedicated ` lovers ' who would sign up for months just to chat with me , '' she said .

The next morning , I woke up to find 24 unread messages . It was my girlfriend 's attempt to wake me up .

If you want to know how it feels to have a virtual relationship , I 'd say if you 're lonely or heartbroken from a recent break up , finding a virtual lover might work better than boozing all night and drunk dialing your ex-lover at three in the morning .

And for those who want to `` get lucky '' , I guarantee you 'll have better luck with the first person you dance with at the nearest club .

And I was pleasantly surprised when she asked to exchange photos and keep in touch after our day was up .
