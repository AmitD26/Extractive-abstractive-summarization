-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Better late than never .

As those in green danced with joy and celebrated the apparent end of Mexico 's World Cup curse , those in orange were already planning their flights home .

A man for whom nothing had gone right all afternoon . His passing was wayward , his touch was off and the quality with which he has been blessed appeared to have temporarily escaped him .

But when the Netherlands needed the Galatasaray man the most , he delivered .

In the energy-sapping conditions of Fortaleza , where the temperature pitchside reached over 100 , Mexico suddenly wilted .

For the best part of 90 minutes it had negated the attacking threat of the Dutch , seen off Robin van Persie and looked good value for a place in the last eight .

Mexico , led by the charismatic and affable Miguel Herrera , have become one of the most difficult sides to beat .

But when it needed its resilience most , it failed .

Instead , Arjen Robben , the man who had tormented Mexico for large periods of the second half , was brought down inside the penalty area by Rafael Marquez .

While the Mexican players protested following Robben 's spectacular fall , their anger fell on deaf ears .

`` He dived three times , he should have cautioned him the first time , '' Miguel Herrera , the Mexico coach , told reporters of Robben after the game .

`` If the referee starts marking fouls that do n't exist , you leave the World Cup to circumstances out of your hands . We expect the referee committee to take a look at that and that this gentleman goes home , just like us . ''

`` The humidity was not in our favor , so when you see that until the very last minute we were fresher and fitter than the Mexicans , that is a big compliment to my players .

`` Not only did they have belief but physically they prepared so well to play this match . That of course gives us enormous confidence going forward . ''

Few would have expected such late drama , with the Dutch appearing to struggle to create many clear-cut opportunities before falling behind .

Those appeals were dismissed by referee Pedro Proenca , as were the shouts from the Dutch when Robben was upended by a combination of Hector Moreno and Marquez .

With both teams having slowed down play following the tournament 's first three-minute cooling break , introduced by FIFA to combat dehydration in the hot weather , it was little surprise that the first half ended goalless .

But the second 45 minutes proved a far more entertaining affair -- especially given Mexico 's rapid start .

That goal appeared to stun the Dutch -- a side which had swept all before it in the group stage .

After all , this was a Netherlands team which had dismantled reigning world champion Spain 5-1 , beaten Chile comfortably and fought back to see off Australia .

First , he denied Stefan de Vrij from close range , pushing his header onto the post before standing tall to block Robben 's effort .

Step forward Sneijder , one of the few experienced players who was there that fateful night in South Africa when his side was beaten in the final by Spain .

Huntelaar , who had replaced the ineffective van Persie , then converted his injury-time penalty to spark wild celebrations .

A date with Costa Rica now awaits the Dutch -- for Mexico , it 's home time once again .
