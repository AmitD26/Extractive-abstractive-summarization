-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What harm does it do ?

That 's the challenge the casino industry puts to its critics . A new report by the Institute for American Values presents the answer .

Modern casino gambling is computer gambling . The typical casino gambler sits at a computer screen , enters a credit card and enters a digital environment carefully constructed to keep them playing until all their available money has been extracted .

Small `` wins '' are administered at the most psychologically effective intervals , but the math is remorseless : the longer you play , the more you lose . The industry as a whole targets precisely those who can least afford to lose and earns most of its living from people for whom gambling has become an addiction . The IAV report cites a Canadian study that finds that the 75 % of casino customers who play only occasionally provide only 4 % of casino revenues . It 's the problem gambler who keeps the casino in business .

Slot machine payouts vary state by state . Some states set a required minimum : 83 % in Arkansas , for example . Others leave that decision up to the casino , as in Georgia and California . Some states require casinos to disclose their payouts . In others , that information is kept confidential . Based on what is published , however , it 's a fair generalization that a player can expect to lose 10 % to 15 % of his or her stake at every session . The cheaper the game , the lower the payout : slots that charge $ 5 per round pay better than slots that charge a penny .

When New Jersey allowed casinos into Atlantic City back in 1977 , casino advocates promised that gambling would revive the town 's fading economy . The casinos did create jobs as promised . But merchants who expected foot traffic to return to the city 's main street , Atlantic Avenue , were sorely disappointed . The money that comes to the casinos , stays in the casinos . Liquor stores and cash-for-gold outlets now line the city 's once-premier retail strip .

The impact of casinos on local property values is `` unambiguously '' negative , according to the National Association of Realtors . Casinos do not revive local economies . They act as parasites upon them . Communities located within 10 miles of a casino exhibit double the rate of problem gambling . Unsurprisingly , such communities also suffer higher rates of home foreclosure and other forms of economic distress and domestic violence .

How heavily does gambling weigh upon the poor , the elderly , the less educated , and the psychologically vulnerable ? It 's difficult to answer exactly , because U.S. governments have shirked the job of studying the effects of gambling . Most research on the public health effects of gambling in the United States is funded by the industry itself , with a careful eye to exonerating itself from blame . To obtain independent results , the Institute for American Values was obliged , ironically , to rely on studies funded by governments in Britain and Canada .

But here 's what we can conclude , in the words of the Institute :

'' -LSB- S -RSB- tate-sponsored casino gambling ... parallels the separate and unequal life patterns in education , marriage , work , and play that increasingly divide America into haves and have-nots . Those in the upper ranks of the income distribution rarely , if ever , make it a weekly habit to gamble at the local casino . Those in the lower ranks of the income distribution often do . Those in the upper ranks rarely , if ever , contribute a large share of their income to the state 's take of casino revenues . Those in the lower ranks do . ''
