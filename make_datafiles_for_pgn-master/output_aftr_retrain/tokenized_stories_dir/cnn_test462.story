He says his working hours are too long ; his salary too low and he has no personal life .

For the past three years , Zheng has been fixing photocopy machines at various factories in China 's manufacturing heartland .

His monthly salary of 3,500 to 4,500 yuan -LRB- $ 580 - $ 740 -RRB- -- depending on overtime -- is higher than the average wage , but only because his job requires more risks -- the ink has toxic fumes .

Yet , he worries about losing a job he loathes . In fact , he says he feels constantly anxious -- a state of mind made clear by a habit of cracking his knuckles and jiggling his leg as he talks .

`` Their mental health is far more worrying than we originally thought , '' he said .

Cheng and his colleagues interviewed 807 migrant workers in the Shenzhen area and had in-depth conversations with 60 of them .

Their research suggested that 58.5 % of those surveyed suffered from depression , 17 % from anxiety and 4.6 % had considered the idea of suicide .

His team found that the majority of those surveyed , half of whom were under 30 , bore a heavy financial and emotional burden as they left behind aging parents or young children .

They felt guilty for being unable to care for them and , at the same time , felt pressure to provide for their families .

Cheng said he first noticed this issue five years ago when he conducted research on the mental health of sex workers in the region , most of whom worked at factories before turning to prostitution .

Some 260 million Chinese farmers have left their villages and to work in cities , according to the China Labour Bulletin .

Despite their contribution to China 's economic miracle , the social status of these migrant workers remains low .

In China 's case , the hukou system -- or household registration system that divides the population into two distinct categories of the urban and the rural -- makes things harder for the migrants , who do n't enjoy the same access to healthcare and education as other city residents . They are often discriminated against in terms of salary and treatment .

Zheng 's parents left home with one goal in mind : making money in the city and then returning home .

` Toad who eats swan meat ? '

Zheng , however , aspires to become a true urbanite and wants to be an interior designer . He tries to study the subject on his own but struggles to find time to do so .

His parents -- who work in Shenzhen as a small time trader and a domestic helper - laugh at his efforts , calling him `` a toad who dreams of eating swan meat . ''

One day , he hopes to settle in Chengdu , the capital of his province where he spent two happy years studying at a technology college .

`` We just have to pay more attention to mental diseases as they can lead to suicide , '' said Cheng .

He recommends compulsory mental health testing in the workplace and a practice he calls `` positive psychological intervention '' -- setting up hotlines and counseling services and providing workers with more opportunities to socialize .

It is a big question when , if at all , professor Cheng 's ideas may be turned into reality . For young Zheng and millions like him , the struggle is likely to continue .
