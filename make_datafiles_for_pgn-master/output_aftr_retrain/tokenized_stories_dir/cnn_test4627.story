In an effort to expand that world , the creators of `` Defiance '' are banking on the combined power of an online third-person shooter video game and a weekly science fiction television series to keep fans hooked and actively involved in the franchise .

Trion Games and SyFy Network joined forces five years ago to create `` a truly unique entertainment experience , '' according to Nathan Richardsson , VP of development for Trion and executive producer of `` Defiance . ''

Creators say the geographic split of the story was necessary so each property could stand on its own . Mark Stern , president of original content at SyFy , said a gaming world where hundreds of players are completing missions would n't be a good environment for TV storytelling .

That 's not to say the show and the game are completely separate . Events that happen in the game will refer to , and possibly affect , things in the TV series and vice versa .

Rob Hill , senior producer at Trion , points out the two main characters from the show , Joshua Nolan and Irisa , actually appear in the game before they show up in the series and go on missions with the player .

The game , which is available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles as well as Windows-based computers , launched two weeks before the SyFy series premier to give fans of the `` Defiance '' universe a taste of what was to come in the show . However , you do n't have to watch the show to understand the game -- and vice versa .

Hill said the game and the show can stand alone , but the idea of expanding the world through different outlets at the same time was something they felt would enhance the viewer 's , or player 's , enjoyment of the franchise .

`` They 're -LRB- Trion -RRB- building this deep , rich world and we were trying to create interesting character drama , '' Stern said . `` That was a great benefit to us to have a company working 24 hours a day building out this detail , like a 300-page world Bible , that we could tap when it did become time for us to worry about -LRB- questions like -RRB- ` What color are the trees ? ' ` What do the buildings exactly look like ? ' ''

Hill agreed , saying Trion pushed SyFy to think about larger details earlier when the show producers wanted to work in character details .

`` There 's so much scrutiny because of what it is , '' he said . `` There 's also this real responsibility feel that , if this does n't work , you 've condemned the idea in general , which is not necessarily fair . ''

Are science fiction and gaming fans ready for this type of multilayered entertainment ? The crossover audience between those two genres seems to be a natural and large one .

'' -LRB- The SyFy show -RRB- is only on for an hour a week and 13 episodes a season , and then people have to wait for the next season , '' Hill points out . `` The fan base really gets into the universe behind these television shows and they do n't get to live in it outside of those 13 episodes . We give them the opportunity to come into the game and live in the universe 24/7 if they want to . ''

`` Defiance '' -LRB- the game -RRB- is available now for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Windows PC . It is an online game so it does require an Internet connection to play at all times . It is rated M for Mature due to blood , drug references , sexual themes , strong language , and violence . `` Defiance '' -LRB- the show -RRB- premiered April 15 on the SyFy channel and will run weekly until July 8 .
