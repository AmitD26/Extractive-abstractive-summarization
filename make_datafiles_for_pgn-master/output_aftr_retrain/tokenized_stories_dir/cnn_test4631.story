University of Iowa President Sally Mason talks to the Board of Regents .

-LRB- UWIRE -RRB- -- The state Board of Regents has reopened its investigation into the University of Iowa 's handling of an alleged rape by two of its football players .

Those letters -- which President Sally Mason received copies of -- were n't turned over to the regents during the initial investigation , which concluded in June . In that investigation , the regents concluded that university officials had handled the situation correctly .

Now that the regents are aware of the letters , however , they want to know more .

`` This is a serious breach of trust , '' Regent President David Miles said . `` It undermines the credibility of the university and this board . ''

School officials say they welcome the second investigation , insisting that the findings will be the same as the earlier probe . The new report will be presented at the next regents ' meeting , scheduled for September 18 .

On July 18 , one of the letters from the mother was released . In the four-page letter , which Miles described as heart-wrenching , the mother contended that the university had mishandled her daughter 's case .

The mother wrote that the woman was told a `` formal process '' would be `` long and arduous '' compared with the `` swift '' informal process led by the athletics department .

Satterfield and Everson were both charged with second-degree sexual abuse six months after the incident . Satterfield was also charged with third-degree sexual abuse .

The letter sent in May has not been released yet , University of Iowa Spokesman Steve Parrott said .

She declined to comment on whether safety policies were changed after the first letter in November .

Tom Evans , investigator and general counsel to the regents , attempted to contact the family after the case surfaced . The family declined to talk with him .

Barta , who attended the meeting , said he welcomed the second investigation , and he was confident that the regents would find that his staff had followed the correct steps .

`` Again , it has been very challenging to not be able to tell the full story , '' Barta said in a statement issued after the meeting . `` It has been especially trying the past few days as the integrity and character of Kirk Ferentz , President Mason , -LSB- and myself -RSB- has been publicly challenged .
