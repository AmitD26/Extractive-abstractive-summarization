A judge has concluded that Jahi , who suffered complications after tonsil surgery , is brain dead .

`` So right now , we 're asking Children 's Hospital to work with us to make that possible , '' he said , referring to Children 's Hospital & Research Center Oakland .

Jahi was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on December 12 , three days after tonsil surgery .

When routine surgeries go wrong

On Monday , a judge appointed Dr. Paul Fisher , chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Children 's Hospital , to evaluate Jahi as an independent expert . Fisher testified Tuesday that Jahi meets the criteria for brain death .

In response to the family 's statement , the hospital `` will allow a lawful transfer of Jahi 's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Children 's can legally do so , '' wrote hospital attorney Douglas C. Straus in a December 27 letter to Dolan .

`` Children 's is willing to cooperate in this regard even though Judge Grillo has confirmed that Jahi is deceased and that statutory patient transfer procedures do not apply here , '' Straus wrote .

The hospital asked the family 's attorney for the name of the facility that would accept Jahi , a transportation plan for her , and consent from the Alameda County coroner for the `` transfer since we are dealing with the body of a person who has been declared legally dead , '' Straus wrote .

In an earlier response to the family , Children 's Hospital Chief of Pediatrics David Durand noted that the judge did n't authorize a transfer to another facility .

`` Judge Grillo was very clear on Tuesday December 24 . He ruled Jahi McMath to be deceased and instructed the hospital to maintain the status quo . Judge Grillo did not authorize or order any surgical procedures or transfer to another facility .

`` Children 's Hospital Oakland does not believe that performing surgical procedures on the body of a deceased person is an appropriate medical practice . Children 's Hospital Oakland continues to extend its wishes for peace and closure to Jahi McMath 's family , '' he said .
