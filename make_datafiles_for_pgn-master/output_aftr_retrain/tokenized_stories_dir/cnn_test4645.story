Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Like other major financial centers such as London , Shanghai or New York , Hong Kong is home to legions of suited workers toiling long hours in vast , glass towers at breakneck speed .

`` The wellness of employees is the wellness of the company ; the very strength of a company is its employees , '' said Dario Calvaruso , a yoga instructor who set up Holistic Wellness -- a company that offers a series of in-office programs to reduce stress .

He 's on a mission to make yoga mats an essential fixture under every Hong Kong worker 's desk .

Within this territory 's constricted work spaces , practicing yoga requires relatively little room and minimal equipment -- a large ball and a mat are enough . As the instructor plays calm music , everyone stretches , breathes deeply and closes their eyes .

`` All the team is present at the lessons and it 's a great way to start our day , '' said Manuele Bosetti , general manager of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao .

`` We noticed that everyone at the office was more relaxed , and we managed to treat our business partners in a more kind way , '' Bosetti added .

Suited and ready

The sight of practitioners in their work clothes surrounded by computers and other electronics may seem incongruous with relaxation and meditation , but Calvaruso believes yoga performed in his studio is similar to that done in corporate environments -- although people in the workplace may face unique problems .

For example , students at a studio yoga class may practice over many years , while those in corporate settings may be unfamiliar with the discipline .

Desk ergonomics are another common focus for yoga classes in offices .

And the result ?

`` Employees perform better , produce more , and of course , the company has bigger profits , '' Calvaruso said .

This instructor 's uphill battle goes against Asia 's economic dynamism . An insatiable hunger for ever-larger returns and continuous growth is the new culture of this region , and it seems to have replaced much centuries-old wisdom that teaches spiritual development through balance , meditation and harmony with nature .
