-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's a reason why Malaysian officials are so confident it was Flight 370 that sent signals to a satellite many hours after the plane disappeared from radar March 8 . That 's because CNN has learned signals from commercial aircraft to Inmarsat satellites always include a code confirming the identity of the plane .

An Inmarsat official , while declining to discuss specifics of Flight 370 , tells CNN the satellite system is highly reliable , that each signal to an aircraft is met by a return signal and that those signals always contains a code verifying the identity of the aircraft .

It is `` virtually impossible '' to change an aircraft 's identifying code or to confuse one aircraft with another , the Inmarsat official said .

That could explain why Malaysian authorities now say they have a `` high degree of confidence '' that Flight 370 continued flying well after it disappeared from civilian radar screens .

Map it : What happened to Flight 370 ?

Malaysian officials , citing `` satellite information '' but giving scant details , this weekend refocused the search for the missing Boeing 777 , moving attention to massive arcs on both sides of the equator .

Malaysian authorities believe someone disabled several communications systems , perhaps to conceal the plane 's location . One of those systems was a digital data system known as ACARS , which uses the satellite to relay messages to the ground .

Inmarsat technicians continue to help , the company said .

`` Our experts have been pulled into the investigation . We 've had people in Kuala Lumpur , '' said Inmarsat subject expert David Coiley . `` We are putting everything into this to assist the investigation as best we can , because it seems there 's no other data set . ''

How Inmarsat works

Inmarsat , which is prohibited from discussing details of the Malaysia Flight 370 investigation , was able to provide CNN with a detailed explanation about how its system works .

The London-based satellite communications company owns and operates 10 satellites , all in geostationary orbit some 22,200 miles above the equator .

At its most fundamental , the satellite is a simple relay , transferring signals from ground stations to the aircraft , and back again , not unlike a cell phone tower , Coiley said .

` Handshakes ' help determine location

The purpose of the hourly `` handshakes '' is to allow the satellite to know the approximate location of the aircraft so that it can efficiently relay any messages . For this , the satellite needs to know the angle of the aircraft from the satellite .

An aircraft directly under the satellite would be at a 90 degree angle to the satellite ; an aircraft at the poles would be at 0 degrees .

`` We have never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information , '' the official said .

A plane 's return signal is an acknowledgment that , `` Yes , I 'm still here , '' Coiley said .

In the case of Flight 370 , the `` last successful handshake occurred somewhere along that circle , '' the U.S. official said .
