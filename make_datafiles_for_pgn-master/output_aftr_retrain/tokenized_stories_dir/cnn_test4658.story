It claimed that all of our so-called atrocities have shamed the memory of our founding fathers and , as a result , we should cancel our parades , put away our fireworks and all sit quietly while we atone for our sins .

I guess that was one way to go .

Another way to go would be to fire up the grills , bring the kids to the beach , and gather the family on a blanket to watch as your tax dollars ignite into colorful bursts .

I 'm guessing that most of us chose the second option .

But just because I had fun with friends and family does n't mean that I believe America is perfect . It just means that , for one day , I chose to celebrate the fact that America is still closer to perfect than any other country in the history of the world .

For 364 days a year we talk about high gas prices , crooked politicians , and how much people from one political party allegedly hate everyone from the other . But for 24 hours we get to put it all aside and marvel at how a few brave men risked their lives to stand up for what they believed in . Of course , I would prefer we celebrate that every day , but for now , or at least until that Inquirer columnist gets elected president and bans it , I 'll take the one .

As someone who works in the media in New York City , I 'll admit that I am part of the chorus of people who talk about our problems . But there 's nothing wrong with that , so long as you also occasionally take the time to talk about the other side . And that 's what I want to do now by asking the question that never seems to be of interest to the mainstream media : What 's right with America ?

What 's right with America ? How about the way we educate our children . Sure , I complain a lot about left-wing professors and how some wealthy private universities hoard their billions while charging obscene amounts for tuition , but the truth is that our universities are always ranked among the best in the world .

What 's right with America ? How about the way we treat the less fortunate ? With no help from our government , Americans gave a record $ 306 billion to charities last year alone . We give twice as much as the next closest country and , relative to the size of our economies , we give 1,000 percent more than the French .

What 's right with America ? How about our supposedly third-world health care system ? We spend more on health care per person than Switzerland , Germany , Canada , or any other country you can think of . Do we still have problems ? Absolutely , but do n't fall for `` the grass is greener '' crowd ; every country has health care problems .

What 's right with America ? We love our country . World Values Survey found that 77 percent of Americans are very proud of their nationality . That puts us in a first place tie with the Irish . Australia was next and no one else was really even close .

I could go on and on , but my point is that we do n't need the so often wished for `` change '' in this country , we just need perspective .

While most of us inherently know that we 've won the lottery by living here , we do n't often think about the reasons why .
