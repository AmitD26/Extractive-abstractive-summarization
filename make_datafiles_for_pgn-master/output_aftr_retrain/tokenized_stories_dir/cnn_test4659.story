-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Neighbors said the house on Vermont Street in Brooklyn 's East New York neighborhood had been vacant for years . Three years ago the now-defunct predatory lending bank Countrywide refused to renegotiate the ballooning interest rate on a mortgage filled with hidden clauses and traps . Instead , Countrywide sold the mortgage to Bank of America , which , in turn , initiated foreclosure proceedings . In the East New York neighborhood , one of the poorest parts of the United States , more than 16 per 1,000 homes are in foreclosure , the highest rate in New York City and one of the highest nationwide .

Meanwhile , Tasha Glasgow has spent much of the last decade without a home , in and out of New York City 's shelter system . Glasgow has an 8-year-old daughter with severe autism and a 5-year-old son . Struggling to find work while struggling to care for her kids , Glasgow thought her luck might change earlier this year when she received a voucher from the New York City government that would allow her to move out of the shelter system . But then , she says , that vital helping hand was abruptly pulled away , the voucher cut by Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's recent austerity measures .

It only makes sense . Pulling the strings of Washington and using our tax dollars , big banks orchestrated a massive bailout for themselves but continue to offer no relief to homeowners suffering under the bad loans they made and the bad economy they created .

You can say that 's just how banks work , like it or not . But that 's the same excuse for why corrupt lenders like Countrywide initiated loans with terms so bad that its managers found themselves under criminal investigation . It 's the same excuse for the banks causing the housing crisis and crashing our economy by making bad bets on subprime loans , and then begging the government to cover their losses .

This is not capitalism . This is an anti-free market manipulation of our economy to benefit the 1 % while hurting the rest of us . The United States economy , as Wall Street has rigged it , violates the principle of capitalism proffered by Adam Smith and the ideal of equal opportunity enshrined by our founders . To `` rescue '' our economy , we let big banks write down their bad debt . So , to rescue homeowners , banks must write down underwater mortgages , helping homeowners adjust the principle of their loans to reasonable , pre-bubble levels , keep families in their homes and stabilize the housing market .

Millions of Americans have lost their homes . In 2010 alone , banks filed a record 3.8 million foreclosures . Totals for 2011 are expected to be even higher . Many people are living on the couches of relatives or spending their savings on low-end motel rooms or are homeless . A 2010 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 26 cities found the rate of homelessness had jumped a startling 9 % .

But the Occupy movement is bringing some hope and opportunity back to our nation , restoring the idea that our economy and our political system can and must work for the 99 % . Granted , helping homeowners stop eviction orders and helping homeless families occupy empty , bank-owned homes is a short-term strategy , but one that will hopefully draw public attention to the injustice of millions of foreclosed homes and millions of homeless families , an injustice that banks could easily have addressed if they cared about our nation and our economy a fraction as much as they care about their bottom lines .
