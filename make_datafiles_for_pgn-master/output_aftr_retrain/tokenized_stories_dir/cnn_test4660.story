The club ended last season empty handed under Gerado Martino . The club 's president Sandro Rosell had to resign over alleged irregularities surrounding the Neymar transfer . And star striker Lionel Messi has been embroiled in allegations of tax avoidance .

Black cat = bad luck ?

But , more importantly , a black cat somehow found itself in the stadium a minute after kick off and delayed the match . It evaded several tackles before nonchalantly walking off the pitch on its own terms . A steward managed to grab the cat as it attempted to enter the stands and received several scratches for his troubles .

Messi , perhaps taking a leaf out of the feline invader 's playbook , evaded several challenges of his own to fire Barcelona ahead before half time .

But you would n't have known that it was Barcelona down to ten men given their second half performance . They enjoyed 79 per cent of possession as Messi added a second . There was also a goal for 18 year old La Masia graduate Munir .

The whereabouts of the black cat is currently unknown .

The underdog 's underdog

Meanwhile arguably one of the biggest underdogs in the history of top level Spanish football started life in La Liga with a shock victory .

Idiosyncratic

A 1999 decree requires every team to have a capital equal to 25 per cent of the average expenses of all sides in the second division , excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest .

But a social media campaign allowed the club to raise the necessary cash to compete , a campaign that Basque rivals Real Sociedad probably wish had failed .
