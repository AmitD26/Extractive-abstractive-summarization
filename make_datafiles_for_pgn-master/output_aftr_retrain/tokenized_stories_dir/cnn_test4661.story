Hours whittled away in generic fast food outlets or tacky themed bars , which in many cases represent the extent of terminal building entertainment , ensure onward journeys ca n't come quickly enough .

For those passing through Changi Airport in Singapore , however , a brief window between connecting flights is a great opportunity to explore one of Asia 's most happening destinations .

The city-state 's condensed landscape -- the entire country is squeezed into a land area smaller than most big cities -- means visitors can quickly tour some of Singapore 's most famous attractions and be back at the airport in a matter of hours .

Changi itself offers free city tours to passengers with a stopover of five hours or more but visitors can also leave the airport to traverse the city on their own accord .

With the help of Shawn Low , travel editor of Lonely Planet 's Asia Pacific edition , we highlight some of the must-see Singaporean sights for those with a few spare hours between flights , whatever the time of the day .

Early morning

A stroll in Singapore 's lush Botanic Gardens at sunrise provides a great opportunity to catch the normally bustling metropolis in one of its more tranquil moments , says Low .

Dense green foliage is complemented by a selection of finely manicured greens and picturesque lakes , a genuine oasis amidst the concrete jungle of high rises and skyscrapers .

All those splashing out while in the city should be mindful not to forget they are eligible for a Goods and Services Tax refund -LRB- worth 7 % of their total purchase value -RRB- when they pass through customs at the airport , he adds .

Indoor activities at this time of day can therefore offer a more comfortable pursuit for those dashing around on a tight time scale , says Low .

Spectacular sunset

A good way to get a sense of Singapore 's vibrant skyline is to find a perch on one of the city 's many rooftop bars come sundown , says Low .

Restaurants such as the Sin Huat Eating House offer local specialties such as crab bee hoon -LRB- mud crab cooked with rice noodles -RRB- while cramped food stalls and bustling coffee houses crackle with the chatter of locals late into the night .

Like all major modern cities , Singapore offers just as much to see and do come night time as it does during the daylight hours .

Low highlights the Night Safari at Singapore 's world renowned zoo as a particularly fun attraction for families and wildlife lovers alike .

Visitors can get up close and personal with a variety of nocturnal animals -- Singapore zoo is famed for its policy of keeping animals in open enclosures rather than in cages -- before hopping in a taxi back to the airport .

Low also singles out Little India , home to Singapore 's vibrant ex-pat Indian community and a remnant of the city 's previous incarnation as a British colonial trading port , as a particularly authentic night time activity .

'' -LRB- Little India -RRB- is as close as you 'll get to the Singapore of the old days , '' says Low . He says Friday nights and weekends , when the streets throng with market stalls and `` the redolent scent of spices and colorful flowers '' are the best time to visit .
