Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bill Clinton has never had a problem getting into the muck of politics .

Since leaving the White House in 2001 and stepping into the role of the Democrats ' elder statesman , the former President has continually shown why he rose from humble roots in rural Arkansas to president of the United States in the first place : his political chops and willingness to use them .

`` I 've got to give him credit , '' Clinton said of Rove on Wednesday at an event in Washington . `` That embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds . First they said she faked her concussion . And now they say she 's auditioning for a part on ` The Walking Dead . ' ''

Fear factor : Rove comments show GOP 's concerns about Clinton

`` So stupid as to be a low hanging curve ball , '' the adviser told CNN 's Jake Tapper .

The role is a familiar one for Bill Clinton .

Since his wife agreed to become America 's top diplomat in early 2009 and now that she is weighing a run at the presidency , Bill Clinton has rarely shied away from getting into the political fray .

Bill Clinton 's role is put into full perspective in `` HRC : State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton , '' a book by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes that details Hillary Clinton 's time at the State Department .

When Altmire decided not to endorse anyone , the congressman was blacklisted and earned Bill Clinton 's ire .

`` The bill for Altmire 's neutrality would come due nearly four years later , to the day , in the 2012 Pennsylvania Democratic primary , '' write Parnes and Allen , when the former President choose to endorse Mark Critz over Altmire .

When Critz went on to win the primary , his victory was largely attributed to two things : His strong labor support and the endorsement he picked up from Bill Clinton .

On Wednesday , for example , the former President endorsed Maryland gubernatorial hopeful Anthony Brown over his top challenger , Maryland Attorney General Douglas Gansler .

Bill Clinton touted Brown 's record and notes that he felt `` enormous affection '' for him .

Not surprisingly , Brown was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton 's failed 2008 bid and traveled to a number of states on the campaign 's behalf . Gansler , on the other hand , was a proud supporter of Barack Obama and co-chaired his 2008 primary campaign in Maryland .

Bill Clinton 's support was so potent that when the Brown campaign announced it in April , Gansler felt it necessary to issue a statement that spelled out his `` respect '' for the former President and his strong support for Hillary Clinton , `` should she choose to run '' in 2016 .

Whether Hillary Clinton will run is not the only question facing the Clintons right now , though . In order for her to be successful , a number of Democratic strategists have said , Bill Clinton 's role will also have to be defined .

In 2008 , Clinton was a staple of the campaign trail and while he was a prolific fundraiser and campaigner , he also had a few notable blowups as things went sour .

`` Hillary Clinton can not hide behind her husband on this . It was an interesting decision , if it was one , to have him come out and say anything , '' said Cheri Jacobus , a Republican strategist , about Bill Clinton 's response to Rove . `` I think they need to really pull Bill Clinton back . He is not as good at this now as he used to be . ''

Democrats scoff at that assertion and point out that other than Hillary Clinton herself , the former chief executive is probably the one closest to her thinking on political issues and whether or not she will run .
