London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Using your fingerprint to identify yourself seems beguilingly simple : it belongs only to you , and you are n't going to lose it . Apple 's use of fingerprint technology -- although not the first in the industry -- seems very in tune with its ethos of making devices easy to use .

However , how safe fingerprint technologies really are does depend on how they are implemented . You might ask , is my fingerprint stored , who else can access it ? Can the government demand that Apple hand my fingerprints to them , or use Apple to identify criminals from their database ?

Apple have stated on record that they do not store fingerprints , and nor does the device . Instead , the iPhone stores the result of a check -- a `` hash , '' which may be unique , but ca n't reveal your fingerprint .

Apple 's fingerprint system does create a risk of `` normalizing '' biometrics . Because of the iPhone 's widespread use , people may increasingly expect to use similar `` easy '' and `` safe '' biometric systems , without considering that they create highly personal identification , with risks of being tracked and surveilled , and yet do not necessarily deliver the security that they imply . Other low level fingerprint ID systems suffer the same problems , yet are being employed in schools , even to replace library cards .

Apple 's fingerprint system may encounter a simple problem , in that the key to unlocking your phone -- your fingerprint -- could well be liberally scattered across the phone you are trying to protect . While the phone may also look for body heat , or skin irregularities , there is at least a distinct path which could be used to try to break into a phone . We 'll have to see if anyone can use it successfully .

Some of these risks are manageable , through transparency and audit . The wider social risks are far harder to manage ; arguably they are n't Apple 's problem . Perhaps society needs to start having a much more intense debate about security and privacy , starting off with asking : whose security are we worrying about : my own , or the state 's ? How do I know what risks I am taking , and why should I trust any of the claims that are made ?
