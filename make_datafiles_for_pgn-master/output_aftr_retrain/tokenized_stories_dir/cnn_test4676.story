-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The best leaders make us feel unsure of ourselves .

This may sound counterintuitive . Are n't leaders are supposed to build confidence ? At times , encouraging people is effective .

People need you to help them think through difficult issues even though they do n't feel comfortable in the process .

It is very difficult for any of us to question our beliefs and behaviors .

The best way to help people see outside the box to objectively consider their circumstances is to listen to how they describe their situation , reflect on what they are saying , and then ask questions that cause them to review their thoughts and behavior .

If your words break through their protective barriers , the moment will feel awkward . They might feel a pinch of anger , embarrassment , or sadness when their blind spot is revealed . Then they grow .

The point is to help the person to think , not to change him or her . This coaching approach creates a two-sided conversation where the recipient feels respected . The steps include :

D : Determine what the person wants as a desired outcome of the conversation . Help the person to define what they want , not what you want for them .

Do they want to be seen by others as a leader ? Do they want more respect from their peers ? Do they want to feel less stressed ? Determine what is in the conversation for them so you can then move toward achieving this outcome .

When you listen and clarify what you hear , people feel heard and understood . Then you can help them sort out truth from speculation , instantly giving them a view of what else might be true .

E : Explore possible sources of blind spots and resistance . Ask about the desires , disappointments , and fears you sense they are feeling .

A : Acknowledge the emerging awareness .

When reflecting , exploring , and acknowledging , quiet your judgmental brain and refrain from jumping in and giving the person advice . The Discomfort Zone is full of tips and examples on how to use the process in your conversations . The best advice : They want you to be present more than they need you to be perfect !
