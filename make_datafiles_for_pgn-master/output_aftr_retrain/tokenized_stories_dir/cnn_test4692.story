Sitting behind the RT anchor desk on Wednesday , Washington-based Liz Wahl told the audience she `` could not be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of -LRB- President Vladimir -RRB- Putin , '' adding `` I 'm proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth , and that is why after this newscast I am resigning . ''

RT called Wahl 's action a `` self-promotional stunt '' and , commenting on Martin 's move , said RT staff members are free to express their views .

The public criticism of Putin 's actions on Ukraine is an embarrassment for RT , but Simonyan is rallying her journalists for a war , which , she believes , is directed by the American government with its foot soldiers being the American media .

`` The storm of articles posted about RT over the last couple of days -- literally tons of printed copy -- looks as if it were written to dictation , '' she wrote . `` Hardly any respectable media outlet refrained from lambasting and lynching RT journalists in articles or reports . ''

Simonyan works for RT , she said , because , `` It 's my country . There is no other choice for me . ''

The network soon lost its Russian image , re-branding itself as `` RT , '' its English-language broadcasts featuring young Americans , and concentrating largely on American news .

A senior staff member at RT insists the staff decides RT 's editorial policy , not the Russian government , and compares RT with the BBC , France 24 , Deutsche Welle , and other state-funded news outlets .

Dmitri Trenin , an expert from the Carnegie Moscow Center who served in the Soviet and Russian military for more than 20 years , says RT 's approach differs significantly from news broadcasting in the Soviet Union . `` The Soviet system of propaganda talked about Russia . They had Russian announcers , by and large , and they tried to project Soviet ideas , Soviet ideology , Soviet experience . ''

`` This time there 's nothing to project , they do n't care about it . What they do care about is introducing themselves in the Western media world and challenging the established truths and half-truths of the Western media , of the Western World . It 's not about Russia . ''

Meanwhile , in an ironic bit of timing , the `` Russia Today '' name is back again . In a bombshell announcement in late December , President Putin issued a decree creating an international broadcasting entity to carry Russia 's views to the world , to be called `` Russia Today . ''

He also liquidated two Soviet-era media outlets , RIA Novosti news agency and Russia Today international radio . Details of the new agency 's structure and mission are expected any day .

For the past 20 years , since the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia has been struggling to project its ideas to the world . The Sochi Olympics and its opening ceremony were a major step in Putin 's revamping of Russia 's image .

Now , with the new `` Russia Today , '' he will have both the message -- and the medium -- to present it . His actions in Ukraine , however , are likely , at a minimum , to overshadow the birth of that new agency and , more likely , tarnish it .
