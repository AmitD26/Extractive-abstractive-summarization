Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema , who both played for France at the Euro 2012 finals in June , were first questioned two years ago about their alleged involvement in a prostitution ring .

`` Some of the defendants will be prosecuted for ` aggravated pimping , ' although I can not disclose which ones at this time , '' the investigating magistrate Andre Dando told CNN on Tuesday .

`` The trial is months away and will be well into 2013 , I expect . ''

Ribery plays for German club Bayern Munich , while Benzema is at Real Madrid .

An official from Madrid , which won the Spanish league title last season , said the club could not comment as it had no information about Dando 's statement .

The case emerged in 2010 , before the France team went to the FIFA World Cup tournament , after police raided a nightclub near the Champs Elysees in central Paris and detained 18 girls on suspicion of prostitution .

She said she had n't told them she was younger than 18 at the time , although she was 16 .

`` There is no evidence that he was ever aware of her age , '' Bottai said . `` She told him she was 20 years old . ''

Dehar has since become a fashion designer , and launched her own collection this year .
