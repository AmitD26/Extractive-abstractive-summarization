Some observations on Ferguson :

The Ferguson Police Department has fallen far short of expectations . While we still do n't know -- and likely wo n't for a while -- what exactly happened and why the officer fired those fatal shots , the way the Ferguson police department reacted was poor and made matters worse , not better . A sensitive response -- informed by an awareness that this shooting would lead to a powerful , communitywide reactionâ € '' would have acknowledged the trauma inflicted on the entire black community .

Critics rip police tactics , use of military equipment

The name of the officer who shot Michael was finally released Friday . He is Officer Darren Wilson , a six-year veteran of the department . It was time to do this . At least now that point of frustration has ended . But the decision also to release the videotape of the previous robbery event in which Michael Brown was suspected was a further insult to the sensitivities that exist in this now cultural event . If it had to be done , it should have been well separated .

The police chief 's decision to come out with a statement early in the investigation defending his officer was a poor decision , as it polarized an already tense environment and was insensitive to Ferguson 's African-American community .

I do not have a concern with an appropriate police presence , and I believe police should act to stop destruction of property or the use of the protest for personal gain or profit , such as looting stores . That said , nothing justifies use of an aggressive police presence without proper cause . There was no basis for a military-style response , even though the law enforcement could justify it by looking at their textbooks . This did not warrant a textbook response . This warranted -- demanded -- a response that carried the respect appropriate in such difficult times . We also now know that a lesser response , as has happened since estate police took over , worked to lessen tensions .

At the very least , I sincerely hope that the police agencies involved maintained their own video log of events witnessed and reacted to by law enforcement . If those actions were necessary in response to threats or inappropriate actions from protesters , I would give the department deference . But they are going to have to justify tear gas and rubber bullets , and that will be tough to do in a situation as socially charged as this one .

There will be and should be , a review of police activities in response to the shooting ; not to place blame , but as a learning tool . We were dangerously close to a meltdown in Ferguson . We now look back at how Seminole County , Florida , handled the Zimmerman matter and must acknowledge they did a better job than Ferguson .

The protesters , setting aside for a moment the looters and hooligans , have acted in a very appropriate and responsible way . Our country was built upon the concept of seeking appropriate redress of actions by our government . It is not only allowed and appropriate , but it is ingrained in our national fabric and the nation would be weaker without it .

The people who take advantage of a situation that allows them to loot and steal -- which they continued doing early Saturday -- should face significant consequences . Not only have they committed individual crimes by their actions , but they have desecrated the very purpose of the respectful protesters and in doing so damaged the national perspective of the protest itself . Their actions distract attention from the important , underlying reasons for the protest and threaten to turn the process into a dangerous , counterproductive battle between themselves and the police presence .

The response Friday night and early Saturday by law enforcement was restrained ; they deserve credit . Even more so , the protesters who tried to block the looters stand as testament to the true purpose of their involvement : peaceful pleas for change .

President Barack Obama should have a voice in the public reaction to this event , but he needs to be circumspect in his presentation . I have , in the past , expressed my chagrin that Obama injected himself into the Zimmerman matter -- not because he involved himself with a national tragedy , but because he took a side in a pending case where he should be very reluctant to do so . I appreciate his more inclusive and tempered response to this troubling shooting .

Traditional media have handled this case well . Across the board , media outlets have presented a number of well-balanced reviews of the relevant issues . The traditional media learned a good deal from the Zimmerman case : Reporting on the Michael Brown shooting has been much better founded in both the rules of evidence , the rules of the court and the statutes that deal with such issues as self-defense , `` imminent fear of great bodily injury , '' and police procedures . The media have learned to understand the subject and the applicable statutes before commenting on the case .

Full coverage on Ferguson shooting and protests

There has also been a greater level of fairness in reporting , and also a necessary acknowledgment that precious few facts are available yet . The media have asked the right questions , but have hesitated to fuel speculation . And that is the essence of responsible reporting .
