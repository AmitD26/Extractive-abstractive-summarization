-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Events are unfolding at a rapid pace in Ferguson , Missouri . The city has been in turmoil since August 9 , when a white city police officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager , Michael Brown , in the middle of a street . Protesters and law enforcement officers have clashed in the streets .

Once again , peaceful protests gave way to angry confrontations with police late Monday night into early Tuesday . After a handful of protesters threw rocks , bottles and Molotov cocktails , security forces responded with tear gas and stun grenades . Most of the demonstrators , however , tried to keep the peace .

St. Louis County jail officials said at least 77 people were arrested , the vast majority of them on refusal to disperse charges . Some of them came from as far away as New York and California . Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson , who is in charge of security in Ferguson , told CNN there were 50 to 60 arrests .

Michael Brown 's family :

The late teenager 's mother , Lesley McSpadden , told NBC 's `` Today '' show that the only way to end the unrest is `` justice '' -- which her family and their supporters have repeatedly tied to the arrest of the police officer who killed Brown .

`` Justice will bring peace , I believe , '' McSpadden said .

The family 's attorney , Benjamin Crump , also announced that Brown 's funeral will be held Monday .

Criminal proceedings :

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will visit Ferguson on Wednesday , in part to check on the investigation being handled by the Justice Department 's civil rights division and the local U.S. Attorney 's Office .

Some residents and community leaders claim McCulloch has deep ties to the police and has favored law enforcement in criminal cases .

School closures :

The situation remains so unstable that the Ferguson-Florissant School District said it is canceling classes for the rest of the week . Two nearby districts -- Jennings and Riverview Gardens -- opted to remain closed again Tuesday as well , according to CNN affiliate KMOV .

St. Louis County police are looking into Brown 's shooting . President Obama has the Justice Department , including the FBI , looking into the case as well .

Darren Wilson , 28 , who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record , is on paid administrative leave . If he returns to duty , he would have to undergo two psychological evaluations , authorities said . He was briefly taken to the hospital after the confrontation with Brown for treatment of an injury that left his face swollen , according to the Ferguson police chief .

Wilson has garnered more and more public support in recent days . That includes a rally held for him in St. Louis and a fundraising effort that had raised more than $ 36,000 from nearly 1,000 people as of Tuesday .

Michael Brown 's family :

They 've hired lawyers and expressed outrage at how the police have handled things , including Friday 's simultaneous release of the officer 's name and surveillance video from the day of the shooting that showed a man identified in police documents as Brown roughing up a convenience store clerk while purportedly stealing cigars . The family and critics of the department have accused police of trying to damage Brown 's character .
