Randy Fay , a helicopter rescue team coordinator for Snohomish County , on Wednesday recalled spotting the boy `` out in the middle of nowhere '' not long after his crew first flew over the scene Saturday .

`` We have no clue how he ended up there by himself , '' Fay said . '' -LRB- There were -RRB- no homes , no nothing . ''

Jacob 's dramatic rescue was recorded by a camera on the Snohomish rescue team 's helicopter . It was an uneasy save . The helicopter could n't set down on the uneven , sticky soil so it hovered a few feet above the ground . The rotors sucked up debris , chopping up insulation and spitting it all over the scene .

Two men who lived nearby saw the child ; one managed to get to him , but no one could get any traction in what Fay described as `` a mushy slurry -LRB- that -RRB- once you got into it , there was no way to push yourself up . ''

By the time rescuers got to the boy , his pants had fallen to around his ankles . They came off entirely `` when we pulled him out of the mud , '' Fay remembered .

And he was calm as he was passed up into the arms of crew chief Beau Beckner .

`` That little guy was very brave , '' Beckner wrote on the rescue team 's Facebook page .

Jacob 's mother , Jonielle Spillers , is safe . She was at work during Saturday 's mudslide , which killed at least 16 people and destroyed much of two towns north of Seattle . Another eight bodies have been found but not recovered , officials said . As of Wednesday , a county official said that 90 people were officially missing or unaccounted for .
