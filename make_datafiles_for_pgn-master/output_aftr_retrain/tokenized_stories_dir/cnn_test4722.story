They are about to change something basic about American life : the sight of the mail carrier strolling up to the front door to drop off that day 's letters , magazines , bills and advertising fliers .

Instead , cluster boxes -- groupings of mailboxes at a centralized point in the community -- will be constructed . Homeowners will be expected to leave their houses and go to the nearest cluster box to pick up their daily mail .

It 's hard to counter the argument that if something drastic is n't done , the Postal Service simply wo n't be able to operate much longer . With Americans relying more and more on e-mail and text messages , and with bills being routinely paid online , the Postal Service is n't bringing in enough revenue to justify the enormous costs of universal mail delivery .

Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has been pushing for the elimination of Saturday mail delivery , but congressional resistance made him put the plan on hold . Even though Donahoe says that Saturday delivery is no longer fiscally feasible , members of Congress are reluctant to anger their constituents -- both individuals and businesses -- by letting the plan go through .

If the cluster boxes begin proliferating , though , and people are told that the mail carrier wo n't be appearing at their doors , you can expect widespread unhappiness and high-decibel frustration .

It 's hardly wild speculation to predict that people will not relish having to go out into the weather every time they want to retrieve their mail . Some wo n't trust the security of the group mailboxes , no matter how many assurances they receive . They 'll be especially vexed on rainy or snowy days when they make the trip to the cluster boxes , only to find that the carrier has n't arrived yet . For those accustomed to door-to-door mail service , the act of picking up and sorting through the mail in front of other people may feel less private .

Opinion : No more Saturday visits from Bob

Yet the really noteworthy thing is not what may be ending -- the noteworthy thing is what we have taken on faith for so long . If someone in government , today , were proposing to start the Postal Service from scratch , offering the amenities Americans are accustomed to , he 'd be laughed out of the room .

`` How would the homeowners and business owners summon these couriers ? ''

`` They would n't have to summon them -- the postal workers would be required to just automatically show up . ''

`` Every day but Sunday . ''

`` Forty-six cents . ''

`` But how can you possibly do such a thing so cheaply ? ''

`` Some people will complain that it 's too expensive . ''

`` Forty-six cents . ''

`` It would cost the same , no matter how great the distance . ''

`` That makes no sense at all . What about the cost of fuel ? How can you charge the same amount for a letter to go five miles as you charge for it to go 3,000 miles ? ''

`` Because that 's what people will insist on . ''

It does sound impossible , does n't it ? It sounds like a plan so farfetched that it would never get off the ground .

Yet it has been an unquestioned part of the way we 've always lived .

We no longer live that way . We expect our information to reach us instantly , on screens and phones and tablets , wherever we may be .

But we expect to receive our mail the old way , too .

See you at the cluster box .
