-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When this season 's World Cup alpine ski champions stepped up to the podium to receive their prizes , they were following in some famous footsteps .

The Dalai Lama , designer Karl Lagerfeld , Oprah Winfrey and boxing star Wladimir Klitschko have all been there .

Recipients in 2014 have included alpine skiers Anna Fenninger and Marcel Hirscher , who posed for the cameras with the freshest batch after picking up the overall titles for the ladies ' and men 's events respectively this month .

Yet behind these triumphant images of sporting glory lies a tale of intricate craftsmanship that is as painstaking in its quest for perfection as the preparations of any winter athlete .

A glass apart

It first manufactured the crystal sphere trophies in 1987 , with the first FIS globe handed over in 1989 . The process has since become part of winter sports tradition .

Where football has its 18 carat gold World Cup trophy and ice hockey the silver and nickel Stanley Cup , winter sports have the crystal globe .

`` Every season we have 33 of the small cups -LRB- for the winners of individual events -RRB- , 17 of the big cups -LRB- for the overall winners -RRB- , 17 for the nations cups and 177 medals of glass , '' JOSKA 's operations manager Alouis Adam told CNN 's Alpine Edge series .

`` I think of the last 25 years we have made over 2,000 different small and big cups . ''

Each is primarily forged using a 1,200-degree Celsius mass of molten glass which is then painstakingly shaped by JOSKA 's glassblowers .

These skilled technicians inflate the hot glass to the required shape via a blowpipe , sweating profusely as they go . After a 24-hour cooling off period , the trophy is brought to a glasscutter who uses diamond disks to carve an intricate snow crystal design into the trophies .

The FIS logos , the relevant discipline and sponsor names are then engraved into the glass .

Once finished , the selected globes are packed up into specially designed shipping cases and transported from JOSKA headquarters to the relevant World Cup venue .

An emotional send-off

He attended this month 's World Cup finals and was as effusive as ever on witnessing the world 's best skiers , snowboarders and cross-country athletes ' joy at receiving the fruits of his company 's labors .

`` That 's a beautiful feeling . I -LRB- have -RRB- watched all the World Cup finals the last 25 years and we are very proud when the winners have our product , '' he said .

But while fond of these items , Adam believes there is something unique about the World Cup globes .

Those winter sportsmen and women fortunate enough to have their hands on the prized crystal will be sure to agree .
