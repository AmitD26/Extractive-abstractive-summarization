Well , guess who 's got a problem -- seven years later .

Rowling now says she should have paired Hermoine Granger with Harry Potter , instead of his bud Ron Weasley .

Ron and Hermione would have needed relationship counseling . What the what ??!!

The Wonderland issue does n't come out until Thursday . But Britain 's Sunday Times published excerpts of the interview in a front-page story , `` JK admits Hermione should have wed Harry . ''

`` I know , I 'm sorry , '' she adds . `` I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans , but if I 'm absolutely honest , distance has given me perspective on that . It was a choice I made for very personal reasons , not for reasons of credibility . Am I breaking people 's hearts by saying this ? I hope not . ''

And what did the fictional Mrs. Weasley have to say about all this ? She agrees !

`` WHAT ??? I am heartbroken ! , '' commented someone named `` ana . '' `` Ron and Hermione 's relationship is wonderful because it is FAR from perfect at the beginning of the series and slowly -LRB- and ingeniously -RRB- develops into my favorite couple in the whole series ! I could go on for days about why I love them . ''

But the we-told-you-so side also came out in force .

Hermione meets Ron in the first book of the series , `` Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , '' when he and Harry save her from a mountain troll .

Not quite . Not even before Rowling delivered this latest bombshell .

Two years ago , she said she once considered offing Ron altogether .

`` In my absolute heart of hearts of hearts -- although I did seriously consider killing ... Ron . ''
