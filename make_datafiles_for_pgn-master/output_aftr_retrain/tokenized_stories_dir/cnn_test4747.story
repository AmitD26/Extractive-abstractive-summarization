There were no signs of resistance from protesters , some of whom helped bailiffs , police and CITIC representatives move the metal barricades away from the area covered by the court injunction .

Earlier , others packed up their tents to pre-empt the bailiffs .

Earlier attempts by riot police to clear the demonstrators have not been successful , and negotiations between student leaders and government representatives did n't yield any progress .

In their early days , the protests brought tens of thousands of people onto the city 's streets to call for full universal suffrage after Beijing said candidates for election in 2017 would have to be screened by a committee .

However , their numbers have since dwindled and polls show that public support for the protesters is dropping .

The city 's government said on Monday that police `` would arrest anyone obstructing the bailiffs . ''
