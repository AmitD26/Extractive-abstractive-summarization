The two assailants , cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber , were shot dead by the Israeli security forces . The incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer , left the city of Jerusalem more divided than for a long time .

To make things worse , it emerged in recent days that Israel has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists ' families , even if they were killed during the attack .

The Israeli security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would-be assailants . Regardless of the fate they face , their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless .

Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army . A report produced , following an investigation by the Israeli security establishment , found this action counter-productive .

According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem , in the height of the Second Intifada , between 2001-2005 , 664 Palestinian homes were demolished in the occupied Palestinian territories as an apparent deterrence .

Arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy , but are also illegal and immoral . This is a clear violation of international law , more specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention , clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory .

Any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and could potentially lead to a war crime charge . And there is also , of course , a moral aspect . As deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals , their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides .

The decision by the Israelis to resume Palestinian house demolition following an attack on Jews in Israel is not a security decision but a political one , aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right-wing members of the current coalition . The Israeli coalition depends on satisfying their demands .

However , the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument , combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice .
