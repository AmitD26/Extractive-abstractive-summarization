-LRB- CNN -RRB- Malcolm-Jamal Warner , who played Theo Huxtable on `` The Cosby Show , '' has been quiet about his onetime TV father , Bill Cosby -- until now .

In an interview with Billboard magazine , Warner said that Cosby was a major influence in his life , and it 's `` painful '' to watch him become the subject of rape allegations .

`` He 's one of my mentors , and he 's been very influential and played a big role in my life as a friend and mentor , '' Warner said . `` Just as it 's painful to hear any woman talk about sexual assault , whether true or not , it 's just as painful to watch my friend and mentor go through this . ''

Cosby has never faced criminal charges . He and his attorneys have repeatedly denied the allegations .

At least three of Cosby 's accusers have filed a federal defamation lawsuit against him , claiming that after they came forward with allegations , they were called liars .

Warner is n't the only `` Cosby Show '' star to talk . Phylicia Rashad , who played Cosby 's wife on `` The Cosby Show '' as well as on the later `` Cosby , '' said she sees the controversy as part of a larger plot .

`` I ca n't really speak on any of the allegations because obviously , I was not there . The Bill Cosby I know has been great to me and great for a lot of people , '' he said .
