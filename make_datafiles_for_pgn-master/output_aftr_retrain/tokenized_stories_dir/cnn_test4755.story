-LRB- CNN -RRB- Greg Ozubko never thought he 'd be tending goal at this point in his life . Not just because he 's 50 , but because 16 years ago he was having so much pain in his hands and feet he could n't walk across a parking lot , let alone put his feet in a pair of skates or drop to his knees to stop a puck .

Like many Canadians , Ozubko started playing hockey as a kid . When he grew up he wanted to be Wayne Gretzky . He played through high school and college , but knew he was n't good enough to realize his NHL dreams . So he moved on in life . He started a graphics business , got married and settling down in Atlanta .

`` Once the symptoms started they were pretty debilitating , '' he remembers .

By 2002 , he felt so great that while watching his home NHL team , the Atlanta Thrashers , he made a decision . The team was horrible that year and in watching them struggle motivated him .

The next day Ozubko says he unearthed his old goalie gear from the 1980s . He dusted it off and headed to the rink .

He decided he wanted to be a goalie .

Ozubko made the cut and was tapped as the East coast hokey league team 's backup goalie . Quickly he was blocking shots from players half his age . He 's always ready to step in whenever one of the teams ' goalies is injured or when the team 's goalie would called up to the majors .

Today he 's retired from minor league play . But he still feels good enough to play . He fills in on goalie when they need one for team practice .

He mentors many of his much younger teammates and works as a player liaison .

That time playing with the Gladiators has left its mark . Ozubko remembers taking it all in as he dressed for his first professional game in November 2011 . `` It was a profound experience , '' Ozubko says . His mission now is to remind the young guys how lucky they are to have landed a coveted spot on a team .

`` When I first started doing this I was 47 and I never would have believed that I would have had an opportunity like this , '' he says .

To him , his ability to play , even for a short amount of time , it is a true gift .
