-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I was happy to return to Rio , this beautiful city which I have visited several times . Twenty years after the first Earth Summit , I came to Rio , like many people from all over the world , to put the world on a different pathway -- one leading to sustainable development .

I had the pleasure of participating in numerous events during the conference where we discussed the role of women 's empowerment in sustainable development , the importance of making real progress on food and nutrition security and the need to improve access to sustainable energy for the poorest .

Underlying all of these discussions was the importance of upholding human rights and not backsliding on any existing commitments , while striving for a more equitable world .

The current declaration reaffirms the Rio Principles and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . However , it worries me that negotiations revealed a desire by some to step back from established commitments and principles . The restating of these commitments is therefore considered a success , only because these principles and values were under threat .

More seriously , the backsliding on reproductive rights -- first established in 1994 at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development and reiterated at the Beijing Women 's Conference -- is simply not acceptable , as highlighted by numerous women leaders in their statements to the Rio Summit .

This possibility of a once in a generation moment passed us by and we will regret it . Happily the lack of political leadership was countered by the incredible vitality , determination and commitment of civil society -- from young people , women , trade unions , grassroots communities , faith-based organizations and the private sector .
