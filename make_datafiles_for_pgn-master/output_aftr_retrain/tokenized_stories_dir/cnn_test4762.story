After getting the weapon , the soldier stole a military vehicle and drove to the clinic , where earlier he had been in a fight , the official said .

The shooter was identified as Army Sgt. John M. Russell , according to Maj. Gen. David Perkins , the military spokesman who briefed reporters in Baghdad , Iraq , on Tuesday .

Russell has been charged with five counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault after the shooting at Camp Liberty , near Baghdad 's international airport , Perkins added . Watch how the Army is handling the case ''

A 44-year-old communications specialist from Sherman , Texas , Russell is serving his third tour in Iraq and has previously deployed to Bosnia and Kosovo , according to his service record .

`` As far as he was concerned , the military was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to him , '' Wilburn Russell said . `` Evidently , he felt they turned against him and life was over . He did n't care any more , I guess .

`` He broke . He just could n't handle it . ''

Russell had recently been referred to counseling by his commander because of unspecified words and actions , Perkins said . The commander also ordered that the sergeant 's weapon be taken away .

A senior Defense official told CNN that when Russell was leaving the clinic Monday , he `` became hostile and an altercation broke out . ''

A couple of hours later , Russell seized a weapon from a fellow soldier , `` commandeered '' a vehicle and drove back to the clinic , the Defense official said . A soldier from Russell 's quarters called military police , but they were n't able to stop him in time .

Russell is from the 54th Engineering Battalion , based out of Bamberg , Germany -- a unit attached to Multi-National Division South but based at Camp Victory in Baghdad . He 's now in military police custody at Camp Victory .

Among the five killed , two are officers from the staff of the clinic -- one from the Army and the other from the Navy . Both are from the 55th Medical Company . The other three were enlisted soldiers who happened to be at the clinic .

Perkins , who said there are no immediate insights on a motive , said Russell had been receiving counseling within his battalion . Last week , Russell was referred to the Camp Liberty center .

`` He had been seen by his chain of command , chaplain , things like that for about the week prior to -LRB- the incident -RRB- , but that could have been the first time he physically had gone to the clinic , '' Perkins said .

Perkins could not confirm any sequence of events and said the investigation into the incident is ongoing .

`` Speculation does not serve us well , or rumor , '' he said . `` We need to know the facts because we will spend a lot of time trying to prevent these types of things in the future . ''

The clinic is temporarily closed for the investigation , with alternate locations available , Perkins said .

Russell was apprehended outside the clinic after the shots were heard , Perkins said .

Maj. Gen. Daniel Bolger , the commander of Multi-National Division-Baghdad , also spoke to reporters , telling them that a `` tragedy like this '' points to the `` challenges '' troops face .

Bolger said there is a `` stigma '' to mental health issues .

`` Not all injuries are physical , and so you 've got to have that door open for the guys , and that is one of the things we emphasize in our training . And , it 's particularly challenging for a fellow like Sgt. Russell .

Wilburn Russell said he hopes his son is found to be temporarily insane .

`` My gosh , it 's a horrible thing . It 's impacted hundreds of people . ''
