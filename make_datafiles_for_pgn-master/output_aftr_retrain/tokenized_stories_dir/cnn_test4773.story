-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration had `` very detailed contingency plans '' for military action against Pakistani forces if they had tried to stop the U.S. attack on Osama bin Laden 's compound , according to two U.S. officials familiar with the plan .

The two U.S. officials also told CNN about the plan if bin Laden had been captured alive , which included taking him to Afghanistan and then out to the USS Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea .

All of the senior U.S. officials in the White House Situation Room during the assault were prepared to call their Pakistani counterparts if fighting between U.S. and Pakistani forces appeared imminent , one of the officials told CNN . The SEALs at all times retained the right of self-defense , and they could have fired at the Pakistanis to defend themselves .

Additionally , the Air Force had a full team of combat search and rescue helicopters including MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters flying .

U.S. military and intelligence assets were conducting continuous reconnaissance of Pakistani military installations to watch for any indication of movements , but the Pakistani military never responded while the U.S. forces were there , one U.S. official indicated .

Even though it was anticipated that bin Laden would resist the Navy SEALs that assaulted his compound , and therefore be killed , the Obama administration had a plan in place for dealing with bin Laden if he was captured alive , according to both U.S. officials .

The plan was for bin Laden to be flown back to Afghanistan aboard U.S. military helicopters and then flown out to the USS Carl Vinson in the north Arabian Sea . There was a team of lawyers , medical personnel , interrogators and translators standing by to deal with bin Laden if that was the scenario that unfolded . A major concern was to immediately `` preserve evidence '' and put bin Laden into a legal framework that would ensure he could be charged and tried some day , the official said . `` We did n't want to have some case thrown out on a technicality . ''

The official indicated the standby teams included the type of expertise normally within U.S. units in Afghanistan , so it 's likely personnel did not even know who their potential target would have been . The official noted that bin Laden would have undergone the same type of medical checks and photographing that surrounded Saddam Hussein when he was captured .

After bin Laden was killed by the Navy SEALs at the compound , his body was flown back to Afghanistan , and then to the Carl Vinson where he was buried at sea . Admiral Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , placed a phone call to his counterpart General Ashfaq Kiyani asking for U.S. aircraft to re-enter Pakistani airspace -- several hours after the raid -- so the body could be flown out to the Vinson .
