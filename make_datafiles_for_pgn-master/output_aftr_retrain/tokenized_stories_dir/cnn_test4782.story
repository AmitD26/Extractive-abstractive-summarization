Twitter is on the verge of its initial public offering and everyone 's knickers have been in a knot all week over the company 's lack of management diversity -- that is , women . As The New York Times put it last week , `` The board ? All white men . The investors ? All men . The executive officers ? All men but for the general counsel , Vijaya Gadde , who has had the job for five weeks . ''

Question : Why is this a problem ?

Some facts : Women make up 6 % of chief executives at the leading 100 tech companies , and that has taken years to accomplish . Most startups have all-male boards . In 2012 women held 16.6 % of Fortune 500 board seats . Women of color were 3.3 % of the total . Fully one-tenth had no women serving on their boards at all . In the past five years , women and minorities have lost ground despite evidence strongly suggesting that gender parity and board diversity have positive effects on profitability .

Twitter had more than a year to prepare for this IPO : Where are the women ? The company 's immediate response focused on a `` paucity of candidates . '' The tech industry has a well-documented pipeline problem , one largely the result of gender stereotypes that reach into the educational system .

However , companies regularly draw executives from outside their own industries -- sometimes , yes , even women -- when seeking senior-level and board positions . It enables them to cross-pollinate ideas , diversify their expertise and innovate . For example , Apple has hired Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts . During her tenure at Burberry , the company doubled its revenues and tripled its share price . Companies redefine `` pipeline '' every day -- particularly when profits are involved .

The technology sector dresses itself up as progressive when in reality it shows every indication of being , at its core , powerfully retrograde . Despite investing in diversity programs , the management of tech firms is distinctly not diverse , and indeed the industry continues to `` dazzle '' with incidents in which men gleefully display their not even implicit biases . Last month 's Titshare debacle -LRB- click and weep -RRB- , as well as Business Insider 's long-overdue firing of CTO Pax Dickinson -LRB- who 'd for years been churning out such sexist , racist , tweets as `` Jesus gets raped by a pack of n **** s. It 's his own fault for dressing like a whore though '' -RRB- are two recent examples .

Bryan Goldberg 's September launch of Bustle , a `` women 's centric '' website -LRB- `` world news and politics alongside beauty tips '' -RRB- was a blunt force case in point . After announcing the site with a tone-deaf post , Goldberg was widely mocked for his personal failure to grasp , among other things , how ridiculous his claim to be starting the `` first site of its kind '' for women was . The real issue is n't Goldberg 's cluelessness , but the institutional biases that enabled him to raise $ 6.5 million when far more able , knowledgeable and experienced women ca n't .

How can we separate these facts from ownership ? We ca n't . As reported by the Federal Communications Commission , our media are almost entirely owned and managed by white men .

The presence of a carefully selected handful of women in tech , regardless of how determined , able and prominently visible they are , has for decades done little to alter the makeup of management and ownership . Gender diversity at Twitter , as elsewhere , is n't a priority because people make reasonable decisions about what they believe will be profitable and successful : Twitter is looking for experience and expertise within a comfort zone .

`` This to me is not a gender issue , it 's an innovation issue , '' Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has explained . Gender issues are n't innovation issues only if your gender is dominant and the norm . This rationale , and others like it , are exactly the kind of `` 1,000 paper cuts '' marginalization that result in fewer women pursuing tech careers to begin with .
