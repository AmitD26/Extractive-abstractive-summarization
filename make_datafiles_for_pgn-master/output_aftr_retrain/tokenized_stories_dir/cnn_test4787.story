`` We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no-one else on the field of play -- including Evra 's own Manchester United teammates and all the match officials -- heard the alleged conversation between the two players , '' the club said .

`` We will study the details reasons of the commission once they become available , but reserve our right to appeal or take any other course of action we feel appropriate with regards to this situation . ''

`` I did n't insult him . It was only a form of expressing myself . I called him something his own teammates from Manchester call him , '' Suarez said , according to the Uruguayan newspaper El Pais .

One word with many meanings translates into sports controversy

British media reports suggested Suarez used the term `` negrito . ''

Scholars who have studied race issues in Latin America say that such a term can have different meanings and connotations in different nations .

Generally , however , negrito is not considered a racial slur in Latin America , said Mark Sawyer , director of the Center for the Study of Race , Ethnicity and Politics at the University of California Los Angeles . `` It 's often a term of endearment , '' he said .

`` I can only say that I have always respected and respect everybody , '' he said . `` We are all the same . I go to the field with the maximum -LRB- enthusiasm -RRB- of a little child who enjoys what he does , not to create conflicts . ''

Evra , who is a Senegal-born French citizen , said in an interview with France 's Canal Plus that evidence supported his claim .

`` There are cameras , '' the former France national team captain said . `` You can see him say a certain word to me at least 10 times . There is no place for that in 2011 . ''

Liverpool noted that in his written statement , even Evra said he did not believe Suarez is racist .
