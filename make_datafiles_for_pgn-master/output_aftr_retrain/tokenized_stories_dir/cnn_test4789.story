-LRB- CNN -RRB- A Korean Air executive has resigned from some of her duties after she ordered a flight to be turned around to the gate and a flight attendant off the plane because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate .

Heather Cho , whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah , resigned Tuesday from the airline 's catering and in-flight sales business , and its cabin service and hotel business divisions , an airline spokesman said .

As for the next steps , the spokesman told CNN there is an investigation going on , so `` we will have to see . ''
