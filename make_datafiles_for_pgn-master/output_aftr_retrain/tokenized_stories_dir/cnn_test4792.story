The story , begging for help , is part of massive national marketing campaign involving 30 million pieces of a mail a year . And it 's a successful one , raising more than $ 50 million last year .

But Josh Little Bear does n't exist . It 's not just a pseudonym to protect a child . The story is a fabrication , a compiling of events that may or may not have happened to paint a broad picture that Native American leaders say does not exist .

The latest , a Christmas-oriented mailer , was sent in early November , according to the school 's director of communications .

The packets include calendars , personalized return address stickers , notepads , elaborate stickers and a so-called `` Dreamcatcher , '' a Native American handicraft that by tradition gives its owners good dreams .

The Christmas appeal introduced `` Emily High Elk . '' A year ago when her family brought her to the school , the letter says , '' -LRB- y -RRB- ou could see the hopelessness she felt in her dark brown eyes . ''

Now , the letter goes on , `` her big bright smile reveals how her life has changed . ''

CNN began receiving complaints about mailings like this more than two years ago . When asked about Josh Little Bear 's letter , Kory Christianson , the director of development , wrote us that there was no such student .

`` The name ` Josh Little Bear ' is fictitious , '' he wrote , `` but unfortunately , his story is not . ''

Michael Roberts , president of the First Nations Development Institute that aims to strengthen and support Native communities , went further . He termed the fundraising letter and the admission that the child is nonexistent as `` poverty porn . ''

`` They are raising money in the name of Indians , using the worst of poverty porn of all Indian country to raise money on all our social ills , '' said Roberts , whose Colorado-based group represents six Native American nonprofit organizations .

It seems that the money being raised is being used for the right reasons , as far as CNN could see . We were given a tour of the school but were not allowed to film . The complex , on the banks of the Missouri River , looks like a nice place and the children seemed happy , well-fed and well-housed .

We tried unsuccessfully to interview the leadership of St. Joseph 's . The communications director , Jona Ohm , first invited us to meet the school president at the small museum operated by the school .

The president , Mike Tyrell , acknowledged that the mailings `` push the edge '' of marketing and asking about them `` is a legitimate question . '' But Ohm told us to stop .
