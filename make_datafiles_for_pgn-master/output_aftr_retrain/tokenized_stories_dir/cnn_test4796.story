-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann formally announced her candidacy for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination Monday during an appearance in Waterloo , Iowa -- the city where she was born .

`` Make no mistake about it : President Obama is a one-term president , '' Bachmann declared . `` Together we can rein in all the corruption and waste that has become Washington and instead leave a better America for future generations . ''

Bachmann blasted Obama 's controversial 2009 economic stimulus plan , telling the crowd that `` spending our way out of this recession has n't worked . ''

Echoing Ronald Reagan 's famous refrain , the congresswoman asserted that `` more than ever , Washington is the problem . ''

`` The real solutions will come from our businesses , our communities , our schools and the most basic and powerful unit of all -- our families , '' she proclaimed .

Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt dismissed Bachmann 's claim she could lead a new economic recovery , arguing that `` her policies would erode the path to prosperity for middle class families . ''

On Sunday , Fox News Channel 's Chris Wallace asked Bachmann if she 's a `` flake '' -- a question the congresswoman said she found insulting . Wallace later apologized .

Former Godfather 's Pizza CEO Herman Cain -- like Bachmann , a Tea Party favorite -- received 10 % , while former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas each got 7 % .

To help accomplish that task , Bachmann has assembled a team of veteran political operatives .

Among others , she hired Ed Rollins , who directed Reagan 's landslide re-election bid in 1984 and managed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee 's 2008 effort , to run her operation .

Also aiding Bachmann are veteran consultant Bob Heckman , who has deep ties to the conservative movement ; former McCain campaign web guru Becki Donatelli ; and Tom McGill , a fundraiser for Bush 's 2004 campaign and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani 's 2008 bid .

She also stressed her sincerity -- a characteristic supporters hope will allow the congresswoman to draw a stark contrast with Romney , who is accused of being a politically opportunistic flip-flopper on abortion and other key issues .

`` What people know about me is I do what I say and I say what I mean , '' Bachmann said on Fox . `` I think people recognize I 'm very sincere in what I say . ''

The money did n't directly benefit her family , she explained , saying the $ 30,000 was for training employees , and the farm that got the $ 260,000 was owned by her father-in-law , so she and her husband did n't get any of it .

Bachmann said New York 's state legislature and governor have the right under the Tenth Amendment to legalize gay marriage , which they did Friday night and early Saturday . But , Bachmann added , she also backs a federal constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman .

In the end , Bachmann said , it would be better to settle the matter with citizens voting on a constitutional amendment rather than Supreme Court justices issuing a decision .

Asked on CBS 's `` Face the Nation '' whether she believes homosexuality is a choice , Bachmann said it was up to individuals to make their own decision and that she was n't judging anyone on the issue .

She also challenged the widespread assertion -- backed by the White House , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and a host of economic analysts -- that a failure to raise the current $ 14.3 trillion federal debt ceiling by August 2 would have potentially dangerous economic consequences .

`` It is scare tactics , '' Bachmann said , adding that the government takes in plenty of money to pay the interest it owes on federal debt and avoid default .
