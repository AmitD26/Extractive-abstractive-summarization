It was one small interview for astronaut Neil Armstrong ... and one giant scoop for an Australian accountant , of all people .

In the year 's most out-of-this-world get , the first man to step foot on the moon sat down with CPA -LRB- Certified Practicing Account -RRB- Australia 's Alex Malley to narrate his historic lunar landing in an extremely rare interview .

Armstrong was the commander of NASA 's three-man Apollo 11 mission that landed on the moon on July 20 , 1969 . Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin spent about two hours on the surface before returning to the Eagle lunar module .

`` I knew something a lot of people did n't know about Neil Armstrong -- his dad was an auditor , '' said Malley in the first of the four part interview with Armstrong posted on the CPA website .

Armstrong also recounts the moment he got the call to ask him if his crew were ready to land on the moon .

`` I thought we had a 90 % chance of getting back safely to Earth on that flight , but only a 50-50 chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt . ''

Armstrong also details the crew 's harrowing 12-minute descent to the moon , when he realized that the Eagle lunar module 's auto-pilot was preparing to land the crew on the slope of a huge moon crater .

`` The computer showed us where it intended to land , and it was a very bad location , on the side of a large crater about 100-150m in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders -- not a good place to land at all , '' he said .

The first few moments when Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the Eagle and onto the surface of the moon were tender , he remembers .

As for the future direction of space travel , Armstrong worries about cuts to NASA 's budget , and says the space program remains an important source of motivation for young Americans .

`` NASA 's been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achive , and it 's sad that we are turning the program in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation it provides to young people . ''
