Would he ever fly again , now that his feet and right hand were gone ?

A blog post by amateur pilot and journalist Miles O'Brien revealed this week that the former CNN anchor was also the victim of a medical condition that required amputation . O'Brien lost his left arm , sending concern throughout the online news and aviation communities .

O'Brien , a correspondent for PBS `` NewsHour , '' appeared on CNN for 17 years , mostly focusing on science , technology and aerospace coverage .

Thomas , 30 , has an idea of what O'Brien might be going through after his amputation .

Former CNN anchor 's arm amputated after accident

He sent his medical records to be reviewed by an aviation medical examiner , who recommended that the FAA allow him to take a medical flight evaluation test .

Only 18 months after his amputations and rehabilitation , Thomas was finally sitting in the pilot 's seat of a tiny rented airplane with an instructor , ready to show what he could still accomplish .

`` I was a little nervous , because I was having trouble getting the airplane started , '' Thomas laughed . `` It was giving me fits . '' Eventually , the engine revved to life , and they were airborne .

The instructor was mostly interested in judging Thomas ' access to the plane 's instruments and how well he could control the plane . Thomas practiced several takeoffs and landings and checked his braking .

He celebrated by , what else , taking a solo flight . The same day he passed his test , Thomas was soaring high above Nebraska after dark . `` It was crystal clear , '' he said . `` You could see a golden trail of headlights down the interstate . ''

`` I ca n't believe I got here , '' he thought . `` It made me feel so successful , like , ` Well what 's my next challenge ? ' ''

Thomas said that for a pilot missing the `` magic hand '' -- the main steering hand -- `` it would be considerably more challenging to get back into it . But it would n't be insurmountable . It just takes more practice , I would say . ''

If it 's really windy and gusty , `` it makes it more of a big deal , '' he said . `` The taxiing , takeoff and landing portion , that 's really the most critical time to have your game on . ''

During his career covering aviation , O'Brien developed a reputation as a pilot and aircraft owner . He often used his plane to travel to story assignments and as a platform to explain aviation stories to a wider audience .

The aviation community is tight-knit , and Thomas is reaching out to O'Brien as he would for any fellow pilot . `` I 'd be more than happy to help him any way I can , '' he said .

He has co-written a book about his experience , `` Modified Flight Plan . '' And soon he wants to fly across America to inspire other amputees .
