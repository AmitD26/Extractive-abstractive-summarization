Lagos , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Africa to represent Africans , a glorious dream . But that is what it has been for all this while , just a dream . Over time , as years have rolled into decades , Africans have become more and more subjugated to the decisions and policies that our former colonial masters propose , and with the aid of visionless leaders , they tell us that it 's the best thing for the people .

It is not the first time subsidies have been removed in Nigeria . Former president Olusegun Obasanjo reduced it eight times during his tenure , with the cost of gasoline increasing from 20 naira -LRB- 12 cents -RRB- to 70 naira -LRB- 43 cents -RRB- . Each time Nigerians were promised better infrastructure and investment .

It has n't been too long that we recovered from the pains and delusions of an IMF-imposed structural adjustment program -LRB- SAP -RRB- in the country , which ran for more than a decade and put us in a worse situation than we were in before it was implemented .

General Babangida , the then head of state , deregulated all sectors and removed government subsidies from almost every sector of production in line with IMF and World Bank directives towards a more open capitalist economy . The result : inflation shot up . We recovered from the pain and delusions but the poverty still remains with us .

This subsidy removal is the latest in a long line of foreign concepts and ideologies that are being forced down the people 's throats . What the Nigerian government has failed to realize is that we can not continue to model our economies on foreign blueprints .

What is behind the fuel protests ?

The people do not trust the government to honor their promises . We have heard different successive governments come in and say they are not corrupt and want to build infrastructure but end up being the exact opposite .

Nigeria 's government squeezed

We the people of Nigeria will fight for the right to survive in the face of tyranny and deceit and I am calling on all the great Nigerian youths to join the mass action and rally everywhere in the country and abroad .
