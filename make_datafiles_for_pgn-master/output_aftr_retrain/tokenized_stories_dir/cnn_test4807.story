Pope Francis moved a predecessor closer to sainthood on Sunday , beatifying Pope Paul VI on the last day of a gathering in Rome of church leaders from around the world .

Paul VI , who was pontiff from 1963 until his death in 1978 , had faced similar pressures during the advent of free love , when the church came out against birth control . Pope Paul VI based the decision on Catholic teachings on marriage .

A trip to the Philippines in 1970 could have cost him his life , but it also provided one of the two necessary precursors for his beatification -- a relic .

The second precursor required for beatification is a miracle . Pope Paul VI 's involves an unborn child in California , Vatican Radio said .

A doctor advised a pregnant woman to abort her child because of danger to her life and his , but she refused and instead had a nun pray for her using a photo of Pope Paul , CNS reported . The child was born healthy .

The announcement of the beatification came in May , two weeks after Pope Francis canonized two other predecessors , John XXIII and John Paul II , allowing them to ascend to sainthood . The unprecedented ceremony was witnessed by huge crowds gathered in St. Peter 's Square in Vatican City .
