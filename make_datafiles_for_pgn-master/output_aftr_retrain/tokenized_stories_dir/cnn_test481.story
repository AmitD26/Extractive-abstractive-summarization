Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of China 's most prominent activists and his wife are under house arrest and have been beaten by authorities , two human rights groups , China Aid and Chinese Human Rights Defenders said Friday .

In a home video released Wednesday by U.S.-based rights group China Aid , Chen Guangcheng described the dire and frustrating conditions of his house arrest , since he was released from jail in September . He said police have threatened to throw him back in jail without recourse .

On Friday , the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Defenders reported Chen and his wife Yuan Weijin were severely beaten after the public release of the video showing Chen discussing his house arrest at home .

`` According to our source , the beating was not light but also was not life threatening , '' Wang Songlian of China Human Rights Defenders told CNN in a phone interview .

Chen is a well-known activist in China .

In 1998 , he led farmers in Yinan County , where his hometown is located , to protest against a river-polluting paper factory and persuaded an international donor to fund a deep well for drinking water as alternative to the polluted river water .

He later set up a center for rights of the handicapped and filed a case against a public transport company in Beijing for refusing to honor the law providing free rides to them .

After his years of activism , the People 's Court of Yinan County sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison in August 2006 on charges of `` willfully damaging property '' and `` organizing a mob to disturb traffic . ''

Chen 's supporters called the charges preposterous .

Last month , in the lead up to Chinese President Hu Jintao 's visit to the United States , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the release of Chen , Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo , along with other political prisoners who are `` enduring enforced disappearances . ''
