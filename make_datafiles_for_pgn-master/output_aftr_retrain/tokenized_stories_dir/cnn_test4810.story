The central theme of `` My Twisted World : The Story of Elliot Rodger '' is his intractable virginity , which he blamed on `` the cruelness of women . ''

Here are five revelations from this disturbing document :

Elliot Rodger grew up on the edges of Hollywood but was not quite a part of it .

His father , Peter Rodger , aspired to make films , but he mostly directed commercials . His mother `` dated George Lucas for a short time '' and was a friend of Steven Spielberg 's , he wrote . His stepmother , Soumaya Akaaboune , acted in a few movies and was a regular on the French version of `` Real Housewives , '' produced in Los Angeles .

Rodger wrote that the movie was `` entertaining '' and the premiere `` was an extraordinary experience , '' but he said he `` felt very bitter that I was n't able to bring a girl with me as a date . The majority of men at the event had a date with them , and I felt so pathetic for not having a date . If only a girl at my collage had been attracted to me ; I would have gladly brought her to the premiere as my date . ''

`` Wealth is one of the most important defining factors of self-worth and superiority . I hated and envied all of those kids for being born into wealth , while I had to struggle to find a way to claim wealth for myself . I had to be ruthless , and do whatever it takes to attain such wealth . After all , it was my only hope of ever being worthy of getting a girlfriend and living the life of gratification that I desire . ''

`` He wanted to help me overcome my troubles because he is a so-called expert with women . He even showed me pictures of all of the gorgeous women he has dated in his life , and there were a lot of them . This man truly lived .

`` A few men who are successful with women have offered me help and advice about this in the past , but nothing ever came of it . I suppose they want to help because it would be a boost to their already big egos , and also because they feel sorry for me . People should feel sorry for me . My life is so pathetic , and I hate the world for forcing me to suffer it . I feel sorry for myself .

CNN e-mailed Launer 's rep for comment Sunday evening but has not heard back yet .

Rodger became convinced that winning the Megamillions lottery was his destiny . He began obsessively playing it and even drove to Arizona from California four times to buy Powerball tickets . `` I saw winning the lottery as the only way out , '' he wrote .

`` I knew I was always destined for great things . This must be it ! I was destined to be the winner of the highest lottery jackpot in existence . I knew right then and there that this jackpot was meant for me . Who else deserved such a victory ? I had been through so much rejection , suffering , and injustice in my life , and this was to be my salvation . With my whole body filled with feverish hope , I spent $ 700 dollars on lottery tickets for this drawing . As I spent this money , I imagined all the amazing sex I would have with a beautiful model girlfriend I would have once I become a man of wealth . ''

Grieving father after rampage : ` When will this insanity stop ? '

`` Without the prospect of becoming wealthy at a young age , I had nothing to live for now . I was going to be a virgin outcast forever . I realized that I had to start planning and preparing for the Day of Retribution , even though I had n't yet had any idea of what day that would be . ''

4 . Rodger 's three guns

Rodger began practicing shooting at a gun range in Oxnard , California , after failing to win the $ 120 million Megamillions lottery in September 2012 , according to his writing .

`` I had the knowledge , in the back of my mind , that the Day of Retribution was very possible now . Going to the shooting range while I waited for my laptop gave me the perfect opportunity to gain some initial training in shooting guns , which will be the main weapons I use as vengeance against my enemies when the Day of Retribution ultimately comes to pass .

`` I walked into the range , rented a handgun from the ugly old redneck cashier , and started to practice shooting at paper targets . As I fired my first few rounds , I felt so sick to the stomach . I questioned my whole life , and I looked at the gun in front of me and asked myself ` What am I doing here ? How could things have led to this ? ' I could n't believe my life was actually turning out this way . There I was , practicing shooting with real guns because I had a plan to carry out a massacre . ''

Rejection , jealousy and vow to kill ` beautiful girls '

His first `` act of preparation '' for the massacre was the purchase of his first gun , he wrote .

He bought his second handgun in the spring of 2013 , when he `` began to seriously think about planning the Day of Retribution , '' he wrote .

He bought a third gun a year later . `` I needed to buy a third handgun , just in case one of them jams . I needed two working handguns at the same time , as that was how I planned to commit suicide ; with two simultaneous shots to the head . I also needed to buy magazine clips and ammunition , as well as knives and carrying cases for my equipment . ''

Rodger wrote that the `` first phase '' of his massacre plan would be to stab his two male roommates to death .
