Drones both dazzled and worried senators at a hearing Wednesday about their use within the United States , and lawmakers and experts said that new legislation may be needed to protect the privacy and safety of citizens .

Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , held and studied a small plane weighing just 2 pounds before beginning the hearing .

`` I am convinced that the domestic use of drones to conduct surveillance and collect other information will have a broad and significant impact on the everyday lives of millions of Americans , '' said Leahy .

Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa , the ranking Republican on the panel , said the technology may require lawmakers to develop a new definition of an unreasonable search , which is banned under the Constitution 's Fourth Amendment .

Amie Stepanovich , of the Electronic Privacy Information Center , said law enforcement should not use drones as an alternative to police patrols . She said that they should be used for specific operations and that Congress should pass a law requiring legal permission .

`` I think we do need to enforce a warrant requirement for drones in circumstances where they 're collecting criminal evidence , '' Stepanovich said . She said exceptions could be made for emergencies .

`` With the ease and availability of drones , I think there is a real concern that the day-to-day conduct of American citizens going about their business might be monitored , catalogued and recorded by the federal government , '' said Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas .

`` There 's very little in American privacy law that would limit the domestic use of drones for surveillance , '' Calo said . Calo said he thinks the aircraft can be extremely beneficial but warned that Americans may oppose their use unless there are some limits .

An industry representative said the federal government already is regulating unmanned aircraft systems , the name industry uses for the aircraft .

`` The -LRB- Federal Aviation Administration -RRB- strictly regulates who , where , when and why unmanned aircraft will be flown , '' said Michael Toscano , president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International . He said operators of planes must get a certificate of authorization from the FAA , and the craft are to be flown under 400 feet and primarily in daytime hours .

`` It may well not be legal to carry any munitions on a drone , '' said Senator Dianne Feinstein , D-California . `` But what can be done illegally , and how can the government prevent that from happening ? ''
