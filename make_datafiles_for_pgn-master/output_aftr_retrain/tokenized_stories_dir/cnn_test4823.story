Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Limited runway space and battered telecommunications networks are hindering efforts to get food , water and medical aid into the hands of desperate Haitians amid the devastation of last week 's earthquake , relief agencies said Monday .

`` The more we receive help , the more we can take care of them , '' he said .

But with thousands of tons of aid heading into Haiti , the airport in Port-au-Prince `` ca n't handle all the aid that 's coming through , '' Belanger said .

`` It is a sheer volume issue , '' he said . `` There are more planes that want to land here than we can accommodate in any given hour . ''

In an interview on CNN 's `` Amanpour '' program Monday afternoon , U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said effectively orchestrating the flow of millions of dollars of aid into the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean nation is `` a great challenge at this time . '' But he said U.N. officials have requested transport helicopters from the U.S. government and other assistance from the European Union , and is trying to improve port facilities to get more aid ashore .

`` I know that there is a frustration amongst Haitian people , but when I met them , from their faces , I have seen that they have great hope and they are great , resilient people , '' said Ban , who visited Haiti over the weekend . `` And I told them ... to be more patient , because -LRB- the -RRB- whole world -LRB- is -RRB- standing behind them . ''

The next issue relief workers may have to tackle is fuel , needed to run not only vehicles but also generators that are now powering critical equipment , Belanger said .

`` The fuel issue can not become the problem , '' he said . `` It needs to be tackled , and it needs to be tackled soon . ''

Benoit Leduc , head of operations in Haiti for Doctors Without Borders , said five of the group 's supply planes have been diverted to the neighboring Dominican Republic rather than being allowed to land in Port-au-Prince . He told reporters Monday that coordination is `` not existing , or not efficient at this stage . ''

Leduc said the diversion of flights to the Dominican Republic has set back plans to erect a portable field hospital by 48 hours -- a critical time when many of injured survivors of the earthquake are now suffering from life-threatening infections .

Carol Fipp , another volunteer at Sacre Coeur , said eight patients have made it to Milot from Port-au-Prince on their own , taking about seven hours to complete the 75-mile drive . The hospital had fewer than 30 patients Monday afternoon .

`` Shout it from the mountaintops : We need helicopters , '' she said .
