As the region 's nations establish themselves as sporting powers , countries such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have pumped millions into sponsoring football clubs .

A report published by Repucom states that in 2014 alone , brands from the UAE spent $ 163 million on shirt sponsorship deals .

`` In the case of Qatar , its 2030 Industrial Vision has sport as a fundamental pillar of its strategic development as a nation , '' he told CNN . `` Just as the United States , through Silicon Valley , has positioned itself at the heart of the global IT industry , so sport is being used in the same way by emerging nations . ''

Football has now become a booming business in the region , but investors are tending to hand money to European clubs , not their own .

The Middle East has spent $ 1.5 bn on acquiring stakes in European football clubs and billionaires from the region have purchased Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain , helping to transform the English and French champions into European powerhouses .

Whilst these investments provide much needed financial stability for these clubs , they are also muscling out local sponsorship . It 's becoming more and more likely that European clubs will be owned by wealthy foreigners rather than local companies who have been hit hard by the global financial crisis .
