It 's been seven years since `` Team Aniston '' and `` Team Jolie '' T-shirts were flying off the shelves . Now , with rings on their fingers , it seems both women have moved on , yet the saga continues .

Many people are referencing Brangelina in the wake of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux 's engagement . And if countless headlines like , `` Anything Brad can do ! As Pitt set to wed Angelina Jolie , ex-wife Jennifer Aniston announces her engagement ... '' are any indication , the media has no intention of giving up on the love triangle .

Even CNN commenters have taken sides , perpetuating a fictitious -LRB- we imagine -RRB- rivalry between the actresses .

Opinion : We care that Aniston 's getting married . Why ?

`` Brad so traded down ... Congrats Jenn & Justin I hope you all beat the odds and live happily ever after , '' commenter Wilder Napalm wrote .

So why continue picking sides ?

That might be why Team Aniston shirts sold faster than Team Jolie shirts , Ross said , adding , `` It was 25 to one at the beginning . ''

But do n't feel bad for Jolie just yet . Her fans have since shown support by purchasing `` Adopt Me Angelina '' paraphernalia .

Even though both women are engaged , Ross said he does n't anticipate any `` Mrs. Pitt '' or `` Mrs. Theroux '' T-shirts .
