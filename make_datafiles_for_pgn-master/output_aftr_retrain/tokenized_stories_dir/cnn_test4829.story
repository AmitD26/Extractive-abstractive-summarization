Guatemala 's new anti-impunity commissioner , Ivan Velasquez , arrived to the Central American nation in October with an ambitious agenda , promising to probe links between drug traffickers and political parties .

`` We 're going to investigate if organized crime has permeated political campaigns with their financing , '' he told CNN en Espa√±ol in an exclusive interview .

The announcement sent shock waves across a country that faces one of the highest murder rates in Latin America . Widespread institutional corruption and societal violence related to drug trafficking continue to be a concern , according to a recent U.S. State Department report .

Previous commissioners have had successes exposing networks that colluded with the government . But Velasquez envisions an investigation that could expose the very apparatuses of criminal activity leaving no stone unturned .

`` We need to consolidate the activities of political parties so in return they can be more coherent , stronger and permanent , '' he said .

The 58-year-old Colombian magistrate was tapped in September by the United Nations to take the helm of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala , a special independent body of prosecutors known by its Spanish acronym CICIG . A special treaty-level agreement between Guatemala and the U.N. signed in 2006 , gives the commission special power to investigate a limited number of sensitive cases .

Investigating political parties is sure to ruffle feathers , but it 's something Velasquez done before .

And he 's asking Guatemalans to take part .

`` In this investigation in particular we need the biggest citizen involvement possible , '' Velasquez said . `` We will vet all of the information they are willing to give us . ''

During its worst period , Colombia overrun by organized crime before order was restored , Velasquez said .

Guatemala can still prevent falling into those same depths that other countries have faced .

`` By what I have seen in Guatemala over the course of these last two months , we 're in the beginning stages , '' he said .

Guatemalan Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz is confident the commissioner 's experience in Colombia will allow him to tackle such high-caliber investigations . After all , Paz said , `` there are similarities in how organized crime has permeated different sectors of society both within and outside of the state apparatus . ''

`` This is emblematic . Finally , we could have some sort if transparency in how we do politics in this country , '' Stein said .

Velasquez `` does n't have enough time '' to investigate political parties and should only focus on finishing the commission 's mandate , Perez told local media .

Perez 's office did not return CNN 's multiple requests for comment .

In the past , CICIG has successfully prosecuted several high-profile cases , including the death of lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg , which nearly brought down the government of former President Alvaro Colom .

`` Just because some segment of society opposes the investigation , it does n't mean it will fail or be truncated , '' he said .

An investigation into the nexus between political parties and organized crime has been a long way coming for both the CICIG and Guatemala , said Anita Isaacs , a longtime Guatemala scholar and professor of political science at Haverford College in Pennsylvania .

`` It 's the next step that had to be taken , '' Isaacs said . `` The landscape in Guatemala has shifted ever so slightly . It 's been biting at the edges and it 's finally gotten to the core . ''

`` In the end , '' he says , `` the fight against impunity completely depends on the country 's authorities . ''
