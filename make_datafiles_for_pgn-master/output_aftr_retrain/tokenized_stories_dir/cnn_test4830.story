`` Absolutely not . I think I am astute enough to understand the dynamics , especially collecting monetary dollars from North Korea . No , we did not get paid from North Korea at all , '' he told CNN in a lengthy exclusive interview on `` New Day Sunday . ''

Smith , who retired from the NBA in 1997 after nine seasons , said an Irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors .

`` That 's the date that was set . I did n't know it was his birthday , '' he said in the half-hour interview . `` And it did n't matter to me once I found out that it was his birthday . ''

Smith said he felt for Rodman , who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event .

Rodman arrived at Beijing airport on a flight from Pyongyang on Monday morning , the last of the team 's players to leave North Korea .

`` We did n't go there for that . We went there to do what we normally do , and that 's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange , '' he said .

`` We 're athletes doing it ourselves , '' he said .

Smith said he has no regrets about going . He said he was able to meet some North Korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first African-American he had ever met . Smith said the man told him they did n't have a very good view of African-Americans . The man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off , Smith said .

The former NBA player , who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador , said he did n't go to any areas where people are hungry .

Smith also swapped sports stories with North Korea 's sports minister and basketball players from the national team . He thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip .
