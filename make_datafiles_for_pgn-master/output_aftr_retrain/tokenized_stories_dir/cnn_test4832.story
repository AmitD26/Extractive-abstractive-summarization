At least 1,900 Hong Kongers took the streets to call for democracy on a sweltering Sunday afternoon , an energetic prelude to Wednesday 's scheduled mass vigil honoring the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown .

One of the lead marchers was Yvonne Leung , 20 , the president of the Hong Kong University Students Union .

`` Personally , my main concern is to end one-party rule in China , because the Communist Party is ruling illegitimately , '' she said . `` It does n't have the Chinese 's people 's mandate ... and it is not acceptable . Democracy is a universal value . ''

Another protester , 21-year-old Vincent Wong , said he was protesting to keep the memory of the Tiananmen victims alive .

The former British colony is currently the only place within Chinese territory where large pro-democracy demonstrations are tolerated .

In February , journalists organized a 6,500-person rally decrying what they said were increasing levels of coercion against Hong Kong press .

Days after the rally , a prominent Hong Kong news editor known for his hard-hitting coverage of China was stabbed by unidentified assailants . The attack , which is still being investigated , was seen by many local journalists a symbol of the city 's declining press freedom .

This year , French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom -- a precipitous drop from its 18th place ranking in 2002 .

Calls for electoral reform

The city is also facing an impending showdown with Beijing over electoral reform .

A January poll by the non-partisan Hong Kong Transition Project found 38 % of Hong Kongers supported Occupy Central 's proposed civil disobedience , while 54 % opposed it .

China 's vice president has warned that such a protest would be `` unlawful '' and would `` wreck the stability and prosperity '' of the city .

More loud protests are guaranteed . What 's less certain is whether Hong Kong will find a political solution .
