-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sherwood Schwartz , the prolific television writer and producer best known as the creator of the iconic sitcoms `` Gilligan 's Island '' and `` The Brady Bunch , '' died Tuesday morning in Los Angeles . He was 94 .

Schwartz got his break in TV as a writer for `` The Red Skelton Hour , '' for which he got two Emmy Award nominations , winning one . But he first left his most indelible mark by creating and producing two ensemble sitcoms : `` Gilligan 's Island , '' which aired for 98 episodes on CBS starting in 1964 , and `` The Brady Bunch , '' which aired on ABC from 1969 to 1974 .

Schwartz was awarded a star on Hollywood 's `` Walk of Fame '' in 2008 , according to website IMDb .

`` Sherwood was a wonderful writer and producer , but more importantly he was a wonderful husband , father , grandfather and friend , '' said Florence Henderson , who starred as mom Carol on `` The Brady Bunch . ''

`` His sense of humor never failed him and I always looked so forward to hearing his stories . They were endless and made you laugh so hard that tears would be running down your cheeks . Most of these stories were about the mishaps in his own life . ''

Henderson said that ever since she met him , in 1969 , `` I do n't ever remember him losing his temper . Ultimately , he was a wonderful teacher in life and again , in death , he taught us how to leave with dignity and courage . ''
