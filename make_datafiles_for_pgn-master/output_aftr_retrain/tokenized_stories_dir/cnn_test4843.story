`` We 've taken additional measures across the country to heighten security , '' State Minister for Home Affairs Shamsul Hoque told reporters .

The Jamaat-e-Islami party had called for a two-day general strike across Bangladesh beginning Tuesday , and demonstrators clashed with police and demanded that ruling party officials scrap the trial process .

Jamaat-e-Islami protested the verdict as demonstrators -- including some from ruling party alliances -- took to the streets demanding the death penalty for Mollah .

Hundreds of Dhaka University students took to the streets in the capital 's Shahbagh Square , where they were joined by other city residents in protests that began Tuesday .

Home Ministry officials said security forces were patrolling in Dhaka and other major cities , including in the large southeastern port city of Chittagong , where at least four people were killed Tuesday during clashes between police and supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami .

Jamaat-e-Islami said its members would continue to protest ; many of its leaders are behind bars facing charges of murder , arson , looting and rape stemming from the war of independence in 1971 .

They said the war-crimes trials , which began after more than 40 years of independence , was done with `` ill political motive . ''

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina showed no sign of backing down , saying the trials would be completed at any cost .

The government , which promised in its election pledges in 2008 to complete the war-crimes trials , set up the tribunals in 2010 .

Amid tight security , a three-member panel of judges of the International Crimes Tribunal-2 delivered the judgment against Mollah in a crowded courtroom on Tuesday .

Mollah , 64 , was found guilty of five of six charges , including murder .

They included crimes against humanity , tribunal Chairman Justice Obaidul Hassan said .

After the verdict was read , Mollah stood from the chair on which he had been seated and cried , `` Allahu Akbar ! '' -LRB- God is Great ! -RRB-

Lawmakers of the ruling party alliance criticized the verdict in parliament and asked the prosecution to appeal for the death penalty .

Bangladesh had been the eastern portion of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a war that killed 3 million people .
