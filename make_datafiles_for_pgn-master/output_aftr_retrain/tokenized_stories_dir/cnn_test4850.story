Audio recordings released on Monday reveal confusion between air traffic controllers and the veteran crew of a Southwest Airlines jet after they landed at the wrong airport in Missouri in January .

`` I assume I 'm not at your airport , '' one of the pilots radioed to controllers at Branson Airport , the Boeing 737 's intended destination .

`` 4013 , um , have you landed ? '' comes the response , according to the recordings released by the Federal Aviation Administration .

Then the controller calls to another air traffic facility for the area to inquire about the plane , and there is this exchange :

`` Yea , why ? ''

`` Are you kidding ? ''

`` Yea , no , I 'm not . ''

And that was n't all .

No one was injured and the jet took off the next day .
