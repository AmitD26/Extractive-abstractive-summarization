-LRB- CNN -RRB- The passing of Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz may not have come as a surprise -- his health had deteriorated in recent years -- but until the very end , the monarch was determined to leave an indelible imprint on the throne by articulating and implementing a clear vision for the country .

Abdullah did n't officially ascend until 2005 , but he had been the de facto king since 1995 , when his predecessor and half-brother Fahd 's health started failing . It was Abdullah who had to steady the ship during the tumultuous aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the United States and subsequent terrorist attacks inside the kingdom in 2003 and 2004 .

The specter of terrorism not only forced some to question the foundation of Saudi Arabia 's `` special '' relationship with the US , but also posed a serious threat to the stability of the regime by challenging its Islamic bona fides on which its entire claim to legitimacy rests .

Many might remember Abdullah for his foreign policy initiatives , including his plan for comprehensive peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors -- adopted first by the Arab League in 2002 and then again 2007 -- or his efforts to foster interfaith understanding by sponsoring international forums aimed at bringing together followers of various religions to stress their shared values , as his meeting with Pope Benedict in 2009 illustrated .

But many Saudis are likely to think of him as the king who tried to dispel any lingering doubts about the validity of the narrative around which the state was founded : The idea of a Saudi `` nation '' and its concomitant notion of a unifying Saudi identity .

Abdullah convinced many Saudis that they are not merely passive observers but rather stakeholders in a still-ongoing nation-building endeavor .

Although he sometimes used the stern tenor of an avuncular patriarch -- as he did when he encouraged Saudis not to become their own worst enemy by questioning each other 's loyalties -- the frank tone he often used in his speeches ushered in a new era , where Saudis of all walks of life felt more open to speak about not only what they considered to be the main impediments hindering the kingdom 's development , but also some of the obstacles standing in the way of their own self-fulfilment .

Many in the Saudi media and burgeoning Saudi civil society , following the king 's lead , felt emboldened to write and speak about subjects that were once considered off-limits , including extremism among some clerics , government corruption , the role of women , child and spousal abuse , and the soundness of the educational curriculum .

The imprisonment of some outspoken advocates of reform in 2014 brought Saudi Arabia intense scrutiny from human rights organizations and the Western media . Those who apparently stepped over the red lines included long-time activists as well as two young women with large followings on social media who tried to cross the Saudi border while driving .

Abdullah also expanded the membership of the consultative Shura Council , which now includes 30 women . Just as importantly , it was under his reign that thousands of Saudis experienced their first taste of democratic politics when they participated in nation-wide elections for municipal councils in 2005 .

In 2011 , Abdullah took a calculated risk by declaring that women will be eligible to participate and run in the next round of elections in 2015 . Much like his pet project , the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology -- a coeducational graduate level institution aimed at preparing Saudis to compete in the global economy -- Abdullah 's initiatives to empower Saudi women roiled conservative elements , who continue to view any change as inherently destructive .

But one of the keys to the longevity of Al Saud has been their ability to balance the competing and conflicting interests of the various segments of Saudi society and to reach a general consensus .

Intermittent clashes between Saudi security forces and the Shia majority in the kingdom 's eastern province also created a sense of unease among some who considered the unrest a harbinger of the Arab Spring 's arrival to the kingdom .

The Saudis have apparently also agreed to train `` moderate '' Syrian fighters on Saudi soil -- an uncharacteristically forceful and public intensification of its involvement in the Syrian crisis .

Despite what some considered his `` weak '' familial ties within the royal family , Abdullah 's popularity among Saudis seemed to have been rooted in his realization that the monarch 's most important base of support going forward must be the Saudi populace at large .

It is noteworthy that even some of the Saudi government 's harshest critics both inside and outside the kingdom seldom blamed Abdullah personally for what they considered to be the kingdom 's shortcomings .

Although some maintain that the persona of the wise yet humble patriarch was carefully constructed , Abdullah 's affable demeanor and seemingly genuine concern for the well-being of average Saudis endeared him to many . Most Saudis will remember him fondly .

These still-unresolved crises and impasses will likely continue to be sticking points under King Salman .

King Salman will likely shuffle some top government positions around , and his style might be a little different than Abdullah 's . At some point , he will likely try to put his own stamp on the throne . That , however , is not likely to be by changing the nature of Saudi-U.S. relations in any fundamental way .
