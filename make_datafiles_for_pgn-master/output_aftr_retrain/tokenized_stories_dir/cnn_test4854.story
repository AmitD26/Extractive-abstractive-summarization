For the several years doctors around the country have been working to update the manual . The DSM-5 is expected to be published in May 2013 , and the proposed changes to the definition of autism have caused some controversy . Dr. Bryan H. King is one of the doctors working on revising that chapter .

My e-mail invitation to be a part of the DSM-5 revision process came on January 4 , 2007 .

At the time , I was told that the work would be completed in 2011 and that participation would not be too burdensome . The process could be accomplished primarily through e-mails and conference calls , with in-person meetings held sparingly .

It 's interesting to reflect on the fact that when the ink was drying on the last version of the DSM in 1994 , e-mail and the Internet as we know it were still evolving .

In the nearly two decades since DSM-IV -- such Roman numerals suggest a chiseling in stone , do n't they ? -- there have been significant advances in technology and medicine , significant advances in our understanding of neuroscience and even changes in the significance of the DSM itself .

There are good reasons to change the DSM and perhaps some good reasons to leave it alone .

Every psychiatrist has an opinion about the DSM , and it typically includes both love and hate . In child psychiatry in particular , it is often said that children must not have read the DSM , because their symptoms so rarely seem to fit neatly into one of the diagnoses , often straddling several .

Our preliminary look at the field trial data suggests that the lines around the autism spectrum disorders will not be significantly redrawn with DSM-5 .

As we get closer to finalizing this revision of the DSM , there is understandable concern about whether some individuals will `` lose '' their diagnoses .

There is no question that some diagnoses will change . For example , Asperger 's disorder will become autism spectrum disorder . But the goal here is finding the best way to capture the symptoms and problems that an individual has , to map those symptoms onto disorders that are valid , and which then inform prognosis and treatment and further study .

We have a ways to go before the love-hate relationship we clinicians have with the DSM changes much . I am certain that children will continue to challenge our diagnostic constructs with their complexity , and I know that we will want to resist chiseling DSM-5 criteria into stone .

But I also believe that by refining the diagnostic criteria to reflect current science , we 're that much closer to getting it right . Perhaps that will make the next revision less burdensome . In any case , when the invitation comes for working on the next DSM , it would be wise -- as for any significant remodeling project -- to double the estimate for time to completion .

Dr. Bryan H. King is the director at the Seattle Children 's Autism Center and director of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Washington and Seattle Children 's Hospital . On The Autism Blog , King and other medical experts at the Seattle Children 's Autism Center share information and perspectives for those raising a child with autism .
