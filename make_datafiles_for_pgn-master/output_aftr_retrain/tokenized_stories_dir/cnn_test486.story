Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani says the controversy surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown , who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson , Missouri , does not exemplify a larger national problem .

`` 93 percent of blacks are killed by other blacks , '' Giuliani said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' `` We 're talking about the exception here . ''

`` What about the poor black child that is killed by the other black child ? Why are n't you protesting that ? ''

In response , Dyson called Giuliani 's comparison `` a false equivalency . ''

`` White police officers would n't be there if you -LRB- speaking to Dyson -RRB- were n't killing each other 75 % of the time . ''

The former New York mayor , who has been credited with greatly reducing crime in the Big Apple among poorer areas , insisted that the focus of the nation should pivot towards reducing crime among the black community .

Giuliani received significant blow-back from Dyson , an African America who told Giuliani his remarks `` reinforce the problematic perspective that prevails in the culture . ''
