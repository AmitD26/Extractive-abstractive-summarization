Manila -LRB- CNN -RRB- Flags were flown at half-staff in the Philippines Friday as the nation observed a day of mourning for 44 police commandos killed in a disastrous operation in the country 's Muslim south .

The officers , members of the police 's elite Special Action Force -LRB- SAF -RRB- unit , were killed in a 12-hour firefight with two Muslim rebel groups in the southern province of Maguindanao at the weekend .

The fallen police were farewelled by grieving family members , politicians and police and military leadership at their home base , Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City Friday .

Policemen across the country wore black armbands to show their sympathy .

Delivering a eulogy for the fallen , President Benigno Aquino III made reference to his own loss as the son of an assassinated political leader , and vowed to bring the remaining target of the commandos ' mission to justice .

`` Our 44 fallen heroes from our police force , the youngest at 26 and the most senior at 39 years old , pushed themselves and exerted all their effort to do what they could , not only for themselves and their families , but for our beloved country , '' he said .

`` They gave up their lives for the kind of peace and order that endures . ''

The president 's father , Benigno Aquino , Jr. , was a Filipino senator who was assassinated at Manila International Airport in 1983 .

Marwan , a Malaysian suspected of being behind the 2002 Bali bombings , has a $ 5 million U.S. government bounty on his head .

`` Capturing Basit Usman is number one on our list of priorities , '' he said . `` I assure you , we will get Usman . ''

He recalled hearing the voice of a colleague on the radio asking for reinforcements , as they became surrounded by armed rebels .

`` Is it worth it ? One international terrorist equivalent to 44 SAF troopers ? I 'm sure if you will ask them , it is worth it . ''

The Philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly Muslim south for years .

Last year , it signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front -LRB- MILF -RRB- , the largest rebel group in the region .

But hardline splinter groups , such as the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters -LRB- BIFF -RRB- , have not signed any peace deal .

The police commandos engaged in battle with both groups during the firefight near Mamasapano town , Maguindanao Province , last weekend .

Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government Mar Roxas said that the commandos were retreating from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the BIFF .

But Benigno said in his speech that `` even if the MILF and BIFF now constitute two different groups , many of them are related by blood or by affinity . Strangers can not just enter their territory . Our troops needed to enter quietly and carefully ; otherwise , their targets may have been alerted . ''

`` In order to give meaning to their deaths , we must resolve not to let something like this happen again , '' read the statement .
