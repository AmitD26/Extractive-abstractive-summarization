Gun debate ? What gun debate ? Americans seem to have this settled .

But Americans , ever more desensitized to the school/mall/navy yard attacks that come , weekly , into their lives , do n't seem to want to talk about a gun problem . Americans remain pleased for the general population -- even 15-year-old kids -- to have nearly unfettered access to all manner of firearms , including assault rifles . Even the President seems to have acquiesced . A tweet from @WhiteHouse : '' ` If public opinion does not demand change in Congress , it will not change . ' -- President Obama on legislation to prevent gun violence . ''

Why should guns be any different ? In the United States only about 10 people out of every 100,000 are killed by guns , or a little more than 30,000 per year -LRB- As a reference , we lost about 60,000 soldiers in the Vietnam War -RRB- .

This is clearly an acceptable sacrifice to make to maintain our sacred , un-infringed right to bear arms , no ?

After all , I 've been told by some gun-rights advocates that reasonable restrictions on gun ownership will undoubtedly send us down a slippery slope to the abolition of all guns in America . And if we did n't have unfettered access to guns , think about what would happen : We would be overrun by a foreign power ; our government would assume totalitarian control and burn the Constitution ; and criminal gangs , the only people left with guns , would run roughshod over all law-abiding citizens .

I 'll repeat : We have a gun problem in this country .

Listen , reasonable restrictions are necessary to assure the continued viability of our Second Amendment rights , and to curb the unnecessary bloodshed caused by the proliferation of guns into hands of irresponsible people who care little about constitutional rights , and less about the sanctity of life . Like that of a boy in Oregon , who was shot dead .

Mark O'Mara : America appears to have settled its gun debate

@highlight

He says inflexible owners must view school shooting as collateral of `` right '' to bear arms

@highlight

He says we do n't further restrict drinking because of DWI . Have we made that deal on guns ?

O'Mara : Face it : Restricting guns wo n't hurt Constitution , cause anarchy ; it will protect us
