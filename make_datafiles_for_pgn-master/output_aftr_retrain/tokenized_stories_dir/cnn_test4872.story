Al Aour , Egypt -LRB- CNN -RRB- Mina Aziz had no real education but he did have a strong back .

He was one of 21 Egyptian Christians killed at the hands of ISIS ' Libyan branch . The Islamic militants released a gruesome video Sunday showing the beheadings of at least a dozen of the men on a beach .

Thirteen of the dead were from Aziz 's village , Al Aour , roughly 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- south of Cairo .

Before their abduction , they had talked about their planned return home to celebrate Christmas .

`` They said , Ma , cook all the holiday food , '' she tells me . `` But the bastards kidnapped them . Like they deprived me of my sons , I hope God deprives them . ''

Hana Aziz says he was almost taken , too .

Masked men came for his cousins and nephew in the adjacent room . Hana Aziz says he witnessed the scene unfold through a crack in the wall , hearing the militants announce they had orders from `` the emir '' to arrest all Christians in Sirte .

Despite the grisly video of the men 's deaths , Hana Aziz takes solace in one aspect of what it shows .

`` To the last moment , the name of Jesus was on their lips , '' he says . `` As they were being martyred , they were calling God 's name , saying , ` God , have mercy on us . ' The entire village is proud . ''

At his home , his boyish face stares out of a photo clutched by grieving relatives .

In the picture , his jeans and dressy black shirt belie the type of labor he did .

`` He was a worker , he used to carry sand and rocks , what else could he do ? '' says Mina Aziz 's mother , Afaf . `` He did n't have a trade . He would have taken any job offered to him . ''

CNN 's Ian Lee reported and wrote from Al Aour , and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong .
