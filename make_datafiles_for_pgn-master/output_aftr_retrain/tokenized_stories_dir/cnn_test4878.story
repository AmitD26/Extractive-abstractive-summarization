When Dr. Leila Zucker 's husband sent her such an e-mail last spring , he said that he did n't want her to go but that he 'd be a lousy husband if he did n't tell her about it .

`` Most of us want to explore , want to go new places , and then it 's just a question of : How much are you willing to give up to do it ? '' she said .

Zucker is one of 705 candidates selected from a pool of 200,000 applicants for the mission . The select group has been narrowed from 1,058 people as some prospective astronauts dropped out for personal or medical reasons , Mars One said recently .

It might not actually happen

A reality TV concept is one way Mars One may make good on its $ 6 billion budget for getting the first four humans to Mars . Lansdorp hopes the unprecedented video opportunities will attract sponsors , partners and media coverage .

Mars One announced in March that it will soon begin constructing the first of its `` simulation outposts '' to train selected astronauts and teams , giving them experience in an environment made to feel like a Martian home .

Zucker , 46 , an emergency medicine physician in Washington , is doubtful that Mars One will deliver on the trip at all . But if it does happen , she is on board . `` There 's no question . ''

Settling away from your spouse

You might think that trying to emigrate from our planet might put some pressure on Earth-based relationships .

Zucker and her husband have been married for 21 years and have no children . If she goes to Mars , she said , she will probably offer her husband a divorce but will wear her wedding ring regardless . He does n't want her to go , she said , but supports her following her dreams .

Dan Carey , 52 , another candidate , also believes humans should be spreading to other planets -- but his wife is not happy about Carey taking part in the mission . The couple , married 28 years , has two college-age children .

Sachin Desai and his wife , Ankita Ritwik , are getting around the marital tension issue by applying together . Desai says he could not go to Mars without her . Sure , Mars might challenge their marriage , but enough marriages are strained on Earth already , he said .

Even if Mars One does n't land people on Mars in 2025 , it serves as a `` social experiment '' to get people talking and thinking about a Mars mission , she said .

`` What I learned in grad school is that you never really know what problems you 're going to come across until you actually try and do something . And the fact that they 're actually trying to plan it , means that they 'll come across the problems , '' she said . `` I believe that there are no problems humanity ca n't solve . ''

Still , it 's a hard sell for friends of Brian Robles ' , a Mars One candidate who studies public health at Rutgers University .

`` Usually , every time I tell somebody about the trip , they say it 's a ` suicide mission ' and ` you 're going to die on Mars , ' '' Robles said . `` Well , we 're going to die here , too . So might as well live your whole life to the fullest . ''

Funny he should mention that : The United Arab Emirates ' religious watchdog , the General Authority of Islamic Affairs & Endowments , recently issued a fatwa to warn Muslims against the mission because `` the chances of dying are higher than living . ''

Mars One responded in a statement , asking the authority to cancel the fatwa . `` The Fatwa prohibits Muslims from going to Mars , but not from applying to Mars One 's mission or training for the mission . In the next ten years , Mars One is open to working with the GAIAE to assess the risk of the mission as the unmanned settlement is under construction , '' Mars One said .

Sachs is hopeful that his trip would n't actually be one-way . He believes it would be in the best interest of the mission to send the astronauts back : `` Imagine only the cost and tax on resources to care with someone elderly on a Mars One colony , '' he said .

Making happy Martian meals

Carey said he 'd lose weight just to be able to take more chocolate with him , since there would be a limit of how much weight each person could contribute to the mission .

Michael McDonnell , another applicant , said he wants to make the first pizza on Mars . Zucker would miss hamburgers but has high hopes for being able to grow them herself , perhaps from cow stem cells using a technique demonstrated last year .

How test-tube meat could be the future of food

But for this opportunity , she would kiss them both goodbye .
