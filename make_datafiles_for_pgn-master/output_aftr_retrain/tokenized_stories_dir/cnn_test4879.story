American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden met with human rights activists and lawyers Friday in a transit zone of a Russian airport , in his first public appearance since he left Hong Kong on June 23 .

Snowden told the activists he was requesting asylum from Russia while he awaited safe passage to Latin America , according to a transcript of Snowden 's statement to the activists , issued via WikiLeaks .

`` As we have seen , however , some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law , and this behavior persists today . This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights . ''

Meanwhile , U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing their contacts with their Russian counterparts to learn whatever they can about Russia 's intentions in the Snowden case , and to press for his return to America , a U.S. official told CNN on Friday .

That platform `` runs counter to the Russian government 's previous declarations of Russia 's neutrality and that they have no control over his presence in the airport , '' he said . `` It is also incompatible with Russian assurances that they do not want Mr. Snowden to further damage U.S. interests . ''

Snowden , a former National Security Agency contractor , is believed to have been holed up in a transit area of Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport since leaving Hong Kong for Russia .

In an invitation to the meeting purportedly e-mailed by Snowden on Thursday , he cited the temporary grounding of Bolivian President Evo Morales ' plane last week as he accused the United States of `` threatening behavior '' on an unprecedented scale .

The jet , which had left Moscow , was forced to land in Austria after other European countries allegedly closed their airspace amid suspicions that Snowden was aboard .

In his remarks , Snowden also sought to defend his actions in leaking documents to the media that exposed U.S. mass surveillance programs .

`` I did what I believed right and began a campaign to correct this wrongdoing . I did not seek to enrich myself . I did not seek to sell US secrets . I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety . Instead , I took what I knew to the public , so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day , and I asked the world for justice , '' he said .

`` That moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly , but it was the right thing to do and I have no regrets . ''

Snowden asked the rights groups present to lobby the Russian government to grant him temporary asylum , said Russian Human Rights Watch representative Tanya Lokshina , who was at the meeting .

According to WikiLeaks , Lokshina told Snowden that on her way to the airport , she received a call from the U.S. ambassador to Russia .

He asked her to relay to Snowden that the U.S. government does not consider him to be a whistle-blower and that he has broken United States law , the group said .

A photograph provided by a Russian Human Rights Watch staffer at the meeting showed Snowden sitting behind a desk , flanked by a WikiLeaks staffer , looking much as he did when last photographed in Hong Kong .

WikiLeaks , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website , has been aiding Snowden in his bids for asylum .

`` A little over one month ago , I had family , a home in paradise , and I lived in great comfort . I also had the capability without any warrant to search for , seize , and read your communications . Anyone 's communications at any time . That is the power to change people 's fates . It is also a serious violation of the law , '' he said .

`` The immoral can not be made moral through the use of secret law . I believe in the principle declared at Nuremberg in 1945 : Individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience . Therefore individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring , '' Snowden said .

`` Snowden did voice a request to remain in Russia , '' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on July 2 , according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti .

`` Then , yesterday , hearing President Putin outline Russia 's position regarding the conditions under which he could do this , he withdrew his request for permission to stay in Russia . ''

It 's not clear if a request for temporary asylum would entail different conditions .

But a Russian lawmaker who was at Friday 's meeting , Vyacheslav Nikonov , told state news agency Itar-Tass that Snowden had said he did not intend to cause any further damage to the United States .

`` I 've said all I knew and I will not harm the United States in the future , '' Snowden said , according to Nikonov .

The many mysteries of Snowden 's transit zone

Sergei Nikitin , head of Amnesty International 's Moscow office , who was at the meeting , said he was pleased to voice the organization 's support for Snowden in person .

Snowden exposed unlawful sweeping surveillance programs , and states that try to prevent him from revealing such unlawful behavior `` are flouting international law , '' Nikitin said .

U.S. accused of ` unlawful campaign '

The transit zone meeting with Snowden began at around 5 p.m. local time -LRB- 9 a.m. ET -RRB- .

A CNN team at the airport saw about half a dozen people -- including Russia 's human rights ombudsman and representatives of Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and Russian human rights groups -- enter a door marked `` Private '' in Terminal E. Police and security officers then kept the media at a distance .

In the letter -- posted on the Facebook page of Lokshina , the Russian Human Rights Watch staffer -- the writer praised the `` brave countries '' that have offered him support , in the face of what he described as `` an unlawful campaign by officials in the U.S. Government to deny my right to seek and enjoy this asylum . ''

In her Facebook post , Lokshina said she received the e-mailed invitation close to 5 p.m. Thursday and acknowledged that she did not know beforehand if it was real .

A large group of Russian and international journalists gathered at the airport in anticipation of the meeting .

Since his arrival in Moscow , Snowden -- who faces espionage charges in the United States -- has requested asylum in dozens of countries , sparking a surge in speculation about his next steps .

He is slammed as a traitor by critics and hailed as a hero by his supporters .

But details about where Snowden is going -- and how he 'll get there -- have remained hard to come by .
