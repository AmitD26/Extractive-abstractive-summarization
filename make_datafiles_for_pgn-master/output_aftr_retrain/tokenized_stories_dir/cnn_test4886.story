The man who shot up downtown Austin last week had the words , `` Let me die , '' written in marker on his chest , the city 's police chief said Monday .

He said investigators found a map that included 34 locations marked as targets in McQuilliams ' possessions .

The majority of the locations were either government buildings , including the ones that he attacked , or financial institutions , Acevedo said . The map included two churches .

Investigators also found a book , `` Vigilantes Of Christendom , '' the police chief said . Inside the book was a handwritten note that discussed McQuilliams ' rank as a `` priest in the fight against anti-God '' people , Acevedo said .

According to Christopher Combs , special agent in charge of the FBI 's San Antonio division , McQuilliams had mentioned to some people that he was upset because he could n't find a job and because , in his view , immigrants were able to get more services than he was .

Authorities believe McQuilliams acted alone .
