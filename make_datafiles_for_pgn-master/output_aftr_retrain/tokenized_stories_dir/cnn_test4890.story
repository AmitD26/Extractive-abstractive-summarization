But while an equivocation that might simply sound awkward in America , it sounded off-the-wall crazy in London . Why ? Because for us it is like being casually asked `` Does two plus two equal four ? '' and replying , `` I 'd rather not answer a hypothetical question . '' One does n't dodge an invitation to assert fact in the UK . Scott dodged , and because the audience laughed gently at him in English accents , it made him look all the more like a country bumpkin .

Consider how horrible we were to Mitt Romney . Of course , from our point of view he was n't very nice to us either .

In July 2012 , he showed up in London and began by casting doubt on our ability to host the Olympics -LRB- something we very much doubted , too , but were n't going to take criticisms from a foreigner -RRB- . Then he appeared to forget the name of the leader of the opposition and called him `` Mr. Leader '' instead -LRB- we 'd all like to forget his name , but sadly , it is etched on our memories thanks to his ineptitude -RRB- .

Finally , Romney said that it was curious to look out of the `` backside of Number 10 Downing Street '' -LRB- `` backside '' is English for `` ass '' -RRB- . For all of this , London Mayor Boris Johnson taunted Mitt in front of a large British crowd -- and Boris is the closest you get to a politician we actually like . So Mitt 's humiliation was a big deal .

Is there a political bias in all of this ? Do Republicans make particularly bad travelers ? Not necessarily . Partly what 's going on here is that there are far more GOP contenders than Democratic ones , so it 's the conservative mistakes that get noticed the most .

But there might also be some truth in the assertion that the British enjoy tripping Republicans up more . Why , otherwise , would someone ask Scott Walker whether or not he believes in evolution when he 's in the UK on a trade mission ? Hillary or Bill Clinton would never be asked such a question .

Make no mistake , our largely left-wing media sees the GOP as a Hollywood clich√© of the old Wild West -- so it 's no surprise that its candidates get all the strangest questions . But that , I would argue , is one more reason for Republicans to cross Britain off their places to visit .

Another is our decline in importance . You see , we 're not nearly as superior as we like to make ourselves out to be . We 've cut our defense spending and chosen not to take part in half of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria . We contributed nothing towards the recent Ukrainian ceasefire negotiations because we are , in the opinion of some , irrelevant .

Meanwhile , the decline of religion in this country is fast , but while we like to imagine it has brought enlightenment , the reality is probably that it has brought social dislocation and despair . Our poor are so poor that they rely upon free food handouts . And our politics can be as frustrating and fractured as America 's -- we have a buoyant far right to prove it .
