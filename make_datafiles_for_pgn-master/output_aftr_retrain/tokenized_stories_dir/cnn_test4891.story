`` These surveys on Alaska 's North Slope are another important step toward broader commercial use of unmanned aircraft , '' Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a news release at the time . `` The technology is quickly changing , and the opportunities are growing . ''

Foxx and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta will announce the new rules during a conference call for reporters .

`` We saw a drone , a drone aircraft , '' an Alitalia pilot radioed in March as he came in for a landing at JFK airport in New York .

The UAV came within 200 feet of the jetliner as it was flying at 1,750 feet , three miles from the runway , according to the FBI .

It 's unclear how complicated the new requirements for commercial drone use will be . The FAA would not provide details Saturday evening .

An apparently prematurely-posted FAA document led some drone advocates to believe they will be less burdensome than what is now required of the few operators who received exemptions .

To legally fly his UAV , Trudeau must have a regular pilots license , pass an aviation medical check , be assisted by a spotter , request permission two days in advance , and limit flights to less than 35 mph and below 300 feet .
