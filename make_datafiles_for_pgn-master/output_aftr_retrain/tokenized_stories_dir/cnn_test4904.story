And the hours they spend at stables just outside Munich seem to be paying dividends , Lisa picking up her first title at national level over the weekend .

While the 25-year-old hones her craft in the world of prancing horses , Thomas takes a keen interest in breeding , as well as reveling in the solitude of an environment that is a stratosphere away from the pressurized spotlight he is used to .

`` I come here to watch if everything 's fine , '' he told CNN in the couple 's first joint television interview .

`` I enjoy it a lot . They make me feel comfortable , the attitude and what they look like and -LSB- the way they -RSB- live their lives . It 's fun . It 's easy to relax around horses . ''

At 25 , Muller is as decorated in the world of soccer as they come .

He has a glut of domestic trophies , including three German Bundesliga titles , and claimed the European Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup crowns with Bayern Munich in 2013 .

Though she has been riding horses since her Granddad introduced her to the sport aged four , it takes time to build a strong bond with a horse in dressage .

`` You have to do eight years to learn everything but then you still do n't know everything . You always keep learning , '' she said .

`` It 's not like other sports , you always train yourself , you have to get a harmony between the horse and yourself .

`` It has its own mind , its own feelings . You have to become a team and that 's why it takes so much time . Every horse is different so you have to feel it .

`` I think for every sportsman it 's a dream and you want to reach it but just a few people can reach it . Maybe , maybe not . ''

According to Lisa 's coach , Götz Brinkmann , that is a distinct possibility .

Last year 's qualification for the prestigious Piaff-Förderpreis -- a national series for riders aged 25 or below -- underlined her potential .

Muller is of the same opinion .

Though he is forbidden from riding himself -- to prevent sustaining an injuries that might impact on his football career -- he has taken a keen interest in the relationship between his wife and Birkhofs Dave .

`` The potential is there , '' he said . `` He 's our best talent I think and the number one in our stable and for Lisa .

Muller can also see parallels in the way some horses with potential develop into thoroughbreds , whether in racing or dressage circles , while some fall by the wayside .

`` It 's interesting to watch , the development of the different horses from when they come to the stable and when they leave . But he -LSB- Birkhofs Dave -RSB- stays for sure . ''

`` Breeding is a little bit for fun , '' he explained . `` For sure I want to breed the best horse I can . But it 's difficult and a bit of luck . But I try my best to optimize .

`` My dream is one day that Lisa rides a horse that I bred . But that 's a long way to go . ''

Though she often goes to watch Thomas play at Bayern Munich 's home stadium -- the Allianz Arena -- Lisa does n't even remotely fit the WAG stereotype .

The wives and girlfriends of high-profile footballers are often portrayed as carefully manicured , fashion-obsessed shopaholics -- an image cultivated by the tabloid newspapers .

But Lisa , who chose not to travel with Thomas to the World Cup in Brazil last year , has not one scrap of jealousy when it comes to the superstar treatment her famous husband gets .

`` I do n't , '' she said . `` You have the bad sides also . Everyone comes and wants to get a photo , a selfie or an autograph . That would be too much . I ca n't do that like Thomas can do it .

`` He 's so easy going . And I want to do my horses by myself . I can groom them the best , I can ride them the best and I love them the most .

`` They 're my partner , my brother . I can tell them every problem . They 're the most important part in my life . ''

This statement provoked a laugh from her husband : `` I have already accepted it , '' he joked . `` Maybe I 'm number five . But it 's OK . ''
