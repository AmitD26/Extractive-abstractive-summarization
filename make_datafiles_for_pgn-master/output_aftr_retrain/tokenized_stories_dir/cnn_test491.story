The Kommersant business daily on Wednesday said the Lourdes signals intelligence facility , which was mothballed in 2001 , would reopen as part of a deal struck by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Cuban President Raul Castro .

Putin visited Cuba on Friday to strengthen ties with the island and lauded a recent deal that forgave over $ 30 billion in Soviet-era debt that Cuba still owed its former communist ally .

Cuban and Russian officials and a U.S. State Department spokeswoman would not comment on the report of the reopening of the base .

If Lourdes reopens , it is not clear how soon the defunct facility will again be operational or how much Russia would pay to be able to monitor U.S. telecommunications from Cuba .

When the facility was closed in 2001 , it further strained Russian and Cuban relations .

Part of the sprawling facility has been turned into a computer science university , but many of the Soviet-era buildings have fallen into disrepair .

Trees and bushes have grown around collapsed buildings and goats hunting for food wander around the once top secret and tightly guarded facility .
