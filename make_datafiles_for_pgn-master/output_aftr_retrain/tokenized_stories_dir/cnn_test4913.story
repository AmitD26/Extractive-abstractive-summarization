-LRB- CNN -RRB- The cover-up is often worse than the crime .

Henry Louis Gates stands accused of scrubbing part of a segment in his PBS documentary series `` Finding Your Roots '' because the actor Ben Affleck put pressure on him . Affleck 's concern was that the segment would have aired his family 's dirty laundry , which includes a slaveholding ancestor , Benjamin Cole .

And Affleck 's initial reluctance to acknowledge his truth -LRB- an impulse , he said on Facebook , he regrets -RRB- is surprising . Last month , Affleck lent his star power to support continued foreign assistance for the Democratic Republic of Congo by testifying before Congress .

In any case , why did he agree to do a television show if he was concerned about what might be discovered ? He could have paid a genealogist to uncover his ancestry , if privacy was what he wanted .

In the leaked exchange , Lynton advised : `` I would take it out if no one knows , but if it gets out that you are editing the material based on this kind of sensitivity then it gets tricky . '' Gates acknowledges that to delete the segment at the request of a guest `` would be a violation of PBS rules . '' Then he does it anyway .

Gates , however , denies doing this . After the story came to light , he released a statement saying that he `` maintained editorial control '' and decided what made `` for the most compelling program . '' For Affleck 's `` Finding Your Roots '' segment , he substituted a Revolutionary War ancestor instead of the slave-owning one .

If Gates thought there was no need for the slavery segment because it did n't make for good television , there would have been no need to consult with Lynton ; Gates could have given Affleck what he wanted because he made the assessment of how strong Affleck 's story was . The original script , reprinted on Gawker and elsewhere , makes it clear , however , that the slave-owner angle makes for better television .

Here are some excerpts :

Gates sets up the segment describing Benjamin Cole as living in Savannah , Georgia . Affleck responds that he has a house in Savannah . Gates says `` Really ? '' and asks whether he knew he had roots there . Affleck says he had no idea he had any Southern roots at all . Then the voice-over lowers the boom : `` We wanted to see if we could learn how Ben 's ancestor felt about -LRB- slavery -RRB- . '' Gates shows the slave schedule of the 1850 Census to Affleck , who says , `` There 's Benjamin Cole , owned 25 slaves . ''

This is the kind of enlightened approach Gates and PBS should have been interested in facilitating . White Americans ' lack of comfort in talking about slavery , race and the places in our society where racism continues to fester is at the heart of why even with a black president , we are still , as a country , far from post-racial .

The fallout continues . Gates has to deal with PBS and WNET 's internal review . He should not walk away without consequences . If you 're going to run with the megastars , you need to have mega-ethics .
