`` The department is still investigating the victim 's claims and will not have any further comment on this matter in order to preserve the integrity of the case , '' police in the Delaware capital said .

Busch 's attorney , Rusty Hardin , said his client expects to be vindicated .

Details of the claim have n't been released . NASCAR races were held in Dover on September 27 and 28 .

Mike Arning , a spokesman for Busch 's Stewart-Haas Racing team , said , `` This is an allegation Stewart-Haas Racing takes very seriously , but we 're still gathering all of the facts and are not in a position to comment in greater detail . ''

Busch is ranked 14th in the NASCAR 's Sprint Cup standing , though he is no longer in contention for this year 's championship . He won the driving circuit 's top prize in 2004 .

He is scheduled to race next in Sunday 's Quickens Loans Race for Heroes 500 at Arizona 's Phoenix International Raceway .
