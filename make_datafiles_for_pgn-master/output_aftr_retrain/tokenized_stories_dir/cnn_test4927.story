ELDORADO , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ambulances rolled into a Texas ranch that 's home to members of a polygamist sect , as authorities continued their search Saturday night for possible victims of physical and sexual abuse .

Authorities are seeking Dale Barlow , 50 , seen in a mugshot from a 2005 arrest on child sex charges .

Authorities wanted medical backup `` in case they 're involved in sensitive areas that could escalate into a negative reaction , '' a law enforcement source said .

A police helicopter also had begun circling the ranch Saturday night .

Earlier , dozens more children and young women were removed from the compound .

Eighteen of the girls have been taken into state custody .

Authorities believe that they `` had been abused or were at immediate risk of future abuse , '' said Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar .

Barlow is in Arizona and does not know his accuser , his probation officer told The Salt Lake Tribune .

Barlow pleaded no contest last year to conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor , The Associated Press reported .

He was ordered to register as a sex offender for three years , according to the AP .

Jeffs ' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bought the land near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch , which they call the YFZ Ranch . The letters are said to refer to the words Yearning for Zion .

It is home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds .

State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening , preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property , according to Randy Mankin , editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper .

`` This came totally out of the blue , '' Mankin said .

There were no indications of violence around the ranch , he said .

When CNN crews have visited the ranch , it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders .
