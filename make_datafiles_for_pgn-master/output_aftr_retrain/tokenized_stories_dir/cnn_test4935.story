Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off Somalia .

The pirates are using ships they have already hijacked and larger ships from which they are launching skiffs , the official said Friday .

One of the pirated ships is the German cargo ship Hansa Stavanger , seized April 4 off the coast of Somalia .

The U.S. military has been monitoring communications between the pirates , the official said . The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton , with helicopter capabilities , has now joined the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge in the area . A third ship , the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer , which has a large medical facility on board , will be there within a day .

Phillips was believed to be trying to swim to the USS Bainbridge , which is in communication with the four gunmen holding Phillips in the 28-foot boat off Somalia 's coast , the official said .

The pirates fired shots , the military official said , but had no further details .

A Defense Department official told CNN that Phillips appeared to be tied up by the pirates after the escape attempt .

The U.S. official -- who did not want to be named because of the sensitive nature of the situation -- said the escape attempt is being viewed by negotiators as an `` optimistic sign '' that Phillips is in good health . He has been held since Wednesday , when the hijackers seized control of his U.S.-flagged ship , the Maersk Alabama . Watch expert talk about hostage escape attempts ''

The captain 's wife Andrea Phillips thanked everyone for their support in a statement .

`` My husband is a strong man and we will remain strong for him , '' she said . `` We ask that you do the same . ''

The Maersk Alabama was on its way to Mombasa , Kenya , with a cargo of food aid when it was attacked Wednesday . It was the first time in recent history that pirates had targeted an American ship .

The ship was hijacked some 350 miles off Somalia 's coast , a distance that used to be considered safe for ships navigating in the pirate-infested waters .
