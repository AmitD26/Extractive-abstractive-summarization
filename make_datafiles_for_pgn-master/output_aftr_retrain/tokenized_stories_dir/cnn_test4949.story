Thomas L. Friedman has taken on a green hue with his latest book , `` Hot , Flat and Crowded '' .

As a journalist , Friedman makes no claims to having scientific expertise in climate change . He is approaching it from a philosophical standpoint .

Green capital

For Friedman , the system works but it 's not immune to bad decision-making . Green industry like globalization will come of age if given the right market environment . His faith in capitalism is equal to that in green technology -- for him , these are two things that are clearly reconcilable .

As an extension of that argument , all countries need to do the same . Right now , no country has really taken the lead in environmental technology , so what we have at the moment is an all out race to the top . Indeed Friedman 's book was written before the financial meltdown but recent events have furthered his argument that environmental technology is the solution of all solutions . It 's a sentiment I also came across at the recent Clinton Global Initiative meeting .

Green Dream Team

A glimmer of hope however is Obama 's newly appointed energy secretary Steven Chu . There 's been extensive chatter about him on environmental blogs in recent days with the media calling Chu the head of Obama 's `` Green Dream Team . ''

Friedman made a ringing endorsement of Chu as did many in the audience that day . Steven Chu , Nobel Laureate and the head of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , is seen as a promising choice for many environmentalists , one perhaps that proves Obama 's intention to fulfill a key campaign promise on energy policy .

The audience listening to Friedman that day was clearly appreciative of his no-nonsense approach to the green issue . As Friedman puts it , `` it 's not about changing light bulbs , it 's about changing leaders . ''

So as I sat there wondering whether the fish the guests had been eating for lunch was sustainable , for Friedman , it did n't really matter . For his revolution , he had bigger fish to fry .
