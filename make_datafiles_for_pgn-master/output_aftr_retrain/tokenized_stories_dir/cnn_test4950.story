-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Since the early days of pop music , the music industry has been searching for the secret formula to writing a successful song -- for that special alchemy that separates a Grammy-winner from a dud . For a period in the 1970s and 80s , the self-styled King of Pop Michael Jackson seemed to have stumbled upon it , but somewhere along the line he , too , seems to have misplaced it .

The software , developed by Barcelona-based Music Intelligence Solutions , works by breaking down more than 60 elements of a song , including melody , harmony , tempo , pitch , octave , beat , rhythm , fullness of sound , noise , brilliance and chord progression , and compares it against a database of over 3.5 million past commercial hits .

Curiously , clusters of songs do not necessarily contain songs that sound the same to the human ear , but from a mathematical perspective they share similarities . HSS analyzed music from Norah Jones ' first album before she broke through and the program 's algorithms placed her in a cluster with Linkin Park , Aerosmith and JayZ .

If you have ever wondered why you sometimes find yourself humming along to some smooth jazz on the radio when you consider yourself a strict thrash metal fan only , then perhaps HSS has discovered the scientific answer .

Besides Norah Jones , the program also predicted success for Mika , while `` Turn Your Car Around , '' a song penned by Ben Novak , a singer-songwriter from New Zealand , was rated as a potential hit by HSS , who recommended it to Sony Music in the UK . It eventually ended up as a vehicle for ex-Blue band member Lee Ryan and scored a respectable UK chart position of 16 in 2005 .

`` But when we choose a tune for an artist and we like it and feel it will be a hit , the surprise is that 85 percent of the time the tracks we have chosen get a positive analysis from the software . ''

The emergence of hit prediction programs such as this -- New York-based Platinum Blue Music Intelligence provides a similar service -- raises concerns that the creative element of writing music would be eroded by breaking it down into mathematical algorithms . But Quintero claims the program in no way writes a song , it simply tells you whether it has the potential to be a hit . He says he mainly uses the software to tweak and refine songs so that he can maximize his chances of scoring a high chart position .

Quintero has since become a member of Music Intelligence Solutions ' advisory board , so he is bound to have a positive take on the service . Jimena Llosa , General Manager EMEA of Music Intelligence Solutions , claims the company has thirty to forty clients in the record industry in Europe and the U.S. , but she says she can not reveal who they are , citing privacy issues . CNN attempted to contact several record companies in London , but A&R departments claimed they had not heard of the service , suggesting either a certain coyness to admit using it or that it is not as widely used as Music Intelligence claims .

Ã“scar Sainz is one musician who has profited from this new way of connecting musicians with an audience . A national tennis monitor by profession , he struggled to make an impact in the music industry despite the best efforts of Pablo Pinilla , one of Spain 's most successful music producers . But since the Orange initiative his career has taken off and he is now selling well through Orange and touring the country .

But the software has its skeptics . Jim Elliot , writer and producer of Kylie Minogue 's new single `` 2 Hearts '' is unconvinced about the accuracy of the program . He entered tracks from her new Album `` X '' and they were , unsurprisingly , rated as potential hits . But he also entered a little-known , unreleased , song by 70s band Gong that included cows mooing , and it was also rated as a potential chart-topper .

He thinks that the program negates the unpredictability of human behavior . `` The fact is that it 's the human errors introduced in the music-making process that are always the most interesting , '' he says . `` Who would have thought Lily Allen would do so well ? I doubt anyone would have predicted that .

With just one fifth of their musicians making a profit for today 's record companies , executives are always searching for new ways to narrow the risk margin . Hit Song Science may become a useful string in their bow in the elusive art of predicting a hit . Otherwise they will have to keep relying on tried and tested -- and more human -- methods , such as gut instinct . E-mail to a friend
