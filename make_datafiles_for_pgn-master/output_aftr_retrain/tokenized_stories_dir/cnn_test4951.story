-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Matt Aldridge would have trouble contemplating life without the Shriners Hospital for Children in Greenville , South Carolina .

Maddie Aldridge has received extensive care at South Carolina 's Shriners Hospital , including leg amputation .

Now , he and his wife , Renee , take Maddie to Greenville -- about a 90-minute drive from their South Carolina home -- at least every six weeks , partly for treatment of a hip condition .

`` If it were n't for Shriners , we 'd be financially devastated , '' Matt Aldridge said . `` With just the care Maddie has received already , we probably would be bankrupt . ''

For the Aldridges and many other families , accessing care from Shriners may get a lot more difficult .

The system 's board says it may ask the fraternity 's membership in July for authority to close six hospitals -- including the one in Greenville -- largely because the endowment fund that supports the hospitals dropped from $ 8.5 billion to $ 5.2 billion over the last year as the stock market plummeted .

Other proposals from the system 's board would close just one hospital or none , but slash spending systemwide . Leaders also are exploring other options , such as partnering with non-Shriners hospitals . But one way or another , the system must cut spending by about 30 percent to survive , Semb said .

Shriners Hospitals , which deals with certain specialties up to age 18 , have treated hundreds of thousands of children free of charge since the first facility opened in Shreveport in 1922 . Most offer orthopedic care . Four , including the Galveston hospital , care for children who are burned . One of those facilities , in Sacramento , California , is treating a few children burned in Friday 's day care center fire in northern Mexico .

The Greenville hospital , which generally draws children from six states , gets about 900 inpatients and about 1,100 outpatient visits yearly , according to Rod Brown , the chairman of that hospital 's board of governors .

Since news of the possible closures broke , many -- including some Shriners and people who 've used the hospitals -- have spoken out in hopes of keeping the facilities open . Hundreds have turned out for rallies in some of the cities . Several `` save Shriners Hospital '' pages on Facebook call on readers to support fundraisers .

`` Say you 've got a series of operations to do on the child , and it 's going to cost $ 100,000 . Even with the good insurance policies , the families still have to pay 20 percent on that , and that 's more money than most have stashed away , '' he said .

The Aldridges have more surgeries in their future . In addition to being born without her shinbones , Maddie has only eight fingers . She will need operations to make her hands more efficient . Watch how hospital 's closure would affect the Aldridges ''

If the Greenville facility were to close , the family would think about moving to Kentucky , where the next nearest Shriners hospital is . Or , they would stay and drive eight hours to the Kentucky facility .

Option No. 1 would take the lifelong South Carolina residents from friends and relatives . The other would mean more missed days at work and school for the family , which also includes Maddie 's 3-year-old sister .

`` Not only is it a financial thing , but it 's also quality of care , '' said Aldridge , who became a Shriner himself in part because of the care he received . `` Shriners doctors are considered to be the foremost experts in what they treat . ''

Semb said some of the six hospitals -- which he said were chosen because they were relatively underutilized -- could stay open if they strike a partnership with non-Shriners facilities . In such a deal , Shriners doctors would perform major surgery at the partner hospital , and the partner would bill the patients ' insurance if they have it . Follow-up care would be done at the Shriners facility , still free of charge .

Semb said the idea has some merit , but he cautioned that to accept insurance and Medicaid , the hospitals would subject themselves to more federal oversight and possibly curtail their ability to treat patients as they see fit .

Meanwhile , Renee Aldridge is circulating petitions against the closures and intends to deliver them to the San Antonio meeting . Wide swaths of the country should n't be deprived of the expertise and the free treatment that Shriners doctors give , she said .

`` Some may be able to go to another place , but a lot of doctors wo n't put the time and care in that Shriners does , '' she said .
