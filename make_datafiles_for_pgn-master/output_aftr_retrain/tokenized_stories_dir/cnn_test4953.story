The Russian has only recently returned to action after a serious shoulder injury , but despite performing solidly in the French Open and reaching the semifinals of the WTA grasscourt event in Birmingham last week , she remained 59th in the rankings .

But Wimbledon , who are alone among the grand slams in not sticking entirely with the official rankings of the ATP and WTA in deciding the seedings , have given Sharapova the 24th berth .

The defending champion will test his injured knees by playing in two exhibition matches on grass at the Hurlingham Club in London later this week , organizers announced Wednesday .

Five-time champion and pre-tournament favorite Roger Federer is second seed at Wimbledon as he bids to set a record of 15 grand slam wins after his French Open triumph .

Home hope Andy Murray , who won the Queen 's Club tournament on Sunday , is seeded third with Novak Djokovic of Serbia in fourth .

Eighth-ranked Fernando Verdasco of Spain gets the seventh seed spot ahead of Frenchman Gilles Simon .

Outside of the top seeds , Marat Safin of Russia has been elevated to 15th from his world ranking of 23 .

Former world number one Safin reached the semifinals at the All England Club last year .

Big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic is lifted to 23rd from 31st .

But Amelie Mauresmo of France was beaten 7-6 7-6 by Russian Ekaterna Makarova at the WTA tournament in Eastbourne .
