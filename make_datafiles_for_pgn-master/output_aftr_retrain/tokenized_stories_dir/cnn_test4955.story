It is , however , going online .

Activists are conducting demonstrations on YouTube , holding virtual fundraisers and using social network sites like Facebook to change the world -- one mouse-click at a time .

These cyber-pioneers include a nonprofit group that uses animated 3-D characters to protest the global shortage of drinking water ; a Web company that allows ordinary people to create their own personalized charity ; and a Goodwill blogger who reshaped the thrift store 's image so thoroughly she was invited to New York Fashion Week .

`` It 's a new world for a lot of nonprofit organizations , '' Hart says . `` No longer is it good enough to say give us some money . The rules have changed . ''

Real change : online or in-person ?

Yet the Web makes it easier for a nonprofit group to reach more people than a meeting ever could , one nonprofit group says .

WaterPartners International is a U.S.-based nonprofit group that created a global campaign to create safe drinking water . Another company may have flown a spokesperson to an impoverished village and hired a film crew to promote their campaign . But WaterPartners says it saved money and time by putting its campaign online -- through animated , virtual characters built from actual people , says Nicole Wickenhauser , a company spokesperson .

Web-based activism not only enlarges the reach of social activists , it empowers ordinary people , its advocates say .

In another time , a person had to find a charity to give their time and money to . Now they can create their own charity through Web sites like "YourCause.com . ''

Matthew Combs , the site 's co-founder , says his site designs Web pages and vets charities for people who do n't have the time or expertise to do it themselves .

Social network sites like MySpace are also throwing their support behind Web activists . MySpace has an `` Impact '' page that connects users with political and charitable causes . YouTube recently launched a `` Nonprofits and Activism '' channel .

` The reaction was priceless '

One of the most audacious forms of Web-based activism comes courtesy of Em Hall , also known by her blog name , the DC Goodwill Fashionista .

When Goodwill of Greater Washington wanted to expand its customer base , its leaders devised a campaign to reach out to a younger , hipper crowd .

Hall still recalls how Fashion Week officials acted when she told them what clothing label -- Goodwill -- she represented .

`` The reaction was priceless , '' she says . `` A look of confusion came across people 's faces as they desperately tried to figure out why Goodwill was at Fashion Week . ''

Despite the possibilities created by the Web , calling people to action still depends on people putting their bodies -- not just their mouse-clicks -- on the line , says Hale , the Seton Hall professor .

`` All of the stuff you can do online ultimately has to show up in the real world , '' Hale says . `` I do n't see the Internet as a substitute -LSB- for social activism -RSB- but as a complement to it . ''

Paul Loeb , author of `` The Soul of a Citizen , '' a book that examines the psychology of social activism , also says online activism can be powerful but limited . He tells a story from his book to make his point .

He says a friend took her kids to a protest against nuclear testing in front of the White House during the early 1960s . But she became dejected because only a few people joined her demonstration and then it rained .

`` He 's seeing these ragged women in the rain and it touches his heart and he ends up getting changed by that , '' Loeb says . `` That story could n't exist in the virtual world . ''
