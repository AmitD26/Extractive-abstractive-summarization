NAIROBI , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Al Qaeda-linked militant group waging war against Somalia 's fragile government is becoming an increasing threat to Western ally Kenya and could potentially destabilize the region with dire consequences for global security , officials and analysts warn .

Al-Shabab fighters count their bullets in neighborhood of Mogadishu .

Appeals by Somalia 's government for international help to unpick its long-running civil conflict have escalated Al-Shabaad 's threats with the group behind warnings of an attack on the Kenyan capital , Nairobi .

And , say experts , the group is being backed by foreign fighters -- some said to have links to Osama bin Laden 's Al Qaeda network -- a situation that draws direct comparisons with the group 's influence in pre-9 / 11 Afghanistan .

`` Al-Shabaab is a threat to the whole world , '' Somali Information Minister Farhan Ali Mohamoud told CNN . `` First to Somalia , to the neighborhood , and to everywhere they have disagreed with . '' Watch more on Somalian threat ''

Mohamoud , whose transitional government has largely failed in its long-term goal of reconciling Somalia 's militias , concedes Al-Shabaab is making major gains on his administration and says the global community must act to prevent their threat escalating .

`` The issue is not Somalis taking over from other Somalis . But the issue is foreign jihadists imposing their ideas into the region . So Somalia can be a launching pad for a greater and wider jihadist issue . ''

`` We do believe that Al-Shabaab poses a threat , not only to Kenya , but to all neighboring countries such as Ethiopia and Eritrea , '' he said .

`` It is not just a problem that we foresee in Kenya , just because we are neighbors to them , it is a problem that we foresee that may occur to a lot of countries and also poses a threat to outside even this region , '' he added .

Ernst Jan Hogendoorn , an analyst with the International Crisis Group , told CNN that while Al-Shabaab had whipped up concerns with headline grabbing acts such as the recent kidnap of two French citizens in Mogadishu and three aid workers on the Kenyan side of the border , countries such as Kenya should pay heed .

But , says Hogendoorn , with an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia proving largely ineffective , and Ethiopian military presence withdrawn in January ahead of an Al-Shabaab push , Kenyan military involvement was unlikely to offer any quick fix .
