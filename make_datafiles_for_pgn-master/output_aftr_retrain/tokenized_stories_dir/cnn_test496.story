On a chilly morning in Barre , Vermont , a random act of kindness warmed the hearts of strangers and spurred another -- and another after that .

Kathleen Connors stopped at L&M Diner on Saturday after a 12-hour overnight shift at Central Vermont Medical Center , where she works as a surgical nurse .

Connors got up to pay her bill , but instead of paying for just herself , she footed the bill for a nearby pair who appeared to be father and son , whom she did n't know .

`` I was looking around aimlessly and I had a pocket full of bingo winnings , '' Connors said . `` It 's nice to see a family come together on the weekend . ''

After paying $ 40 for both meals , she got in her truck and went home without a thought . What she did n't know was that her generosity would be repeated -- 46 times -- in the span of 6 hours .

L&M Diner is a relatively small establishment . Housing just 13 booths and 11 seats at the counter , it 's the type of joint that attracts local regulars .

`` This is my way of showing my appreciation for Vermont . I love Vermont and I could n't be happier . I love where I work , I love where I live and I love the people around me , '' Connors told CNN affiliate WCAX .
