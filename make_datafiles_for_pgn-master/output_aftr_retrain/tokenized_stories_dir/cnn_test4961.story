The 200-pound replica was stolen less than a month ago from Vox Pop , a coffee shop in Brooklyn .

`` It 's very disturbing , '' shop operator Debi Ryan told CNN , adding the video struck a chord similar to that of terrorist assassination videos . `` I do n't know what it means . ... I do n't know who would do this . ''

Authorities told CNN they are handling the case as a larceny rather than separately investigating the YouTube video .

`` We want to verify who sent the e-mail with the video and see if they 're responsible , '' police said .

`` We 've created a space here that 's owned by the community , '' Ryan said . `` We 're all about freedom of speech and freedom to be who you are and say whatever you think . ''

But Ryan does n't consider the YouTube video featuring her stolen statue appropriate free speech .

`` Vox Pop stands for freedom of speech . You do n't get to steal somebody else 's property to send that message . We have to respect each other , '' she said .

Although the coffee shop recently faced economic problems and neighborhood tension , the motive behind the statue 's theft remains unknown . As for whether there will be a replacement statue , Ryan said , `` I 'm hoping . I think she belongs here .

But she added , `` Whether we have a physical statue or not , what she stands for remains here . ''
