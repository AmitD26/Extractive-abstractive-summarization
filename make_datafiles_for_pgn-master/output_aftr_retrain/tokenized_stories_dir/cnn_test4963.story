LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A former motor-racing engineer has unveiled a prototype of a new hydrogen-powered city car which claims to emit less than one third of the carbon emissions produced by its nearest rival .

The Riversimple Urban Car has been nine years in the making and needs further funding for city trials .

`` I think that the auto industry is focusing a lot of money on research and development at a basic science level on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology . We do n't think it 's necessary to do that , '' Spowers told CNN .

`` We can use existing technology and integrate it into a whole system design approach -- that is where the breakthrough has come . ''

Spowers is searching for extra funding to put the ` Urban Car ' on the streets , but he says at this stage they wo n't be for sale . Riversimple plans to lease the car to customers for a monthly fee of £ 200 -LRB- $ 330 -RRB- . Hydrogen fuel for the cars will cost just 15 pence -LRB- 25 cents -RRB- per mile .

It 's a long way from the fuel-guzzling world Spowers used to inhabit as a designer and developer of high-powered racing cars . It was the industry 's appalling environmental record that encouraged him to leave to try to find a way to make driving greener .

`` Certainly the first five or six years were hard work because I did have an awful lot of people telling me I was mad , '' Spowers told CNN , at the launch of the Riversimple Urban Car in London .

Ferdinand Porsche 's great-grandson Sebastien Piëch is a partner in Riversimple . He says the company 's nimble size has given it an advantage over larger car manufacturers whose future he says concerns him .

`` It concerns me massively , because I do n't see that the model they have now is very relevant to where consumers are going . Consumers are looking for a different solution . I 'm not sure if what they 're producing is working , '' he said .

Riversimple plans to share the designs for its car through open-source licence agreements , a system more commonly used in the software industry . Designers and manufacturers will be invited to make improvements so the car evolves into the most efficient vehicle it can be .

`` We do n't believe that making money on IP -LRB- intellectual property -RRB- is really what 's actually happening even now . We believe that service and providing the solution for customers will be where we make money , '' Piëch told CNN .
