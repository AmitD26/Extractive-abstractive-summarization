LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson 's daughter touched the hearts of millions when she bid a tearful farewell to her father at his memorial service in a rare public appearance .

`` Ever since I was born , daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine , '' she said , fighting back tears as relatives consoled her .

For many watching , Paris ' appearance marked a rare glimpse of a child who has spent most of her life shielded from the public .

In its execution , the speech appeared to be a surprise to those onstage and off .

`` It was a surprise they were there . All of us who know them were delighted they were strong enough to come and feel this love and great outpouring for their dad , '' Kenny Ortega , the choreographer -LRB- `` Dirty Dancing '' -RRB- who was directing Jackson 's `` This Is It '' comeback concerts in London , England , told CNN 's Campbell Brown . `` We would 've never expected that they had the strength . It was beautiful . '' Watch Ortega express his surprise at Paris Jackson 's tribute ''

Marlon Jackson told the crowd that his sister , pop star Janet Jackson , wished to say some words . Instead , Janet appeared to encourage Paris to come forward from the sea of black dresses and suits and take the microphone , adjusting it and stroking the child 's hair as Paris delivered her words .

`` Michael was so close with these beautiful children , '' he said .

`` Little Paris was his biggest fan . ... A little girl could n't love her papa more . ''

`` The saddest moment was when Michael Jackson 's daughter spoke , '' said Angelina Martinez , who attended the service with her daughter , Jessica .

`` She was really in pain . Everybody was crying inside , '' she said . `` It was beauty combined with sadness . ''

But to many , Paris ' tribute cast Jackson in the one role few have experienced him as : a father .

`` It was very , very touching , and really it was an example of the good parent Michael was , because when I was at Neverland and with the kids he really was a good loving father -- they had a fantastic relationship , and they were very close-knit , '' Stuart Backerman said .

Others saw the tribute as a whole as Jackson 's final legacy to his children .

`` There are those I feel in years to come , will try to distort him to his children ... and not understand that the real challenges that Michael Jackson had to seriously face and did face and make a difference , '' the Rev. Al Sharpton said .
