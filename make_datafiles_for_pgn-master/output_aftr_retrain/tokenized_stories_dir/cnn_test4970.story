Researchers use the doughnuts and other stale pastries to bait traps for the bears . Once snared , the bears are tranquilized and then fitted with a GPS collar . Using cell phone technology , every 15 minutes the collar sends a text message that tells researchers where the bear is located .

Tracking the bears ' movements -- or lack thereof -- is important . Dr. John Cox , head of the South-Central Florida Bear Project , said the bear population , in order to stay healthy , must be able to travel to different locations throughout the state . They need to travel between different bear populations .

Having the bears wear the GPS collars is `` wonderful because the bears are telling us what habitat we need to protect , '' said Tricia Martin of The Nature Conservancy . As of now , 55 black bears in the area have been fitted with collars . Watch the researchers at work ''

Researchers want to know whether the bears ' travels have them crossing a road , an orange grove , or somewhere else in order to get from place to place . Collecting data on the corridors the bears need to travel will help in pinpointing what land should be sought for conservation purposes .

But first the bears must be snared -- and that 's where the doughnuts come in .

`` The doughnuts are a good bait , they can smell and it 'll bring them in , '' said Wade Ulrey , one of the researchers with the South-Central Florida Bear Project .

Recently a young female bear was found in a snare trap -- lured there by the doughnuts , or perhaps the brownie with whipped cream and a cherry that also had been placed there .

Ulrey and fellow University of Kentucky research scientist Joe Guthrie slowly approached the trapped bear . The animal , with a cable around its paw , tried to climb a pine tree to escape . See photos of a snared bear ''

The researchers waited for the bear to calm down , then they injected her with a tranquilizer that was at the end of an 8-foot-long pole . As they waited for the drug to take effect , Ulrey and Guthrie returned to their truck to gather the tools they needed to examine the bear .

`` It 's similar to an ID system used for pets , '' said Ulrey . The chip tells the researchers that this bear was caught in 2007 , when she was a cub still roaming Florida with her mother .

This young black bear , however , wo n't be telling researchers where she will be traveling . She is too young to be outfitted with a GPS collar .

`` Usually the things you 'll see is a little bit of an abrasion where they 've rubbed some of the fur off , or maybe a cut , '' Cox said when asked about the danger of using a snare trap .

As this young cub wanders off , the research team can only hope she finds a road less traveled -- and stays off the highways .
