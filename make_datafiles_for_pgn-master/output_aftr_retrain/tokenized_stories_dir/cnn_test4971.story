WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- While a government-run public health care option irks conservatives , and even some fiscally minded Democrats , the idea of health care cooperatives has emerged as an option in the reform debate .

Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad , of North Dakota , says a public option plan might not make it through Congress .

Small health care cooperatives have worked in a couple of markets . But whether the idea can be applied on a national scale is debatable .

But Tim Jost , a professor at Washington and Lee University , said that Conrad is not offering concrete statistics on how the plan will help reform health care .

`` I have not seen anything , other than Sen. Conrad 's statements to the press , explaining how this is going to work , '' he said . `` He put out a couple of one-pagers early on , but he is talking about this actuarial data . Let 's make it public , let 's find out who the actuaries are . ''

Co-ops are nonprofit organizations that aim to provide better coverage at a lower cost for their members . They put profits back into the system , so any money that is earned is used on patients and other costs . In addition , patients elect a governing board .

In order for a co-op to have reduced costs , analysts say , it needs to have tens of thousands of members . That could be a hard slog for the nonprofits because start-up costs would probably be in the millions . That may be where the federal government steps in -- by adding seed money for the program .

`` Let 's see how they -LSB- Conrad and others -RSB- explain that they are going to get to 10 to 12 million members . ... I ca n't see how that 's going to happen , '' Jost said .

`` You have to go out there , you have to contract with hospitals , doctors , other providers of care . Well , the private insurers have their networks in place , and they often have what they call ` most favored nations ' clauses , which provide that a provider can not -LSB- offer -RSB- a lower rate than it does to the dominant insurer . ''

A top White House aide told Bloomberg Television 's `` Conversations with Judy Woodruff '' that President Obama may accept nonprofit health insurance cooperatives in place of a new government-run plan .

And the idea has gotten support from a key Republican senator .

But not everyone is so sure that co-ops will work to reduce health care costs across the board .

CNN Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , who spoke with top officials at both co-ops , said this type of model would not solve the problem of uninsured Americans .

`` Will co-ops solve that ? No . That is according to two folks who run co-ops -LSB- one in Seattle and one in Minneapolis -RSB- . ... They said ` we are not charities . You have to spend money and pay premiums to join our co-ops . And we do n't take everyone . We sometimes say no to people with pre-existing conditions , ' '' she said .

Co-ops also may not have the industry clout of the big insurance companies . Watch Obama discuss his plan for health care reform ''

`` They -LSB- co-ops -RSB- would have some cost advantages over private plans -- they would n't have to make a profit -- but they are going to be running on a very small scale , at least initially , and therefore they are going to have very high administrative costs proportionate to claims , '' Jost said .

CNN 's Dana Bash , Lesa Jansen and Chris Welch contributed to this report .
