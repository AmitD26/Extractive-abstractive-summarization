Thanks to the flu , a broken ankle , a staph infection , and bronchitis , plus several school cancellations , my three children were at home -- hurting , vomiting , coughing , or tracking muddy water into our house -- all but seven days last February . -LRB- Shall I pause to let the horror of that number sink in ? All but seven . -RRB- I 'm normally an efficient , organized person who thrives on plans and checklists , but by the end of that month , I 'd accomplished almost nothing beyond reading aloud the entire fifth book of Harry Potter . I felt so anxious that I was on the verge of hyperventilation .

Originally a form of self-defense , the ancient Chinese art of tai chi promotes serenity through gentle movement .

This ancient Chinese practice -- believed to offer all the health benefits of silent meditation while giving you something to do with your hands and feet -- seemed like an obvious place to start for an antsy , toe-tapping sort like me . The thing is , I have a poor sense of balance and tai chi often requires standing on one foot . To avoid the not-so-peaceful experience of looking like a dork in front of a group of total strangers , I opted for a DVD , with only the tiniest hope of success .

Knitting

Walking in the woods

I 'd read somewhere that exposure to nature can boost a person 's general well-being and sense of calm -- and I certainly needed a dose of that . So I headed to some nearby woods where the redbuds and crab apples were in full bloom . Birds called piercingly , squirrels quarreled , and high branches clattered together in the wind . In other words , nothing about the forest was still or quiet or remotely peaceful , but somehow it made me feel peaceful . I stopped thinking about my family and work deadlines and all that laundry . In fact , I stopped thinking altogether .

Back at my car , I checked the clock and was shocked to learn that more than an hour had passed . Now , I ca n't realistically give up an hour every day to nature . But studies have shown that even small doses of nature can be healing , so I 've tried a few smaller-scale nature interactions , as well . I started a small aquarium , planted a windowsill bean garden , and hung a bird feeder where I can see it from my desk . Health.com : Make time to play
