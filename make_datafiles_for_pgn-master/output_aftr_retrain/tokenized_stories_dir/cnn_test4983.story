-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the first anniversary of the historic 2008 election , retired Gen. Colin Powell , the first African-American secretary of state , talks one-on-one with CNN 's Don Lemon for Essence Magazine about the most pressing issues facing black men in the age of President Obama . Don Lemon : President Barack Obama issued a national call to service . Do you think African-Americans have answered that call ?

Colin Powell : I really do n't know that I know the answer to that question . I do know that in the work that I do and my wife does as the chair of America 's Promise , we are seeing more and more people step forward to try to deal with the problems that we have , to include African-Americans and Hispanics stepping forward .

But it 's not just a one-time thing . You ca n't just have , let 's have a day of service on Martin Luther King Jr. 's birthday or a day of service . We 've got to get deeply involved in working with our kids on a continuing basis and not just one day a year .

Hopefully , it 's their parents , even if it 's a single parent . ... But without that kind of family support , then we need Boys and Girls Clubs . We need Big Brothers and Big Sisters . We need mentors . Otherwise , these kids will find bad adults to copy from , and we 're going to lose them .

Lemon : I recently reported on youth violence and gangs in Chicago , Illinois . Most of the young men did n't have role models at home . Would it help if more African-American men had picked up the torch to help those young men ?

Every child has a father , and some of those fathers do n't want to live up to the responsibility of being a father . Whether it 's a father in a marriage or a father in a good home , that father is a father and owes that child financial support , owes that child companionship , owes that child an example in life .

Those of us who have been blessed with some success ... you can look back and see family members who kept you in play . If it had n't been for my relatives and my parents and my cousins and my priest and all the other people in my neighborhood , I would n't have made it . But they had a level of expectation for me .

And when they get out of high school , if we can get them into the college , you will find six girls in college for every three or four boys who are in college . And those six girls will graduate at a higher rate than the three or four boys .

This is a moral disaster for the African-American community . This is not why Rosa Parks rode in the back of the bus or why Martin Luther King Jr. and all of his colleagues marched . We did n't do it so that these kids could fail because they do n't have adults in their life , teaching them how to succeed .

Powell : The president-elect was aware of the work that Alma and I had done together on America 's Promise . As part of the transition effort , he intended to make this an important part of his administration , and he wanted to get started earlier .

The White House asked if I would work with transition officials to launch his first initiative , which was called Renew America Together .

I 'm so pleased that he has made this a major part of his administration and his agenda , because it fits right into what my wife and I have been doing for many years .

LEMON : Did you have any African-American role models ? What did they teach you ?

POWELL : They were , first and foremost , my family . When I was a young kid , born in Harlem , raised in the Bronx , it was my family that taught me how to behave , taught me what they expected of me , gave me a sense of shame and told me to `` mind . '' It 's a word that 's not used enough anymore .

I entered the Army five years after the last segregated unit was closed down . I entered in 1958 , and at that time , the Army was fully integrated , the most integrated institution in American society .

`` We do n't care where you went , and we do n't care if you 're black , white , blue . ... The only color we care about now is green . You 're in the Army . ''
