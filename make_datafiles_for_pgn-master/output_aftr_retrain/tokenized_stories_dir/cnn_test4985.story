-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's doubtful there 's ever a perfect time or place to end a marriage , but for Dean McDermott , that time and place was in a Palm Springs , California , hotel room after playing a round of golf .

Mary Jo Eustace said she 's been able to take her 2006 divorce from Dean McDermott and turn it into a positive .

Eustace replied that `` you 've known her -LSB- for -RSB- three weeks . I actually thought it was a joke . I thought I was being punked . But it was true , '' she told Behar .

When Eustace found out her 13-year marriage was ending , she said she was `` in a really ugly bikini -- missing like padding on one side , holding my daughter in my arms , '' but at least the bomb was n't dropped in front of news cameras .

Matos was standing right next to her husband when he admitted at a press conference that he 'd had an affair with another man .

Especially once the media picks up on the crumbling matrimony . `` The first week that my divorce was announced ... I saw a picture of my ex-husband with his new wife 's legs wrapped around his head , '' Eustace said . `` You 're in complete survival mode . ''

Although Lance Armstrong 's post-marriage flame , Sheryl Crow , was n't the reason his five-year marriage to Kristen ended , she told Behar it was still difficult to watch . And yet the hardest part for Kristen Armstrong was disliking her former husband 's new love .

`` I really wanted to dislike her , '' Armstrong said . `` I really did . -LSB- But -RSB- she 's beautiful . She 's smart . She 's funny . She was great with the kids . For as much as I wanted to dislike her and I tried , I could n't . ''

After McGreevey announced his affair , Matos said she found papers that appeared to be the outline for a book that said McGreevey married her `` for political gain , '' she said . `` He married me because he wanted to become governor and perhaps president . That 's very painful . ''

All of the ex-wives said they 've been able to use their divorces as a time to grow . `` You feel dehumanized , horrible , '' Eustace said of divorce .

`` With lawyers and fighting and feeling unloved and unlovable , and the media thrown into it , you really have to take care of yourself and to take care of your kids , '' she said . `` It really can be life-affirming ... a wonderful second opportunity in your life . It can be actually , I think , very positive . ''
