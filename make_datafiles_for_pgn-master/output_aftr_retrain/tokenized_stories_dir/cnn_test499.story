OK , we can admit it . Even though Kate Upton spent six days in Antarctica posing in minimal clothing in below-freezing temperatures -- which she says led to hypothermia and frostbite -- we 're jealous .

Why ? Um , because we do n't look like that in a bikini .

Upton is the first model to be picked to do back-to-back covers for Sports Illustrated 's swimsuit edition since Tyra Banks appeared for the second time in 1997 . And you only have to look at the photos to figure out why .

David Kirsch : The idea was to step up the intensity and duration of the workouts , making it a strict cardio and sculpting boot camp that entailed body weights and resistance bands , sprinting and calisthenics , shadow - and kickboxing .

At the beginning , we worked out seven days a week , twice a day . Then we brought it down to five to six days a week for one hour a day .

CNN : What was the most difficult thing for Upton ? What was the easiest ?

Kirsch : Most difficult for her was the sprinting -- getting up to a sprint was challenging . And the easiest was the boxing and kickboxing , mostly because she loved kicking my ass !

CNN : What is the biggest obstacle people face in getting to the gym ?

CNN : What is the most common mistake you see people make while working out ?

Kirsch : They do n't subscribe to my mind-body philosophy of training ; they 're not doing the correct exercise for their body type , or they 're distracted , socializing , using PDAs instead of focusing and visualizing .

CNN : Give our readers the ultimate piece of advice -- something you 've learned over the years that they might not know .

Kirsch : The mind is more powerful than any muscle in our body . With our mind focused , we can will ourselves to unbelievable greatness .
