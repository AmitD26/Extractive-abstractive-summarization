The incident occurred Friday when Muhammad Abu Tahir , a Pakistani national and lawful permanent U.S. resident of Glen Allen , Virginia , was aboard AirTran Airways Flight 39 from Atlanta , Georgia , to San Francisco , California .

During the flight , a flight attendant served Tahir , seated in coach , three airplane-serving-sized bottles of wine , then refused to serve him more , according to a two-page affidavit filed Monday by the FBI .

He appealed to the senior flight attendant , who granted him a fourth , then a fifth bottle , both of which he downed quickly , it said .

When a flight attendant knocked on the door and encouraged him to leave the bathroom so others could use it , Tahir refused `` and started yelling at the flight attendant that he was being disrespected , '' it said .

Notified of the passenger 's behavior , the captain advised the senior flight attendant to enlist the help of a passenger to stand outside the lavatory in case help was needed , it said .

By this time , a fire extinguisher had been carried to the rear of the plane for possible use against the man and a beverage cart was repositioned to contain Tahir , according to the affidavit .

While Tahir remained inside the lavatory , the pilot made an emergency landing in Colorado Springs , Colorado , where police officers took Tahir to the El Paso County Jail , where he remained Monday .

Tahir told the FBI that he felt he was being disrespected when the flight attendants denied his request for food , which was being served in business class , the affidavit said .

`` It is crucial that the flying public obey the commands of the flight crew , '' said U.S. Attorney David Gaouette .

The incident was the second in three days in which North American Aerospace Defense Command fighter jets were scrambled in response to a passenger deemed disruptive .
