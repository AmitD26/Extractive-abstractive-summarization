Joaquin `` El Chapo '' Guzman Loera , pictured in 1993 , ranks 701st on Forbes ' yearly report on billionaires .

They are all featured in Forbes magazine 's world 's billionaires report as `` self-made '' billionaires .

He ranked 701st on Forbes ' yearly report , with an estimated fortune of $ 1 billion .

Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora expressed outrage at the publication and described Forbes ' calculations on Guzman Loera 's fortune as mere `` speculation . ''

`` I will never accept that a criminal could be recognized as someone distinguished , even if it is by a magazine like Forbes , '' Medina Mora said to local media during a drug traffic summit Thursday in Vienna , Austria .

Steve Forbes , the magazine 's editor-in-chief , issued a statement on Saturday saying `` it is deplorable that someone like this has a billion dollars . '' But the magazine , he said , was simply doing its job and reporting a fact .

`` Forbes has listed other criminals from Meyer Lansky -LRB- 1982 -RRB- to Pablo Escobar -LRB- 1987-1993 -RRB- on our Rich Lists , '' Forbes said . `` Do n't shoot the messenger . ''

Its article offers a rationale as to why Guzman Loera made the list .
