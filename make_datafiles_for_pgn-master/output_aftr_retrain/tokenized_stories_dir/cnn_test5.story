The stay-at-home mother targeted maliciously by Rosen has successfully raised five boys , who all have their own families now and constructively contribute to society . This particular mother has battled cancer and multiple sclerosis .

This particular stay-at-home mom travels the country and speaks up on issues of importance to her and for her children and grandchildren 's future . This particular stay-at-home mother is also a Republican , her name is Ann Romney and her message is resonating . Therein lies the reason for Rosen 's vicious attack .

After calls for her to apologize from both the left and the right , Rosen initially refused . But she caved to the building pressure today . In her apology she said , `` Let 's declare peace in this phony war and go back to focus on the substance . ''

We could n't agree more -- so let 's look at the substance , and the facts , which is what Ann Romney and many other women have been doing all along .

Comment on Romney 's wife keeps campaign 's focus on women

As her husband moves toward locking up the Republican nomination , recent headlines have screamed that Ann Romney is the `` Romney that Democrats fear most . '' And for good reason . Pundits point out that she is passionate , attractive , charismatic and elegant -- all true -- but we would argue that what Democrats truly fear is her message and the impact it is having with women of all walks of life .

Recently , Romney made headlines when she said , `` Women care about jobs . Women care about the economy , they care about their children , they care about their debt . They 're angry , they 're furious about the entitlement debt we 're leaving our children . '' She is right .

Meanwhile , Democrats preen on about the phony `` war on women '' and are increasingly desperate to lure attention away from their disastrous policies . The women we know are smarter than this and realize this is merely a smokescreen meant to distract women voters from the true legacy of the Obama administration : failed economic policies that adversely affect women .

In her stunning comments , Rosen claims Romney `` never really dealt with the kind of economic issues that a majority of women in the country are facing . ''

Moms know how to make and maintain a budget and are left wondering why it has taken Harry Reid over 1,050 days to pass a budget in the male-dominated , Democrat-led U.S. Senate .

Moms know the crushing legacy that debt can leave and are outraged that , as of today , each of our children owes $ 50,017.33 of the national debt . This is the legacy of the Obama administration , and this is why liberals like Ms. Rosen make personal attacks on mothers like Ann Romney , rather than debate the issues most important to women .

The left 's war on moms exposes their true feelings towards women -- that we are the victims , the proverbial damsels in distress waiting for Washington to come riding in atop its white horse named bureaucracy to fix our families , prescribe our medications and send our children the bill .
