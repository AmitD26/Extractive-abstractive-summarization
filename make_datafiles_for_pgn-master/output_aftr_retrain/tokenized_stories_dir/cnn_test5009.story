Today , we 're immersed in the afterglow of a remarkable seven-day collegiate football hiring span . From Dec. 7 through 13 , three new head football coaches of color were appointed on the BCS -LRB- Bowl Championship Series -RRB- level : Turner Gill -LRB- Kansas -RRB- , Charlie Strong -LRB- Louisville -RRB- and Mike London -LRB- Virginia -RRB- .

The earlier November selections of Larry Porter -LRB- Memphis -RRB- and Willie Taggart -LRB- Western Kentucky -RRB- elevated the number to five in the current 2009 FBS hiring cycle . We have 13 -LRB- 11 African-American -RRB- head football coaches of color among the 120 FBS -LRB- Football Bowl Subdivision/IA -RRB- schools . We are experiencing a watershed of success after a sordid history of disappointments .

BCA report cards revealed increases in the number of people of color brought in for official interviews , but , in reality , the hiring remained abysmal by any acceptable standard .

Anyone desiring to become a head football coach on the FBS level had a lesser chance statistically than those seeking to become head coach in the NFL or in NCAA basketball or even a general in the U.S. Army . At the minimum , the number of minority head football coaches should be closer to 20 percent of the opportunities . My statement to college presidents , which accompanied the release of our most recent hiring report , called for the administrators to `` stand up for justice and not block its path . ''

I believe the BCA has played a significant role in the exposure of the collegiate football hiring issue dating back to the late 1980s . The production of the annual hiring report card and distribution of capable candidate lists has brought awareness , knowledge and accountability to the search and hire process .

Dr. Richard Lapchick -LRB- DeVos Sports Business Program -RRB- has produced multiple reports and studies pertaining to the diversity and inclusiveness of all of collegiate sports and , specifically to football . His call for an `` Eddie Robinson '' rule on the collegiate level , similar to the National Football League 's Rooney rule , is heard . The Rooney rule requires that at least one minority candidate be interviewed when a new head coach is appointed .

The strong voice of retired NFL head football coach Tony Dungy is being heard . When Tony speaks , the people listen . He has the resume and the platform to state the case for the equitable hiring issue . His expertise and credibility is unquestioned .

Winning is always important . Coaches of color are experiencing success . For the first time in history , three current coaches of color will take FBS teams to a bowl game : Randy Shannon -LRB- Miami/Champs Sports Bowl -RRB- , Ken Niumatalolo -LRB- Navy/Texas Bowl -RRB- and Kevin Sumlin -LRB- Houston/Armed Forces Bowl -RRB- .

Two of the past three Super Bowl champions have been coached by African-Americans African-Americans -LRB- Dungy and Tomlin -RRB- . The current success of the Indianapolis Colts with Jim Caldwell as head coach is further testament .

The recent passage of the state of Oregon 's House Bill 3118 was very significant . Initially , this bill was spearheaded by the concerns of a private citizen , Sam Sachs , to the Oregon legislature . Oregon has adopted legislation similar to the NFL 's Rooney Rule for all state colleges as a guideline for hiring in athletics . It appears that up to eight additional states will strongly consider similar legislation .

Finally , nothing is more significant than the positive effect of seeing the highest office in our country and , for that matter , the entire world occupied by an African-American . President Obama 's position and success as a national and world leader speaks volumes .

Most of the messages from my office have criticized a process that has progressed slowly , if not begrudgingly , toward equity . Today , I can honestly say our college presidents and athletics directors are standing up for justice and not blocking its path . It 's important that we be able to continue to make this statement on a regular basis .
