A Swedish appeals court on Thursday denied WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange 's latest request to dismiss an arrest warrant for alleged rape and molestation -- cases that he says are false and politically motivated .

Assange , 43 , has been living in London 's Ecuadorian Embassy for more than two years to avoid extradition to Sweden , where prosecutors want to question him about 2010 allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another .

The Australia native has argued the warrant should be dismissed because , in part , Swedish authorities refuse to interview him at the Ecuadorian Embassy , thereby prolonging a preliminary investigation that he says should have concluded long ago .

The appellate court nodded to this argument , agreeing that `` the failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation ... to move the preliminary investigation forward . ''

Another appeal expected

`` The court of appeals admits the prosecutor has wrongly failed to move this case forward , but refuses to provide Assange with any remedy . It is astonishing , '' Ratner said in a news release .

Swedish prosecutors say that Assange must be interviewed in Sweden , citing what they say are legal impediments to coercing an interview elsewhere .

Assange rocketed to international fame when WikiLeaks began publishing secret government documents online .

In August 2010 , Swedish prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Assange over the allegations of sexual assault from two female WikiLeaks volunteers .

He turned himself in to London authorities the same year , and was remanded in custody .

At the time , a judge ruled that he should be extradited to Sweden , and Assange launched a series of appeals that went all the way to the British Supreme Court . It denied his appeal .

In June 2012 , Assange fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy to seek asylum , which was granted in August of the same year .

He 's been living at the embassy in London since then .
