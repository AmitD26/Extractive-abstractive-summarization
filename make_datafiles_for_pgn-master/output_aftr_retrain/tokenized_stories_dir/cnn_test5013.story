-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for a trio of bombings that killed at least 74 people Sunday at two venues in the Ugandan capital , Kampala , where crowds had gathered to watch the World Cup final .

`` And the best of men have promised and they have delivered , '' said an Arabic statement issued by Al-Shabaab 's press office and obtained by CNN . `` Blessed and exalted among men -- -LRB- taking -RRB- full responsibility . ... We wage war against the 6,000 collaborators ; they have received their response . ''

The 6,000 is an apparent reference to African Union peacekeepers in Somalia . Uganda contributes troops to the peacekeeping effort .

`` We are behind the attack because we are at war with them , '' Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu , Somalia .

`` We had given warning to the Ugandans to refrain from their involvement in our country . We spoke to the leaders and we spoke to the people and they never listened to us . ''

However , Police Chief Maj. Gen. Kale Kayihura told reporters arrests have been made in connection with the bombings . He would not say how many people have been arrested or provide details .

Earlier Monday , Sheikh Abu Al Zubeir , identified as `` the emir of Al-Shabaab in Somalia , '' said in an Arabic website posting , `` My message to the Ugandan and Burundian nations is that you will be the target for our retribution to the massacres perpetrated against the Somali men , women and children in Mogadishu by your forces . '' The statement was posted on an al Qaeda affiliated website that previously has carried statements and videos from Al-Shabaab .

The website set up a page Monday to `` receive congratulations '' on Al-Shabaab 's behalf for the `` blessed operations '' in Uganda .

Suspicion had centered on Somali Islamist groups shortly after the explosions in Kampala . Islamic militants battling Somalia 's U.N.-backed transitional government had previously threatened attacks on Uganda and Burundi .

The U.N. Security Council said of the attacks in a statement Monday :

The U.S. Embassy confirmed the death of one American . An organization that works with children in Uganda identified him as Nate Henn .

`` Nate was not a glory-seeker and never sought the spotlight . He asked not to be made a hero of , '' the post said . `` But the life he lived inspires reflection and imitation . ''

U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said five other Americans were hospitalized , and that two of them `` have serious injuries requiring significant medical attention . '' The State Department is assisting in their medical evacuation , he said .

He added the State Department has no reason to doubt Al-Shabaab 's claim of responsibility , saying the `` evidence so far at the attack scene would suggest an Al-Shabaab connection . ''

In a government statement , Somali President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said he `` condemns in the strongest terms the despicable terrorist acts that killed over 60 people in Kampala . ''

`` The fact that the victims were enjoying the World Cup reveals the evil and ugly nature of the perpetrators and the need to uproot from -LSB- the -RSB- region those who do not value the sanctity of human life , '' the statement said .

Stone Atwine was watching the game at the rugby center when the blast occurred .

`` It happened toward the 90th minute of the game ... this loud explosion , '' he said . `` We did n't know what was happening , we were running around , scampering for safety . I saw dead guys still seated in their chairs with blood . ''

Relatives flocked to hospitals and mortuaries to look for loved ones Monday .

In the capital , crowds huddled around newspapers , talking in hushed tones .

`` Everyone is shocked , everyone is talking about it , '' said Mark Keith Muhumuza , who was watching the game at a stadium near the rubgy center explosion . `` We were in panic mode at the stadium because we thought we would be attacked next . ''

Muhumuza said when the game ended , he went to the rugby center . `` People were wailing , some were trying to find their relatives , others were trying to run away from the scene . ''

`` I deplore what has happened and look forward to the good that football can bring to our world . ''

The sites of the bombings remained cordoned off as authorities intensified security in the east African nation . Police and military forces patrolled the capital .

Some of the injured at the restaurant included six members of an American church mission working with a local congregation , according to the Rev. Kathleen Kind , pastor of Christ Community United Methodist Church in Selinsgrove , Pennsylvania .

All the church members were accounted for and families had been contacted , Kind said . Their injuries ranged from broken bones and flesh wounds to temporary blindness and hearing problems , she said .

Kayihura said the bombings could have been avoided if the two venues had used security measures such as metal detectors and guards .

The African Union summit is scheduled to be held in Kampala next week .
