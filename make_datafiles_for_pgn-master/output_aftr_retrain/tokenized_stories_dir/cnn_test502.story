Fifty people have been arrested in connection with this week 's killing of a Christian couple who were beaten and pushed into a burning kiln in eastern Pakistan , a police official said Thursday .

Investigators believe the 50 were part of a mob that killed the couple Tuesday after the pair were accused of desecrating the Quran , said Bin Yameen , a police official in the Kasur District in Punjab province .

The mob allegedly marched to the couple 's home , broke down their door , dragged them outside , beat them and threw them into the brick kiln where they both worked .

Police officials identified the woman as Shyman Bibi Urf Shamar , and her husband as Sajjad Nasir Zurjah Nazir Nasir . The village is about 60 kilometers -LRB- 37 miles -RRB- southwest of Lahore , the capital of Punjab .

The province 's government will pay the couple 's family 5 million Pakistani rupees -- about $ 49,000 -- as compensation for their deaths , the province 's chief minister , Shahbaz Sharif , said in a news release .

The government also will give the family 10 acres of land , Sharif said .

But a postmortem examination later revealed no evidence that she was pregnant , CNN affiliate GEO News reported .

Pakistan 's anti-blasphemy law often is used to settle personal vendettas , rights groups say , and people accused of the committing the crime are frequently targeted by mob violence .

An accusation that the couple had desecrated the Quran `` was spread to nearby villages and announcements -LRB- were -RRB- made through mosque loudspeakers , '' the HRCP said .

The HRCP said its team learned that four policemen went to the kiln to demand that the couple be handed over for protection from the mob , but that the owners `` instructed their employees not to hand the couple over and the policemen were also beaten up . ''

The kiln 's owners were among those arrested , the rights group said , quoting police .
