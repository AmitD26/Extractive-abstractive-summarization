It 's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it covers a vast area of hundreds , maybe even thousands , of miles of open ocean .

A crew of scientists from the University of California 's Scripps Institution of Oceanography has embarked on a three-week mission aboard the research vessel New Horizon , heading for the debris field to study it .

The mission is not as straightforward as it sounds . `` There may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you 'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon , '' said Robert Knox , deputy director for research at the Scripps Institution .

There has been some previous research on this garbage field , but not much . It 's been very poorly studied in a scientific sense . Major questions remain :

How how much stuff is there ? What size is the stuff ? Where is it distributed in the ocean , at the surface or at what depth ? What does it do to the food chain , especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain ?

While the main focus of the Scripps mission is the impact of this plastic trash on marine life , researchers will gather information on a wide variety of issues .

Here 's what scientists do know : They know the size of this zone is huge , maybe as big as Texas . And they know that all the plastic accumulated in the patch has mostly broken down into smaller bits , floating just under the water 's surface like confetti , basically a soupy mix of plastic-filled seawater that stretches for maybe thousands of miles .

They know the garbage patch has been growing for many years , and scientists first became aware of the problem years ago when fisherman reported encountering widespread debris . They know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world , but this one is the biggest .

But the plastic is really the toxic killer . While it slowly degrades , it turns into increasingly smaller bits of plastic . Seabirds mistake it for food and they dive down and eat it .

As the larger animals and marine life eat the smaller animals , this plastic eventually ends up in the human food supply , too .

But even the size is of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is uncertain .

NOAA has tracked the Great Pacific Garbage Patch movement to some degree . Scientists know it moves as much as a thousand miles north and south in the Pacific seasonally . And during warmer ocean periods , known as El Nino , it drifts even further south .

A kind of large , clock-wise circulation of currents driven by the wind around the Pacific ocean basin causes the plastic and other garbage to mix together in convergence zones , forming this giant trash zone and making its movements comparable to a whirlpool .
