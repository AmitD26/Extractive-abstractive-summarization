Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- HBO 's `` True Blood '' is already in its third season and it is one of the most watched shows on cable . The last show on HBO to garner as large an audience was `` The Sopranos . ''

The show has tons of fan sites and more `` True Blood '' fanatics worldwide than you can shake a stake at .

But if you think it 's just like the TV show , think again .

CNN recently spoke with Ball about the comic book , the show and what 's next for `` True Blood . ''

CNN : So we are going into the third season of `` True Blood . ''

CNN : Was it hard to create this comic book series ? ... The TV show is based on a book , so are you paralleling the comic book to the actual show ?

Ball : Well it was a little difficult for me because comics are such a distinct medium in which I have never worked . So I had to learn a little bit about the medium and what it was all about .

What we decided to do was to take the characters of the show and put them in a story that 's independent of the show itself , but is very true to the mythology of the show . It 's not something that is dependent on the show or the show is dependent on it , which makes a lot of sense .

CNN : The creatures are very interesting in the comic book series .

CNN : How hard was it to develop the picture for that ?

Ball : It 's true , they are very hardcore .

CNN : Putting a comic book together , are you looking at some of those fan sites to see what people want or what they 're saying at all ? Are you influenced by that ?

Ball : I 'm not . I personally do not go to those sites . I do n't read what people post .

And obviously I spend so many hours per day working on `` True Blood '' that in my free time the last thing I want to do is have more `` True Blood '' -- you know what I mean ? I tend to read or play with my dogs or go in the canyon or something like that , because I do n't want to go crazy . I want to maintain some reality .

Ball : A lot of us are going to be there -- a lot of the cast . I know that Anna and Stephen and Ryan and Sam and Rutina and Nelson and Deborah will be there . I think Joe is going to be there . I do n't think Alexander Skarsgard is going to be there because he 's going to be shooting a movie . I 'm assuming it 'll be pretty much the same group , and we have a big panel discussion . We 're going to sign autographs and just sort of partake in the wackiness that is Comic-Con . It 's really fun .

Ball : We 're going to do six issues this year . I think there will be a new one every month . And then once all six issues are published , they will be bound in a special collector 's anthology edition . And I 'm assuming we 'll do it again next year if it works out well .

CNN : So where do you hope to rank in the world of comic books ?

To use a `` True Blood '' term , I 'm such a newbie to the world of comics that I 'm not really sure .

I know the comic book is really good . It 's a really fun story . It 's really entertaining . It 's all the characters that you know and love in a new situation fighting a new adversary . You also get some very interesting back story on all the characters , which is very true to who they are . I 'm very pleased with it .

CNN : Since it 's independent of the actual show , will you have new characters being introduced into future issues of the comic book series ?

CNN : Okay so give us a sneak peak of upcoming episodes on season three .

Ball : Very soon you 're going to find out something that is very important from Eric 's past and that is going to motivate him and has been motivating him for years . That is a little bit of a big shocker .
