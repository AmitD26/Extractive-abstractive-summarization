The ruling may delay Brown 's execution that was scheduled for Thursday . Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for raping and murdering a high school student .

The federal appeals court said a U.S. District Court made a mistake when it recently said that Brown should choose between a one-drug or a three-drug option for his lethal injection .

`` The district court 's decision to provide Brown the choice of a one drug option is not consistent with California state law and procedures , '' the court ruling said . `` California law does not provide the condemned a choice between a three-drug protocol or a one-drug option . ''

The ruling was not meant to decide Brown 's guilt or innocence , but only was considering the `` narrow issue of the manner and timing of Brown 's execution in a fashion that comports with the Eighth Amendment 's protection against cruel and unusual punishment , '' the federal appeals court said .

Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of Susan Jordan , who was walking to Arlington High School in Riverside when Brown pulled her into an orange grove , according to court documents .

He raped and strangled her with her own shoelace and took her school identification cards and books .

Later that evening , Brown looked up her family in the phone book and called their home , the documents state .

During the penalty phase of Brown 's trial , his lawyer claimed his client was remorseful and presented psychiatric evidence suggesting that Brown had emotional problems , including sexual maladjustment and dysfunction .

The jury deliberated for three hours before returning a death verdict , according to an opinion issued September 19 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals .

CNN 's Bill Mears , Augie Martin and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report .
