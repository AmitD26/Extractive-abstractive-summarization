Hank Williams Jr. apologized Tuesday for comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler , a remark that prompted controversy and resulted in `` Monday Night Football '' pulling his popular musical introduction from this week 's game .

On Tuesday , the country singer stated : `` I have always been very passionate about politics and sports and this time it got the best or worst of me .

Williams made the comparison on Fox News this week when he was asked about Obama and House Speaker John Boehner , a Republican , playing on the same team in a June golf game .

Earlier Tuesday , the Anti-Defamation League condemned Williams ' comments and praised ESPN for pulling his `` Are You Ready for Some Football ? '' musical recording that opens `` Monday Night Football . ''

`` Hank Williams Jr. should know better . He owes an apology to Holocaust survivors , their families , and the brave American soldiers who gave of themselves to fight the Nazi menace during World War II . The last thing we need is to enter another election cycle on a sour note tainted with inappropriate , tired and over-the-top analogies to the Nazis , '' he said .

On Tuesday , ESPN said it had made no decision on Williams ' future beyond the Monday night telecast , according to Bill Hofheimer , senior director of communications at ESPN .

Williams has criticized Obama in the past , when the Democrat was running for the presidency . In 2008 , Williams was even mentioned in some media outlets as saying he was considering running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican in the next election cycle , but those plans never materialized .

Williams , who supported the Republican ticket in 2008 and even penned a song called `` McCain-Palin Tradition , '' said during that campaign that candidate Obama did n't like the national anthem .

The `` McCain-Palin Tradition '' song , which is a riff on the Williams tune `` Family Tradition , '' included a line suggesting that Obama has `` terrorist friends . ''

In an appearance on Fox News ' `` Fox and Friends '' on Monday morning , Williams referred to a June golf game with Obama and House Speaker John Boehner on the same team , against Vice President Joe Biden and Ohio Gov. John Kasich , as `` one of the biggest political mistakes ever . ''

Asked what he did n't like about it , Williams said , `` Come on , come on . That 'd be like Hitler playing golf with -LRB- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin -RRB- Netanyahu . OK . Not hardly . ''

Thompson , an actor and ABC Radio Network commentator , was a Republican senator from Tennessee and one-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination .

In a statement Monday , ESPN said that while Williams `` is not an ESPN employee , we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to ` Monday Night Football . ' We are extremely disappointed with his comments and as a result we have decided to pull the open from tonight 's telecast . ''

In a statement issued through a representative , Williams , son of legendary country singer Hank Williams , acknowledged his analogy was `` extreme -- but it was to make a point . ''

Still , he noted , `` Every time the media brings up the tea party , it 's painted as racist and extremists -- but there 's never a backlash , no outrage to those comparisons . ... Working-class people are hurting -- and it does n't seem like anybody cares . When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job -- it makes a whole lot of us angry . Something has to change . The policies have to change . ''
