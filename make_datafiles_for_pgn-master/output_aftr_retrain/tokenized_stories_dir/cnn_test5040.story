HARARE , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A magistrate in Zimbabwe ruled Friday that Tendai Biti , the secretary-general of the opposition party , must face trial on charges that include treason .

Magistrate Mishrod Guvamombe said the state had enough evidence to disclose an offense against Biti , a high-ranking member of the Movement for Democratic Change -LRB- MDC -RRB- .

`` After a careful perusal of the submissions by both the state and defense , there is a reasonable suspicion that the accused -LSB- Biti -RSB- committed the offense , '' Guvamombe said to a full courtroom .

Biti 's defense team has requested he be granted bail while he awaits trial . Acting Attorney General Bharat Patel was expected to decide on the request later Friday .

Biti faces four charges including treason , which carries the death penalty . The treason charge , which the MDC said was `` trumped-up , '' stems from a document titled `` The Transitional Strategy '' that Biti is said to have written ahead of the March 29 election between President Robert Mugabe and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai .

Biti denies he wrote the document and his lawyers have described it as `` doctored . ''

From the same document stem two other charges of causing dissatisfaction among the army and bringing the office of the president into disrepute .

The fourth charge Biti faces is communicating falsehoods prejudicial to the state by allegedly announcing that Tsvangirai had won the March presidential election by an outright majority . Results announced by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission five weeks later indicated that while Tsvangirai had beaten Mugabe , he had failed to garner a majority . Watch Mugabe say he 'll fight to keep is party in power ''

Biti denies all the charges , which the MDC calls `` maliciously politically motivated . '' The party called for Biti 's immediate release .

`` The regime wants to frustrate both the internal cohesion of the MDC and its election campaign , '' the party said in a statement Friday . `` The regime knows fully well that its time is up and is trying to postpone the inevitable -- its departure .

`` Mugabe is increasing violence against -LSB- the -RSB- opposition , '' Rice said at the UN . `` President Mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of Africa . ''
