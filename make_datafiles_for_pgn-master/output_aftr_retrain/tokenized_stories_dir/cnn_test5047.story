New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police say human remains found on a New York beach are not those of a missing woman whose search led authorities to the discovery of four dead prostitutes .

It is not clear to whom the remains belong .

Police say they are `` continuing the investigation of the remains found on March 29 as well as the investigation of the deaths of four women found off Ocean Parkway in December 2010 . ''

The four bodies were discovered on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach , `` which indicates they were dumped there by the same person or persons , '' Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said in December . `` It 's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location . ''

`` There may be clues available now with this body that will help the homicide investigation and will help it move forward , '' he added .

All four of the women advertised for prostitution services on the Craigslist website , police said .

At least one body could have been there for as long as two years , Dormer added .
