-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- AC Milan took a giant step toward wresting the Italian Serie A title off Internazionale after Alexandre Pato scored twice in Saturday 's 3-0 derby victory at the San Siro , which ended with both teams reduced to 10 men .

Inter 's reign stretches back to the 2005-06 season , but the second-placed Nerazzurri -- coached by former Milan boss Leonardo -- now trail the Rossoneri by five points with seven games to play .

And the 21-year-old gave Milan -- whose last league crown came in 2004 -- the lead after only 44 seconds .

He played a one-two with Gennaro Gattuso on the edge of the Inter area but the veteran midfielder 's attempted return pass went into the path of the onrushing Robinho , and Pato pounced on the loose ball to beat compatriot goalkeeper Julio Cesar .

His team 's hopes of gaining parity suffered a huge blow nine minutes after the interval when last man Christian Chivu was sent off for clipping the heels of Pato as the forward burst towards Cesar 's goal .

Pato , playing in his first Milan derby , doubled the lead in the 62nd minute when he headed home from Ignazio Abate 's mishit shot after the right-back was put in space by Clarence Seedorf .

But another goal inevitably came , with substitute Antonio Cassano scoring from the penalty spot after being dragged down by Javier Zanetti -- his third since joining from Sampdoria in the January transfer window .

But the former Italy forward ruined his own night by getting booked twice within a minute -- the first for taking his shirt off to celebrate his goal and the second for a poorly-timed tackle on substitute Ivan Cordoba .

In Saturday 's other match , Brescia moved out of the relegation zone on goal difference above Cesena with a 3-1 win at home to 10th-placed Bologna .
