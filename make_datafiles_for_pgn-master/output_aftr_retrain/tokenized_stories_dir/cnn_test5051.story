The 22 letters and a printed telegram are being auctioned by Christie 's , which estimates the value between $ 25,000 and $ 35,000 . The auction house describes the writings as `` the earliest Jackie Kennedy letters , '' displaying `` a funny , spirited , at times cynical young woman , but one with great intelligence and a strong will of her own . ''

`` I do love you though -- and can love you without kissing you every time I see you and I hope you understand that , '' she declares .

Then , on January 20 , 1947 , she writes to him about her definition of true love .

`` What I hope for you , '' she writes Corbin , `` is for the same thing to happen as quickly and as surely as it did with me . It will when you least expect it . ''

But that ill-fated engagement to Husted lasted only a few months in 1951 , according to Christie 's .

Corbin died in 2004 at age 79 , according to the Social Security Death Index .

The 75 pages of letters were written between 1945 and 1951 on personal stationery and the letterhead of Miss Porter 's School , but in the letters , Onassis calls Porter 's finishing school `` prison . ''

`` If school days are the happiest of your life , I 'm hanging myself with my skip-rope tonight , '' the teenage Onassis writes to her boyfriend .

In another letter , she pens of an upcoming Christmas break , when `` I can commute happily back and forth between my doting parents until they both get sick of me . ''

The finishing school was in Farmington , Connecticut , a town where Corbin had resided at one time , a Christie 's spokeswoman said .

Onassis displays a mischievous side in a February 12 , 1947 , letter in which she tells Corbin to smuggle in cigarettes , chocolate `` and a hip flask to shock Mrs. J. ''

Many of the letters begin with `` Dearest Bev '' or `` Buddy darling , '' and one envelope , sent via `` air mail '' with three 3-cent stamps , is addressed to `` Mr. R. Beverley Corbin Jr. '' of `` The Owl Club '' at Harvard University .
