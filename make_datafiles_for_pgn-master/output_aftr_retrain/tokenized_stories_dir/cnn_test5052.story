Defying conventional wisdom on a healthy lifestyle , she somehow found the secret to longevity .

Wild pandas live 15 years on average , while those in captivity can live much longer thanks to improved nutrition and medical care , according to WWF , the nature conservation organization whose logo famously features a giant panda .

At least two pandas had lived longer than Ming Ming , state media has reported . Tao Tao died in 2008 at the age of 36 and Chang Chang passed away in 2002 at the age of 35 .

`` The longevity of those pandas does n't have too much to do with our conservation effort , '' said Professor Fan Zhiyong , head of the species program at WWF 's Beijing office .

`` In captivity pandas do n't have to worry about food sources , infectious diseases and competition from other species -- all of which remain challenges to their survival in the wild . ''

While both Tao Tao and Chang Chang spent most of their lives in a zoo in eastern China , Ming Ming 's life journey spanned half the globe . Her longevity had surpassed most people 's expectations .

Some 300 pandas live in captivity in China , mostly in breeding programs aimed at boosting the low population caused by disappearing natural habitats and low fertility rate . Fewer than a dozen zoos outside China have pandas .

`` Ming Ming had always been weak ever since she was rescued , '' said Huang Zhi , one of her caretakers at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong , also in Sichuan , where she grew up .

She moved one last time in 1998 to a safari park in the southern Guangdong province , where old age eventually caused multiple health problems .

`` Her eyesight was deteriorating -- and she moved very slowly and ate very little , '' he recalled . `` I felt she was very old . ''
