Boston -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What scientists say is the largest concentration of endangered right whales ever spotted in one location is giving researchers an unusually rich opportunity to study the animals and their feeding habits .

But the gathering , an annual affair in the chilly spring waters off Cape Cod Bay in Massachusetts , also raises the threat of boats striking the 70-ton mammals , according to the state Division of Marine Fisheries . The agency has posted an advisory to boaters urging them to be on the lookout for the whales and steer clear .

In fact , the last known fatal strike on a whale in the area happened in 1999 , he said .

State and federal law makes it a crime to close within 500 yards of a right whale , according to the state Marine Fisheries Division .

Seeing so many right whales in the same place is encouraging for researchers , even though they are well aware that the species is on the road to recovery after dipping in the early 1900s to as few as a handful of breeding females and male suitors .

It 's also a spectacle for the public , Mayo said . The whales feed on the surface and can be seen from shore , he said .

`` Anytime you see a whale from the beach that 's actually alive , it 's pretty exciting , '' he said .

The whales should begin trickling out of the bay sometime in the next few days heading for deeper waters offshore , Mayo said .
