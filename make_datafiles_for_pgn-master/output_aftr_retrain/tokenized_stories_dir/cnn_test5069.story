-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seventeen years after the release of her breakthrough album , `` My Life , '' Mary J. Blige offers up a sequel -- `` My Life II : ... The Journey Continues -LRB- Act 1 -RRB- . ''

`` The first ` My Life ' album was about healing and helping people get through things , '' the singer told CNN . `` Now there 's recession , there 's war and there 's people really not feeling good about life anymore . So it 's time , because people need to feel the hug that comes through music . ''

In the mid-90s , Blige herself was in a troubled place , spiraling downward with drugs , alcohol and a tumultuous relationship with K-Ci Hailey of the R&B duo K-Ci & JoJo .

`` I just knew by maybe 1997 , I would be dead or just finished . That 's where we were at the time . We were very suicidal , very dark , '' she recalled .

Blige admits she reached out to fans for support , because she did n't know where else to turn .

`` I spoke up through my lyrics that I needed help , and the spirit that came behind it was that I was sad , you know , '' she said . `` I needed help . Four million people responded to that album , saying , ` Mary , wow . Me , too . ' ''

`` My Life II '' finds the New York native in a very different place .

CNN : A lot has changed in the 17 years between `` My Life '' and `` My Life II . '' What precipitated that change ?

Mary J. Blige : That 's an interesting question . I come from pain . I come from poverty . I come from embarrassment , and my mom struggling , and having two jobs and leaving us with the baby sitter -- and coming back and we 're outside the baby sitter 's house . I 've come back from abuse from people . I really wanted out .

It started snowballing into this thing that was hurting me , and I was in the public eye . I got to a place where I understood that I needed help , and that was during the `` No More Drama '' album -LRB- released in 2001 -RRB- when I met my husband -- who was my boyfriend at the time . And who knew that he was going to have the information that he had for me , and that I was going to be able to receive it ?

Blige : Why ca n't Lindsay and so many other people get it together ? I mean , everyone is afraid of the pain . That is a painful walk . Embarrassment is painful . It brings a tear to your eye when you have to walk down the red carpet with so much shame in you , and so you would rather paint something on . But in my case , I never cared about being embarrassed or ashamed to ask for help . I was just ashamed of being ashamed . I was just tired of feeling that way .

CNN : It sounds like it took you a while to get to that place where you said , `` I 'm deserving of all this success . ''

CNN : Let 's talk about `` Rock of Ages . ''

Blige : I play a gentleman 's club owner . I mean , you know ...

Blige : I definitely had a scene with Tom Cruise , and he is just so helpful and so much fun . Everyone was just -- how can I say it ? Everyone in that star-studded cast , they were just as star-struck to meet me as I was to meet them . And when I met Catherine Zeta-Jones , she was like , `` I love you ! '' And I was like , `` What ? I love YOU ! '' And Russell Brand is just amazing . And Julianne Hough is my friend , and Adam Shankman -LRB- the director -RRB- is one of my really good friends . So we were like family -- no joke .

CNN : You seem to be in a really good place , and that 's reflected on `` My Life II . ''

Blige : Yeah , I am . The place I 'm in with `` My Life II '' is understanding that there WILL be trials . Trials will come . It is not going to be , `` Oh , everything is wonderful all of the time , '' because it is not . And the balance is you either know how to get around it , or you just have to go through it . That 's life .
