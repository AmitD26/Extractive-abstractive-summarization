Knowing your arguments and facts is one way to gain credibility . Mitt Romney fattened his credibility bank account at the expense of Rick Perry , who supported a no fly zone over Syria . Romney argued that a no fly zone over Syria would be pointless since the Syrian government has 5,000 tanks . Romney jokingly said it would make more sense to impose a `` no drive zone . ''

Jon Huntsman made a similar deposit when he stated that sanctions on Iran would not work since `` the Chinese are n't going to play ball and the Russians are n't going to play ball , '' and Iran has already decided to go nuclear . Huntsman 's cited the examples of Libya -LRB- which gave up its nuclear ambition , and later the government was overthrown with the help of the United States -RRB- and North Korea -LRB- which has tested nuclear weapons and whose government is still in power . -RRB-

Another way to maintain credibility is to cite proof for your arguments . Michele Bachmann has said things in previous debates -LRB- President Obama wants Medicare to collapse -RRB- and in last night 's debate -LRB- suggesting that the CIA can not interrogate terrorist suspects any longer because the ACLU is in charge -RRB- that were not very credible . These frequent ATM withdrawals hurt Bachmann because a lack of believability spills over .

Her disagreement with Rick Perry about whether to give aid to Pakistan should have been an excellent point for her . She showcased her knowledge of the subject , saying that we exchange intelligence information and the United States must have our interest represented . Bachmann called Pakistan `` too nuclear to fail , '' and chastised Perry for being naÃ ¯ ve when he said he would not give Pakistan one penny until it proved it had America 's best interests in mind .

This was a terrific answer that warranted applause because it was thoughtful , logical and well reasoned . What did she get ? Crickets . Why ? Because her believability bank is in the red .

Paul 's argument was factually accurate , even if unpopular with many conservatives . But then Paul writes an overdraft with moderate Republicans by saying things like aid to Africa for malaria or AIDS prevention is `` all worthless . '' Paul hit the daily double . Unpopular answer ? Check . Wrong on facts ? Check . There are countless examples of disease prevention aid being effective . Could aid be more effective ? Sure . But that was not Paul 's answer . He simply asserted that aid is worthless , but he had no proof .

Actually , he originally answered a question about terrorist profiling with his support of `` targeted identification . '' But when asked a follow-up not 20 seconds later , he retreated by saying he would `` ask the professionals . ''

Nothing hurts your credibility worse than flip-flopping on the same question and diving into a non-answer . Cain 's bank account is probably under a thousand dollars . But that still leaves him 999 .

Finally , to save credibility , you should be prepared to defend your position when giving a potentially unpopular answer . Newt Gingrich had two answers that the conservative wing of his party might not like , but he defended them well . Gingrich said it was possible to cut some of the military because , `` If it takes 15 to 20 years to build a weapons system when Apple changes technology every nine months , there 's something profoundly wrong with the system .
