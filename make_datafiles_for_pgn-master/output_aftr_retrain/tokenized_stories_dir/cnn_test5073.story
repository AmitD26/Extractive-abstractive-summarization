-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Another University of California official expressed dismay about the recent use of pepper spray by police on Occupy Davis protesters .

`` We regents share your passion and your conviction for the University of California , '' Lansing said in a video statement released Monday . `` And we want all of you to know we fully and unequivocally support your right to protest peacefully . ''

`` I am here to apologize , '' were the first words Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi said through a microphone after climbing onto a small stage erected on the university 's `` quad '' for Occupy supporters . `` I really feel horrible for what happened on Friday . ''

Video of police pepper-spraying nonviolent demonstrators at a sitting protest Friday on the UC Davis campus has sparked widespread criticism , including calls for Katehi 's resignation .

A group of about a dozen protesters sat on a path with their arms interlocked as police moved in to clear out a protest encampment affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement Friday . Most of the protesters had their heads down as a campus police officer walked down the line , spraying them in their faces in a sweeping motion .

The school said 10 protesters arrested were given misdemeanor citations for unlawful assembly and failure to disperse . Eleven were treated for the effects of pepper spray , which burns the eyes and nose , causing coughing , gagging and shortness of breath .

It called for greater attention to cuts in state funding to education and rising tuition . Its board demanded Katehi resign , saying she exhibited `` gross failure of leadership . ''

On Saturday , Katehi called the officers ' actions `` chilling '' and said the video `` raises many questions about how best to handle situations like this . '' But she refused calls from faculty members and others for her to step down , saying she did not violate campus policies .
