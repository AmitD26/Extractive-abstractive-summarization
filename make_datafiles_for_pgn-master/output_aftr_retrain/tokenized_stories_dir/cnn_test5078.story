Although he did not fire the fatal shot , 29-year-old Dustin Louis Stewart is charged with first-degree felony murder in the incident because if someone dies during the commission of certain crimes , such as burglary , an alleged accomplice can be charged in the death , prosecutors have said .

A hearing for Stewart was held Thursday in the central Oklahoma city of Chickasha , five days after the incident . During that hearing , Stewart posted the $ 50,000 bond and was released , Grady County court clerk Jessica Pickle told CNN .

Prosecutors recommended that $ 50,000 be set as the bail amount , according to a court document . Stewart was ordered not to have any contact with the alleged victim -- in this case , Sarah Dawn McKinley , who fired the fatal shot -- and to appear next in court the morning of January 20 .

A preliminary hearing in the case is set for May 23 , the document signed by Stewart states .

The incident has caught the nation 's attention because part of the action was captured during a 911 conversation .

McKinley , who had been widowed less than a week before , placed a couch in front of one door and went to the bedroom and put a bottle in her baby 's mouth before calling 911 , she said on HLN 's `` Dr. Drew '' on Wednesday .

`` I 've got two guns in my hand . Is it OK to shoot him if he comes in this door ? '' asked McKinley , 18 .

`` Well , you have to do whatever you can do to protect yourself , '' dispatcher Diane Graham responded . `` I ca n't tell you that you can do that , but you do what you have to do to protect your baby . ''

In the end , McKinley fired a 12-gauge shotgun and killed Justin Shane Martin after he entered her home , according to a Blanchard Police Department affidavit filed in court Wednesday . Martin was armed with a knife , authorities said .

`` A person has the right to protect themselves , their family and their property , '' Walters said .

`` It 's all dependent upon if the situation warrants it and the facts warrant it , '' he said . '' ... If in the commission of a qualifying offense , someone gets killed , then yes , -LRB- first-degree murder charges -RRB- can and probably will be filed upon the person who does n't die . ''

Graham was the first of two 911 operators to speak with McKinley .

`` She did a very good job in keeping her -LRB- McKinley -RRB- calm , '' Grady County Sheriff Art Kell said of Graham . `` Her job is to make sure the person on the phone is comfortable ... to give them support . ''

McKinley was on the phone with a second dispatcher when she pulled the trigger .

Police said Stewart told them Martin knew McKinley 's husband had died , according to CNN affiliate KOCO . Martin suspected prescription drugs would be inside the home , the station reported , citing court documents .

McKinley said she believes the men were coming after her , rather than intending to commit a robbery .

Stewart told investigators he and Martin ingested hydrocodone about 30 minutes before reaching the rural home , the affidavit states .

McKinley said she had pushed the couch against the door to deter entry .

Martin , 24 , was found between the door and a couch with a knife clutched in his gloved left hand , police said .

CNN 's calls to police in Blanchard , about 25 miles south of downtown Oklahoma City , were not immediately returned .

Stewart 's attorney , Stephen Buzin , told CNN he would not comment on specifics of the case against his client . `` We will let the facts come out at trial and feel comfortable with his innocence , '' the attorney said .

Martin recently had approached McKinley 's home , saying he wanted to introduce himself , Walters said . The man said he worked for the owner of the property on which McKinley lived , she told HLN .

`` She remained as calm as one could under the circumstances and had the forethought and called 911 , as everyone should , '' he said .
