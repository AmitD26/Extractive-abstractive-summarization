Since the world economies went into a tailspin in 2008 , getting a bank loan has gotten harder . But it 's also opened up the market for others to step in .

Welcome to peer-to-peer lending , a platform where people lend money to each other over the internet .

`` You can get actually a better deal by looking at people around you , looking at your community , '' says Soul Htite , the founder and CEO at Dianrong , a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai .

Acting as a broker between lenders and borrowers , peer-to-peer lenders say they can offer a better rate to both sides without the weight of regulation and the expensive branches that typically make high street banks so cautious .

`` I doubt that people born today are ever going to have a bank account the same way you and I have a bank account , '' Htite told CNN . `` I think we 're going to see the banking world completely transform . ''

In the United States , peer-to-peer groups such as LendingClub and Prosper allow borrowers to apply for loans of as much as US$ 35,000 payable over three or five years . The companies use technology to do due diligence .

`` It 's funny because it 's sort of come full circle , '' Renton said . `` Banks are now participating in P2P lending .

`` It 's very simple , it 's very fast . Really , you can do it in your pajamas at two in the morning . That is the beauty from the borrower perspective .

`` From the investor perspective , it 's for the first time ever , people have been able to invest money in their fellow citizens . ''
