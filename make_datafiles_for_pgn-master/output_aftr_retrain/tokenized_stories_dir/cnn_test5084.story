-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Back in 2005 , when he stopped studying third down tendencies long enough to work on a motivational self-help book , Nick Saban kept hammering on one phrase .

The book 's title was `` How Good Do You Want to Be ? A Champion 's Tips on How to Lead and Succeed at Work and in Life . ''

`` Eliminate the clutter . ''

`` It 's everything out there that can take away from your focus , '' said Saban 's co-writer , Brian Curtis .

Saban 's no-nonsense nature -- he and a statue of him outside Alabama 's football stadium are tied for number of memorable one-liners -- perfectly equips him for a moment like Saturday night .

SI.com : Alabama hosts LSU in the Game of the Year

The son of a West Virginia gas station owner , he began coaching as a grad assistant at alma mater Kent State in 1973 . Over a lengthy career , he has been employed by nine different college programs , and three more NFL franchises .

Following four years as head coach at Michigan State , Saban was brought to Baton Rouge in 2000 after LSU had gone 7-15 the previous two seasons .

His professional travelogue did n't end there . Saban left to test himself as an NFL head coach with the Miami Dolphins in 2005 . Two seasons there produced a 15-17 record , and then Saban was seduced by a once proud southern belle who had fallen into disrepute .

`` I 'm not going to be the Alabama coach , '' Saban infamously declared on December 21 , 2006 .

On January 4 , 2007 , he was introduced as the Crimson Tide 's next coach .

He was apologizing for that one three years later in a Sporting News interview . Sort of . `` I apologize for any professional mishandling that might have occurred , '' he said .

But there is a reason Alabama ponied up $ 4 million a year for Saban -LRB- university President Robert Witt makes a reported base of $ 490,000 a year -RRB- . He is one rainmaker of a coach .

While perhaps not always so dedicated to the truth about his comings and goings , Saban is all in with building winning football programs . And in 2007 Alabama needed him badly .

Then came Saban , whose stern dictatorship cut through all the nonsense . He is 51-11 at ` Bama , with one national title and the hopes of another resting on Saturday .

His success did not sit well a couple states to the left . When Saban first left for the pros , LSU fans were mostly understanding . They even cheered him when he returned to Baton Rouge with the Dolphins in 2005 to take on the New Orleans Saints , who had been displaced from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina .

But when he took over a conference rival , he was a direct threat to their team and the game changed .

On Saban 's trip to Baton Rouge in 2008 , he was greeted with the requisite effigy burning . The LSU student newspaper produced an editorial that proclaimed : `` For the record , Nick , the Tiger faithful hate your guts . ''

`` What people suddenly did n't seem to understand is that he did n't leave LSU for Alabama , '' said Glenn Guilbeau , who covers the Tigers for Gannett News Service . After ditching the Dolphins , `` the only open jobs were Alabama , Louisville and Tulane . What was he supposed to do ? ''

Time has somewhat softened the Saban-is-Satan storyline when LSU and Alabama play now .

His connection to LSU was brought up only once in his press conference last Monday . In response , Saban sounded almost wistful .

`` I really do n't think a lot about that , but there are a lot of personal relationships we have with a lot of people because of the association we had with LSU , '' he said . `` The older you get -- and everybody knows I 'm getting old -- you kind of cherish those relationships and really respect and appreciate them . I 'm happy to say a lot of those things do n't get affected by this game and what happens in this game . ''

When he completes this season , his fifth , it will match his longest stay at any of his coaching posts . `` I think there 's a feeling that this is the right place for him and his wife at this stage of their lives , '' Curtis said .

Saban 's Nick 's Kids Foundation provided the $ 50,000 seed money to start Project Team Up , which coordinates aid for those who lost homes and loved ones to the storm . Saban , his wife Terry and his team have been out front throughout the recovery process , said Riz Shakir , Project Team Up 's managing director .

At least he has settled into one place long enough now that those who wish to appreciate him know where to find him .
