`` There 's nobody alive in there , '' she heard them say .

When there was silence , she believed it to be night . But Maxi , a deeply spiritual young woman , chanted the Lord 's Prayer until she was discovered by Peruvian and Nicaraguan rescuers and pulled out of the rubble of Port-au-Prince 's GOC University on January 18 .

`` I always knew I would keep breathing . I knew I would live , '' she said . But the miracle of rescue was only the first hurdle .

Sixteen days later , she is struggling to navigate life anew . She bears physical scars as proof of her ordeal . A bandage on her left shoulder . A fractured hipbone . Cuts and scrapes cover her head and arms . It 's harder to detect the inner damage of a young woman who gave her all to endure .

That fateful day

In early January , Maxi was busy studying for final exams . She had n't exactly wanted to pursue business administration . Since childhood , her dream was to become a nurse . But somehow , nursing school deadlines passed her by , and Maxi enrolled in a business program at the Groupe Olivier and Collaborateur University , known as GOC .

She reluctantly showered and put on the gray collared shirt she always wore to school with a pair of black jeans and sandals . She did n't wear much makeup -- just some powder and eyeliner , though she fussed over her hair and nails . She liked to get a manicure every five days with a fresh coat of baby pink on her toes .

She walked down to the bus stop and waited almost an hour before one carried her to Nazon in central Port-au-Prince . By the time , she reached the university , it was almost 3 p.m.

Maxi raced toward the stairwell , one sandal flying off her foot . A storm of dust rose before her . A block of cement struck her neck , and she fell on her back . Someone fell on top of her . It was Mica , a fellow GOC student .

Mica 's leg was broken , her foot crushed . Maxi felt blood on her own head . The two women lay conjoined like Siamese twins , unable to move , trapped under layers of pancaked concrete , mortar and metal .

` We 're alive '

There was no signal on Maxi 's cell phone , but with the LCD light , she could see the cuts and bruises on Mica 's face . She knew she probably looked the same . Above her , she could see the feet of the dead . Soon the rats would come to gnaw on fresh human flesh .

The two women maneuvered themselves so they were not smothered by concrete . They curled up together , Maxi 's legs bent over her chest to allow for breathing room .

They took turns sleeping to keep their energy up . The other would stay awake and call out to the outside world . `` We 're alive . ''

She could see the levels of the building underneath her . Occasionally , the earth trembled again , and more chunks came crashing down .

When the phone finally gave out , Maxi 's world went dark . She tore a page from a notebook and stuffed it up her nostrils . It was n't enough to cover the wretched smell of human decay .

Search for the missing , found

The day after the quake , Joaceus had frantically run from one makeshift hospital to another in Port-au-Prince , searching for her sister . When she did not find her , she stood every day before the mound of the university building , watching rescue teams dig deeper .

She pointed a finger at God and made a pact . `` I 'm not dying today . ''

Maxi was n't much of a churchgoer -- she often skipped Sunday Mass. . But she prayed twice a day , once in the afternoon and once before going to sleep .

`` Our Father who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name , '' Maxi recited with Mica .

Maxi held Mica 's hand tightly . She rubbed her back to soothe her . She believed God had put them there together for a reason . They were going to be one another 's salvation .

Saved

On Monday , rescuers finally reached Maxi and her friend . She does n't remember details of how they were pulled out . Just that she could breathe again and savor the coolness of water trickling down her throat . And she could see her sister , waiting in the distance .

Doctors said she was severely dehydrated and suffered a few fractures . Her blood pressure had dropped to 60/20 . CNN staffers on the scene rushed Maxi to a field hospital . She was treated at three different locations before Joaceus was able to take her home four days later .

She learned she could not go back to her mother 's house . There were deep fissures and cracks in the walls . Her family was sleeping under sheets outside a neighbor 's house . There , on the rocky dirt , among the chickens , Maxi 's mother , Dieusana Joaceus , made her daughter a bed .

Maxi can not walk or bathe herself , though a doctor who came to see her recently said she might be able to stand within a few weeks .

Maxi said she plans to become a nurse now , as she had always wanted , so she can give to others the same second chance at life . Her mother and sister said their makeshift living quarters have been a saving grace .

`` Everything here reminds me of the earthquake , '' she said , managing to smile . `` I do n't need reminders . ''

She constantly thinks about her time under the rubble and wonders how many of her friends have died . Who survived ? She tried to call Mica , but believes she has gone to stay with family in New York .
