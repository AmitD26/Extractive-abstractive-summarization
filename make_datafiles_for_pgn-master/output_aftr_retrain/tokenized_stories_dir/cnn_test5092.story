When pressed , his campaign released figures that showed that a number of companies helped by Bain under Romney 's tenure , such as Staples , the Sports Authority , and Domino 's , have added more than 100,000 jobs since then . But there are two problems with that figure . The first is that it 's the number of jobs in all the time since Romney started at Bain , including many years after he left . The second is that there are no figures that show how many jobs were added or lost at other companies Bain managed , so a claim of a `` net '' addition is unproven .

Bain could release comprehensive figures , but it 's not likely it will . Nor should it . Bain is n't running for office , and I 'm sure it considers the information proprietary .

That 's compounded when he claims to `` enjoy '' firing people .

But let 's be fair . The governor is having his words taken out of context . Here 's the full quote :

`` I want individuals to have their own insurance . That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep people healthy . It also means if you do n't like what they do , you can fire them . I like being able to fire people who provide services to me . If someone does n't give me the good service I need , I 'm going to go get somebody else to provide that service to me . ''

Romney is n't talking about his time at Bain . He 's talking about health insurance . Specifically , he 's talking about how he 'd like insurance to work . He would rather everyone be personally responsible for buying insurance , instead of getting it from the government . Then , he says , if the insurance company did a bad job , people could fire them .

That sounds much better , right ?

The second problem is worse , though . Healthy people often do n't know their insurance plans are bad until they get sick . Healthy people , after all , do n't make as much use of their plans . Once they fall ill , though , it means now they have a pre-existing condition , which will make it almost impossible to them to get a new plan if they decide to fire their old insurance company . The way the private insurance market works today , almost no one has the luxury of firing the insurance company once he or she figures out it is n't doing a good job .

It will also be true for many more people once President Obama 's Affordable Care Act gets fully under way in 2014 . Since Romney seems so enamored of firing bad insurance companies , you might think he 'd want to protect and promote other people 's ability to do so . Instead , he opposes the Affordable Care Act , which would do the same thing nationally that his law did for the people of Massachusetts .

Aaron Carroll : Romney comment on firing people is mostly out of context ; smoke , not fire

@highlight

But it calls attention to his questionable record as `` job creator '' at Bain , he says

@highlight

His quote involved firing health insurers ; but sick people do n't have luxury of doing that

@highlight

Carroll : In Massachusetts they can , under Romney health law ; yet he opposes national reform
