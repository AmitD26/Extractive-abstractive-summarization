Istanbul -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A high-ranking Turkish government minister is calling for the speedy punishment of several police officers who were caught on a police station camera , repeatedly slapping a detained woman in the face and pulling her hair even after she had been hand-cuffed .

Cengiz , who was dressed in shorts and a tank-top , yelled and backed away from the men . Suddenly , the officers started slapping Cengiz and yanking her hair . Later , the camera showed them wrestling Cengiz to the ground as a third man in police uniform occasionally stepped in to help restrain the woman and pick fallen items off the floor .

`` The incident in Izmir is unacceptable and we definitely consider this incident as one for which the perpetrators should be punished , '' said Fatma Sahin , Turkey 's family and social policies minister , in a statement released on her ministry 's web-site on Sunday . `` There is political will and state authority to take the required action in a speedy way . Therefore , both legal and administrative investigations have been launched and those policemen are suspended . ''

Cengiz ' lawyer told CNN police arrested her client during a raid at an Izmir night club on the night of July 16 .

`` The violence against my client , which started when she was taken with the excuse that she did not have her ID , continued at the police station , '' the lawyer , Hanife Yildirim , told CNN .

Soon after her release on July 17 , Cengiz filed a formal complaint against the police with the assistance of the Izmir Bar Association 's human rights department .

In the meantime , authorities pressed criminal charges against Cengiz for resisting arrest and `` reckless behavior . ''

Police in Izmir have not responded to requests from CNN to comment on the case .

Cengiz ' case sparked outrage throughout the media and among human rights groups in Turkey .

Usterci argued that Cengiz ' case was a rarity , because the in-house police station video camera was not tampered with after the victim 's complaint was formally lodged .

In its annual report on Turkey in 2011 , Amnesty International concluded `` investigations of alleged human rights abuses by state officials remained flawed ... the losing of evidence by state officials and counter-charges being issued against those who alleged human rights abuses contributed to the perpetuation of impunity . ''

`` Turkey continues to be a country where discrimination and violence against women is high . In 2011 , an average of three women a day were killed , '' announced the Turkish Human Rights Foundation and the Human Rights Association , in a joint press release this month .

The two police officers shown beating Cengiz are expected to appear in court in February 2012 .

`` We will also be following up on this , '' she concluded . `` Violence in a police station , especially against a woman , is unacceptable . ''
