`` Since the situation he has improved , '' said Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas , who called the result a `` moral win . ''

Racism rows damage brand of the ` beautiful game '

Aware of a potential powder-keg atmosphere , home team Tottenham warned fans that ground stewards would be wearing head cams to record any inappropriate behavior .

Spurs made the perfect start when Emmanuel Adebayor scored his ninth league goal this season in the eighth minute , forcing home Gareth Bale 's low cross after teammate Sandro stole the ball from Daniel Sturridge near halfway .

Sturridge wasted a golden chance to level soon after , but the 22-year-old striker made amends in the 23rd minute when he buried Ashley Cole 's cross -- a goal that left Spurs furious as the England leftback appeared to control the ball with his hand .

Footballers are TV stars , and should act like it

On-loan Manchester City striker Adebayor had the ball in the net again just before the hour , but it was ruled out for offside .

Villas-Boas brought on $ 80 million striker Fernando Torres with 13 minutes to play , but it was former Chelsea defender William Gallas -- who scored a winner against Tottenham in 2006 -- who next went closest to scoring as he volleyed a good chance wide .

Spurs go into the December 26 Boxing Day fixtures in the club 's best position this century , but still nine points behind City .

In Spain , Barcelona and Valencia cruised into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey , joining holders Real Madrid in the next round .

First-team regulars Pedro Rodriguez , Andre Iniesta and Xavi also netted in a win that gave the Catalan side a 10-0 aggregate scoreline .

Valencia surprisingly drew the first leg at lower league Cadiz 0-0 , but scored four unanswered goals on Thursday to go through as defender Victor Ruiz , strikers Jonas and Roberto Soldado were on target before midfielder Ever Banega wrapped it up .
