-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Didier Drogba scored the only goal as Chelsea beat Juventus 1-0 at Stamford Bridge to give Guus Hiddink 's side a slender advantage ahead of their Champions League last-16 second leg in Turin .

Didier Drogba celebrates his goal as Chelsea took a narrow advantage after their home tie against Juventus .

Hiddink was taking charge of a Chelsea side at home for the first time since his temporary appointment and it was the hosts who made the first inroads towards goal with Jose Bosingwa forcing Buffon into a save with a left-foot shot from the edge of the area in the fourth minute .

Four minutes later Drogba almost opened the scoring when he got ahead of his marker to turn a cross from Bosingwa just over the crossbar .

In the 15th minute , Drogba should have made it two when he met a corner from Frank Lampard inside the six-yard box , but he inexplicably headed wide .

Chelsea also had chances to double their lead , notably when a 20-yard effort from Nicolas Anelka flashed inches wide , but Chelsea held on for the victory .

`` We maybe should have scored a second goal to give us some breathing space for the second leg . I felt we suffered a little bit in the second half and Juventus are a difficult side to play , but I 'm happy with the result , '' Hiddink told Sky Sports .
