The claim called for the dissolution of the Wefaq and Al-Amal movements , two Shiite groups in the forefront of recent protests against the Bahrain government , a key U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf .

Abdul Khalil Jalil , a member of parliament from Wefaq , confirmed the development but did n't provide details .

It called in Saudi Arabia and other regional troops to help end the protests , which swept across the kingdom earlier this year as populations across the Arab world rose up against their rulers .

Bahrain 's Sunni Muslim monarchy has long suspected Iran of attempting to foment unrest among the island 's majority-Shiite population , leaked U.S. diplomatic documents show , and Iran has asserted territorial claims over the onetime Persian province both before and after the 1979 revolution brought the current Islamic republic to power

Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama , the capital , to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy .

Young members of the country 's Shiite Muslim majority have staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination , unemployment and corruption , issues they say the country 's Sunni rulers have done little to address .
