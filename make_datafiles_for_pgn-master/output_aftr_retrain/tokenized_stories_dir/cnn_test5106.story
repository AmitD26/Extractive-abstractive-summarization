-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The University of Kansas men 's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night , setting up an an NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky .

But a win in Saturday 's contest against Kentucky 's in-state rival , Louisville , was hardly a given . The Cardinals , for one , had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino , who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky .

But the Wildcats eventually pulled away , winning by a 69-61 margin .

The Jayhawks were paced by forward Thomas Robinson , this season 's lone unanimous AP All-American pick . On the other side of the court was the Buckeyes ' Jared Sullinger , who himself earned first-team honors for the second straight year .

On Saturday night , Ohio State jumped ahead early , carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half . But Kansas stormed back after the intermission , notching the game up at 38-38 with 14 minutes left in the game .

The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck , with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes .

Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on , thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call , for a 64-62 victory .
