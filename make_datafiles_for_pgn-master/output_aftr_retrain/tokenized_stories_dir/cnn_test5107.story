-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Actor-director Gary Sinise has touched the lives of thousands of U.S. service members .

Sinise often travels overseas to honor and entertain the troops with his Lt. Dan Band , and his Gary Sinise Foundation helps support them when they return home .

Gary Sinise : Over the past 10 or so years , I have been very active with a lot of military charities , a lot of first-responder charities . ...

Quan : Why is this cause important to you ?

Sinise : I have veterans in my family .

On my wife 's side , I have Vietnam veterans . I remember all too well what happened to them when they came home from war . On my side , I have veterans . My dad was in the Navy , my uncles were in World War II , and my grandfather served in World War I. I have great respect for our veterans .

And then I played one in `` Forrest Gump '' and I got involved with the Disabled American Veterans organization , and I became keenly aware of what people who lose their limbs and parts of their body have sacrificed in service of their country .

Quan : How did the Lt. Dan Band get started ?

I happened to have these guys that I played with out of Chicago . And my buddy Kimo Williams and I put some more guys and gals together , and we have a band of 13 people now . It 's a big , big show . We 've been all over the world several times . We probably will do 14 , 15 USO shows this year alone .

A lot of people do n't know the extraordinary sacrifice and service of certain people . And when these kinds of things are highlighted through a campaign like this , I think it gives incentive to other people : `` Hey , wait a minute . There are things I can do in my community , even if it 's small . ''

Sinise and his band 's efforts to support the troops are chronicled in the documentary `` Lt. Dan Band : For the Common Good . ''
