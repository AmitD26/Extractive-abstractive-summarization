The report , published earlier this month , was requested by New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg after a series of breaches at Newark Airport , including a knife bypassing TSA screening , passengers walking around security checkpoints and a dead dog transported without being screened for explosives .

The TSA took action to fix only 42 % of the security breaches documented at Newark Airport , according to the report .

`` There 's no consistency because there is no clear guidance on what to report and when to report , '' Charles Edwards , acting inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security , told a congressional hearing on Wednesday . `` One of our recommendations is that they have to have a comprehensive oversight program where they provide clear guidance on how each of the airports need to be reporting and then TSA needs to follow through . ''

Most of the incidents examined occurred in 2010 , and the report says since then efforts to fix security breach vulnerabilities have improved .

Five other large U.S. terminals were visited by inspectors for comparison but the airports ' names were withheld from the public report .

Of the six airports visited , records were found detailing efforts to fix the causes of only 53 % of the breaches .

The inspector general also noted that while the agency did have `` many programs and initiatives that report and track identified security breaches '' they were `` not all inclusive or centrally managed . ''

This lack of comprehensive , centralized data was cited as preventing the use of information to `` monitor trends or make general improvements to security . ''

Problems with how incidents were categorized in reporting also were outlined in the report .

Management at the agency concurred with the inspector general 's report .
