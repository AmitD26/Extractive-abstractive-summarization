Whilst the energy grids we rely on to provide us with cheap and reliable electricity may have been fit for purpose in the 20th century , it is now abundantly clear that the design of 21st century energy networks will have to be very different . In Europe , the foundations for a secure , flexible and more energy efficient future are already being laid .

The SmartGrids project will transform how electricity is supplied in Europe . Instead of centralized power generation , new suppliers will be linked up providing new trading opportunities for businesses and homeowners .

The result is SmartGrids -- one of many projects set up under the European Union 's European Technology Platform -LRB- ETP -RRB- . Combining the expertise of industry , NGO 's , scientists and regulators , SmartGrids is proposing a fundamental shift away from traditional energy supply models .

Duncan Botting , Vice-Chairman of the SmartGrids Advisory Council is currently co-editing the SDD . He spoke to CNN about how the SmartGrids will differ from the old networks and the challenge of replacing the electricity grid across 27 EU states without any loss of power .

`` The grids built in the 1950s and 1960s were designed for power to effectively be poured in at the top -- big central generation . This power then went through transmissions systems and then smaller wires for distribution to the home , '' Botting told CNN .

It 's hard enough trying to create a reliable system that is able to manage this complex interaction between power generators . But when you throw in the complication of 27 member states , each with their own networks , all at different levels of maturity you start to realize the scale of the task at hand .

`` It takes up to 40 years to completely replace a grid , '' Botting said . `` In order to get this right we need to change things at the right pace . We 're not changing the grid like for like but with smarter more intelligent bits of kit . ''

`` Aura-NMS is trying to take a slightly different view of life , '' Botting said . `` If you go back 50 years we used to have local control centers around the networks , with people there telling us what and where a problem was . Aura-NMS is trying to mimic this but also enable microgrids which can be maintained in their own right , away from the main grid . ''

The push towards more intelligent electricity grids is a global phenomenon . The United States is currently researching an Intelligrid and Botting recently visited Taiwan for an international symposium on the issue . Jeremy Rifkin , President of the Foundation on Economic Trends , is a big supporter of SmartGrids and believes that new inter-connected power grids mark the beginning of what he describes as the ` Third Industrial Revolution ' .

`` The idea , '' Botting explains , `` would be that instead of having a meter in your house , you would now have a smart gateway which would be programmable . ''

`` At the other end of the stream , wind farm generators for example , instead of being told that they are generating too much energy because the grid can not cope , there will be an arbitration which goes on automatically to maximize their throughput and maybe back off using a high carbon energy source . ''

He admits that nobody would be considering SmartGrids in usual economic terms , but climate change has changed the game . And he 's convinced that advances in renewable energy technology -- a key aspect of the SmartGrids vision -- will keep pace with the project .

`` You ca n't limit your imagination by what you have today , '' he said .

`` If we are going to get security of supply with low carbon and renewable resources you then have to start looking at how they will be delivered to the end user . What are the economics if you do n't do it ? Well , you might not have a business , or the lights might go out . ''
