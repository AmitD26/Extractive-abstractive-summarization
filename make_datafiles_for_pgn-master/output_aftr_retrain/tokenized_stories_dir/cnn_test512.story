But they quickly realized they had stumbled across something a whole lot more valuable in the ancient Mediterranean harbor of Caesarea .

It 's the biggest hoard of gold coins ever discovered in Israel -- and it could lead to further archaeological finds .

The coins themselves come in several different denominations and are very well preserved , the antiquities authority said . The oldest of them is a quarter dinar minted in Palermo , Sicily , in the second half of the ninth century .

Most of the pieces , though , are from the Fatimid Caliphate , the Shiite Muslim empire that ruled large parts of North Africa and the Middle East around the turn of the first millennium .

Sharvit said he believed the coins , of various dimensions and weights , had been uncovered by winter storms .

He thanked the people who found the treasure -- members of a local diving club -- for quickly reporting their discovery rather than trying to keep the coins for themselves .

`` These divers are model citizens , '' he said . `` They discovered the gold and have a heart of gold that loves the country and its history . ''
