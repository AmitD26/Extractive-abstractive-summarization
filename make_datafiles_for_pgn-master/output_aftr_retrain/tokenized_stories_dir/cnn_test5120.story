-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been three years since Tommy Haas has reached an ATP Tour final , and the former world No. 2 's wait for a 13th career title was extended on Saturday .

Haas , who has overcome two career-threatening injuries in the past decade , was runner-up in the clay event in 2000 and had been on course to reach his first final since winning another German tournament , the Halle grass-court championship in 2009 .

But Croatian Cilic triumphed 6-3 6-4 as he won 89 % of his service points to set up a clash with Germany 's Philipp Kohlschreiber on Sunday .

Kohlschreiber , the 2007 Munich champion , will also be seeking his seventh title after beating Spanish second seed Feliciano Lopez in the second semifinal .

In Portugal , Kaia Kanepi won her second WTA Tour title by beating Spain 's Carla Suarez Navarro 3-6 7-6 -LRB- 8-6 -RRB- 6-4 in Saturday 's final of the Estoril Open .

The Estonian sixth seed had a six-week injury layoff after her maiden victory in Brisbane in January , but has battled back after losing first-round matches in Miami and Indian Wells .

In Belgrade , Italian second seed Andreas Seppi will take on France 's Benoit Paire in Sunday 's final of the Serbia Open .

Seppi beat Argentine fourth seed David Nalbandian , while in another three-set match Paire upset Spaniard Pablo Andujar -- who was top seed in the absence of defending champion Novak Djokovic , who is mourning the recent death of his grandfather .
