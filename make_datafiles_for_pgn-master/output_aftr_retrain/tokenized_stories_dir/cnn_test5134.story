-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- An old-fashioned , tastefully constrained supernatural thriller , `` The Woman in Black '' embraces the elements of gothic horror movies with pleasing seriousness : If there 's a door handle to rattle or floorboard to creak in the ruined mansion at the heart of the story 's trouble , this production pauses for the sight and sound .

And gray English skies with a likelihood of thick English mist is the unchanging weather forecast . The upside is , this classically creepy , unironic tale of loss and vengeance , based on Susan Hill 's popular 1983 novel of the same name , pays fair homage to the kind of fare that has long been the specialty of the recently revived British company Hammer Films , where Christopher Lee once reigned as Count Dracula and Peter Cushing personified Baron Frankenstein .

The downside is , `` The Woman in Black '' devotes an awful lot of time to the sight of Daniel Radcliffe , playing a sad , frock-coated lawyer named Arthur Kipps , creeping anxiously through that haunted house , clutching a candle and an axe , getting nowhere .

Arthur does , at least , begin to wonder about the unusual death rate of village children . Oh , if ghosts could talk ! Instead , this inconsolable spirit makes her feelings known through more ghoulish means .

The horror-loving audience who wants to be scared silly , on the other hand , ought to know that , TV ads featuring night-vision footage of freaked out preview patrons to the contrary , this is a movie of quiet spookiness rather than loud BOO!s . B -
