Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hours before the official announcement that President Barack Obama had landed in Kabul , Afghanistan , for a surprise visit , the media -- both social and electronic -- were already buzzing with reports about the trip .

Some , including those inside the administration , were actively concerned about the safety of the commander in chief as he arrived in a war zone , while others felt any word of the president 's visit was public information and fair game in today 's competitive , instant news cycle .

Before the day began , the administration issued what was later revealed to be a fake presidential schedule , having the president and vice president in meetings throughout the day at the White House .

Then , shortly after 9 a.m. ET , Afghanistan-based 24-hour news channel TOLONEWS filed a Twitter post announcing the president 's supposed arrival in Afghanistan . -LRB- The tweet has since been deleted from its feed . -RRB-

Minutes later , The Huffington Post 's Joshua Hersh retweeted @TOLOnews with a question :

@joshuahersh `` Is this right?RT @TOLOnews BREAKING : United States President Barack Obama has arrived in Kabul to meet Afghan president Hamid Karzai ''

But , at 9:32 a.m , the U.S. Embassy in Kabul announced via Twitter :

@USEmbassyKabul `` Reports that President Obama is in Kabul are false . ''

That was enough to send the Twitterverse and traditional media buzzing . The New York Post posted a story on its website shortly after 10 a.m. reporting the president was in Afghanistan .

`` Obama arrives in Afghanistan report says ; White House denies it , '' read the Post 's headline . The story was later removed from the paper 's website .

`` Where is Obama , '' read a similar headline on The Drudge Report . Many of the publications that posted early reports on the president 's visit later pulled their stories . However , The Drudge Report kept its post up .

Early reports often wrong

The trip took place in the wake of security questions raised last month following a scandal that erupted when several members of a Secret Service advance team in Cartagena , Colombia , solicited prostitutes before the president 's arrival at the Summit of the Americas . And in March , several news outlets , at the White House 's request , removed stories about daughter Malia Obama 's spring break trip to Mexico .

But balancing news interests against security interests is nothing new for White House reporters .

`` We were told we were not supposed to tell our family , '' King told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday . `` We were supposed to tell one or two of our colleagues , meaning our bosses , and to keep it as secret as possible . ''

A secret rendezvous in the dark of night

News organizations who were a part of the traveling press pool covering the president 's surprise Afghanistan visit -- a small group of reporters , producers and photojournalists designated to be the eyes and ears of the White House press corps during such clandestine trips -- were part of the secrecy and complied with the White House 's request to hold off on reporting the information until the president was safely in Kabul , according to White House pool reports .

`` We landed at Bagram Airfield at 1020p local and got onto Chinook helicopters that were waiting with rotors spinning , '' reported pool producer Richard Coolidge of ABC News . `` The short flight to Kabul was also in blackout -- no use of any flashlights or even phones due to their backlit screens . Pilots and gunners used night vision goggles . ''

`` AF1 is blacked out as it was on arrival with shades down . But the increasing light limits the value of that precaution , '' reported the press pool . `` We are on AF1 and rolling 425a local 755 pm ET . ''

The early reports of the president 's Afghanistan trip sent White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor scurrying to douse the rumors . According to the website BuzzFeed , that outlet agreed to the White House request and pulled its report after Vietor called around 9:33 a.m. . The New York Post followed suit , removing its story hours later .

Vietor did not respond to CNN 's request for comment .

Tompkins said that in the harried and hypercompetitive world of reporting via social media , outlets sometimes reason that a competitor 's scoop signals a green light to rush ahead with news . This is a dangerous precedent when national security is concerned , he said .
