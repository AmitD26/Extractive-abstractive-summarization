-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chelsea romped into the English FA Cup semifinal with a 5-1 beating of London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in a controversial match at Wembley Sunday .

Leading 1-0 from Didier Drogba 's superb first-half strike , Chelsea went further ahead when Juan Mata 's shot hit a cluster of bodies on the Tottenham line , with TV replays indicating it had not crossed the line .

But referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal to spark frantic protests from incensed Tottenham players .

Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said Atkinson later apologized .

`` I spoke to him . He says he feels worse than I do . I said : ` I do n't think so , ' '' Redknapp told reporters .

`` He knows he 's made a mistake and he says he 'll have a bad week as well . ''

Chelsea responded with a superb third goal by Ramires before fellow midfielder Frank Lampard put the outcome beyond doubt with a long-range free-kick which wrong-footed Carlo Cudicini in the Tottenham goal .

The match was played a day before the anniversary of the April 14 , 1989 tragedy that saw 96 Liverpool fans crushed to death during an FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield -- one of the worst disasters in football history .

With the scores 1-1 , Norris awarded Hearts a penalty when a Marius Zaliukas shot struck Joe Ledley on the arm .

Craig Beattie scored from the spot before Celtic were denied a penalty in stoppage time when Andy Webster appeared to handle in the box .

Hearts will play Edinburgh rivals Hibernian in the final .
