Champions League semifinalists Bayern made sure their rivals would have to get a result in the late kickoff by snatching a last-gasp 2-1 win at Werder Bremen , but Dortmund retained the crown with two matches to spare in front of their home crowd after a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach .

Croatia midfelder Ivan Perisic opened the scoring in the 23rd minute with a header from Marcel Schmelzer 's free-kick , while Japan international Shinji Kagawa settled any nerves of the 80,720 sellout home crowd at Signal Iduna Park with the second goal on the hour mark to seal the club 's eighth title since forming in 1909 .

The victory extended Dortmund 's unbeaten league run to 26 matches , and ended Bayern 's slim hopes of a first title since 2010 and 23rd overall .

Brazil defender Naldo put the home side ahead in the 51st minute , but diverted a cross by substitute Ribery into his own net with quarter of an hour to play .

But Ribery struck in the final seconds to put Bayern 10 points clear of third-placed Schalke , who travel to fourth-bottom Augsburg on Sunday .

Monchengladbach stayed a point behind Schalke , and facing an uphill battle to qualify for the Champions League .

Stuttgart drew 1-1 at third-bottom Cologne and stayed in fifth ahead of Bayer Leverkusen , who won 1-0 at Hoffenheim .

Second-bottom Hertha Berlin 's hopes of staying in the top flight suffered a big blow after a 2-1 home defeat by already-relegated Kaiserslautern .
