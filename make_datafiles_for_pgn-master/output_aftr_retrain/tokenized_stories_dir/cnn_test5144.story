-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Watching Brad Friedel being put through his paces at Tottenham Hotspur 's training facility in Chigwell , Essex , you could be forgiven for thinking he was a lot younger than his 40 years .

`` I enjoy playing football so much that I try to keep disciplined . I do yoga -- I 've done that for eight or nine years now , '' he told CNN World Sport .

Friedel 's fitness levels have allowed him to notch up over 450 appearances in England 's top division in a career spanning 15 years and four clubs : Liverpool , Blackburn Rovers , Aston Villa and Spurs . He has not missed an EPL game in almost eight seasons .

Footballers ' health has rarely been out the headlines in recent weeks after Bolton Wanderers ' Fabrice Muamba collapsed at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup quarterfinal against Spurs last month .

Although he was n't on the pitch that day , the incident left Friedel in shock and disbelief .

`` Here you have a 23-year-old , an incredibly fit footballer that collapses and goes into cardiac arrest and then 72 hours later you start to hear about the miracle , and it gave everyone a lift . ''

Inevitably , the incident brought the issue of heart-screening of footballers to the fore , but Friedel is confident that procedures in place are already pretty good .

`` I think it 's going to be better at some clubs than others . When I came here I was fully screened , also at Aston Villa and Blackburn . I think we have to take into consideration as well that these things just happen sometimes , '' Friedel said .

It 's nearly two decades since Ohio-born Friedel left his homeland in search of a professional career abroad .

`` Soccer in the United States has come a million miles from when I started . There was n't a professional league back then , '' he said .

Friedel will return to the U.S. in mid-year as Tottenham embark upon a preseason tour , with friendlies lined up against LA Galaxy and the New York Red Bulls .

`` We 're one of the teams people really enjoy watching and hopefully with the branding efforts we 'll become bigger in the States . ''
