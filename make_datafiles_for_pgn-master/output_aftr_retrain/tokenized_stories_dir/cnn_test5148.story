Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama took a key step in cementing his judicial legacy Monday , nominating Solicitor General Elena Kagan to replace retiring Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court .

If confirmed , the 50-year-old Kagan will become the 112th Supreme Court justice . She would be the third woman on the nine-member bench and the fourth in the history of the court .

At its discretion , the court decides cases on the Constitution or federal law that may begin in federal or state courts .

Kagan received her law degree from Harvard University , where she later served as dean of the law school . She served in the Clinton administration as associate White House counsel .

Kagan , in turn , said she was `` honored '' and `` humbled '' by what she called `` the honor of a lifetime . ''

That work wo n't stop immediately with her nomination to the high court .

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vermont , said Monday that Kagan is a `` superb nominee '' who is `` the best this country can offer . ''

`` She will be confirmed , '' he predicted .

`` My conclusion will be based on evidence , not blind faith , '' he said .

`` The only reason she would be filibustered is if members come to believe she could not put aside her own personal views on cases in which she wanted to see a particular outcome rather than decide the case on the basis of the facts and the law , '' Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl said .

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions , the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee , said Monday that Kagan 's confirmation hearings could wrap up by early August , but noted the timing depends on the White House 's willingness to work with the GOP .

Republicans may try to use Kagan 's own words against her in pushing for greater specificity on her views during her confirmation hearings . In 1995 , she dismissed the hearing process as a `` vapid and hollow charade . ''

While serving as dean at Harvard Law , Kagan said she `` abhorred '' the military 's `` discriminatory recruitment policy . '' She called it `` a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order . ''

Also in the spotlight will be Kagan 's views on the politically hot-button issue of campaign finance reform . She was the government 's lead attorney in arguing against a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in January that eased long-standing restrictions on campaign spending by corporations and unions in federal elections .

Some liberal organizations have expressed concern over Kagan 's views on executive power . As chief defender of the administration 's anti-terrorism strategy , Kagan has articulated a more robust defense of the White House than many civil rights and human rights groups would like .

Vincent Warren , head of the left-leaning Center for Constitutional Rights , said Kagan 's record `` indicates a troubling support for expanding presidential powers , something we must be vigilant about at this time . ''

`` President Obama would appear to be seeking to appoint a Supreme Court Judge who will endorse his policies and appease conservatives , '' he argued . `` This is not the way to make a decision that will affect our nation for decades to come . ''

Observers on both sides of the political aisle have noted that Kagan has a relatively short paper trail compared to other recent Supreme Court nominees .

Kagan grew up in a Jewish household on the Upper West Side of Manhattan . She went to Princeton University and Harvard Law School . She served as a law clerk for federal judge Abner Mikva and then for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the high court . Marshall affectionately called the diminutive Kagan `` Shorty . ''

Kagan later went into teaching , starting at the University of Chicago , where one of the part-time faculty was Obama .

Clinton picked her in 1999 for the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit . But no Senate confirmation hearings were held , and the nomination lapsed . The seat was later filled by John Roberts , who quickly used the appointment as a springboard to chief justice .

Named Harvard 's dean in 2003 , Kagan earned a reputation for soothing longstanding tensions over a perceived liberal tilt to the faculty and curriculum .

CNN 's Bill Mears , Alan Silverleib , Dana Bash , Ted Barrett and Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
