On a video that Giyen Kim recently posted on iReport.com about her frustration with trying to lose weight , one user commented , `` Who cares how much you have lost you are still a fat a ** . Stop eating and go to the gym . ''

In the past , Kim might have cried and turned to a pint of ice cream for comfort , she reflected . But this time , she hit the gym -- a reaction she views as a revelation .

Kim , 34 , is one of many CNN readers who are using CNN 's iReport.com to share frequent updates of progress on their New Year 's resolutions . iReport.com : Share your journey to change

Lately she has been cooking more for herself and trying to stay away from foods that have refined carbohydrates . She also tries to eat one vegan meal every day , but still occasionally indulges in bacon , the namesake for her blog Bacon is My Enemy .

She exercises six days a week , mostly cardio , but wants to work on strength training and resistance training . She would also like to take step classes .

Still , Kim maintains a positive outlook on her situation .

`` No matter if you get derailed , if you just pick yourself up again and get back on track , it makes a big difference , '' she said . `` If you 're in a place of feeling good about yourself , regardless of how your self-image has been in the past , it propels you to go forward . ''

Dr. Melina Jampolis , a physician nutrition specialist from San Francisco , California , said losing a pound per week is very reasonable . At most , Kim could probably lose an additional half-pound to pound a week , `` but any more than that and she would probably be losing water weight and muscle , '' Jampolis said .

Jampolis recommends that Kim keep a daily journal of what she eats , and review it to see where she might be able to cut 50 to 100 calories , and where there might be hidden calories in her diet . Kim should also make sure she is varying the intensity , duration , and type of workout , Jampolis said .

`` As she loses weight and becomes more fit , she is burning fewer calories doing the same thing , so it is critical to change things up , '' Jampolis said .

As far as Kim 's professional goals , she has secured an interim position at a non-profit organization , and continues to do video blogs for Momversation.com .
