Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Late last week , the leaders and finance ministers of the 20 biggest economies , the G-20 , met in Cannes for their annual media extravaganza .

As usual , it 's very hard to see what could possibly be accomplished in an unwieldy format like this . Taxpayers confronting the enormous cost must wonder : How on earth did this event ever come into being anyway ?

Yes , the leaders encountered each other at the U.N. General Assembly and other big useless crushes . And yes , sometimes they scheduled bilateral meetings to discuss particular pieces of business . But would n't it be nice if the leaders could just regularly sit down for a sequence of informal talk , no particular agenda , just get-to-know-you , hear what 's on your mind ?

Accordingly , President Valery Giscard D'Estaing proposed a new kind of summit for the leaders of the world 's six largest economies : two days at a location outside a capital city , to be followed by a bland communique that sent the message : `` If we told you what we discussed at our confidential talks , then they would not be confidential talks , would they ? ''

The first meeting was held at Rambouillet , some 25 miles outside of Paris . By all accounts , the meeting was a great success . No , the leaders did not overcome their economic challenges . But they built new relationships , so much so that four leaders in particular remained close friends for the rest of their lives : D'Estaing , U.S. President Gerald Ford , German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt , and British Prime Minister James Callaghan .

The small summit was recognized as so useful that it quickly evolved into a permanent institution . Yet almost as soon as the institution was created , it began -- as international institutions so often do -- to bloat from useful innovation into useless behemoth .

As the meetings became a fixture on the annual calendar , the agenda for the meetings began to fill . The number of aides in attendance grew . The press coverage escalated : hundreds of journalists converged on the 1988 meeting in Toronto . With so many TV cameras eager for video , political entrepreneurs inevitably materialized to provide the video the cameras needed : counter-summits , political demonstrations , and so on . Three thousand protesters convened in Toronto . Security costs escalated correspondingly : to a then-astounding $ 30 million .

Toronto 1988 was noteworthy as the last of the Cold War summits . As the world moved into a new political era , the G-7 summit elephantized in earnest . In 1996 , the leaders of the UN , World Bank , International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization were added . In 1997 , Russia joined the group , now renamed the G-8 - despite the awkward fact that the Russian economy had shrunk to approximately the size of that of the Netherlands .

The Russian addition raised the question : If Russia , why not China ? And what 's with the whole `` largest economies '' thing anyway ? Is n't that kind of ... stuck-up ?

To respond to that concern , a new forum was created in 1999 : a meeting of the finance ministers of the 20 largest economies , called -LRB- you guessed it -RRB- the G-20 . During the financial crisis of 2008 , the US urged a summit of the heads of government of the G-20 . What was intended as an emergency summit instantly congealed into a recurring gathering , held in the late fall after the G-8 meetings of mid-summer .

Beginning with the Okinawa summit hosted by Japan in 2000 , five poor countries were added to the G-8 guest list : South Africa was included as a permanent invitee , along with four rotating slots for countries like Senegal and Algeria . And if you were already adding poor countries , should n't we add agencies that address poor country concerns ? In 2000 , the World Health Organization gained attendance rights too .

The 2001 meeting in Genoa , Italy , was stage-managed by Italy 's showman prime minister Silvio Berlusconi . He accommodated most of the leaders on luxury cruise ships in Genoa harbor to isolate them from the violent protesters on the mainland . Total costs for the summit were now soaring toward and then past the quarter-billion mark .

In 2010 , Canada hosted the G-8 summit of world leaders -LRB- in the rural setting of Huntsville , Ontario -RRB- , at the same time as the G-20 finance ministers met in downtown Toronto . For the first time , costs pass the $ 1 billion mark mostly due to higher security expenses . But this experiment in folding the G-8 -LRB- plus 5 ! -RRB- into the G-20 failed . The two massive entities retained their distinctness , each separately growing bigger , costlier , and progressively more useless .

At the 2010 G-8 meeting , France proposed junking the G-8 +5 format for a permanent G-14 format : the core seven , plus Russia , plus China , India , Brazil , Mexico , South Africa and 1 Muslim country , so nobody will feel left out . That idea looks likely to be adopted in time for the 2013 meeting in the United Kingdom .

Then the leaders of Britain and other major countries could organize amongst themselves some informal talks , no particular agenda , just get-to-know-you , hear what 's on your mind ...

Coming up soon : the new G-30 !
