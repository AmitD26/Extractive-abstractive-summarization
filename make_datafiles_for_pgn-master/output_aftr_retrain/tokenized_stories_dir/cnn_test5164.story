Honiara , Solomon Islands -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prince William and Catherine , the duchess of Cambridge , will file a criminal complaint against the photographer who took topless pictures of her , the palace said Sunday evening .

The complaint will be given to a French prosecutor on Monday , Britain 's Press Association reported .

Lawyers for the royals will be seeking damages and a Paris court order preventing the photos from being published again . They also want existing photos taken offline , the palace spokesman told CNN .

William and Catherine were said to be `` hugely saddened '' by what palace officials called a `` grotesque '' invasion of privacy while they were on a private vacation .

But the Irish Daily Star went on to print the pictures on Saturday .

O'Kane said the Irish Daily Star was reproducing the images as published in Closer on Friday rather than buying them directly . The pictures are not being published in the Northern Ireland edition .

Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom .

Pacific welcome awaits William and Kate

The latest controversy comes only three weeks after the British royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of William 's younger brother , Prince Harry , partying naked in his Las Vegas hotel room with a group of girls .

In a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become , a co-owner of the Irish Daily Star , media group Northern & Shell , said it in no way backed the newspaper 's decision to run the pictures of Catherine .

Northern & Shell also owns the Daily Express and the Daily Star , among other British publications , which have not run the pictures of Catherine , nor of Prince Harry .

They were due in the Solomon Islands Sunday on the next leg of a tour that has been overshadowed by the furor over the photographs .

Catherine was `` upset '' with Closer magazine , a palace source told CNN .

Mondadori told CNN it plans to run 26 pages of photographs of William and Kate on vacation in an `` extraordinary '' special edition to go on sale in Italy on Monday .

Chi 's front cover will also feature three revealing pictures of Catherine , according to a copy of the page and statement sent by Mondadori spokeswoman Carmen Mugione via e-mail .

Opinion : British privacy should start with British press

Legal analysts suggest the company hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales , thanks to the revealing pictures .

The grainy pictures published by Closer in France appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau belonging to William 's uncle in Provence , in southern France .

The new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family 's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of Diana , as she fled photographers in Paris 15 years ago .

Laurence Pieau , editor-in-chief of Closer in France , defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with CNN affiliate BFM-TV , saying : `` We were just doing our job . ''

Pieau said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos , and that they show the royals `` are just like any other couple in love . ''

On Saturday the management of Closer said the photos `` are in no case degrading . ''

But even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree , Harris said , the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge .

No UK newspaper has so far published the photographs of Catherine .
