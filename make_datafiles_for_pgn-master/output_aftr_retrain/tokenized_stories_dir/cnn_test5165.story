Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Is this week 's anti-American chaos in the Arab world going to be President Barack Obama 's Jimmy Carter moment or Republican challenger Mitt Romney 's John McCain moment ?

The unrest so far in Libya , Egypt and Yemen -- embassies attacked , an American ambassador killed , spreading protests -- evokes memories of another U.S. crisis more than 30 years ago .

Unable to catch up in the polls , the former Massachusetts governor launched immediate and initially inaccurate criticism of Obama 's foreign policy on Tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- after first reports of protesters breaching the U.S. Embassy in Egypt and of an attack that had killed an American at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya .

`` It 's disgraceful that the Obama administration 's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions , but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks , '' the Romney statement said in reference to a Cairo embassy statement that was released before protesters stormed the compound .

When news emerged Wednesday that the Libya attack killed four people , including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens , Romney found himself criticized by Democrats and some Republicans and conservatives for what they depicted as a crass and non-presidential move .

`` Governor Romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later , '' Obama told CBS in an interview on Wednesday . `` And as president , one of the things I 've learned is you ca n't do that . It 's important for you to make sure that the statements that you make are backed up by the facts and that you 've thought through the ramifications before you make them . ''

A more reasoned response by Romney `` would n't have fit his ready-made scheme of Obama-as-Carter , but it would have spared him of most of the ridicule he 's receiving now , '' Larison wrote , adding : `` Now instead of portraying Obama as Carter , he has presented himself as the bumbling McCain figure of 2012 . ''

Mark Salter , a former chief of staff and campaign adviser to McCain , also took issue with Romney 's move , writing on the website realclearpolitics.com that `` the rush by Republicans -- including Mitt Romney , Sarah Palin and scores of other conservative critics -- to condemn -LRB- Obama -RRB- for policies they claim helped precipitate the attacks is as tortured in its reasoning as it is unseemly in its timing . ''

`` I understand the Romney campaign is under pressure from some Republicans to toughen its attacks on the president , '' wrote Salter , comparing it to similar pressure on McCain four years earlier . '' ... But this is hardly the issue or the moment to demonstrate a greater resolve to take the fight to the president . ''

After his vigorous attacks on Obama on Tuesday night and Wednesday , Romney dropped some of the harshest rhetoric from remarks at a campaign event on Thursday in Virginia while continuing to label the president as a weak leader .

`` As we watch the world today , sometimes it seems we 're at the mercy of events rather than shaping events , '' he said , later adding that `` the world needs American leadership , the Middle East needs American leadership , and I intend to be a president that provides the leadership that America respects and will keep us admired throughout the world . ''

For his part , Obama emphasized U.S. muscle on Thursday in promising a Nevada campaign event that `` no act of terror will go unpunished . '' The president added that he instructed his administration to `` do whatever is necessary to protect all Americans who are serving abroad . ''

The back-and-forth on the issue reflects the competing efforts by the Obama and Romney campaigns to frame the election in terms favorable to their candidate .

Obama seeks to make it a question of competing visions for the future , while Romney pushes for a referendum on Obama 's presidency at a time of high unemployment , sluggish economic recovery and mounting federal deficits and debt .

Romney previously has sought to tie Obama to the troubled , one-term Carter presidency , focusing on the economy -- considered the most important issue of the campaign .

`` I think it is a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values , '' Romney said of the statement issued by the embassy in Cairo that condemned the anti-Islam video that fomented protests outside the compound . `` When our grounds are being attacked and being breached ... the first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation . And apology for America 's values is never the right course . ''

Although Romney said the statement was released after the violence at the embassy , in fact it was released hours earlier .

Democrats quickly fired back , with former presidential candidate John Kerry saying Romney 's comments demonstrated `` an insensitivity and a lack of judgment about what is happening right now . ''

However , some Republicans including Romney 's running mate in November , conservative Rep. Paul Ryan , quickly came to Romney 's defense .

Conservative analyst Liz Cheney , the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a former State Department official in the Bush administration , accused Obama of a litany of missteps that she said weakened U.S. influence abroad .
