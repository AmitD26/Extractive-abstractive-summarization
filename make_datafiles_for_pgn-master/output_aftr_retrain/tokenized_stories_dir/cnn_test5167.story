Welcome home : Share your homecoming experience

Beyond significantly increasing funding to meet the ever-growing costs of treatment , as well as other benefits , America has a responsibility to ensure that our disabled veterans are never neglected or erased from our collective memory . A permanent public tribute to recognize them is now underway .

Yesterday , in a ceremony attended by hundreds of disabled and able-bodied veterans whose service dates back to WWII . House speaker Nancy Pelosi , Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki and others joined us to break ground on The American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial .

The groundbreaking , however , marks just the beginning of efforts -- our obligation -- to create this memorial .

Unfortunately , we often marginalize and forget the men and women who sacrificed for our freedom . In fact , Veterans Day itself has become for far too many of us an extra vacation day from work or school . For retailers , it has become yet another day to lure shoppers with special sales and promotions .

All of us should instead consider this sobering fact : Since 2001 , the number of disabled veterans has risen by 25 percent to over 3 million today . In contrast , the increase in the six years prior to September 11 , 2001 , was just 4 percent . Well over 180,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are already collecting disability benefits .

A Stanford University study last year estimated that as many as 35 percent of Iraq war veterans will suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome , a condition that has already led to high rates of depression , suicide , substance abuse , unemployment , relationship and family problems , and other issues .

We have been privileged to meet a number of these veterans and have witnessed their Herculean struggles to regain health , reshape lives shattered by disability , learn new trades or professions , and rejoin the civilian world .

While their disabilities remind us of the fragility of life , they also inspire us with their fortitude , strength of character , and unflagging commitment , not just to survive , but to flourish as devoted husbands and wives , fathers and mothers , sons and daughters , friends and colleagues , and hard-working and productive citizens .

It is not possible to look into the eyes of any disabled veteran and not feel compelled to do something to recognize what he or she has given up for our sake , for the freedoms that we take them for granted .

John Quincy Adams said : `` You will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom . I hope you will make good use of it . ''
