Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He 's the 20-something blogger who created the iconic Steve Jobs action figure .

And yet , despite his devotion to all things Apple , MIC Gadget 's Chris Chang says if it came down to just one device -- he would choose a Chinese-branded smartphone over the iPhone .

Chang shows me his preferred smartphone -- the roughly $ 400 OPPO Finder . The Android-powered phone is just 6.65 millimeters thin -- thinner than the iPhone 5 . That said , it 's not a 4G handset .

But it 's enough for Chang and a growing number of discerning Chinese smartphone users .

Break it down by marketshare and , according to IHS iSuppli Research , in the first half of 2012 , three of the top five smartphones sold in China are local Chinese brands : Lenovo , Coolpad and Huawei . All three individually outsell Apple 's iPhone in China .

But China 's Meizu , Xiaomi and OPPO are climbing up the value chain -- not so high as to angle for the top tier of the market with Apple and Samsung , but right in the middle .

Xiaomi is the smartphone cult hero in China with its intensely loyal fans who adore the company 's charismatic founder , Lei Jun , and the brand 's distinctive style .

`` Watching a thousand Xiaomi fans give Lei and the new phone a standing ovation last month really drove home the company 's success at connecting with its customers , '' says Ong .

So how can the rest of the world get their hands on a cult Chinese smartphone ?

Well , you ca n't . They 're only available in China . Xiaomi may have an English language Twitter feed , but it did n't want to lend its Mi-Two phone for review to international audiences on CNN 's News Stream . -LRB- We had to borrow the phone from Chris Chang . -RRB-

The fan base for China 's sleekest smartphones will remain in China for now .
