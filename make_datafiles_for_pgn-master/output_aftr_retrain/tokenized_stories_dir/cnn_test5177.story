Justices will weigh a challenge to the state 's law by Alonzo King , who was convicted of a 2003 rape on Maryland 's Eastern Shore with the assistance of genetic material obtained following his arrest three years ago on an unrelated assault charge .

King moved to suppress the use of the DNA on Fourth Amendment grounds , but was ultimately convicted of the rape offense .

Federal law in 1994 created a national database in which local , state , and federal law enforcement agencies could compare and share information on DNA matches from convicted felons . But courts have been at odds on just when such samples can be collected and the information distributed .

A divided Maryland Court of Appeals agreed with King , saying suspects under arrest enjoy a higher level of privacy than a convicted felon . This , the court said , outweighed the state 's law enforcement interests .

State officials asked the Supreme Court to intervene , saying the state court ruling `` resulted in the loss of a valuable crime-fighting tool . '' They said that from a law enforcement and forensic perspective , there is no difference between fingerprinting and collecting `` biometric information . ''

The Supreme Court allowed the Maryland law to remain in effect in July while appeals from the state were filed , and Chief Justice John Roberts signaled at the time his tentative support for the measure .

`` Collecting DNA from individuals arrested for violent felonies provides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population , '' Roberts wrote .

`` Crimes for which DNA evidence is implicated tend to be serious , and serious crimes cause serious injuries . That Maryland may not employ a duly enacted statute to help prevent these injuries constitutes irreparable harm . ''
