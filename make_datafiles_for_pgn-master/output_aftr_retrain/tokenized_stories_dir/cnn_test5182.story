-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nine years ago he was an electrician . Six months ago , he was worth some A$ 1.18 billion -LRB- $ 1.22 billion -RRB- Australia 's mining boom having turned him into the country 's richest person under 40 years old .

While creditors have been circling for months , it was a Tuesday decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court to wind up Tinkler 's Mulsanne Resources over an unpaid A$ 28.4 million dollar debt that suggests the former electrician 's luck may have run dry .

He recently settled a A$ 16.6 million dispute with Mirvac over a failed land purchase in Sydney and a A$ 2 million debt to the publicly listed contractor , Sedgman Ltd. .

Instead , he flew it to Singapore where he and his family now live in two adjacent homes , reportedly with a Maserati and Porcshe in the driveway .

And in August with coal prices flailing , Tinkler abandoned plans for a A$ 5.3 billion take over Whitehaven Coal , one of Australia 's largest coal producers with exploration assets in Queensland . Tinkler 's Aston Resources , however , remains the largest shareholder in Whitehaven Coal with a 19.4 % stake .

Navigating the downside of Australia 's commodities boom is proving to be a wild ride for Nathan Tinkler . As a result , the unlikely rich lister is in the business pages of Australian newspapers almost daily . And he does n't much like the attention .

`` There has definitely , absolutely , been a spirited media campaign to get me , '' Tinkler told Sydney 's Daily Telegraph earlier this month .

Seeking to sooth the doubters , he added , `` I would say the noisy few have made a lot of people nervous and there is no need to be . ''

The order to liquidate his personal investment vehicle would indicate the nervousness is not a fiction of a media campaign .

But Tinkler is accustomed to wild rides . The ride to the top for Australia 's fastest self-made billionaire was not only wild . It was a gamble .

By 26 , he 'd formed his own mine machinery maintenance business , servicing coalmines , which were burgeoning and booming as Australian commodities fueled the expansion of China 's infrastructure .

Then came his big break .

Investors came on board when exploratory drilling turned in heaven sent results - high grade coal samples .

The Aston Resources merger with Whitehaven Coal was his great hope and even diminished by weak coal prices , it remains his main asset .

If the former electrician ca n't pull another rabbit out of his hat , faith in the Midas touch may be all that remains to stave off bankruptcy .
