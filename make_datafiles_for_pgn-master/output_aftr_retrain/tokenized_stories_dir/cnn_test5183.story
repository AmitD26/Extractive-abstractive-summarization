-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dear 2012 , now that you 're gone , please take these lame words with you : trending , spoiler alert , bucket list , superfood , guru and job creators . Oh yeah , and do n't forget yolo .

For the 38th straight year , the tiny state college tucked away in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula unveiled on Monday its list of useless , overused or misused terms : 12 words or phrases the school wants `` banished '' from the English language in 2013 .

`` I 'm in the word banishment business , '' admits university PR director Tom Pink , who helped whittle down the list from thousands of nominations submitted to the school 's website . `` There 's a slightly serious side to this , but mostly we 're trying to have fun with it . ''

Sure it 's fun . But it also makes you wonder why some new words stick and others do n't .

Here 's the list :

Who needs `` carpe diem '' when you 've got yolo -- branded on Twitter , in pop song lyrics and in celebrity tattoos .

Sadly , poor little yolo 's story is all too common , says Geoffrey Nunberg , a linguist who teaches at the University of California at Berkeley School of Information .

`` Just once , I would like to hear it referred to as a financial crisis , '' wrote a nominator from Johnstown , Pennsylvania . Appropriately , her name is Barbara Cliff .

`` Journalists always like cliffs , '' Nunberg jokes . `` There 's more pressure to use phrases like that , because if you soft peddle things , nobody 's going to read the story . ''

3 . Kick the can down the road , a metaphorical phrase that describes the concept of substituting a short-term fix in place of a final decision

4 . Job creator/creators , a person or business directly responsible for adding employed workers to the economy

Words like `` job creators , '' Nunberg says , represent an entire set of phrases that bubbled up during the 2012 presidential campaign . These words reflect recent changes in the way Americans talk about differing economic and social classes . `` It 's the ' 47 % , ' the ` moochers , ' the ` makers and takers . ' '' These kinds of words , Nunberg suggests , fuel the fire of class warfare in American life .

The popularity of this word results from the `` bloating of the language of corporate life , '' Nunberg says . `` People are expected to manifest a kind of emotional attachment and investment in their jobs that was n't required back when jobs were a lot more secure . ''

6 . Superfood , a nonscientific word for food with extremely high nutritional benefits

Another food word on the list :

7 . Boneless wings , small hand-held pieces of processed chicken without bones which are often enjoyed in sports bars

8 . Trending , currently popular

`` There are lots of ways to say it , but none in as few as eight letters , '' jokes Nunberg . `` It 's a little trendy . ''

Here 's one that Pink says has lost its meaning :

9 . Bucket list , a personal list of experiences people desire before they die , also known as `` kicking the bucket ''

This one has got to go , says Pink . There was a time when it could mean something like climbing a mountain , he explains . Now a bucket list can include less-lofty pursuits -- like catching a two-for-one sale at the mall .

That phrase was , `` I know , right . ''

Says Pink , `` That one came close . ''

`` Banish ` Mother Nature ' from weather references FOREVER ! '' writes snowdogg .

F-word and A-word

Nunberg 's book , `` Ascent of the A-Word , '' follows a ** hole from its invention by WWII GIs to today , where the word has become a `` basic term that a lot of us use all the time in our emotional and moral lives , for example when somebody cuts us off on the highway . ''

More words are being invented now than ever before -- partly because of easy and fast communication on the interwebs . -LRB- Sorry , gemurray -RRB- `` But the more words that are produced increases the competition , '' says Nunberg . There 's a kind of process of natural selection .

The words that survive often `` become signs of important social movements or changes , '' he says .

The loser words will die -- never to be spoken again by countless mouths of future generations .

Hey little yolo , if you 're reading this , you better find some new friends . And fast . If you know what 's good for ya .
