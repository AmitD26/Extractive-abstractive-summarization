Assured by his wife that there was nothing he could do to help , the Swede remained in the Netherlands and pulled off an emotional victory with a sensational shot at the final hole of the KLM Open on Sunday .

`` When he was put into hospital on Friday , I was panicking . He was not good for 12 to 14 hours there and as a parent that makes you feel very vulnerable , '' the 34-year-old told the European Tour website .

`` I just wanted to go back home and look after the family , but my wife convinced me to stay . They were in good hands ; there was nothing I could do and she was telling me that , but when your kids get sick you do n't think straight . ''

`` It 's always a nice feeling , but especially this week with how things have been with my son being a little bit ill , '' said Hanson , who will play for Europe against the U.S. at the Ryder Cup this month .

`` He has managed to get over that and he 's getting better and better , which is the most important thing . ''

Hanson , who also has membership of the PGA Tour this season , had looked like missing out when , trailing Larrazabal by one shot , he drove into the trees at the 16th hole .

`` This was needed . It 's been a bit of a slow summer for me , so this came at a perfect time to get confidence back and feel ready for the Ryder Cup . ''

Ramsay birdied three of the last four holes to match Hanson 's final-round score of 67 , but was just short of repeating his victory at last week 's European Masters in Switzerland .

`` On the last hole I was thinking I could hole my eagle putt and have a little run around the green but he got in first , '' he said after taking home $ 200,000 to go 17th in the money list with almost $ 1.2 million this season .
