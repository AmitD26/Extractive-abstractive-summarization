`` Why did I move to the States ? I still do n't know . For a better education , for a better life , '' she said .

`` There 's no way back for me . How can I apply ? What can I do ? Nothing . ''

Like Ayala and others across the country , many of the iReporters who posted their views had a personal stake in the broader issue of immigration . Their opinions were nuanced and widely varied but had one thing in common : Most did not believe that the recent changes and rulings will have a direct effect on them -- or would have helped them in the past .

Corrine Kay of Gaithersburg , Maryland , said she has had a years-long issue with immigration .

`` All immigration to these United States should be done legally , abiding by the laws of our great nation , '' she said . `` My husband and I are doing exactly that , taking an excessively long time and great expense to do so . ''

Kay was married in Egypt but has been waiting for three years for her husband to get a visa in order to live with her in the U.S.

`` I realized , I must not be alone , as there are certainly other Americans who deal with the pains of having to make do and go through the motions of life while missing their loved ones so , '' she said .

Even so , Kay said , she can understand why some people cross the border illegally .

`` Being in a country illegally is a scary and difficult situation for children , and it is not a decision they made or were mentally equipped to make , '' said Carey , whose family came from Ecuador . `` But for that same reason , I think adults who have made the decision to come to the U.S. illegally have to face reality . ''

`` I was involved in activism in favor of illegal immigration and the halt on deportations for a bit , but I made the decision to no longer support these groups , '' she said .

`` I do n't agree with their strategies . There need to be more compelling arguments based more on logic and less heart . They want their supporters to feel bad for illegal immigrants , but no responsibility is taken whatsoever for the fact that an adult stayed here illegally . ''

At the same time , Carey was happy to see so much of the Arizona law struck down .

`` I always thought the Arizona law was a bit extreme and based on fear while targeting mostly one race/background , '' she said .

Even though the recent immigration decisions do n't affect him now , Sajiv Pandya believes they might have 20 years ago .

`` I was a citizen of the United Kingdom , but I was a third-generation Kenyan of Indian ethnicity , '' he said .

`` I do n't look ` white , ' and so I was held on the grounds that I was Mexican until I could prove otherwise . ''

More than 20 years later , Pandya said he is in favor of `` comprehensive legal immigration and for strict compliance to immigration rules . ''

`` I followed rules to become a U.S. citizen , and I do n't think it is fair for someone to jump the line or not even stand in line , '' he explained .

`` I am happy that the Supreme Court ruling struck down three of the four major provisions . The fourth one , which they upheld , is precisely what impacted me and which I think is going to continue to be abused if it is not further challenged , '' he said , referring to the controversial provision that allows police checks on people 's immigration status while enforcing other laws .

Pandya said he is `` a little aghast '' at the partisan nature of the immigration debate . `` Comprehensive immigration rules need to be a bipartisan effort at a federal level and and must follow a process that is fair to all , '' he said .

`` I want my voice to be heard ; I want to chase my dreams ; I want my family to be free , and I want them to live the American dream , '' she said .
