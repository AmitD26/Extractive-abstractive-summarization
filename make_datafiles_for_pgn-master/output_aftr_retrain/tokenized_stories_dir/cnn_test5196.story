Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kenneth Melson , acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , is expected to resign under pressure , perhaps in the next day or two , in the wake of the controversy over Operation Fast and Furious , two senior federal law enforcement sources said Monday .

The Justice Department refused comment . White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters he had no new information on the issue .

Operation Fast and Furious was `` a colossal failure of leadership , '' Peter Forcelli , a supervisor at the bureau 's Phoenix field office , said recently .

Terry was killed last year north of the Mexican border in Arizona after confronting bandits believed to be preying on illegal immigrants . Two weapons found near the scene of the killing were traced to Fast and Furious .

`` I was flabbergasted . I could n't believe it at first , '' Terry 's mother , Josephine , said when she learned the ATF may have let some of the guns used in the attack slip through its fingers . Terry 's relatives said they want all those involved in his killing and who helped put the weapons in their hands to be prosecuted .

`` We ask that if a government official made a wrong decision , that they admit their error and take responsibility for his or her actions , '' Robert Heyer , Terry 's cousin and family spokesman , said in a hearing last week by the House panel .

The committee 's chairman , Rep. Darrell Issa , R-California , called the operation `` felony stupid . '' As many as 2,000 semiautomatic rifles reached the hands of cartels as a result , and Issa said the top two ATF officials were briefed on the program regularly .

The Mexican attorney general 's office demanded a quick U.S. investigation of the matter in March and said authorities must hold accountable anyone who was responsible for the operation .

`` As the United States government has signaled , the government of Mexico was not informed of any operation that would include the controlled transport of weapons to Mexico , '' the office said .
