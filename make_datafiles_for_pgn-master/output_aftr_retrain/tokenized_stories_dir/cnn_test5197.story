Police , who did not know the children were missing until November 19 , contend that the elder DeBlase allowed the girlfriend , Heather Keaton , to abuse the children by restraining them with tape , putting socks in their mouths and confining them .

The boy 's skeletal remains were found about 12 miles north of Vancleave , after the boy 's father -- who is in police custody in Alabama -- gave authorities information on where the body might be buried , said Jackson County , Mississippi , Sheriff Mike Byrd .

`` It was the father who gave us the general area , '' Byrd told HLN . `` He was n't real sure exactly where he was . ... He claimed he had taken a lot of sleeping pills and did n't quite remember exactly where he was . ''

Based on that information , the sheriff 's office cordoned off a five-mile stretch along a highway and dispatched eight 10-man teams to locate the remains . The body was found about 10:30 a.m. , Byrd said .

The body of Natalie DeBlase has not been found , Byrd said , but he indicated authorities believe it near Citronelle , Alabama , about 50 miles north of Mobile .

Police believe both children died in Mobile , Levy said .

`` This is a one-step-at-a-time , one-day-at-a-time operation , '' Levy said . `` We 've had some success with it today . We 're going to evaluate our results , then begin the next step . ''

Levy said he was relieved at the new findings , but said the investigation had taken a toll .

`` I have kids that are of similar age and it makes me think about them while I 'm out here , '' Levy told HLN .

`` It 's really terrible , as if nobody really cared , '' Levy said of the time that transpired between the sightings and launch of the search . `` That 's what we ca n't seem to understand at this point . ''

Both DeBlase and Keaton are now in custody , and blaming each other for the siblings ' deaths .

The investigation kicked off November 18 , when Keaton told Louisville , Kentucky , police that she needed protection from DeBlase , who she claimed was holding her against her will .

Keaton was arrested last week , charged with two counts of willful abuse and neglect of a child .

Three days later , Randall Melville -- who for two days had been hosting DeBlase , his longtime friend -- called Santa Rosa County , Florida , police after hearing news reports about the children 's disappearance , according to a report from the county sheriff 's department .

He had been charged with two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of abuse of a corpse -- the latter because , Levy said , of his `` disposing of the bodies in the woods . ''

According to a police complaint , DeBlase between March 1 and November 19 allowed Keaton to tape Natalie 's hands and feet , put a sock in her mouth and place her in a suitcase that was put in a closet for 14 hours . He also allowed Keaton to tape Jonathan 's hands to the side of his legs , tape a broom handle to his back , place a sock in his mouth and then make the child stand in a corner all night when the couple went to bed .

DeBlase and Keaton had one infant daughter together , according to Keaton 's account in the Kentucky police report . Police said one reason Keaton claimed she needed protection from DeBlase was that she feared for the safety of the infant , who was with her in Kentucky .

Levy said the two slain children 's biological mother lives in Mobile , but she did not have custody `` because , at the time , she did n't have a place to live . ''
