Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Torrential rain in Myanmar has forced thousands to flee their homes and flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of rice paddies , media reports and aid workers say .

Two weeks of heavy monsoon rain caused the flooding , which has primarily affected the Irrawaddy Delta region close to the capital Yangon .

He said the families that had not fled were living on the upper floors of their homes and long boats were the main form of transport .

The government , private benefactors and the World Food Program had provided food rations to flood victims , he added .

`` What people need now is non-food items -- clothing , cooking pots and utensils , '' he told CNN by telephone from Yangon .

In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar 's southern delta region , killing 130,000 people .
