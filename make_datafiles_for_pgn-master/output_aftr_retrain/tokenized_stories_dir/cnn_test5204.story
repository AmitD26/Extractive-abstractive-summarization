-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egypt 's president-elect , Mohamed Morsi , told a packed Tahrir Square on Friday that the people are the source of his authority as the country 's first democratically elected leader .

The incoming president promised to protect the rights of all Egyptians , whether they voted for him or not .

`` No rights will be taken from anyone who says no to me , '' he said .

At the end of his speech , Morsi referred to Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman , the blind Egyptian cleric serving a life sentence in the United States for a conspiracy conviction in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .

He said he wanted to work to free political prisoners , which he said include Abdel-Rahman .

`` I will faithfully execute and preserve the republican system and respect for law and sovereignty , '' he said .

Morsi , 60 , was declared president Sunday after he took 52 % of the vote to 48 % for Ahmed Shafik , the final prime minister to serve under President Hosni Mubarak before he was ousted .

During the historic campaign for president , Morsi said he would support democracy , women 's rights and peaceful relations with Israel if he won .

`` I will keep in touch with everyone , and I do not differentiate between supporters and opposition . I will seek advice from you and from Allah almighty , '' he said .
