Colombo , Sri Lanka -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A few days ago , strangers appeared at the door of a Sri Lankan investigative journalist when he was n't home , asking questions about him .

Just before midnight Friday , three men stormed Faraz Shaukatally 's house as he slept , police said . One of them shot him .

Journalists face heavy intimidation in Sri Lanka , according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists -LRB- CPJ -RRB- , which has called the island nation a `` highly restrictive and dangerous nation for the press . ''

Police have not apprehended suspects in Shaukatally 's case or established a motive , but the editor of his paper thinks he was shot over his critical articles .

Nine of the murders in the past decade remain unsolved . More than 63 % of journalists killed in the country covered politics as a part of their work .

In the past five years , 20 journalists have fled the country amid `` a climate of intense intimidation , '' the CPJ says .

Last year , citing national security , the government blocked a freedom of information bill , further denying journalists and citizens access to documents .

In recent weeks , the Leader ran articles critical of President Mahinda Rajapaksa .

Perera admitted that she does not know whether Shaukatally was attacked specifically for any of his work .

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , Navi Pillay , said Sri Lankan authorities should immediately give Shaukatally protection . She called the shooting an assassination attempt .
