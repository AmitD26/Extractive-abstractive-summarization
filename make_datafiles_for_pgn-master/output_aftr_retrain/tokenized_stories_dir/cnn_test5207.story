-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Who -- or what -- is `` War Horse '' for ?

Steven Spielberg 's second movie of the season is a very different kettle of fish from `` The Adventures of Tintin , '' which is unpretentious escapism aimed directly at the family audience .

Set in and immediately prior to World War I , the movie chronicles the experiences of a feisty colt , a thoroughbred who 's named Joey by the tenant farmer 's son -LRB- newcomer Jeremy Irvine -RRB- , who cares for him and coaxes him to drag a plough through a rock pile . Sold into the army by the boy 's drunken and penurious father -LRB- Peter Mullan -RRB- , Joey passes from one rider to the next : a British cavalry officer -LRB- Tom Hiddleston -RRB- , a German hospital orderly -LRB- David Kross -RRB- , a young French girl -LRB- Celine Buckens -RRB- , and so on , in the narrative equivalent of a relay race -- the horse being the baton .

The prologue evokes a rudimentary class consciousness that evaporates as soon as Joey comes into the possession of Hiddleston 's gallant cavalry captain -- whose fateful battle charge is one of the film 's most impressive flourishes , and a striking expression of another of the story 's obvious themes , the industrialization of warfare .

But the movie loses its footing badly in the next two episodes , when the focus shifts away from the horse and on to his minders : two German deserters , and then a French farmer and his granddaughter . This last is an especially ill-judged interlude , and seems only to have been included as an olive branch toward any young horse-lovers of the female persuasion who may have found themselves at this war movie by mistake .

The scrupulously neutral and fundamentally banal screenplay by Lee Hall -LRB- `` Billy Elliot '' -RRB- and Richard Curtis -LRB- `` Love Actually '' -RRB- reaches its nadir shortly afterward , when Joey apparently `` volunteers '' to drag heavy artillery through the mud in order to relieve a four-legged comrade he recognizes from their cavalry unit .

Hard to tell who 's the target audience -- teenage Academy voters ?
