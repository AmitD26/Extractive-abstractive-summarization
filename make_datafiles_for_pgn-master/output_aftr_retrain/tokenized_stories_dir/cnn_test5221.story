-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.N. Security Council is expected to meet Tuesday to consider a proposed resolution to authorize more sanctions against North Korea following the secretive regime 's controversial nuclear test last month .

Like the regime 's previous tests in 2006 and 2009 , the move prompted widespread international condemnation , as well as a promise of tough action at the United Nations .

The United States and China , a key North Korean ally , have been negotiating for weeks on the wording of the proposed resolution .

As a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power , China can strongly influence the body 's decisions and has previously resisted strong sanctions on the Kim regime , which it props up economically .

The two communist countries have been close allies , since China backed the North in the Korean War in the 1950s .

The United States backed the South in the conflict , fighting side by side with its troops . The two Koreas are still officially in a state of war , though an armistice signed in 1953 ended the bloodshed .

Analysts say Beijing wants to maintain the North as a buffer between its border and South Korea , a U.S. ally .

Details of the proposed resolution remained unclear late Monday in New York .

Russia , another veto holder , will support a resolution on North Korea if it does n't go beyond `` missile and nuclear issues , '' Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said Tuesday , according to the Russian news agency Interfax .

The meeting Tuesday at which the text is expected to be presented is set to begin at 11 a.m. , according to the U.N. media office .

The rocket launch in December apparently succeeded in putting a satellite in orbit , a move North Korea said was for peaceful purposes . But the launch was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology .

But North Korean state media regularly publish articles directing aggressive rhetoric against Washington and Seoul .

`` North Korea 's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security , '' President Barack Obama said after the North 's nuclear test last month .

CNN 's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report .
