Beijing is quickly realizing these fast-developing social media can be an important way to get public feedback on social issues as China goes through a wide range of growing pains in its transformation from a planned to a more market-oriented economy .

Both Facebook and Twitter were gaining a nascent foothold in China with their ground-breaking services when an uneasy Beijing abruptly blocked their sites in 2009 .

No official reason was ever given , as is always the case when propaganda officials take such actions ; but the timing of the move just before the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown led many to suspect that Beijing was worried the sites could become hotbeds for debate and discussion on a highly sensitive matter that to this day is banned from all Chinese media , both traditional and new .

The blockage of both Twitter and Facebook continues to this day , reflecting Beijing 's clear unease at letting average Chinese form online communities through sites that are based outside China and therefore do n't have to play by the country 's strict self-censorship rules .

Unlike the big offshore-based names , domestic players , and anyone operating a China-based service for that matter , must follow Beijing 's strict self-censorship rules and immediately remove any content banned by central propaganda officials or risk big fines and even closure .

The homegrown Chinese services have had to walk a difficult tightrope as they tried to build commercial services while waiting for Beijing to take a clear stance on how much it was willing to tolerate in the world of online public debate .

Beijing initially took a line of relative tolerance , only to slam on the brakes periodically when angry debate started getting out of control during discussion of sensitive topics like the high-speed rail crash in Zhejiang province last year that left more than 30 dead and 200 injured .

Beijing 's growing unease with the situation came to a head in late 2011 when it ordered social networking sites to register all of their users with their real names .

Around the same time , Beijing also started sending a set of completely opposite signals through traditional state-run media that openly praised the new social media sites .

That campaign saw publication of a series of articles praising the sites as a powerful tool for government and other state-controlled agencies to issue regular updates on their activities and get feedback on new initiatives and steps they were taking to address public concerns .

This hot-and cold approach probably reflects Beijing 's initial lack of understanding of the power of social media , followed by its growing level of comfort as it realizes the medium 's potential as a valuable and also controllable tool to understand and address public concerns .
