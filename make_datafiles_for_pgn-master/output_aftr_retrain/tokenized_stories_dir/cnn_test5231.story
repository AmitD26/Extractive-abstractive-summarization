The agreement ends a lawsuit that accused the singer of `` yelling , screaming obscenities , throwing water and drenching with water , attempting to strike and physically injure '' Roseanna Monk and her child , Genevieve , in the lobby of Trump Place on Manhattan 's Upper West Side on November 11 , 2010 .

LaBelle , her lawyer and representative did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the settlement filed in a federal court in New York .

Monk 's lawyer , Samuel Davis , told CNN Wednesday that it `` took a bunch of depositions '' before LaBelle `` recognized that she was going to have to face the music . ''

The singer apparently was upset because she thought the child was wandering around the lobby unattended , Davis said .

`` LaBelle besieged them with such ferocity , before she doused them with water , that the baby was crying hysterically , '' Davis said . `` LaBelle would not desist . ''

`` She went from being the most outgoing , saying ` hi ' to everybody in the lobby of her building , to being clingy and shy , '' he said .

`` Patti is a nice lady , but she has some anger issues , '' Davis said .

The Monks will donate the payment to charity , as Davis will do with his legal fees , which LaBelle must pay , the attorney said .

CNN 's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report .
