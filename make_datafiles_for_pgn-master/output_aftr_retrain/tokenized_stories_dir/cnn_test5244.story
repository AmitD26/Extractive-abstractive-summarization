The Romney campaign was undoubtedly the height of Portman 's political career .

After he failed to deliver his state and Romney lost the election , Portman stepped out of the limelight and remained relatively quiet on Capitol Hill as President Barack Obama settled in for a second term .

`` I 'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples ' opportunity to marry , '' Portman told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash two years after learning his son , Will , was gay .

Portman is an unexpected advocate for same-sex marriage -- and he admitted as much in the interview .

`` What happened to me is really personal , '' Portman said . `` I mean , I had n't thought a lot about this issue . Again , my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career . ''

Even though he is seen as a social conservative , someone whose social policy is deeply rooted in his Christian faith , Portman is noticeably out of his comfort zone in this discussion . It is budget and tax issues , not marriage and sexuality , that he is better known for .

Portman was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after receiving little challenge from Democrat Lee Fisher for a seat vacated by Republican George Voinovich .

While there , he has pushed fiscal issues , including a balanced budget amendment .

His first foray into elected office was when he won a House seat in 1993 , representing Ohio 's 2nd Congressional District .

In that role , he began to hone his expertise on budget and fiscal issues . During his 12 years in the House , Portman sat on the Ways and Means and Budget committees -- two powerful budget and tax-writing panels -- and co-chaired the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service .

The job required Portman to dive into the esoteric world of federal spending . On his website , Portman describes himself as `` a deficit hawk '' that proposed `` a balanced budget , '' fought `` irresponsible earmarks '' and advocated for more transparency .

When Portman was rumored as a possible vice presidential candidate for Romney , nearly all Democratic operatives attacked him for his time as Bush 's top budget deputy .

Many said he portrayed himself as a deficit hawk , but did n't live up to those ideals when he worked for the White House .

Greg Schultz , the Ohio state director for Obama 's 2012 campaign , stressed these critiques in a blog post for the campaign .

`` As one of the architects of the top-down Bush budget , Portman practically invented the policies that punished middle-class families while exploding the deficit , and crashing our economy , '' Schultz wrote .

Portman , in the middle of the presidential campaign , even tried to distance himself from the Bush administration .
