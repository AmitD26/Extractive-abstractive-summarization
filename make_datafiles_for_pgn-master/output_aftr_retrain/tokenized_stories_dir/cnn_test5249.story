Nitro Active was breaking down . Because of injuries to his tendons and leg joints Nitro Active could barely stand , let alone race .

It was at that point that Monika Kerber came into Nitro Active 's life . Kerber runs Villa Chardonnay , a horse rescue operation in Temecula , California .

`` He deserves another chance , '' said Kerber .

`` They are literally running for their lives , '' said Nancy Perry of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals , or ASPCA . `` If they run too fast they break down on the track and die . And if they do n't run fast enough , they are discarded . ''

The Jockey Club -- the registry for thoroughbred horses in the United States , Canada and Puerto Rico -- estimates that 15 thoroughbreds die on American racetracks every week . Those figures do not include other breeds of horses that also race in the United States .

`` When you extrapolate that to quarter-horse racing and standardbred racing , you realize the numbers are astronomical , '' Perry said .

The ASPCA is pushing for federal regulation to halt the use of performance enhancing drugs on the racetrack .

She said the proposed Interstate Horse Racing Improvement Act would remove oversight from a hodgepodge of seemingly ineffective state commissions .

He also stressed that the industry has raised millions of dollars to provide a comfortable retirement for aging racehorses .

In recent years , Santa Anita has spent millions more installing an artificial race surface in an effort to reduce racing injuries . But Verge said the new surface did n't work . There were constant problems keeping the track in proper condition to race . While mortality rates during races were lowered , trainers complained that the new surface was causing an increase in training injuries .

The artificial surface has since been replaced by a traditional dirt track . Racehorse fatalities at Santa Anita are back up , the highest in the state . In addition to racing incidents , three horses were killed during the filming of horse race scenes at Santa Anita for the HBO TV series , `` Luck . ''

Attendance at racetracks nationwide is falling .

That 's why federal regulation is needed , according to the ASPCA . Perry said the sport could regain its popularity if people believed it was cleaning up its act .

`` In sports where people compete , we have prohibitions on the use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs , '' she said . `` But for some reason we 've allowed horse racing to slip through the cracks . ''

Some of racing 's greatest horses have met horrific fates . In 2008 , Eight Belles snapped both front legs in the Kentucky Derby and was euthanized in front of a TV audience of millions . Two years earlier , Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro broke his leg racing in the Preakness Stakes . In 2002 , the horse racing world was rocked by the news that 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand was apparently killed in a Japanese slaughterhouse .

Horse racing 's critics said these and other deaths are not isolated tragedies , but rather part of a callous pattern within the inner world of the racing industry .

Veterinarian Wayne McNeel has been guiding Nitro Active back along the long road to recovery . The horse 's future is still far from certain . But he said he hopes that one day soon Nitro Active will be able to bear a rider around the shaded grounds of his new home .
