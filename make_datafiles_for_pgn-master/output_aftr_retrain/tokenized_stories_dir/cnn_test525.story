-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seeking to alleviate concern about rising oil prices , Saudi Arabia 's oil minister said his country and other OPEC members have the capacity to produce surplus oil , Saudi Press Agency reported .

It was not clear from the news agency 's report whether al-Naimi meant that Saudi Arabia is already producing an extra 4 million barrels or that it can , if the need arises .

On Tuesday , 87 countries -- including Saudi Arabia -- signed a charter to limit price fluctuations and stabilize the market .

`` Now it 's starting to look like the entire region 's on fire , and it looks like it could spread to other parts of the region , '' said Peter Beutel , oil analyst with energy risk management firm Cameron Hanover . `` This thing is getting worse and worse and worse , and it could spread to Saudi Arabia , and that 's the big fear . ''

Libya 's importance with regard to oil prices does n't hinge so much on its oil-producing and exporting capabilities , said Beutel .

To put things in perspective , Libya produces about 1.6 million barrels of crude per day , compared with Saudi Arabia 's daily production of 8.4 million barrels and worldwide production of 87 million barrels , he said .

`` Markets have always relied on Saudi Arabia to act as the swing producer , boosting output if supplies were disrupted elsewhere , '' said Win Thin , global head of emerging markets strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman .
