Now 34 , Zarni Aung is working for MÃ © decins Sans FrontiÃ ¨ res -LRB- MSF -RRB- -- or Doctors without Borders -- as a counselor for HIV patients too scared to expose their illness for fear of being ostracized or ignored .

`` I 'm no longer afraid to speak out , '' he says in halted English at MSF headquarters , occasionally stopping to sip tea and get the words straight in his head .

Just over one year ago , MSF issued an urgent plea for help to treat an estimated 85,000 Burmese people with HIV . At the time only a fraction were getting vital antiretroviral therapy -LRB- ART -RRB- , creating heartbreaking decisions for doctors who had to choose who was treated and who was turned away .

`` Every day we are confronted with the tragic consequences of these decisions : desperately sick people and unnecessary deaths , '' the head of MSF 's Myanmar mission , Peter Paul de Groote , said in a report , `` Lives in the Balance , '' released in February 2012 .

`` Unless ART provision is rapidly scaled-up , many more people will needlessly suffer and die , '' De Groote warned in the report `` A Preventable Fate . '' At the time , of 240,000 estimated to be carrying the HIV virus , 76,000 were in urgent need of ART . Of those , only 11,000 people were being treated .

Fast-forward to 2013 and the numbers tell the story of a dire situation brought back from the brink .

Around 125,000 people are now estimated to need ART in Myanmar but money has been pledged to retreat 85 % of them , around 106,000 people , said Dr. Khin Nyein Chan , MSF 's medical coordinator in Yangon .

It 's due to the return of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , which pulled its funding in 2011 due to a lack of donations . Just over $ 160 million has been pledged until the end of 2016 to pay for HIV treatment and prevention programs for people most at risk of falling ill .

While new funding for HIV treatment is flowing into the country , MSF warns that extending healthcare to 106,000 people is a slow process . So far the medication is only reaching 50,000 .

`` We still need to overcome a lot of challenges ahead , `` said Dr. Khin Nyein Chan . `` There is a need for capacity building , decentralizing the care delivery , and the stronger engagement of partners , including the Ministry of Health . ''

And there 's another pressing issue : Eradicating the stigma associated with having HIV in Myanmar .

`` Most of the patients were depressed so I disclosed my status and experience to help support them , '' he said .

He tells the story of an HIV patient whose family refused to attend his funeral , and of the HIV positive eight-year-old boy who went home crying from school after his teacher told him not to play with other children . Zarni Aung now gives talks in schools and to anyone else who will listen as part of the support group Myanmar Positive .

One quarter said , within the last 12 months , they had felt discriminated against by their own families , 45 % said they had been verbally or physically assaulted and 78 % said they were aware that people were talking about them behind their backs . One quarter felt suicidal and around the same number said discrimination had forced them to quit their jobs .

But he has a powerful ally in the form of Burmese opposition leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi , who last month joined 200 people for a candlelight vigil to remember those who have died from AIDS-related illnesses .

`` I believe that with true compassion -- the invisible cord that binds us to other human beings regardless of race , personal status , religion and national borders -- we can get results for all people . ''
