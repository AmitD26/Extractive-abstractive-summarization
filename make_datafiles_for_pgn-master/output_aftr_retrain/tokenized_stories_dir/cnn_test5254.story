BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has extended for six months the cease-fire he imposed last summer on his Mehdi Army militia , al-Sadr 's office in Baghdad said Friday .

A Baghdad street is reflected in the glass over a poster of powerful Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr .

The official said a letter was distributed to all al-Sadr offices announcing the extension of the suspension , credited by the U.S. military with helping reduce the sectarian violence that has engulfed Baghdad and other hot spots across the country .

The cease-fire was announced in late August after pitched battles in Karbala and other cities between the militia and fighters aligned with its Shiite rival , the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq .

There were questions as to whether al-Sadr would continue his cease-fire .

Rogue followers of al-Sadr are thought to be among the recalcitrant militants .

`` Those who honor al-Sadr 's pledge will be treated with respect and restraint , '' the U.S. military said . `` Those who dishonor the Sadr pledge are regrettably tarnishing both the name and the honor of the movement . ''
