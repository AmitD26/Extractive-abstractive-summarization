-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two International Space Station crew members will head out Saturday morning for a spacewalk to address an ammonia leak in the orbiter 's cooling system , an emergency that forced NASA officials to work round-the-clock to hatch a plan .

First detected early Thursday morning , the leak was causing ammonia to enter space -- which could be seen in the form of `` flakes of snow '' -- at a rate of 5 pounds per day , said Mike Suffredini , NASA 's space station program manager . Ammonia is used to cool each of the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems .

`` This type of event is what the years of training were for , '' wrote Cmdr. Chris Hadfield of Canada . `` A happy , busy crew , working hard , loving life in space . ''

Hours earlier , Hadfield wrote on Twitter that his crew was planning for a Saturday spacewalk to be conducted by NASA astronauts Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn .

Cassidy and Marshburn have done two spacewalks apiece , working together both times in 2009 while on a space shuttle Endeavour mission to the space station .

`` Since the crew is prepared and our ops team is ready to go , we 're going to try to get them outside , '' said Suffredini .

Scheduled to wake up at 2 a.m. ET , the astronauts will begin their formal preparations about 1 hour and 15 minutes later , Knight said . A hatch will open around 8:15 a.m. , sometime after which Cassidy and Marshburn will start moving along a truss the 150 feet out to the site of the leak on the space station 's U.S. segment .

The space station 's crew , which also includes three Russian cosmonauts , is not in danger from the leak , NASA has said . Moreover , the agency has said the rest of the orbiter is otherwise operating normally .

The leak is in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before . NASA said crew members tried to fix a leak in November . It 's unclear whether this is the same leak or a new one .

In the Friday news conference , NASA 's Suffredini said the spacewalk and ammonia leak wo n't affect the departure -- scheduled for Monday at 7:08 p.m. ET -- of Hadfield , Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko .

Three crew members , Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Alexander Misurkin and Pavel Vinogradov , will remain on the space station when the others leave .
