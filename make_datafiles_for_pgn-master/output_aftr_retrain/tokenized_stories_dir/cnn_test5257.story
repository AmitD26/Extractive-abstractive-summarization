Lincoln finished first in a ranking by historians of the 42 former White House occupants . The survey was released over Presidents Day weekend .

`` As much as is possible , we created a poll that was non-partisan , judicious and fair-minded , '' said Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley , who helped organize the survey of 65 historians for cable television network C-SPAN .

The hero of Springfield , Illinois , finished first nine years ago as well .

`` It 's fitting that for the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln that he remains at the top of these presidential rankings , '' Brinkley said .

Founding father George Washington finished second in the new survey , followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt , Theodore Roosevelt , and Harry Truman , in that order .

Grant has traditionally received poor marks for corruption among people in his administration and the failed postwar reconstruction effort he presided over . But the nation 's 18th president may be getting a bounce from all of the recent attention focused on Lincoln , Medford said .

`` Grant won the war for Lincoln , '' she noted during an appearance on C-SPAN 's `` Washington Journal . '' `` A new look at the totality of his career may be improving his presidential stature , '' she said .

`` Bill Clinton and Ulysses S. Grant are n't often mentioned in the same sentence -- until now , '' historian Richard Norton Smith said . `` Participants in the latest -LSB- survey -RSB- have boosted each man significantly higher than in the original survey conducted in 2000 . All of which goes to show two things : the fluidity with which presidential reputations are judged , and the difficulty of assessing any president who has only just recently left office . ''

In his final news conference before stepping down last month , George W. Bush made it clear he was n't concerned with poor initial judgments of his presidency .

`` There is no such thing as short-term history , '' Bush said . `` I do n't think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time has passed . ''

The survey 's participants ranked Bush 41st on international relations and 40th on economic management -- ahead of only Herbert Hoover .
