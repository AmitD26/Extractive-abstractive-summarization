The sale of the old house , the purchase of the new house , the packing , the good-bye parties . It was all so overwhelming for me . I ca n't imagine what it was like for my toddler , leaving the only home , neighborhood and sitter she had ever known in the city where she was born . Fortunately , I got a little bit of help from the Berenstain Bears to give my daughter some answers .

It 's no wonder that I could find a Berenstain book for almost any new or difficult situation . When co-author Jan Berenstain died last month , she had written more than 330 `` Berenstain Bears '' books , first with her husband , Stan -LRB- who died in 2005 -RRB- , and later with her son , Mike . More than 260 million copies have been sold over the past 50 years , making it one of the best-selling children 's book series in history , Harper Collins said .

Mirroring all types of families

Growing up in a house filled with books , I turned to children 's literature to explore and learn about worlds beyond my experience . Now , I turn to the classics of children 's literature for assistance in parenting my way through the basic struggles in our lives , such as feelings , friendships , sharing , courtesy , differences and loss , among others . If the Berenstain Bears did n't have the answers , maybe Dr. Seuss , `` Goodnight Moon , '' `` Ferdinand the Bull '' or `` The Hungry Caterpillar '' could do the trick . The classics explained essential subjects to a young mind better than I ever could , and they reassured me , too .

Still , some of the classics did n't represent our experience or the lives of many of the families we know and love . My child has two moms . Her neighborhood friend has one mom who adopted her . Her friend across the street has a mom and dad .

`` As families have changed over the past decades , that means that there 's opportunity for books to serve families who may not be made up of Papa , Mama , Brother and Sister Bears , '' said John Sellers , children 's reviews editor for Publishers Weekly . `` There 's certainly a need for books that portray , mirror and show the value in all kinds of families : same-sex families , mixed-race families , stepfamilies , families with grandparents as guardians . ''

Here are some of my family 's modern favorites .

It 's OK to be different

A visual learner and slow reader , Parr remembers having trouble learning when schools did n't know how to help him .

Why not let your child drive the bus ?

After I became a parent in Brooklyn , my daughter and I loved that we could identify the locations that Mo Willems featured in `` Knuffle Bunny : A Cautionary Tale . '' Yes , we lived across the street from the actual Laundromat featured in the book . For a city kid , the idea of sitting on a stoop , Laundromats across the street and parks within walking distance made sense in the whimsical pictures drawn by the former Sesame Street writer .

While Willems is grateful that children identify with his work , he says he writes to understand things he does n't understand , such as friendship , love and jealousy . -LRB- `` The Duckling Gets a Cookie !? '' which comes out in April , turns jealousy on its head . -RRB-

`` Heather Has Two Mommies '' author and poet Lesl√©a Newman started writing children 's books featuring families with two mommies or two daddies after a friend stopped her on the street and demanded that she write books featuring families like hers .

My daughter had never heard a story with two mommies . She grabbed at the picture book `` Mommy , Mama and Me , '' and memorized all the words . -LRB- The companion , `` Daddy , Papa and Me '' works for the two-daddy family . -RRB- She gravitated to `` Heather has Two Mommies '' as she got older .

`` I write to tell a story , '' said Newman , who remembers reading Dr. Seuss , Curious George , Babar the elephant and `` Caps for Sale '' as favorites . `` I write to find out what I do n't know . If pressed , I 'd say my goal would be to produce a children 's book that would help any child reading that book to feel good about herself . ''

A sweet summer day in the life of an interracial family is the setting for Liz Garton Scanlon 's picture book `` All the World , '' featuring the art of Marla Frazee -LRB- who received a Caldecott Honor for this book -RRB- . The book is about global connectivity , showing families and partners of all ages and races .

As she started writing for children , Scanlon noticed themes of nature and community emerging in her work .

`` I also really think about a child 's perspective : How would they envision friendship ? What would they notice about places or parties or food or trees ? '' said Scanlon , whose favorite books growing up were `` Blueberries for Sal , '' `` Make Way for Ducklings '' and `` Where the Wild Things Are . '' `` Kids are relatively disempowered . They 're just not the big people in charge . So I really try to think about how children 's books can give some of the power back to them , just by granting importance to their perspective . ''
