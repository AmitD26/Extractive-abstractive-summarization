Constructive criticism is fine , said Franklin Garvizu , a congressman from the president 's party . But officials have seen something more nefarious , he said .

Bolivian opposition leaders have a different take . They say such comments show the government 's authoritarian aim to censor social networks .

Word that the government is monitoring information on digital news websites and social networks , and weighing regulating them , sparked sharp criticism among some on the streets of the capital city of La Paz .

Others , like Cristina Perez , noted that the tone of discourse had gotten out of hand .

That means government officials , he said , should see social media as an opportunity government can join , rather than a threat .

Online , he said , `` you can defend , promote and spread human rights , and on the other hand complaints . ''

`` It is a device that can be used to deepen democracy , '' he said .
