Nairobi , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- No one at the Railway Golf Club in the heart of Nairobi quite remembers if Barack Obama , Sr. , the father of the 44th U.S. president , ever played here when he was a high-flying civil servant in the 1960s . Perhaps he played up the road at the Royal Nairobi Golf Club , the oldest of the city 's six golf establishments , someone suggests .

The club scene was certainly the natural ecosystem for the pipe-smoking Harvard-educated economist , and the hordes of other young Africans just returned from the world 's top universities to take over their newly independent country .

Dr. Simeon Onyango , is in the pharmaceuticals business and a widely travelled man . He thinks the world of President Obama .

The Kenyan capital is a land of dramatic contrasts . From a rooftop bar on Mombasa Road , the main highway to the airport and on to the coast , you can sometimes see in the distance herds of buffalo , giraffe and the odd lion . Once in a while , when the big cats wander into the villages and kill their cattle , Maasai warriors take out their spears and hunt them down . It is a city that likes to keep in touch with its wild side .

Kibera , Kenya 's biggest slum , is Obamaland . Here , the people are less guarded , more passionate about politics . Their living conditions are terrible . They have given rise to a peculiar activity , slum tourism , where wealthy people journey from all over the world to come and see squalor .

The ring of slums to the south co-exist cheek-to-jowl with Lavington , one of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods . Every morning crowds of workers stream through Lavington for their 15-kilometer walk to the city 's industrial zone .

James Mwanzia , 25 , sells charcoal , used by thousands of poor household for fuel . `` The highlight of his term was killing Osama bin Laden , which is something other presidents have not been successful in doing , '' he says .

Kenyan perception of America has also changed over the years . The U.S. is recognized as a powerful actor not just in regional affairs , but in national affairs . There is a growing belief in Kenya that America exercises its immense power only in its own interest -- sort of like a wealthy friend who comes to a party with lots of food , but does not share .

Last October , Kenyan forces crossed the border into Somalia in pursuit of Al-Shabaab . The region 's first contact with jihadist terrorism was in August 1998 when al Qaeda bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam . There was an outpouring of sympathy for America . But when Kenyan forces entered Somalia , the U.S. stayed out of it .

James Thumi , who sells software , feels Obama has not been sufficiently engaged with Africa . While his predecessors had big initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight Aids , Tuberculosis and Malaria , and the African Growth and Opportunity Act , which offers African companies preferential access to the U.S. textiles market , Obama has been pre-occupied with domestic issues .

America also uses travel advisories to chide the Kenyan government for policies with which it disagrees , according to Thumi .

In K'ogelo , a village about 400 kilometers west of Nairobi and the home of the Obamas , a victory party is being planned . At the Railway Club , golfers pay no heed to the scorching sun and are out on the green . In the club house , members speak quietly into their cell phones . A few are on their iPads , most likely keeping a worried eye on RealClearPolitics.com to see which ones are leaning and which ones are toss-ups .
