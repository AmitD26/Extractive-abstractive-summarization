-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I know just what a lot of those so-called DREAMers deserve to get for Christmas : a scolding . There are good and bad actors in every movement , and the bad ones -- if not kept in check -- can drag the good ones down with them .

Having declared their intention to better themselves , some in the DREAMer movement now insist that they 're entitled to better treatment than run-of-the-mill illegal immigrants . You know , like the hardworking and humble folks who cut your lawn , clean your house or care for your kids . In fact , the DREAMers seem to suggest they 're due a reward for good behavior .

-- `` Fair treatment for DREAMers and our families and communities , including a road map to citizenship for 11 million Americans without papers and an end to senseless deportations and abuses '' ;

-- `` Growth and diversity of our movement for change , intensifying efforts to become more inclusive of non-Latinos , LGBTQ communities , differently abled people , people of faith , and other groups . ''

Gee , kids , can we get you anything else ? Maybe free massages the next time you stage a sit-in ? These kids want it all .

Faces of hope line up for two more years in the U.S. .

They demand more than just the ability to live in the United States legally and not have to worry about being deported as many others have been . This is no small thing . The Obama administration removed more than 1.5 million illegal immigrants over the last four years , and there 's every indication it plans to remove just as many in a second term . Some of those who have been deported were DREAMers , despite President Obama 's claim that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is removing only hardened criminals .

The DREAMers chalked up a victory . But what some seem to really want is the golden ticket : U.S. citizenship . And they want it yesterday . They 're convinced that they deserve it , and they 'll settle for nothing less . Many of them reject , even ridicule , proposals by Republicans in Congress to give them legal status without citizenship -- and the voting privileges that come with it .

While they probably do n't realize it , their public tantrums are turning people against them and hurting the chances for a broader immigration reform package . And if they set back that cause , heaven help them . They 'll sink the progress for a group of people who have given more , worked harder and made greater sacrifices -- people like their undocumented parents . You know , the people who brought them to this country in the first place for a better life , and then fed them , clothed them and sheltered them . These are the folks who told the DREAMers they were special , long before that became the official position of the immigration reform movement .

It comes from people like Arnold Torres , a Mexican-American political strategist in California -LRB- disclosure : he 's a friend and business partner -RRB- who supports comprehensive immigration reform and has the credentials to prove it . More than 25 years ago , Torres was executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens and helped shape the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act . Today , a lot of folks on the left talk about creating a pathway to legal status for millions of the undocumented . This guy actually helped do it .

DREAMers : Deferred deportation

For almost a year , I 've been listening to him grumble about the DREAMers and their goals .

Torres worries that the DREAMers could , through their hubris , alienate supporters and make it harder to win the backing of Republicans for a larger immigration reform plan .

But why should this surprise us ? Feeling entitled is the American way . And these kids are as American as they come . They may have been born in another country , but -- unlike their parents -- they were raised in this one . They bleed red , white and blue , use English as their primary language and tweet up a storm before breakfast . And in a country whose motto has gone from `` E Pluribus Unum '' to `` Gim me , gim me . Where 's mine ? , '' they 're not about to be left behind .

DREAM ` ers were n't born ; they were created . Not long ago , the conventional wisdom in Washington was that immigration reform was n't going to happen soon . So forget women and children . It was DREAMers first . No wonder these kids think they 're special . Everyone tells them so .

There 's only one problem . These people are still in the United States illegally . They do n't like being reminded of this , but it 's true . So they 'd be wise to tread lightly -- especially since they do n't have the leverage they once did .

These kids are just not that special anymore . That is , except to themselves .
