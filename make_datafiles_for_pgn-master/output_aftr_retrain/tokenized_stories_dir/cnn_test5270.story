Will Texas Gov. Rick Perry run for re-election next year for an unprecedented fourth full term in office ?

We should find out Monday , when Perry is expected to make his intentions known at an event in San Antonio in front of friends and supporters .

Perry to announce political future Monday

The conventional wisdom is that Perry is leaning against another term in Austin , as Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott , a fellow Republican , gears up for running . And if Perry does n't run for re-election in 2014 , the thought is that he would make another bid for the White House , in 2016 .

But note that Perry has bucked conventional wisdom in the past .

Perry blames abortion rights activists for ` absolute anarchy '

The push in Texas comes after other states have passed such bans in recent years , including Nebraska , Kansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Indiana and Alabama . Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 18 weeks , and North Dakota has the tightest restriction in the country at six weeks , when a fetal heartbeat can be detected .

The abortion issue will also be front and center in North Carolina , when state lawmakers return to Raleigh this week .

The state Senate just passed a series of anti-abortion amendments that were tacked onto a bill that would ban Sharia law . The measures do n't include a 20-week provision but would place increased standards on abortion clinics and limit health care coverage for abortions .

North Carolina joins states legislating against abortion

The action now moves back to the state House , which has passed the Sharia law bill without the abortion restrictions .

On the federal level , Sen. Marco Rubio is considering a request by anti-abortion groups to sponsor a bill in the U.S. Senate that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks , an adviser to the Florida Republican confirmed to CNN on Wednesday .

`` I can tell you that the pro-life groups are asking Senator Rubio to sponsor the bill in the Senate . He 's on a family vacation this week and will decide when he returns to D.C. next week , '' said the adviser , who asked for anonymity to speak more freely .

Marjorie Dannenfelser , president of the Susan B. Anthony List , said her organization has been leading efforts to recruit Rubio to sponsor the bill in the Senate . `` He wants to , and that 's good news , '' she told CNN on Tuesday .

Susan B. Anthony List describes itself as a group `` dedicated to electing candidates and pursuing polices that will reduce and ultimately end abortion . ''

But conservatives have criticized the first-term senator in the past couple of months for his big push for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package that includes a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country .

The Republican-controlled House passed a similar late-term abortion ban bill last month , with only six Republicans voting against the measure and six Democrats voting for it . The bill prohibits most abortions for women beyond their 20th week of pregnancy .

The measure is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate , and the White House has threatened a veto on the legislation .

With the Senate passing a bipartisan immigration reform bill a week and a half ago , the spotlight has shifted to the GOP-dominated House . House Republicans meet behind closed doors Wednesday to discuss their next steps .

Immigration reform looks doubtful in House as lawmakers quarrel

The Senate bill , which passed 68-32 , included a last-minute , bipartisan amendment , which called for tougher border security measures , to make the overall legislation more acceptable to Republicans .

The same day that House Republicans powwow , former President George W. Bush speaks about immigration at his recently opened presidential library in Texas . The title of the event : `` What Immigrants Contribute . ''
