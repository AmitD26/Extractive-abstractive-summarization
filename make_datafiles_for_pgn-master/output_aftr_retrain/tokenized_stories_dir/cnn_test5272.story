`` My father did a lot of things to help other people , even though his public stance appeared opposite , '' Washington-Williams said . `` I was sensitive about his well-being and career and his family here in South Carolina . ''

Butler 's sister took the girl to live in Pennsylvania when she was 6 months old . She did not meet Thurmond until 1941 , when she was 16 .

Her mother , who was ill and died a short time later , had insisted on introducing her to Thurmond , who acknowledged her as his daughter , the Washngton Post reported in 2003 .

Throughout the years , the two kept up a relationship despite the divide over race , Washington-Williams said .

`` When my father became a United States senator -LSB- in 1954 -RSB- , his communication and support continued '' she said , and `` his financial support was constant during various phases of my life . I knew him beyond his public image . ''
