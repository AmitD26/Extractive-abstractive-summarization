-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the summer ocean waves wash up onto America 's beaches , we find ourselves thinking , nervously , about Steven Spielberg 's `` Jaws '' and the paralyzing fear that sharks inspire in us . Yet , paradoxically , we celebrate global attempts to protect the declining number of sharks . The world has figured out we need these species , along with all creatures of the Earth , to maintain a delicately balanced ecosystem .

In California , and other states , a ban on the sale and possession of shark fin soup has gone into effect this year after aggressive marketing campaigns by WildAid and other organizations .

Overseas , marketing and public diplomacy efforts featuring posters on public transportation systems and TV ads have been underway for the past few years . These efforts all show signs of success , on both the supply side and the demand side of trade in shark fins . Hong Kong 's Census and Statistics Department tracked 3,100 metric tons of shark fin being imported from the island to China last year , but this year 's numbers are way down .

Stopping the killing of sharks is part of a broader movement to stop the killing of wild animals and the trafficking of wildlife products around the world -- products that come from poaching elephants , tigers and rhinos , in addition to killing marine life .

For example , the poaching of elephants in search of ivory tusks for luxury goods had became a full-scale war between poachers , who are sometimes terrorists , and governments in parts of Africa . Illegal shipments of tusks across porous borders bring in the prizes of money and weapons .

Once a marginalized issue of U.S. foreign policy , Clinton and current Secretary of State John Kerry have placed wildlife trafficking at the top of the agenda , given its wide tentacles to Africa , Asia , Russia , Indonesia and consumers in almost every country .

And we can track the results of wildlife trafficking and punish the offenders .

This is one of those rare international tales of where the public and private sector , along with Hollywood , can create a very different kind of movie .
