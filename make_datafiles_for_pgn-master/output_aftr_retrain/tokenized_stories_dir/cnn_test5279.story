-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the early days of the Web , the mantra `` information wants to be free '' made the rounds . In music circles now , `` music wants to be shared '' seems to be the idea .

The big record labels now allow fans to play their songs free on social networking sites .

Increasingly for instance it 's easy to `` tweet '' to others what you 're listening to . -LRB- A tweet is a post on Twitter , the micro-blogging site where you can broadcast to followers what you 're doing , in 140 characters or less . -RRB-

For instance Skype users can opt to display , next to their names , whatever song they 're playing on iTunes .

A new site called Blip.fm specializes in this , except it calls the tweets about what you 're listening to `` blips . ''

In effect , you get your own DJ space . Along with the song , you can add a comment about it . Many users now have hundreds of listeners on their Blip.fm page .

Copyright lawyers could clamp down on this sort of thing , says Mike McGuire , an analyst with research firm Gartner . Technically , at least . Businesses that play music to a crowd are supposed to pay a performance royalty to ASCAP , BMI or one of the other performance-rights organizations .

But they 're not likely to , says McGuire : `` Nobody will bother about that unless and until the clubs engaging in this become really popular . ''

Earphone manufacturers can incorporate Jook technology . With Jook-enabled earphones , you can broadcast what you 're playing -LRB- Us mode -RRB- , and then others sitting nearby can listen in -LRB- U mode -RRB- .

Jook is platform-independent , so it works even if you have an iPod from Apple and your listener has a Zune from Microsoft .

The way people discover music , he notes , has changed . It 's no longer from a music nerd behind a counter , a la John Cusack in the movie `` High Fidelity . ''

Anyone now can be that music nerd -- and there are ever more ways to share the music .
