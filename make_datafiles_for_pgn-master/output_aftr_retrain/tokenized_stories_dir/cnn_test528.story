-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At 35,000 feet , the orange glow of a European sunrise begins to pierce the horizon from beneath a tufted layer of clouds . Unfortunately , it will be only a matter of minutes before that glow transforms into a pupil-penetrating annoyance through the windscreen of our 777 .

The irritating glare wo n't , of course , affect the way we navigate our way to London 's Heathrow Airport ; a complicated and well-engineered computer system using GPS positioning provides information to air traffic controllers . But what if this well-oiled machine breaks down ? Do we need to start worrying ?

But while a malfunction affecting the flight of objects hurtling through the sky at 600 mph might sound scary , rest assured that Mom and Dad celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary are n't at any risk of colliding with another airliner en route . It just means they might be a little late arriving for their vacation .

Airplanes that are already airborne receive priority by virtue of the fact controllers understand that only a finite amount of fuel remains in the tanks . As airline pilots , it becomes a matter of calculating whether our fuel on board is sufficient to fly a few circles in a holding pattern or divert to our alternate airport . Traditional radar is still available once the flight travels in range of a land-based facility . Departures , however , will be delayed until the situation is rectified or mitigated .

As it has been since the days of the DC-3 , the track system is a nonradar environment . Radar signals do n't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean , so before airplanes enter the North Atlantic track system , from either east or west , a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude . In other words , airplanes are separated both vertically and laterally based on their known performance . This is still the case . Before the latest computer technology became prevalent , oceanic controllers would track airplanes manually based on verbal pilot position reports at designated degrees of longitude .

With the advent of more precise navigation , more precise onboard automation and more exact ground-based air traffic control systems , the separation limits have decreased , allowing for more flights between North America and Europe . All this means that airplanes can still maintain this separation even if the ground-based oceanic computers take a temporary vacation .

How ?
