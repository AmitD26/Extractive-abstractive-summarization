Tony Abbott -- the opposition leader who hopes to unseat Kevin Rudd as prime minister on September 7 -- has been the worst offender , with a series of missteps that have threatened to derail his center-right Liberal Party 's momentum . Opinion polls have Abbott 's coalition marginally ahead of Rudd 's center-left Labor Party by 52 points to 48 .

The most serious blunder came on Tuesday when Abbott praised a female candidate 's `` sex appeal '' while campaigning in the Western Sydney seat of Lindsay .

The remarks were seized upon by feminists and other critics as evidence that Abbott holds outdated attitudes towards women , an allegation previously made by former Prime Minster Julia Gillard , who once told the Australian parliament : `` If -LRB- Abbott -RRB- wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern Australia , he does n't need a motion in the House of Representatives , he needs a mirror . ''

Abbott 's comments triggered a torrent of criticism and ridicule on social media .

`` My first reaction to this statement was utter disbelief , '' wrote one Facebook user . `` I am still astonished that this language is considered acceptable . ''

`` My policy is pretty simple : in modern Australia , neither sexism , nor racism , nor homophobia has any place whatsoever , '' he told reporters . `` I believe people look to their national leaders to set that sort of example . ''

Abbott has previously come in for ridicule for projecting a Putin-esque , `` macho man '' image , including being photographed at ocean swim events in revealing swimming trunks . Images of Abbott in his `` budgie smugglers , '' as the style is known colloquially in Australia , were circulated online following his latest remarks , with a caption asking : `` Just how much sex appeal does it take to win an election , Tony ? ''

An aspiring candidate for Abbott 's Liberal Party also found himself the target of social media jibes Tuesday following an embarrassing on-camera freeze when questioned about his party 's immigration policy . Jaymes Diaz , a candidate in the New South Wales seat of Greenway , told a television reporter his party had a six-point plan to `` stop the boats '' of illegal migrants , but was unable to articulate what any of those points might be .

The slew of political gaffes inspired comedian John Oliver , of the popular U.S. satirical program The Daily Show , to urge the United States to emulate Australia and condense its campaigning into one month , promising they would not miss out on any of the entertaining blunders of a typical election season .

`` You might think , ` Hold on John , if our elections were just four weeks , we would n't get to have all the fun of watching the human gaffe-alanches on the campaign trail , ' '' he said . `` But here 's the thing -- you 're wrong . You name a great campaign moment and Australia will get to it this month . ''

In April , U.S. President Barack Obama apologized after describing California 's Attorney General Kamala Harris to an audience of Democratic donors as `` by far the best-looking attorney general in the country , '' a remark that was criticized by some as sexist .
