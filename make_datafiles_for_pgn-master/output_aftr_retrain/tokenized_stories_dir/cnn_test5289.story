Last fall TV season a plethora of shows burst onto the small screen with leading gay characters in everything from comedies to musical dramas . Many of those series have since been canceled .

That means that a possible wedding between the characters of Mitchell and Cameron on ABC 's `` Modern Family '' in the wake of the Supreme Court striking down the Defense of Marriage Act this summer could have an affect on those who may be still on the fence about same-sex marriage .

`` Hearing our stories makes it harder for people not to support us when it comes to the ballot box or the politicians that they choose to support , '' said Matt Kane , GLAAD 's associate director of Entertainment Media . `` It is important that our stories get out there and TV is one of the best ways to do that . ''

When NBC 's comedy `` The New Normal '' premiered last fall , it was heralded by the LGBT community for its plot about a gay male couple trying to have a baby . David Wiegand , the San Francisco Chronicle 's TV critic , noted that while that show did n't catch on with fans , NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt said at the Television Critics Association summer press tour that he did n't believe the gay characters on the show turned away viewers .

Rather , as NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke pointed out , audiences are less patient these days in terms of giving a struggling series time to catch on .

Kane said there are some bright spots in the upcoming broadcast TV season , including returning LGBT characters on shows like `` Glee , '' the aforementioned `` Modern Family '' and `` Grey 's Anatomy . '' He said there is greater racial diversity among LGBT characters this year , including Aisha Hinds as half of an interracial lesbian couple on CBS ' `` Under The Dome '' and Andre Braugher portraying a gay police captain on Fox 's new cop comedy `` Brooklyn Nine-Nine '' starring `` Saturday Night Live '' alum Andy Samberg .

GLADD recently put out the Studio Responsibility Index , which found that , with the exception of a handful of movies like `` The Perks of Being a Wallflower '' and `` Pitch Perfect , '' most big films lack any significant LGBT presence . GLAAD also produces a report , `` Where We Are On TV , '' which Cruz said acts as a resource for networks . He said the trend this season will be diversity and GLADD would like to see even more of that as well as a greater variety of gay roles in various genres such as sci-fi .
