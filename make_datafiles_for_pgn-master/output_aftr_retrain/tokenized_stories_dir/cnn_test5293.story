Rescuers rushed to evacuate people and tend to the wounded , who were lined up on stretchers near the smashed train cars .

At least 315 people were hurt in the accident , which occurred just after 7 a.m. in a western suburb of Buenos Aires , Argentina 's state-run Telam news agency reported .

`` The lights went out suddenly , and there was an explosion . I was in the last car . The only thing you could hear were screams , '' passenger German Garay told Telam . `` People became desperate to get out . They were stepping on each other . ''

`` We want to determine if it was foul play or an accident , '' Transportation Minister Florencio Randazzo told reporters . `` If it could have been avoided , it was not accident , and there will be one or more people responsible . ''

Transportation officials said the trains had been checked by mechanical engineering inspectors in March .

Thursday 's crash happened nearly 16 months after a commuter train on the same rail line crashed into a barrier at a station in Buenos Aires , killing 50 people and injuring hundreds .

Now a government consortium oversees the train line , rather than a private company .

But family members of victims of the 2012 crash said Thursday 's collision was a sign that little has changed .

And government officials , she claimed , continue sending trains to corrupt companies for repair .

Journalist Ivan Perez Sarmenti and CNN 's Miguel Escalona contributed to this report .
