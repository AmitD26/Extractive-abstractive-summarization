Another tornado was seen at Chickasha , about 40 miles southwest of Oklahoma City . It later reached Newcastle , before pushing through Moore and Norman , suburbs of Oklahoma City . The National Weather Service warned residents and I-44 drivers to take precautionary action .

About 1,200 people packed a shelter in Newcastle , a bedroom community near Oklahoma City , during the storm , said City Manager Nick Nazar . `` That saved lives . ''

`` We have been extremely lucky , '' he said . `` Minor injuries so far . ''

About 100 people were displaced , and 50 homes were rendered uninhabitable , Nazar told CNN . Two or three businesses were damaged , as was an elementary school .

`` It came right past the store , '' said Chickasha AutoZone employee Nathaniel Charlton . `` They had a little debris thrown across the parking lot . It was on the ground , but it was n't bad . ''

Sirens went off about 20 minutes before the storm pushed through , Charlton told CNN .

State officials received reports of damaged businesses in Chickasha .

KWTV broadcast images of destroyed and damaged homes in El Reno .

The University of Oklahoma , based in Norman , on Tuesday afternoon suspended classes at its three campuses .

As the storm struck at about 5:45 p.m. , he and the wait staff watched news programs on the restaurant 's 10 television sets in fear , he said . But when it hit , they were unimpressed . `` Just rain , '' said de Leon in a telephone interview . `` It looked like normal rain . '' Hail was mixed in , but the bits of ice were nothing special , `` little bitty ones , '' he said .

Two hours later , he said , the restaurant had filled up and it was business as usual .
