What happened to her body afterward ? It was stashed in a recycling bin , rolled outside , then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern Massachusetts high school 's athletic fields , adds another source . It was left there -- not buried , not even covered .

Those are the answers , many of them revealed Thursday , two days after the teacher 's killing . Yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends , family and co-workers described as reserved and well-behaved -- continues to loom large .

Chism , who had moved to the Boston suburb of Danvers before the start of the school year , remained jailed without bond Thursday . A grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step : If they indict him for first - or second-degree murder , he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult , based on Massachusetts law .

Meanwhile , the tight-knit North Shore community is still trying to make sense of what he allegedly did and of life without a teacher who so many appreciated , learned from and loved .

Two missing persons ' reports come together

One of those students was Chism , a freshman .

He 'd been doodling and listening to music during his Algebra I class in the school 's final period , classmate Cambria Cloutier told CNN . Creating such drawings was unusual for Chism , who Cloutier recalled rarely participated in class discussions but was `` a really good student . ''

When the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. Tuesday , Ritzer asked him to stay after class , according to Cloutier , who sat two desks over from Chism .

At some point that afternoon , Ritzer went to a regular students ' girls bathroom on Danver High 's second floor , as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom , a source close to the investigation said .

There , Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m. , said a source .

Her body went into a recycling bin , then outside the school where it was tossed . Authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment some 100 feet away from Ritzer 's body , a source said .

Before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they 'd started looking for Chism .

This was in the early evening , with Danvers Police tweeting to residents that he had n't returned home and was last seen around the Hollywood Hits movie theater in the town some 20 miles northeast of Boston .

While they were looking for him , police got a call around 11:20 p.m. Tuesday about another missing person : Ritzer . She was n't home either , nor had she answered her phones .

The stories started coming together about an hour later , when police officers in nearby Topsfield found Chism walking along Route 1 .

A quiet and normal student

Chism is a quiet young man , those who know him said . He excelled at soccer and made a harmless impression .

`` He ... seemed quiet and reserved , but he just seemed normal , '' said Ariana Edwards , who was in Chism 's English class .

Friends got their first hint that something was awry when Chism did n't show up for soccer practice Tuesday . The team set out to look for him after seeing texts that he was missing .

A teacher who went the extra mile

Meanwhile , many were at a loss in Danvers to explain the death of Ritzer -- a woman who inspired many , whether it be in the classroom or online , with her heart , intellect and positive spirit .

`` She was talking on Saturday about this year was a good year . She was teaching freshmen for the first time . She was happy , '' said Jen Berger , Ritzer 's best friend . `` I do n't even know what the world is like without her . It 's a scary thought . ''

`` She believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals , '' the university said . `` In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to ` helping students in times of need . ' ''

`` No matter what happens in life , be good to people , '' she wrote in August . `` Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind . ''
