Melissa Rauch , who plays Bernadette Rostenkowski , moderated the panel . Johnny Galecki , who plays Leonard Hofstadter , arrived in full `` Star Wars '' regalia , and the iconic physicist Stephen Hawking recorded a video message that featured him singing the show 's theme song .

The real question , one that has been plaguing fans especially since last season , is whether Jim Parsons ' Sheldon Cooper and Amy will finally consummate their romantic relationship .

`` I `` ll use Sheldon 's words and say ` It 's a possibility , ' '' writer Steve Holland said .

The writers also addressed whether the cast would ever find themselves at San Diego Comic-Con in an episode of `` The Big Bang Theory . ''

Comic-Con is certainly the right place for this particular group of writers , however , who do a lot of research on the various science and geek topics that are integral to the show .

`` We 're all pretty comfortable with the geekery , '' Holland said . `` Sometimes we have ideas from articles we 've read or we have a vague notion of , or sometimes we put in brackets ` Science to come . ' ''
