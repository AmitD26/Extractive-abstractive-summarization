Yosemite National Park , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They look like cumulus clouds rolling through the park -- puffy and white . But they are more sinister than that .

The clouds are from a huge wildfire in northern California , which is threatening Yosemite .

Firefighters hope to keep it that way .

`` This is going to be a tough fire . It 's going to continue for a few more weeks , '' said Tom Tidwell , chief of the U.S. Forest Service .

Crews are doing their best , but just a spark or two could send the inferno raging .

`` It is dangerous for them right now , '' Cal Fire Division Chief Mike Ramirez said . `` When you 're on a ridge like this and the fire is below you , that is a recipe for disaster . ''

Tuolumne is on the northern edge of the Rim Fire , a monster of a wildfire that has charred more than 192,000 acres . It 's the seventh-largest blaze in California history , requiring the efforts of more than 4,500 personnel .

The blaze was 30 % contained as of evening Wednesday .

`` To be this close is to be scared , '' said Murphy , a wildlife rehabilitator who lives in the threatened town with her husband . `` But we 're ready ; we 're packed ; we 've already moved the animals . ''

`` We will leave when we have to , but it 's amazing to watch , '' Murphy said .

A threat to the Bay Area water supply

The commission said it was confident the Rim Fire would not affect the reservoir : `` Due to the rocky , granite terrain and limited brush along the perimeter of the reservoir , there is little risk for direct water quality impacts . ''

Because of the approaching flames , officials shut down the generators , and the city -- more than 120 miles to the west -- temporarily is getting power from elsewhere .

`` All of San Francisco 's municipal electric customers continue to be fully supplied ; there will be no interruption in electric service , '' the commission said .

More evacuations possible

The Tuolumne County Sheriff 's Office , meanwhile , issued evacuation advisories for Tuolumne and nearby Ponderosa Hill , said InciWeb , a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management . It was not clear how many residents were covered by the evacuation advisory .

Evacuations also remained in place for areas south of Highway 120 -LRB- including Scotts Ridge -RRB- , north of Old Yosemite Road and along the Highway 108 corridor between Tuolumne City and Pinecrest .

Authorities say the Rim Fire started on August 17 . The cause is under investigation .

`` There 's a lot of concern , and there 's a lot of work to be done , '' U.S. Forest Service spokesman Lee Bentley said .

`` Access and difficult terrain remain concerns for crews and equipment , '' said an incident report . `` Rapid fire growth and extreme fire behavior are hampering suppression efforts . ''

About 4,500 structures , many of them vacation homes , were under threat , InciWeb said . The fire has cost more than $ 39 million to date .
