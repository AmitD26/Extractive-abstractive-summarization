`` I am very proud of her and I love her very much , '' Brett Anderson said . `` She is surrounded by the love of her family , friends and community . ''

The 16-year-old was found alive after a frantic , week-long search that stretched from southern California to the wilderness of central Idaho , more than 1,000 miles away , where she was found at a campsite by a mountain lake . At a news conference in San Diego , Brett Anderson thanked investigators as well as reporters and social media users who spread the story `` across and beyond '' the United States .

How to help Hannah Anderson

`` Obviously we would have liked for Mr. DiMaggio to surrender and face justice in the court of law , '' Gore said . `` But that 's not going to be the case . ''

Hannah did not appear to have significant physical injuries and was reunited with her father Sunday . She was unaware that her mother and brother were dead until after DiMaggio was killed , when she was told of their killings by FBI interviewers , Gore said .

Gore would discuss no details of Hannah 's abduction except to say she was under `` extreme duress '' the entire time . He said the investigation is still going on , but cautioned , `` We might never know some of these answers . ''

`` When you get a completely irrational act like we 've seen here , with two murders and a kidnapping , sometimes you 're not going to come up with a rational explanation of what happened , '' he said .

` Uncle Jim ' and his interest in Hannah

But there were some signs that DiMaggio was infatuated with Hannah and signs he was trying to lure the family to his home in rural San Diego County , near the Mexican border , her grandparents said .

`` There was no danger sign , nothing that you would act on , say it was wrong , '' he said . `` It was just friendly . ''

Marissa Chavez told CNN that she was in a car with Hannah and DiMaggio , 40 , a few months ago when he told Hannah he had a crush on her .

He followed it up by saying if he was her age , he would date Hannah , Chavez said .

But Hannah did not want to be alone with DiMaggio after that , according to Chavez .

In an earlier episode , Chavez recalled a trip that DiMaggio and Hannah took to Hollywood .

The trip was supposed to be for one week , but Hannah told Chavez that they came back after two days because DiMaggio was upset that she was n't paying enough attention to him .

Sara Britt said DiMaggio would have done anything for them and they would have returned the favor .

In the weeks before DiMaggio 's home in rural San Diego County went up in flames , he pleaded for the Andersons to visit him one last time . He had lost the home to foreclosure and said he was moving back to Texas .

Hannah went missing after cheerleading practice on August 3 . The next day , the bodies of her mother , Christina Anderson , 42 , and 8-year-old brother , Ethan , were found about 45 miles east of San Diego , in DiMaggio 's burned house in Boulevard . The body of a dog was also recovered , police said .

Mark John , one of those riders , said Sunday that they saw multiple `` red flags '' during their brief encounter , including the brand-new camping equipment they carried and the pajama-like bottoms Hannah was wearing .

It was `` just like a square peg going into a round hole , '' John said . `` They did n't fit . ''

Another rider , Mike Young , said it looked like Hannah `` had a scared look on her face , '' adding about DiMaggio : `` I just had a gut feeling about him . ''

Unaware of the Amber Alert , however , the horseback riders continued on , and only after seeing a news report on the pair upon returning home did the group put the puzzle pieces together .

Hundreds of law enforcement agents started to scour 300 square miles of rough terrain -- dense forests , steep valleys and peaks over 8,000 feet -- hampered by the smoke from nearby wildfires .

Late Saturday afternoon , they spotted the pair 's campsite near Morehead Lake , about 30 miles from Cascade . But the topography was so steep , helicopters had to drop authorities off far away from the camp .

Hostage rescue teams had to hike more than two hours to get to the scene , local sheriffs ' departments said . They moved in carefully so they would n't alert DiMaggio that they were coming . They moved in after DiMaggio and the girl were separated , unshering Hannah to an area where a helicopter could whisk her away .

At some point , a `` confrontation '' ensued between authorities and DiMaggio , Gore said . The confrontation ended when an FBI tactical agent shot and killed the murder and kidnapping suspect .
