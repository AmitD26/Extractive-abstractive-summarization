When the New Jersey Supreme Court decided that Vincent August Sicari must choose between his career as a municipal judge and his other career in the entertainment industry , he decided it was n't yet the time to have a last laugh .

Vincent August Sicari has practiced both law and comedy for over 15 years , and in January 2008 he became a part-time municipal judge in South Hackensack . While a judge , he continued to pursue his entertainment career as a standup comedian and actor , including appearing on the TV show `` What Would You Do ? '' under the name Vince August , according to court documents .

`` I 'm disappointed . I 'm proud of being a judge ; I take great pride in it . It is a great life accomplishment , a great career accomplishment , '' Sicari told CNN Thursday . `` I do n't like being forced to make a decision . ''

`` I 'm going to keep doing what I was doing , but now I 'm not a judge , '' Sicari said .

According to court documents , Sicari provided information about his standup routines to the Advisory Committee on Extrajudicial Activities following his municipal court appointment . After the panel determined that his comedy career was a conflict , he appealed to the state 's high court .

One canon of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges `` to conduct any extrajudicial activities in a manner to avoid casting reasonable doubt on the judge 's capacity to act impartially as a judge . ''

Sicari could be seen in various roles on `` What Would You Do ? '' -- a show that features social experiments to capture public 's reactions to real-life scenarios played out by actors .

The judges noted that his roles portraying homophobia , racial profiling and other forms of discrimination could be misleading to someone catching a glimpse of the show before changing the channel . His routines at comedy clubs often involve politics and religion .

`` When I 'm a lawyer I 'm focused on that , when I 'm on stage , on set , I focus on that , '' he told CNN . `` I thought I 've done it pretty well . ''
