-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Work hard , play hard . In Seoul , it 's easy to do both .

The city 's metro area is home to roughly 20 million residents , whose penchant for working long hours has helped transform the country into an economic power in the last half-century .

When the capital city 's residents need a break , there 's a host of options open to them . Seoul is bursting with cultural events , a buzzing nightlife and lively eating spots .

Gregory Curley : It 's very cosmopolitan . It 's very large and very fast paced . It 's hectic but exciting at the same time , and extremely dynamic . It actually never sleeps . I really mean that . It 's not that things never seem to shut down , there 's always something happening .

CNN : What are your favorite districts ?

CNN : What are some other highlights ?

My favorite dish is a spicy chicken dish called dak tori tang . It 's fantastic . But also a huge favorite of mine is Korean barbeque .

Food has a very important place in Korean culture -- not only in the manner in which it is prepared , but also in the way it is consumed . Restaurants are social playgrounds . I have many memories of being huddled around a table cooking marinated meats and drinking soju amongst friends .

CNN : Seoul is undergoing some major design changes . Do you have a favorite public space ?

CNN : Do you have any favorite or lasting memories ?

GC : My friend was one of the organizers of the Pentaport Rock Festival . Amazing time . And quite possibly one of my fondest memories in Korea .

GC : Exploring the country outside of Seoul is a great way to get to the heart of Korean culture . If you drive straight east from Seoul you reach Donghae , which is quite picturesque . The area 's great for seafood and swimming .

My favorite beach along the east coast is Naksan Beach -LRB- in the north , just south of Donghae -RRB- and Chilpo Beach -LRB- in the south , just north of Pohang -RRB- . Donghae is great because it has that coastal charm -- a very laid back atmosphere with friendly folk and fantastic seafood .
