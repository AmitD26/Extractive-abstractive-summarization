The superhero film began its run with a massive $ 125.1 million -LRB- $ 113.1 million over the traditional weekend , $ 12 million from corporate screening programs on Thursday -RRB- , breaking the record for the biggest June opening weekend ever , ahead of Toy Story 3 's $ 110.3 million bow in 2010 . Among 2013 films , Man of Steel had the second best debut of the year behind Iron Man 3 , which started with $ 174.1 million in May .

For Cavill , Adams , and the rest of the cast -- which includes Russell Crowe , Diane Lane , Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , and Michael Shannon -- Man of Steel became their best ever opening weekend . The same goes for director Zack Snyder , who formerly saw gigantic numbers when 300 bowed with $ 70.9 million in 2007 .

What ` Man of Steel ' gets wrong about Superman

The news could n't be better for Warner Bros. , which -- with the exceptions of The Great Gatsby and 42 -- has badly struggled at the box office in 2013 . Films like Jack the Giant Slayer , The Hangover Part III , Beautiful Creatures , Bullet to the Head , and The Incredible Burt Wonderstone have massively under-performed at the box office , so Man of Steel 's success is a welcome change . `` We 're thrilled , '' says Dan Fellman , the studio 's president of domestic distribution , `` and it will fly through the summer . We 're going to have legs on this film . ''

Fellman also notes that Man of Steel 's success brings Warner Bros. and DC Comics one step closer to creating a Justice League franchise that might rival Marvel/Disney 's Avengers . The exec would n't confirm whether Henry Cavill has already been contracted to star in Justice League films , though he did coyly remark , `` Henry will be around for a while . ''

Internationally , Man of Steel soared with $ 71.6 million in its first weekend , including $ 17.6 million in the United Kingdom and $ 9.8 million in Mexico . The film has yet to open in a number of large markets , but it 's already clear that it will easily outdo Superman Returns $ 191 million international haul .

In second place , This is the End opened with $ 20.5 million , giving the raunchy R-rated comedy $ 32.8 million total since its Wednesday debut . While that 's not a huge start , Sony spent only $ 32 million on the comedy , which stars Seth Rogen , Jonah Hill , Craig Robinson , Jay Baruchel , James Franco , and Danny McBride . This is the End started in the same range as Franco and Rogen 's hit Pineapple Express , which opened with $ 23.3 million in 2008 .

Fourth place belonged to Fast & Furious 6 , which fell 52 percent to $ 9.4 million in its fourth weekend . The $ 160 million Universal release has now earned $ 219.6 million total , surpassing Fast Five 's $ 209.8 million cume and making it the highest grossing Fast film domestically . Worldwide , the same is true : Fast & Furious 6 's $ 636.9 million haul is a franchise best .

1 . Man of Steel -- $ 113.1 million

3 . Now You See Me -- $ 10.3 million
