Scott Edward Sippola , 31 , and Allison Lenore Coss , 24 , could have faced up to nine years in prison for convictions of conspiracy and interstate communications to extort money .

Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Lochner said a statement from Stamos was read in court . In it , Stamos said he had been slandered and his reputation impugned . Lochner said the judge ascertained that the conspiracy was n't just a `` foolish lark . ''

In a presentence filing , Sippola admitted his conduct `` was awful . ''

Vermaat said the defendants sent about 40 e-mails to Stamos threatening to sell the photos . FBI agents got involved and started monitoring Stamos ' e-mail account and `` eventually communicated by cellular telephone with the defendants pretending to be Mr. Stamos ' business manager . '' Sippola and Coss were arrested in December 2009 at an airport , a pre-arranged dropoff spot for the money .

The television actor , who also appeared in `` Full House '' and `` ER , '' testified that nothing inappropriate happened at a 2004 spring break party and , accordingly , he did n't believe compromising photos existed .

Coss also filed a memorandum before sentencing , asking for a lighter sentence because she is a `` good person who acted out of character . ''

`` The defendant was misguided in her thinking that asking for money to prevent selling photographs was a legitimate business transaction , '' the filing states .

Calls by CNN to defense attorneys Friday were not immediately returned .
