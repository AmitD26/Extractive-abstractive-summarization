As drones become more mainstream , the prospect of excessive surveillance and other dangers loom . Drones drive down the costs of surveillance to a worrisomely low level . For example , it would n't be surprising if Amazon delivery drones were equipped with cameras for loss prevention . So what would stop law enforcement from asking Amazon for all of its drones ' footage in a given neighborhood where there had been a crime ?

Simultaneously , drone technology has the potential to revolutionize delivery , agriculture , photography and possibly disrupt major industries .

Imagine that you 're shopping at Barnes & Noble . You ask for a book that the store does not carry . Rather than send you online , Barnes & Noble flies the book over from another store while you shop or take a coffee break .

Or imagine that you 're a farmer whose livelihood depends on catching crop disease early . You could use drones to fly over thousands of acres in an afternoon to spot problem areas .

These are exciting uses for drones . But the real innovation will come when companies such as Amazon mix their robotics strategy with their love for open platforms .

Amazon paid nearly $ 800 million for the robotics firm Kiva Systems for the specific purpose of helping to organize its warehouses . The company is now experimenting with drones for the second task of delivery .

The real explosion of innovation in computing occurred when devices got into the hands of regular people . Suddenly consumers did not have to wait for IBM or Apple to write every software program they might want to use . Other companies and individuals could also write a `` killer app . '' Much of the software that makes personal computers , tablets and smartphones such an essential part of daily life now have been written by third-party developers .

You do not necessarily want a live-action version of Angry Birds using drones . And who is responsible should someone get hurt by interacting with robots ?

Once companies such as Google , Amazon or Apple create a personal drone that is app-enabled , we will begin to see the true promise of this technology . This is still a ways off . There are certainly many technical , regulatory and social hurdles to overcome . But I would think that within 10 to 15 years , we will see robust , multipurpose robots in the hands of consumers .
