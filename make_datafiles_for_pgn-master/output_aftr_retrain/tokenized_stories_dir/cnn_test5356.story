`` I hope you can sense ... this is of serious concern to me and the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it can indeed create a perception that is absolutely contrary to what it is that we have sought to do , '' he said .

The Marine Corps said it was `` concerned '' when it learned about the biblical references .

`` We are making every effort to remove these markings from all of our scopes and will ensure that all future procurement of these scopes will not have these types of markings , '' it said in a written statement .

Earlier , after it emerged that the Michigan-based manufacturer was putting codes for scriptures on the scopes , Trijicon issued a statement saying that it has put scripture references on its products for more than two decades .

`` As long as we have men and women in danger , we will continue to do everything we can to provide them with both state-of-the-art technology and the never-ending support and prayers of a grateful nation , '' it said Wednesday .

ABC first reported the story on Monday , saying that some of the citations on the sights included `` 2COR4 : 6 , '' an apparent reference to 2 Corinthians 4:6 of the New Testament , which reads , `` For God , who said , ` Let light shine out of darkness , ' made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ . ''

Another , according to ABC , included JN8 : 12 , apparently referring to John 8:12 . That reads , `` When Jesus spoke again to the people , he said , ` I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness , but will have the light of life . ' ''

Trijicon has a $ 660 million contract for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army , according to Turner . He said slightly more than 300,000 scopes have been delivered so far , with most going to the Marines .

`` Allowing religious references to be placed on U.S. weaponry , which are bought and paid for by U.S. taxpayers , is unacceptable , '' MPAC Executive Director Salam Al-Marayati wrote in a letter to Gates , according to the council 's Web site .

`` Such inscriptions not only run afoul of the Constitution and U.S. military rules , but they also feed into the violent extremists ' narrative that the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are a ` crusade against Islam . ' ''
