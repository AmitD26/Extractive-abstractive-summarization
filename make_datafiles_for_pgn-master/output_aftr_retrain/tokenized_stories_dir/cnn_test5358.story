ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Most of us have them -- the personal ritual to deal with the `` ick '' of a public bathroom : wiping the seat with toilet paper , using a paper seat cover or even rolling up several pieces of toilet paper to create a thicker barrier between the skin and ... the unknown .

Public bathrooms may be teeming with bacteria , but the toilet seat is probably safe for sitting .

But the toilet seat is actually the cleanest part of the bathroom , one expert says .

`` One of the cleanest things in the bathrooms we find are the toilet seats , '' Gerba said . `` I 'd put my fanny on it any time -- unless it 's wet ; then you 'd want to wipe it first . '' Avoiding bathroom ` hot spots ' ''

The Internet has come through for people who just want a clean place to go . New tools like MizPee -LRB- nationwide -RRB- and Diaroogle -LRB- New York only -RRB- will point you to the nearest public restroom and display extensive comments about those facilities from users , even delivering the information to your mobile phone . -LRB- Warning : CNN makes no promises about the cleanliness of the language in these bathroom locators . -RRB-

MizPee launched a year ago for people in San Francisco , California , after co-founder Peter Olfe saw that the city 's public library bathroom was `` so disgusting , '' said Dhana Pawar , vice president and co-founder of Yojo Mobile , which created MizPee . `` Unfortunately , -LSB- MizPee -RSB- was inspired by that trip . ''

Fueled by demand , MizPee has expanded to more than 22 cities in America and six in Europe , and has had more than 300,000 unique visitors . Users rate toilets on a scale from one to five toilet paper rolls and nominate the best and worst toilets for the Flush of the Year award . The site also gives users information on deals at restaurants , shops and services nearby , in addition to toilet trivia called `` looisms . ''

Women are also particularly concerned about finding clean bathrooms with changing stations , Pawar said . `` You 'd be surprised how few there are . ''

`` I 'm one of those really anal people who have to have a clean bathroom , '' she said .

For many people , public bathrooms generate feelings of anxiety , fear and disgust . `` Basically , everybody is fearful of public restrooms , '' said Dr. Lisa Bernstein , assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine , who admitted that her mother always told her that she should never make direct contact with a toilet seat .

Research indicates that fear of the commode itself may be misdirected .

Public bathrooms may contain several kinds of harmful bacteria , including E. coli , salmonella , coliform , rotavirus , cold virus and the potentially deadly form of staph known as MRSA , experts say . But people are more likely to pick up these nasty bugs through touching things in the bathroom with their hands , not their behinds .

More concerning , however , is a child who steadies himself or herself on a toilet seat by holding onto it and then leaving without washing hands , she said . Those germs could lead to an infection once the child 's hands touch the nose , mouth or eyes .

And do n't forget that unwashed hands have handled everything from the door knob to the lock to the flusher . Again , if you touch one of these objects and then rub your eye , nose or mouth , you 're apt to transmit that bacteria .

`` You can remove all gastrointestinal and respiratory infection bacteria by washing hands , '' said Judy Daly , clinical microbiologist at the University of Utah and spokesperson for the Clean Hands Campaign . `` Seventeen seconds of a little bit of friction , water and soap will really mediate bacteria . ''

The American Society for Microbiology , which sponsors the Clean Hands Campaign , found in a study last year that about 77 percent of men and women washed their hands in public restrooms , down 6 percent from 2005 . The observational study also found that women washed their hands more than men .

`` It 's such an easy intervention , '' Daly said . `` If you get it to be a habit for a 30-day period , it 's something you do automatically . ''

Use automatic devices

Do n't let your belongings touch the floor

When Gerba looked at women 's purses , he found that one-third of them had fecal bacteria on the bottom . Make sure you hang your shoulder bag on a hook . If none is available , some people swear by hanging the strap around their necks .

Do n't hold back

It 's fine for a woman to hover over the toilet seat if she does n't want to sit down , but if she does n't empty her bladder completely , she 's at risk for a urinary infection , Bernstein said .

After all that research -- he 's had the cops called on him while prowling around bathroom floors -- Gerba has no problem with sitting down on public toilets . But Bernstein still uses one or two seat covers , `` because of what my mother taught me , '' she said .
