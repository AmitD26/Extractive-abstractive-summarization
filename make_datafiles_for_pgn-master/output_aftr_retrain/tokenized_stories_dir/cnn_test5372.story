Kiev , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ukraine 's embattled government has agreed to scrap harsh laws limiting protests and give amnesty to demonstrators who seized the Justice Ministry headquarters , a top official announced late Monday .

With Ukraine 's political crisis deepening , protesters left the ministry after Justice Minister Olena Lukash warned that she would call for a state of emergency . But at the end of the day , Lukash said the anti-protest laws that went into effect on January 16 would be repealed and the protesters who occupied her ministry would receive amnesty -- as long as they cleared out of `` all seized premises and roads . ''

Anti-government demonstrators seized the Justice Ministry building on Sunday night . They cleared out Monday after Lukash threatened to impose a state of emergency -- a step opposition spokeswoman Lesya Orobets warned could lead to the use of military units to suppress protests .

`` We as an opposition spent the whole day trying to negotiate with people who actually captured the premises to get out of there , not to give them any legal base for a state of emergency , '' Orobets told CNN 's Amanpour program .

The violence that has rattled Kiev for weeks spread outside the capital Sunday , with reports of protesters seizing municipal headquarters in other towns . Ukraine 's parliament was expected to hold a special session on the protests Tuesday , and the European Union 's foreign policy chief , Catherine Ashton , was headed for Kiev in a bid to help defuse the standoff .

`` What is urgently needed is a genuine dialogue to build a new consensus on the way forward , '' Ashton said in a written statement late Monday . `` I hope that the Ukrainian parliament will set a clear path during tomorrow 's session towards a political solution . This must include revoking the package of laws passed on 16 January . ''

`` Underscoring that no time should be lost , the vice president urged President Yanukovych to pull back riot police and work with the opposition on immediate measures to de-escalate tensions between protesters and the government , '' a White House readout of the call stated . `` He also urged the government to take concrete steps during tomorrow 's parliamentary session to respond to the full and legitimate concerns of the Ukrainian people , including by repealing the anti-democratic laws passed on January 16 . ''

Government offer rejected

Among the snowy rooftops of Kiev , smoke can often be seen billowing from the city center , where thousands of demonstrators have massed despite freezing weather , setting up makeshift barricades and bombarding police with gasoline bombs . Scenes of fires , burnt tires , smashed windows and the drumbeats of sticks on corrugated metal have become familiar occurrences on the city 's central arteries .

More recently , protesters , old and young , have been voicing their anger about anti-protest laws passed this month . The controversial new laws have sparked concerns that they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech . They 're also calling for changes to the country 's constitution .

`` The people of Ukraine went out onto the Maidan not for the opposition leaders to be given government posts , and not even for revoking of the dictatorial laws , '' Tymoshenko said . `` The people want fundamental changes in their lives , justice in Ukraine and a path to European values . This is their last chance . ''

Opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk has refused Yanukovich 's offer to be prime minister , Lukash said Monday night . Yatsenyuk , who heads the Fatherland Party , would have become the prime minister and would have been able to dismiss the current government , which has been one of the protesters ' demands .
