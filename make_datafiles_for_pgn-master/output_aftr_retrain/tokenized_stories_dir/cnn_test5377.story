Philadelphia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs , pet food containers and a freezer at a West Philadelphia abortion clinic , the city 's chief medical examiner testified in the murder trial of the doctor who ran the facility .

Authorities accuse Gosnell , 72 , of using scissors to sever the spinal cords of fetuses who emerged from their mothers still alive .

`` There was no guidance on how to proceed , '' Gulino said , adding that the lacerated fetuses had to be thawed slowly so the tissue would not be destroyed . `` I was never asked to do that -LRB- before -RRB- . ''

A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received repeated reports about Gosnell 's practices for two decades , but had taken no action , Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said .

When authorities searched Gosnell 's office , they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building . Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf . Furniture and equipment was blood-stained , dusty and broken .

`` My grasp of the English language does n't really allow me to fully describe how horrific this clinic was -- rotting bodies , fetal remains , the smell of urine throughout , blood-stained , '' Williams said .

The remains , ranging in age from 12 to 28 weeks , were stored in a variety of non-medical containers such as a plastic water jugs or cat and dog food containers , Gulino testified during the fifth week of the trial . In Pennsylvania , abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake .

When a photo of a fetus was projected onto a pull-down screen , one juror gasped and shut her eyes , while several other jurors shifted in their seats and took notes . During the exchange , Gosnell , dressed in a suit and tie , removed his glasses and intently examined the image on a nearby monitor .

Along with an examination chair with stirrups facing the jury box , a sonogram machine and other medical devices are on permanent display in the center of the courtroom .
