Pope Benedict XVI is not suffering from any specific disease that forced him to resign , his spokesman said Tuesday , a day after the news that he was stepping down shocked the world 's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics .

The pontiff is resigning because he does not feel he has the strength to continue as the church 's leader , the Rev. Federico Lombardi said , adding that it was a `` spiritual '' decision .

He dismissed reports in an Italian newspaper that the pope 's decision was linked to a medical intervention to replace the battery in his pacemaker , saying that had been a routine procedure . Benedict has had the pacemaker since he was a cardinal , he added .

He will hold a final audience in Vatican City 's St. Peter 's Square on February 27 , Lombardi said .

Despite addressing reporters at length , Lombardi left many questions about what will come next unanswered -- including those concerning exactly when a successor will be elected .

The Vatican does not yet know when cardinals will meet in a conclave to decide who will replace Benedict , Lombardi said . Vatican experts are studying legal documents on the subject , he explained .

Much of the uncertainty stems from the fact this is the first time a pope has stepped down in nearly 600 years .

`` Strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me , '' said Benedict , 85 , according to the Vatican .

The pope , born Joseph Ratzinger , will first head to the pope 's summer residence in Castel Gandolfo before he likely retires to a monastery and devotes himself to a life of reflection and prayer , Lombardi said .

The pope 's older brother , the Rev. Georg Ratzinger , told CNN in Regensburg , Germany , that Benedict had come to his decision without seeking his brother 's advice .

Asked if Benedict sounded relieved when the pair spoke Monday , his brother said : `` His voice sounded the same as by every other call . He planned the whole event and it worked out well . The news is now out in the world , and now his life must continue its normal path . ''

Ratzinger , himself 89 , did not specify when his brother began to feel too frail to carry on . But , he said , `` The aging process causes difficulties , only in the last few years , first as he was 80 and then when you go past 85 ... when you cross these hurdles you feel like everything becomes more difficult . ''

He is not sorry to see his brother step down , he said .

`` I 'm realistic . I can see that the advancement of life brings changes and it goes along these lines . I would say that I would have been happy , had he been able to continue , but I take this realistically and soberly -- that it 's for the best . ''

Benedict 's decision has inevitably prompted frenzied speculation over who might assume the papacy in his place .

While Benedict wo n't be directly involved in his successor 's selection , his influence will undoubtedly be felt . He appointed 67 of the 117 cardinals that -- as of Monday -- are set to make the decision .

The number of electors could drop to 115 , as two cardinals will turn 80 in March , when their age makes them ineligible to cast a vote . More than two-thirds of the final number of cardinals must agree on the next pope . The announcement that a decision has been made will come in the form of a puff of white smoke emerging from a chimney in the Vatican .

Much speculation has focused on whether Benedict 's successor might come from Africa or Latin America , rather than Europe , where Roman Catholic congregations are shrinking .

Ratzinger said he expected to see a pope chosen from outside Europe one day -- but not just yet .

`` I 'm certain a pope will come from the new continents but whether it will be now , I have my doubts , '' he said . `` In Europe , we have many very able people , and the Africans are still not so well known and maybe do not have the experience yet . ''

Bets are already being placed on which of the cardinals might step into Benedict 's shoes .

`` We 're not going to have a problem of two competing popes . If Pope Benedict still wanted to have influence , he would n't have stepped down , '' said senior Vatican communications adviser Greg Burke .

`` What 's interesting is how long ago this decision was made -- shortly after the pope 's trip to Cuba , which was in March of last year , so that was before the whole butler story even broke . ''

`` Thus , even though the pope has resigned , things get done , '' he added .

Meanwhile , Italian iReporter Martina Lunardelli says she was shocked by the pope 's decision to resign but feels it was the right one to make .

While not quite unprecedented , Benedict 's resignation is certainly historic . The last pope to step down before his death was Gregory XII , who in 1415 quit to end a civil war within the church in which more than one man claimed to be pope .
