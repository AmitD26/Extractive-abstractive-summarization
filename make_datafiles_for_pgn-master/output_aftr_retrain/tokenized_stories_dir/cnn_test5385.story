`` The biggest surprise was to discover that this individual possessed African versions in the genes that determine the light pigmentation of the current Europeans , which indicates that he had dark skin , although we can not know the exact shade , '' researcher Carles Lalueza-Fox from the Spanish National Research Council -LRB- CSIC -RRB- said .

`` Even more surprising was to find that he possessed the genetic variations that produce blue eyes in current Europeans , resulting in a unique phenotype in a genome that is otherwise clearly northern European . ''

A genome is the full map of an individual 's DNA .

La Brana 1 's closest modern descendants , in genetic terms , live in northern Europe in places like Sweden and Finland .

The research -- carried out by the CSIC in partnership with Denmark 's Centre for GeoGenetics -- has been published in the scientific journal `` Nature . ''

Scientists said the cave is located in a cold mountainous area with a steady temperature -- conditions that contributed to the `` exceptional '' preservation of the DNA of La Brana 1 and the remains of another individual found there .
