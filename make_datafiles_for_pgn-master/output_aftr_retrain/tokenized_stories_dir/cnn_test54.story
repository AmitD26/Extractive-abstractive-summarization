-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over the course of more than 15 years , `` Resident Evil '' has established a rich history as one of the video game world 's most storied franchises .

This time , you play as a member of the Wolfpack squad for the always dubious Umbrella Corporation . You 're tasked with retrieving a virus that turns people into the undead creatures before the U.S. military can get it .

Raccoon City is the location where the zombie phenomena first occurred and has been the setting in many of the `` Resident Evil '' games .

Working for the bad guys in this title was supposed to be a refreshing change from others in the series . And it might have worked , if the squad-based third-person shooter game did n't feel more like a poorly lit `` Call of Duty '' than what we 've come to expect from the `` Resident Evil '' franchise .

Each member of your squad specializes in a different field -LRB- stealth , explosives , recon , etc. -RRB- , and you play as one of four soldiers fighting their way through Raccoon City .

If you 're trying to use cover from your enemies while you 're moving , you end up essentially plastered to a wall if you get even close to it . Forget about moving stealthily from one covered spot to another . If you want to progress , you have to stand up , exposing yourself to enemy fire , then move to the next safe spot .

At least they are good in a fight and and very effective at taking the heat off your character . Be sure to have a medic in your squad to help heal injured party members .

Most of the opponents are not zombies . You 'll spend a lot of time battling the U.S. military in firefights , not that the soldiers you face seem much smarter than the undead .

Character models for the soldiers and the zombies are reused often . You 'll see the same zombie police officer , zombie large guy and zombie girl in short-shorts over and over again .

You will kill a lot of living and nonliving enemies in this game . The experience points you gain can be used at the beginning of each mission to upgrade weapons or personal abilities . But , even if you do n't use any upgrades at all , you will still be able to succeed .

`` Resident Evil : Operation Raccoon City '' ultimately comes off as a mundane , average shooter that abandons its heritage in the zombie/horror genre .

The ending flies in the face of `` Resident Evil 's '' history and leaves more questions unanswered . It feels half-done with no real finale .

`` Resident Evil : Operation Raccoon City '' is currently available in North America , Australia and Europe . It will be available in Japan on April 26 . It is available for Windows PC , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . It is rated 'M for Mature ' due to blood and gore , intense violence , and strong language . This review was done playing the Xbox 360 version .
