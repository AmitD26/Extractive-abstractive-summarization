-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- John Yates believes when it comes to the power of the federal government , he is just a small fish caught up in a prosecution meant for corporations .

And the Supreme Court thought enough of his appeal to hear the matter later this year .

The justices agreed on Monday to take up the case in which prosecutors used a law typically applied to corporate records to convict Yates of getting rid of three illegally caught grouper .

The question is whether the law against obstructing an investigation into business practices is too vague . It was passed in the aftermath of Enron and other big scandals of that kind .

The actual legal language in dispute involves efforts to conceal , cover up , falsify , or make a false entry in any record , document , or tangible object .

They discovered 72 undersized red grouper , and told Yates to leave the catch there , and head back to shore so agents could seize it .

When the Miss Katie arrived at port days later , a government inspector counted only 69 fish that were below the 20-inch minimum harvesting size . Yates still claims the deputy originally miscounted the fish .

The justices will not retry the facts , but only will consider whether the law was properly applied .

The case is Yates v. U.S. -LRB- 13-7451 -RRB- .
