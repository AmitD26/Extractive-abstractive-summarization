The certificate states , as Obama 's advisers have repeatedly said , that the president was born at Honolulu 's Kapiolani Hospital on August 4 , 1961 . Doubters insist Obama was born overseas -- possibly in his father 's home country of Kenya -- and may be constitutionally ineligible to serve as president .

`` We do not have time for this kind of silliness , '' Obama told reporters at the White House . `` I 've been puzzled at the degree to which this -LRB- story -RRB- just kept on going . ''

`` Normally I would not comment on something like this , '' the president said . But the country has `` some enormous challenges out there '' that it will not be able to effectively meet `` if we 're distracted . ''

Obama 's personal attorney , Judith Corley , picked up certified copies of the long-form document in Hawaii and brought them back to the White House Tuesday evening , Bauer noted .

While the president has tried to make light of the controversy , the question has remained political red meat for some of his critics . A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that nearly 75 % of Americans believe Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States . More than four in 10 Republicans , however , believe he probably or definitely was not born in America .

The U.S. Constitution says only `` natural born '' citizens can become president -- a vague clause that followers of the birther movement contend disqualifies Obama from the presidency , since they believe he was born overseas .

`` The president believed the distraction over his birth certificate was n't good for the country , '' White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said . `` It may have been good politics and good -LRB- television -RRB- , but it was bad for the American people and distracting from the many challenges we face as a country .

`` At a time of great consequence for this country -- when we should be debating how we win the future , reduce our deficit , deal with high gas prices , and bring stability to the Middle East , Washington , D.C. , was once again distracted by a fake issue , '' Pfeiffer said . `` The president 's hope is that with this step , we can move on to debating the bigger issues that matter to the American people and the future of the country . ''

Trump stands by `` birther '' claims

Obama `` should have -LRB- released the certificate -RRB- a long , long time ago , '' he said .

Trump , a billionaire business tycoon and reality television star , blamed the media for repeatedly bringing up the issue . Trump , however , has frequently raised questions about Obama 's birthplace during his climb in recent GOP primary polls .

What 's your take on the birth certificate release ?

Allegations that Obama was not born in the United States have been repeatedly discredited . A recent CNN investigation turned up no evidence to support the birther claims .

`` But I 'm speaking to the vast majority of the American people , as well as to the press , '' he said . `` We 've got better stuff to do . ''
