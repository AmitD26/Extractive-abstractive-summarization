-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ukraine has suspended one of their top Olympic officials after an investigation alleged he was willing to sell up to 100 tickets for the London Games on the black market .

A statement on UNOC 's website quoyed Bubka as saying : `` As President of the Ukraine NOC , I am committed to maintaining the highest standards and ethics within the Olympic Movement .

`` I am deeply concerned about these allegations and I have ordered an immediate investigation in Ukraine . I have briefly spoken with General Secretary Gerashchenko and informed him that he is suspended pending this investigation .

`` I have also spoken to -LRB- London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games -RRB- chairman Sebastian Coe since I learnt of this news and informed him that I will ensure that we fully co-operate with any subsequent investigation that takes place in London .

`` There has never been a situation where we have had a surplus number of tickets and those that we have received will all be distributed using official channels .

However , AFP reported that Bubka 's deputy , Viktor Korzh , was dubious about the veracity of the BBC 's claims .

`` I still have great doubts about this and think that the whole story could come to nothing , '' he is said to have told reporters .
