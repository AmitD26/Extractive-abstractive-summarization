-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If the pre-vote predictions had been accurate , football heavyweights Italy would be preparing to host the 2012 European Championship .

It was n't a shock on the scale of Qatar 's swoop for the 2022 World Cup , but the joint bid from Poland and Ukraine was at one stage considered third favorite to host Euro 2012 -- out of three candidates .

Racism , rather than Ronaldo and Ribery , dominates Euro 2012 storylines

But as early as 2008 , Platini was telling Ukraine to `` get going '' as the building of new stadiums and improvements in the transport network slipped behind schedule . At one stage , there was even talk of Scotland stepping in as emergency host .

By the end of 2011 , Platini was diplomatically describing the buildup as a `` complicated adventure . ''

`` Difficult births often lead to beautiful babies , '' the French football great concluded in March as Poland and Ukraine finally declared they would be ready for the June 8 kickoff when an estimated worldwide audience of at least 150 million is expected to be watching .

Only time will tell whether Platini will return to UEFA 's headquarters in Switzerland a proud father .

Most major sporting tournaments experience a rocky buildup , Poland and Ukraine 's has been at the turbulent end of the scale -- understandably so , given the countries ' lack of major event experience coupled with ambitious improvement plans that are reported to have cost $ 38 billion combined .

The stadia are breathtaking . Five of the eight on show during the tournament are brand new , and the existing venues in Kiev , Donetsk and Kharkiv have undergone major developments .

The 50,000-capacity , newly-constructed National Stadium in Warsaw will host the opening game between Poland and Greece .

While the venues have been tested , the transport network will come under scrutiny for the first time when an estimated one million fans descend on the two countries .

Ukraine faces a race against time to complete the planned 1,750 kilometers of new roads in time for the start of the tournament . It has also shipped in high-speed trains from South Korea to ease travel between the two host countries .

Poland has already accepted that some of its transport improvements -- including the construction of 750 km of new motorways -- may not be ready .

`` We know not everything will be completed in time for Euro 2012 , '' Poland 2012 communications director Mikolaj Piotrowski told CNN late last year .

`` But today we can say that a lot of important investment projects will be completed three to five years sooner than without the Euros scenario , so I think it was worth it to see Michel Platini opening the envelope in Cardiff in 2007 . ''

If getting around should be manageable for fans , finding somewhere affordable to stay once they get to their destination is an altogether trickier task .

England -- traditionally one of the best-supported European teams -- failed to sell out its original allocation of tickets for its group games in Kiev and Donetsk , with many fans opting to stay at home as Ukrainian hotel owners seek to make hay from the tournament by ramping up prices . In April the Football Supporters ' Federation said fans were being quoted as much as $ 1,000 a night for a three-star room .

The families of black England players Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have already decided against traveling to Ukraine -- and that was before a BBC documentary highlighting racism and violence in the host countries was screened

Poland , too , has suffered serious problems with racism .

`` Monkey chanting , banana throwing , that has happened in Polish matches unfortunately , '' Rafal Pankowski from the campaign group Never Again told CNN .

`` We want to use the Championships to highlight some of the issues and make a difference in a positive way in terms of anti-racism education . ''

UEFA has always accepted that giving Euro 2012 to Poland and Ukraine was a risk .

Italy , six years on from the scandal that so seriously damaged the country 's chances of hosting the tournament , is embroiled in another match-fixing crisis that led defender Domenico Criscito to be cut from the squad .

As for the hosts , Poland looks to have the easier group with Czech Republic , Greece and Russia .

`` Ukrainians , our time has come ! '' declares the team 's slogan .
