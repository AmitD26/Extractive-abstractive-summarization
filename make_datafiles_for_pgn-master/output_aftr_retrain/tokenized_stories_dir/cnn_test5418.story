-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A decade ago , tiny `` travel-size '' shampoos were fun stocking stuffers and a more expensive , more convenient means of packing toiletries for a trip . Now they 're a reminder of the layered security landscape that has evolved at airports since the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .

As the 10-year anniversary of that day approaches , CNN asked security experts to weigh in on changes in aviation security in the United States since 9/11 and to offer a glimpse of what 's likely to happen next .

The good news for the widely criticized Transportation Security Administration ? Some security analysts like where the agency is headed .

`` The TSA is exhibiting much more open-mindedness and has already accepted the concept that there is a need to look at people as well as what they carry , '' said Rafi Ron , president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv , Israel .

Body scanners , metal detectors and pat-downs have limitations and responding to recent threats by having passengers remove shoes or carry only small amounts of liquid does n't make sense , analysts say .

`` Just to do things based on something that already happened in and of itself is frankly illogical and is not supportive of good security , '' he said .

TSA Administrator John Pistole , who took the helm in 2010 , gets credit from security experts for a shift in strategy .

Pistole , a former deputy director for the Federal Bureau of Investigation , has said intelligence is the best tool for preventing terrorism , and the agency is testing measures at airports that it hopes will make things easier for most travelers .

Pistole recently announced a pilot trusted traveler program to reduce screening hassles for travelers who provide additional personal information to the government and free more resources to focus on high-risk passengers . The program is expected to launch in October .

Everyone profiles , consciously or unconsciously , Bloom said . And there 's nothing `` unusual or unnatural '' about it .

They 're not calling for illegal racial or ethnic profiling , Bloom , Ron and security analyst Douglas Laird said .

'' -LRB- That 's -RRB- the lazy and the easy way to go about it and the nonprofessional way , '' Ron said . The profiling he supports uses legitimate information to identify what does n't make sense -- flying one-way with no luggage , for example .

Laird , president of Laird & Associates and a former security director at Northwest Airlines , helped develop a profiling system called CAPPS -LRB- Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System -RRB- used by the airlines before 9/11 .

The system referenced commercial data available through airline computer systems and credit card companies , Laird said , comparing information like street addresses with phone numbers with where the passenger purchased the ticket . The system took names out of the equation , Laird said , because a `` professional '' terrorist would probably travel under a different identity with genuine documents .

The system compares information provided to airlines by passengers against watch lists , but does not use commercial data and protects travelers ' privacy , according to the TSA . The watch-list matching program was fully implemented in November 2010 .

`` Secure Flight is not really a profiling program , '' Ron said . `` It is basically a program that is mostly focused on identifying wanted people or people that we already have their names in various databases . ''

Bad things and bad people

TSA behavioral detection officers are testing a `` casual conversation '' screening technique at Boston 's Logan airport . While officers talk with passengers they are looking for suspicious behavior and facial expressions .

Ron said his professional experience with Israeli airport security , widely considered to be the best in the world and heavily reliant on behavioral analysis and profiling , does n't mean he would suggest the United States go to the same lengths . But the American system should understand the roots of Israel 's success , he said , and incorporate them in a way that fits within our legal framework .

`` And I 'm glad , '' Bloom said . `` Because I like to wear wingtip shoes to go with my suit and having to unlace and take them off and put them back on is getting to be a real hassle . ''
