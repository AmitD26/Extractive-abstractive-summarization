-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson 's personal chef Kai Chase says June 25 was shaping up as another typical day in the superstar 's usually peaceful and orderly home until an urgent plea from Jackson 's personal doctor sent panic sweeping through the household .

Michael Jackson 's personal chef Kai Chase appeared on CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' Thursday night .

Around noon or a little after , Chase said , `` Dr. Murray comes down the stairs . There was a stairwell that leads into the kitchen . And he 's screaming : Hurry ! Go get Prince . Call security . Get Prince . ''

Chase said she quickly got Jackson 's oldest son .

`` Within minutes , the paramedics are there . And the security is running upstairs , skipping stairs and all of a sudden we 're all , you know , panicked , '' Chase told King . `` So the energy in the house had just kind of changed from that happy kind of day that we were having and preparing lunch and having a good time to just kind of eerie . '' Watch Chase 's interview with Larry King ''

`` We started crying and we all come together in unity in a circle and we started holding hands . And we started praying , '' Chase said .

Chase said Jackson did complain once about his demanding schedule .

`` The third day I was there , when I came back , he had told me , ` You know , they 're killing me . They 're killing me because I 'm working too much . I 'm rehearsing too much . ' ''

Between 1 and 1:30 p.m. June 25 , Chase said security asked her to leave the home , and she never saw Michael Jackson being transported to the hospital . She did n't learn of Jackson 's death until later that day on the radio .

Chase said that Murray was in the house often in June and she attributed the doctor 's frequent presence to Jackson 's rigorous rehearsal schedule for an upcoming series of concerts in London , England .

In his interview with Chase , King pressed for details of evidence of drug use by Jackson :

King : Did you notice oxygen tanks , because if it was Diprivan and they have to measure ... your blood pressure ? They also need oxygen tanks if you 're giving that drug . Did you notice them ?

King : Where were they ?

King : On that morning or other mornings ?

Chase : No . I did n't see him that morning . I saw him in the afternoon , but other mornings .

Chase : Carry them down .

King : They were portable oxygen tanks ?

Chase : Yes .

Chase said she just recently learned the warrants to search Murray 's offices cited her name as a suspected alias for Michael Jackson .

`` I was just made aware of that from my publicist . I think that is ... appalling . I have no clue what that is about , '' Chase said .

`` They 're doing great . And I saw them a couple of weeks ago , '' she said . `` And they look great and they 're playing with their cousins and having a good time . ''

She said the children gave her a `` box of happiness '' on return that contained little gifts and letters . One of them read in part :

`` He ate very well , '' she said . `` He ate organic and fresh . He -LSB- was -RSB- into the health foods and juices and things of that nature . ''

â€¢ On Jackson 's ex-wife having visitation rights to her children : `` I think Debbie Rowe should see and raise her children . ''

Life in the Jackson household -- from Chase 's account -- was a loving and cheerful one and that he loved his three children .

`` You know , I would bring ... the lunches and set them on the table and they 'd all come in and sit , close the door and they 'd dine privately . And you would just hear laughter and story-telling and just beautiful things . Those were his babies . ''
