-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The bitter family dispute over the care of renowned radio announcer Casey Kasem got more bizarre Sunday .

It is the latest incident in the feud between Kerri Kasem and Jean Kasem , who has been married to the former host of `` American Top 40 '' and `` Casey 's Top 40 '' since 1980 , over who should decide his medical care .

She stayed on the street while paramedics went to get the 82-year-old icon , Deraney said .

As she waited , Jean Kasem approached and hurled something at Kerri Kasem while referring to King David of the Bible , saying she was throwing the meat at `` the dogs . ''

A video provided to CNN by Deraney showed part of the incident , and in it , Jean Kasem walks down a driveway , throws underhanded a block of meat , which skips on the pavement toward the person holding the camera .

Kerri Kasem said it was a pound of hamburger .

There was no assault complaint , Deputy Scott Wilson said .

Wilson said the Kasems are due in Kitsap County court again on Friday .

Three weeks ago , a California court awarded Kerri Kasem temporary durable power of attorney and health care directive and has ordered Jean Kasem to surrender Casey Kasem 's passport to the daughter . The California judge also ordered that Casey Kasem ca n't travel anywhere without a court order until a doctor clears him .

But Julie and Kerri Kasem and their brother , Mike Kasem , have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father .

Jean Kasem said in court papers last year that the three children `` single-handedly and irreparably shattered '' the couple 's lives by deploying public demonstrations and attacks in the media , according to CNN affiliate KCBS .
