-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy .

However , such transformation will not be easy . Over the last two decades , various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success .

The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt . While a success in matriculation -- 19 % of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations . A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market . Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices .

Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption , new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China 's growing divide between the rich and the poor .

We found that the top 10 % of Chinese households garnered 57 % of total income and 85 % of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries , and can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles .

Income inequality is the key reason for China 's low consumption rate . The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings . The top 10 % of households have 69 % of the total savings , and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60 % . Conversely , about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings .

Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing 's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers , not exports , the key driver of China 's economy . Why ? The data suggests China 's rich are already spending what they need , and pocketing most of the rest .

An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption , however , is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads , railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment .

Although 90 % of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems , benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums . Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance .

Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system . So far , the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30 % of that of health insurance . It also pays too little : unemployment benefit is only 17 % of the average salary compared to 47 % in the U.S. and 60 % in Germany .

Over the last 10 years , government spending on social welfare programs is only about 3 % of the total spending .

If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens , Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies , unemployment and retirement , and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy .
