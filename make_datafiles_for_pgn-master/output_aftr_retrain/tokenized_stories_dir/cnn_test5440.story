LONDON , England -- Graffiti artist Banksy , famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world , is holding his first major exhibition in years .

This time , however , the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK .

The exhibition 's range , while very varied , remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art . See pictures from Banksy 's exhibition ''

`` I think we might have dragged them down to our level rather than being elevated to theirs '' Banksy , who is thought to be from Bristol , said about the museum .

In one of the paintings , a character has been cut out and is instead sitting on the painting 's frame , perhaps taking a break from posing ?

Perhaps the most controversial , yet equally light-hearted piece , is a painting of the British Parliamentary House of Commons , filled with chimpanzees who are looking surprisingly `` ministerial . ''

`` This show is my vision of the future , '' the artist said .

Banksy is unlikely to show up at the exhibition as he attempts to retain his anonymity .

But while we may never know his identity , with this latest show , Banksy has definitely shown yet another facet of his personality .
