Obama and Putin are among the leaders invited to take part in French ceremonies Friday marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings , which helped change the course of World War II .

Obama said Putin could start by recognizing Ukraine 's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko , stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine .

Putin , in an interview with French television station TF1 , did not discount the possibility of meeting with Obama .

Asked if he would speak with Ukraine 's new leader , Putin said he will not `` evade '' Poroshenko or anyone else .

`` There will be other guests , and I 'm not going to avoid any of them . I will talk with all of them , '' he said , according to the Kremlin 's translation .
