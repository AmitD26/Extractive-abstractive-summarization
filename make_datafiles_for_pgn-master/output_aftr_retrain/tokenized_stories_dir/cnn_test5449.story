President Hamid Karzai says he wo n't sign it until some conditions are met . U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice says what the Afghan leader is asking for are new demands added to a deal that has already been worked out .

Karzai wants a promise from the United States that there will be no more raids on Afghan homes , and that Afghan prisoners will be released from the Guantanamo Bay detention center .

She told him to sign the bilateral security agreement soon , or the United States will be forced to plan for a complete pull-out . That would include NATO 's troops , depriving Afghanistan off all security coverage from Western forces , she said in a statement .

During the loya jirga , Karzai told the crowd that the deal would not be signed until after the next presidential election in April 2014 .

The elders and Rice both said they would like to see it be signed more promptly .

Along with their demands toward the United States , the loya jirga attendees requested that Karzai pass the agreement before the end of this year .

The raids have been one of the main sore spots between Afghans and Western military presence led by the United States .
