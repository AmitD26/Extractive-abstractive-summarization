-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nearly 65 years after his demise by his own hand in a bunker beneath the streets of Berlin , Adolf Hitler is still managing to cause controversy .

The findings might have encouraged one of the wilder conspiracy theories about Hitler to flourish , but researchers were not claiming that Hitler was a woman .

Nor do they think that the remains are likely to be those of Hitler 's long term partner Eva Braun , who , so the story goes , killed herself at the same time and place as the Fuehrer in 1945 .

FSB archives ' chief Lieutenant-General Vasily Khristoforov told Interfax that the decision to destroy Hitler 's remains and those of Eva Braun and the Goebbels family was ordered by the head of Russia 's KGB -- forerunner to the FSB -- Yury Andropov -LSB- who briefly became Soviet leader in 1982 -RSB- .

`` Andropov clearly listed the plan : To remove and destroy the remains of the war criminals , buried in Magdeburg -LSB- Germany -RSB- on February 21 , 1946 ... '' Khristoforov told Interfax .

Interesting though they are , the Khristoforov 's revelations do n't shed any more light on the authenticity of the skull .

For now , U.S. researchers stand by their evidence saying the skull fragment is definitely from a female , while Russia insists that the jawbone -- which the U.S. researchers did n't test -- is most definitely male .

Whatever the eventual outcome is , in this , the latest in a long line of investigations into the most reviled figure of the 20th century , it seems certain that experts and conspiracy theorists alike will be picking over the bones of Hitler 's life and legacy for decades to come .
