-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the second anniversary of the death of former North Korean leader , Kim Jong Il , the nation held a memorial in his honor , lauding his life and achievements .

During the ceremony , his son , Kim Jong Un sat front and center below the image of his father , which was festooned in gold-colored flowers . He assumed power after his father 's death in 2011 .

The memorial marking the death of the elder Kim brought out what looked like thousands of party members and military personnel , who dressed in black or in green uniforms , into Pyongyang Gymnasium . They clapped in in synchrony , raising their hands above their shoulders .

Anniversary ceremonies pertaining to the North Korea 's founder , Kim Il Sung and his son , Kim Jong Il are common .

In a separate event on Monday , members of the North Korean military -- the Korean People 's Army -- swore to uphold Kim as leader and to defend him unto death at a meeting at Kumsusan Palace , reported the North Korean state news agency , KCNA . The participants `` solemnly pledged to become human bullets and bombs '' and to know only Kim , according to KCNA .

The execution of Jang last week came as a shock .

His crimes on KCNA included : Behaving arrogantly , unwilling to stand up from his seat and `` half-heartedly clapping . ''

His widow and the current North Korean leader 's aunt , Kim Kyong-hui did not appear to attend the Tuesday anniversary commemorating the death of her brother . However , she was mentioned in a KCNA report this weekend , suggesting she had survived her husband 's purge .

After the ceremony held at the Pyongyang gymnasium , Kim Jong Un later appeared with his wife , Ri Sol Ju as they visited the mausoleum where his father 's body lies . Ri was seen walking by his side .

Sokeel Park , director of Research and Strategy at Liberty in North Korea , an NGO , said he had heard from defectors secretly communicating with family members inside North Korea that there have been greater restrictions . This is common during anniversaries marking the Kims .

`` I 've heard of increased restrictions on movement , and increased restriction on the market , '' Park said . `` The general atmosphere is one of lockdown . Combine that with the quite shocking news to North Korea that Jang Song Thaek was looking to overthrow the leadership -- that 's shocking in any society . That contributes to this tense atmosphere among North Korean people . ''

Signs of instability ?

The execution of Jang has unsettled some North Korea observers as well as its neighbors , as they look for signs of instability in the government and possibility of provocation .

Park Geun-hye , the South Korean president said on Monday before a meeting with diplomatic and security ministers , that she could not rule out `` reckless provocations '' from the north .

U.S. Secretary of State , John Kerry called Kim `` reckless '' and '' insecure '' following the execution of his uncle , stating that it makes having a nuclear weapon in the hands of somebody like him `` even more unacceptable . ''
