That group has spearheaded diplomatic efforts to persuade Iran to rein in its nuclear program , which Iran has said is purely peaceful but which U.N. and Western leaders suspect of having military aims , including a possible nuclear weapon .

Iran has been under increasing pressure to accept international demands to restrict its nuclear program , including a series of increasingly harsh economic sanctions imposed by European nations and the United States .

Last month , Iranian officials signaled they were ready to engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency , the U.N. nuclear watchdog , over the issue . The European Union said Monday that Iran had agreed to Saturday 's talks in Istanbul .

While the enrichment is n't enough to create nuclear weapons , which require a uranium content of 90 % or more , analysts and inspectors say it is step toward being able to create a nuclear weapon .

Last month , the IAEA noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in Iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities .

Iran says the enrichment is for research and medical needs .

IAEA inspectors traveled to Iran in January and again in February to discuss the issue but said Iran refused to grant inspectors access to a military base the agency believes may have been used to test explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear bomb .

On Thursday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admonished Iranian officials to come to Istanbul willing to make progress on international demands .

A top Iranian religious leader , Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani , countered Friday that Western leaders should back off , according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency .

They should , instead , `` react to Iran 's proposals logically and stop the current unconstructive accusations against the Islamic Republic , '' IRNA quoted him as saying .
