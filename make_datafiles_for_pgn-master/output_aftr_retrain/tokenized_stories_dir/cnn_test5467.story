-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three of four former Vanderbilt University football players indicted on charges of rape Friday are now in police custody , according to Nashville Metro Police Department .

The men were indicted in connection with the alleged rape of a 21-year-old student in a campus dormitory in June and are each facing multiple criminal charges , according to authorities in Tennessee .

Police said each of the four men is charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery . Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography .

Vandenburg was taken into custody at Nashville International Airport as he flew back into the city , police said . He was then taken to the hospital for a state-mandated blood test before being transported to jail .

Police said McKenzie turned himself in at Nashville police headquarters Saturday morning . He also was taken for the mandatory blood test and is being held in jail on $ 50,000 bond .

Late Friday afternoon , police officers arrested Batey at his Nashville home . He is being held on $ 350,000 bond .

In a statement issued Friday the university said `` Our first thoughts are for the victim , a Vanderbilt student , and we convey to her and her family our deepest sympathies and sorrow . We will continue to offer her all of our services and support . ''

Four days later , the four men were dismissed from the football team and suspended from the university amid an investigation . The university and city police announced the dismissals but did not identify the players at that time .

Friday 's indictments come after what police said was a nonstop investigation and `` tedious and painstaking work '' by detectives over the last six weeks .

The university said in its statement that its highest priority is student safety and security , and the university is focused on preventing any future incident like this on campus .

`` The charges brought today against the four former Vanderbilt football players allege conduct which is abhorrent and will never be tolerated , '' the statement said .
