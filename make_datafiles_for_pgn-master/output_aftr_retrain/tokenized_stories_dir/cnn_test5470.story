The spokesman 's comments , rejecting a key American condition , could potentially derail American efforts for Afghans to reach a negotiated end to the decade-long war .

In an e-mail response to questions from CNN , Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid denied previous reports that the Taliban had been invited to meet with the Karzai government in Saudi Arabia , saying that talks with what he called a `` puppet '' government would be pointless .

`` We have never been asked to attend talks with Karzai administration officials in Saudi Arabia , but even if we are asked to attend , we wo n't because -LRB- the -RRB- Karzai government is a puppet and unauthorized , and meeting with them will not be beneficial in solving the issue , '' Mujahid wrote in a message from an e-mail account regularly used by the Taliban to issue statements .

The e-mail also contained the Taliban 's first open recognition that they have met with U.S. officials in Qatar -- talks that senior American officials also confirmed .

U.S. officials have been trying to jump-start peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan officials through discussions over the past year .

Another meeting between U.S. officials and Taliban representatives could happen this month , the senior U.S. officials said .

On Tuesday , Mujahid said that the Taliban sought confidence-building measures from the Americans for talks to proceed .

`` The trust-building phase is totally up to Americans , '' the spokesman wrote , `` and they have to take measures and our conditions are as follows : Exchange of Guantanamo prisoners , the establishment of political office -LRB- in Qatar -RRB- , removing the sanction lists of the UN -LRB- against Taliban figures -RRB- . ''

American demands for the Taliban include requiring them to renounce terrorism and to distance themselves from al Qaeda , senior U.S. officials said . Taliban representatives seemed organized , professional and willing to meet those demands during the Qatar talks , according to the senior U.S. officials .
