When a Chinese patrol ship picked up two pulses in the southern Indian Ocean , the head of the Australian agency coordinating search efforts called it `` an important and encouraging lead . ''

Investigators hope the audio signals are locator beacons from the plane 's data recorders , but they 're not sure yet .

Is it the discovery we 've all been waiting for ? Could those be Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 's pingers ?

1 -RRB- The frequency does n't occur in nature .

The Chinese Haixun 01 patrol ship detected pulses at a frequency of 37.5 kHz , the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency reported . That 's the same frequency of black box pingers -- and that frequency is no accident . The pingers were designed to have that frequency because it does not occur in nature .

2 -RRB- There were two separate events .

`` I think the fact that we have had two detections , two acoustic events , in that location provides some promise which requires a full investigation of the location , '' Houston said .

3 -RRB- You usually know a ping when you hear one .

The pings are , under ideal conditions , easily recognizable . They `` ping '' like a metronome â € '' with a steady pulse about once a second .

4 -RRB- They 're in the right spot .

`` The area of highest probability , we think is now probably in the southern part of the area , pretty close to where Haixun 01 is operating , '' Houston said .

Pulse signals raise new questions

REASONS TO DOUBT

1 -RRB- The ocean is noisy .

3 -RRB- These are n't ideal conditions .

The Chinese said they did not have time to record the pulses , precluding a scientific analysis of the sounds .

4 -RRB- A spare pinger on the boat might have sent the signal .

In video of the Haixun 01 , it appears the Chinese had a spare pinger in the boat .

If that pinger gets wet , it will start transmitting , potentially confusing search teams .

`` I would n't put one where I 'm measuring , '' Patel said . `` It 's just not good common practice . ''

The hydrophone the Chinese used to detect the pulse is `` designed for shallow water applications , '' not for the deep water , said Thomas Altshuler of Teledyne Marine Systems , manufacturer of the hydrophone .

Is it possible that it heard a ping from the depths of the Indian Ocean ?

`` It is possible , but it would be right at the edge of that detection -LRB- capability -RRB- , '' he said .

6 -RRB- The underwater search of a vast area started only recently .

We 'll give the final word to Angus Houston .
