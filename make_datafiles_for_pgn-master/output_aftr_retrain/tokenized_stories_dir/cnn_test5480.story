`` All of a sudden the kids say , ` There 's someone on top of the car on the trunk , ' and I 'm like , ` What ? ' '' Brenda Cruz told CNN affiliate WSOC .

The family said they witnessed the man shattering the rear windshield before clambering inside the moving vehicle , which was being driven by a woman and had a child in a car seat inside .

`` I 'm really worried because I just hope she 's OK , you know , with her kid , '' he said .

Authorities said Monday that the incident began as a domestic dispute at a nearby Payless ShoeSource and continued on the highway .

`` The female driver is the victim and will not be charged , '' said Keith Trietley , spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department . `` She chose not to prosecute the male suspect . They are known to one another and were involved in a domestic dispute . No one was injured during the incident . ''

Trietley declined to identify the couple , noting that no charges have been filed .
