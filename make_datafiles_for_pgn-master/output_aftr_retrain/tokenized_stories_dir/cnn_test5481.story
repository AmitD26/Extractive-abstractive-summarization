`` Football is my life , football has made my life change a big deal , '' Marwa tells CNN .

Like many a young boy , Marwa became obsessed with football , often walking vast distances so he could get to a TV to watch a match . Yet despite his passion for the game , he wanted nothing to do with refereeing and for good reason .

`` Those times it was hard because a match would hardly finish without a referee being beaten , '' he explains . `` The fans were rowdy and you know , the facilities were not very good . ''

`` You were playing in open fields so the referee could be attacked anytime so when I could see that as a young boy , I did n't love it . So I was scared . ''

However , by the time Marwa became a linesman in 1998 at the age of 21 , the game had changed dramatically as more resources and education had been funneled into the sport .

The 37-year-old knows this will be the biggest test of his career so far and is prepared to have the eyes of millions of football fans scrutinizing his every decision .

`` Referees have to make decisions in the shortest time possible . I see it once but you , on TV , will see it and see a replay and you can even pause with technology and even review , '' he says .

`` As a referee I only have one angle to look at that ... so the challenge that we have as referees , the biggest one , is how to place yourself at the right position and the right moment to make that very important , crucial decision . ''
