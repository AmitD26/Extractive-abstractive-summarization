Ukrainian authorities have closed many of the routes in eastern Ukraine , according to Eurocontrol , which counts Ukraine among its 40 member states .

The United States has concluded the Malaysian airliner was shot down , a senior U.S. official told CNN 's Barbara Starr . Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk on Friday blamed `` terrorists '' for the downing . The flight was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia .

`` What I ca n't understand is why civilian airliners were flying over this area , which is just a huge error on their part , '' said Bob Baer , a CNN national security analyst and former CIA agent .

Most airlines follow the guidelines and rules set by their national civil aviation authorities and fly the most direct route from their departure to their arrival city , said Mary Schiavo , former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation .

`` It was n't this particular area , '' she said . `` They had n't defined it as a stay-away area '' even though there was violence in the region .

`` No airline will risk the safety of their passengers , crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings , '' said Tony Tyler , head of the industry group International Air Transport Association , in a statement . `` Airlines depend on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which airspace is available for flight , and they plan within those limits . ''

Many travelers are likely to avoid the major air route between Europe and Southeast Asia , Schiavo said . `` People simply will just avoid that route . I certainly would n't fly that route right now . ''

Lufthansa said it is n't making any changes to its two daily flights going from Frankfurt , Germany , to Kiev , Ukraine , or its one daily flight from Munich , Germany to Odessa , Ukraine , because they do n't cross over that airspace .

A Kiev-bound Emirates flight turned around on Thursday and returned to Dubai `` due to the safety concerns raised with the latest reports on Malaysian flight MH17 , '' and suspended all flights to Kiev immediately until further notice , according to a company statement .

Other Emirates flights to and from the United States and Europe fly a route outside the area where the crash occurred , the company said .

With the exception of flights to Kiev , Air France is no longer flying over Ukraine , the airline said . Air France suspended flights over the area surrounding Crimea in April .

American carriers including Delta Air Lines are also avoiding the region .
