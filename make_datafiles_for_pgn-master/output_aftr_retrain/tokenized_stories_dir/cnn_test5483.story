The disease has killed 67 people this year in Brazil 's Rio de Janeiro state , the state 's ministry of health reported . Slightly less than half of the deaths were children under the age of 13 , the ministry said .

Brazilian authorities are calling the situation an epidemic .

The ministry of health did not identify whether the deaths were attributed to the more severe form of dengue , dengue hemorrhagic fever , which `` can be fatal if unrecognized and not properly treated , '' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said .

Dengue fever , the more common form of dengue , is caused by four closely related viruses . All of them are carried by infected mosquitoes , mainly the Aedes Aegypti mosquito , the CDC said . Watch a report on the outbreak ''

It can not be spread from person to person .

Rio de Janeiro Mayor Cesar Maia said that patients from outside the city are flooding the municipal hospital and that there are n't enough beds to accommodate them , Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported .

The newspaper said the average hospital waits ranged from eight to 28 hours in some places .

The state 's secretary of health , Sergio Luiz Cortes da Silveira , acknowledged , `` We do n't have enough hospitals for these patients . '' He said the state was appealing for help from pediatricians elsewhere in the country . Watch ill Brazilians being cared for ''

At least part of this work , he said , included going door-to-door to inform people of where the mosquitos live . `` Without the mosquito , dengue does not exist , '' he said , according to the government .

The CDC estimates that there are 10 million cases of dengue around the world each year . `` It actually is quite common , '' said Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC . Watch Khan discuss dengue and its prevention ''
