LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The world 's oldest known Christian Bible goes online Monday -- but the 1,600-year-old text does n't match the one you 'll find in churches today .

Discovered in a monastery in the Sinai desert in Egypt more than 160 years ago , the handwritten Codex Sinaiticus includes two books that are not part of the official New Testament and at least seven books that are not in the Old Testament .

The New Testament books are in a different order , and include numerous handwritten corrections -- some made as much as 800 years after the texts were written , according to scholars who worked on the project of putting the Bible online . The changes range from the alteration of a single letter to the insertion of whole sentences .

`` The Bible as an inspirational text has a history , '' he told CNN .

That is part of the reason for putting the Bible online , said Garces , who is both a Biblical scholar and a computer scientist .

By the middle of the fourth century , when the Codex Sinaiticus was written , there was wide but not complete agreement on which books should be considered authoritative for Christian communities , according to the Web site where the Codex is posted .

The Bible comes from the Monastery of St. Catherine in the Sinai desert , where a scholar named Constantine Tischendorf recognized its significance in 1844 -- and promptly took part of it , Garces explained .

`` Constantine Tischendorf was in search for ancient manuscripts , so he appreciated the age and value of it , '' Garces said .

He took a handful of pages to Germany to publish them , then returned in 1853 and in 1859 for more . On that last trip , he took 694 pages , which ended up in St. Petersburg , Russia .

The Soviet government decided to sell them in 1933 -- to raise money to buy tractors and other agricultural equipment .

Film footage from the time shows crowds of people turning out to see the manuscript , which was considered a national treasure , he said .

Though the Bible has been reassembled online , in the real world it remains scattered .

The manuscript contains the Christian Bible in Greek , including the oldest complete copy of the New Testament . -LRB- A copy held at the Vatican dates from about the same period . -RRB- Older copies of individual portions of the Christian Bible exist , but not as part of a complete text .

The Codex also includes much of the Old Testament that was adopted by early Greek-speaking Christians .

That portion includes books not found in the Hebrew Bible and regarded in the Protestant tradition as apocryphal , such as 2 Esdras , Tobit , Judith , 1 & 4 Maccabees , Wisdom and Sirach .
