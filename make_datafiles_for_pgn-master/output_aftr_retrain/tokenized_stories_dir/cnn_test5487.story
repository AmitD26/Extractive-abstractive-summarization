The harrowing experience of an Arizona mother ending up in a Mexican border jail has prompted travel experts to renew some do 's and do n't 's for traveling .

Every year , more than 2,500 Americans are arrested abroad , with 30 % of those cases related to illegal drugs , the U.S. State Department says .

The experience of Yanira Maldonado of Arizona -- freed from jail Friday after being accused of drug possession -- seems a case of a person `` being in the wrong place at the wrong time , '' said travel expert Pauline Frommer , publisher of Frommers.com . A Mexican court determined that prosecutors did not provide evidence .

Still , the incident calls for globe trotters to be reminded of a few basics , experts say .

Do a little homework

The U.S. State Department publishes travel advisories online .

So does the U.K. version of that agency , the Foreign & Commonwealth Office .

In fact , Frommer likes the U.K. government 's travel advisories better because they are time-stamped and more detailed , such as giving the number of pickpockets over what period of time in a country .

Still , many parts of Mexico remain enjoyable destinations for tourism , Frommer said . In fact , she 's visited the country three times in the past few years : Cancun , Cozumel and Mexico City .

If a U.S. citizen is arrested abroad , he or she is subject to that country 's laws and may not enjoy the same protections as provided in the United States . The State Department stands `` ready to assist incarcerated citizens and their families within the limits of our authority in accordance with international law , '' the agency says .

If you are detained abroad and there is U.S. consular representation in that country , you have a right to a visit from a U.S. government official , said Alex Puig , regional security director of Americas for International SOS , a medical and security services firm operating in 70 countries .

Do n't look like a tourist .

`` You do n't want to raise your profile by the way you dress , '' he added .

Think as if it 's going to be stolen

Do n't carry a lot of money .

There 's no reason to in this age of connectivity .

And make sure you have a credit card with a sufficient cash advance in case you need to post bond to get out of jail , said Texas attorney Louis Lopez , who represented a man framed by drug cartels .

Be aware of your surroundings

`` Just be aware of drugs going from south to north , and drug traffickers are going to use every means available to move their drugs , '' Puig said . `` So you have to be alert . ''
