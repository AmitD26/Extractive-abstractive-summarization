-LRB- CNN -RRB- In the azure waters off the rocky coast of Antikythera , a remote island in the Mediterranean with a population of less than 50 , an international team of archaeologists has recovered new treasures from one of the most mysterious shipwrecks of all time .

The group of maritime archaeology experts have been at the site since mid-September and armed with the most advanced marine technology available , they have conducted the first-ever scientific excavation of the Antikythera wreck .

Despite facing fierce winds and choppy seas during the 30-day mission , the reclaimed items include tableware , anchors and other maritime components , as well as a giant spear , which they believe once belonged to a life-sized bronze warrior statue .

In 1900 , sponge divers from the Greek island of Symi anchored along the eastern coastline of the island while waiting for a ferocious storm to pass . What they would stumble upon would stun the world .

The heavily corroded bronze fragments would turn out to be what has been described as the world 's earliest known `` computer , '' designed in the first century BC -- the Antikythera Mechanism . Built to track the astronomical calendar and lunar movements , later radiographic image analysis of the mechanism revealed 30 intricate gear wheels .

Famed underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau visited the site in 1976 to film a documentary and returned from below the surface with treasures galore . Since then , the site had remained dormant under the aegis of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture for almost 40 years .

`` The Antikythera shipwreck is maybe the most important , most famous shipwreck from antiquity , '' Brendan Foley , an archaeologist from WHOI and co-director of the expedition told CNN before the dive began in September . `` We are hardcore scientists and archaeologists . We hate to speak of treasure but in this case , it 's actually a treasure ship and there are just no two ways about it . ''

Shrouded in mystery

Analysis of the reclaimed artifacts has dated the vessel to the first century BC , while a horde of gold coins retrieved from the water suggests the boat 's origins lie east , from Asia Minor . But no one knows for certain how big it is , what it was doing there or why it went down . Yet .

Foley said : `` This not just an everyday trader . This is probably one of the largest , most expensive ships that was sailing in the first century BC . The 1901 sponge divers reported that the artifacts were spread among an area about 52 meters along the seafloor . And that corresponds nicely with what we 've observed in our dives on the site . ''

Supported by the Hellenic Navy , Foley and his 32-man team have been provided with research vessels capable of raising artifacts weighing up to five tons straight off the seabed .

The international expedition started by mapping out the site using `` Sirius , '' an autonomous underwater vehicle -LRB- AUV -RRB- from the Australian Centre for Field Robotics . The AUV conducted a high-resolution survey of the wreck site to create precise 3D documentation of the expansive debris field . Meanwhile , technical divers equipped with metal detectors scanned the seafloor to determine the extent of the wreckage under the sediment before test trench excavations were able to begin .

And the best part is the simplicity of the technology , revealed its creator Phil Nuytten .

`` You can literally operate the Exosuit after a few hours of training . The majority of the training is spent in emergency drills . But the actual functioning of it is as simple as learning to drive a golf cart , '' said Nuytten , a pioneer in deep-sea exploratory technology .

`` The suit is controlled by footpads that can tilt forward , backwards or from side to side . ''

Aside from Exosuit 's ease , Nuytten also highlighted how the suit negates some of the side effects of conventional saturation diving , like decompression sickness and prolonged , unnecessary dive times .

But for the dive team , it 's the opportunity for exploration that is the biggest pull of Exosuit .

When human remains -- including a skull that was 80 % intact -- were recovered in ' 76 , a treasure trove of jewelry , perfume bottles and other female-related trinkets were found close by .

`` One of our pet theories is that maybe this ship was carrying a really wealthy woman from Asia Minor , and she was going to be married and this cargo was her dowry . It 's impossible to prove but it 's a nice romantic notion , '' said Foley .

With such a long passage of time between when the ship sank and the present day , and so many unanswered questions , the scientists and archaeologists expect to be working on the project for at least the next five years . And it 's a journey Foley is excited to have embarked on .

`` I like to think of shipwrecks as books , books in a library . The seafloor is a vast library and with every single shipwreck , there is a book telling us about the past and the artifact that we raise is like a page in that book .
