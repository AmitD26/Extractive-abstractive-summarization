Airbus , Daimler-Chrysler , Nokia , Renault , Samsung and Microsoft Beijing have all mandated English as their corporate language , writes Neeley in the May 2012 edition of Harvard Business Review -- and she says more than 70 Danish companies have now migrated to English .

In 2010 , Japanese internet services company Rakuten made headlines when it announced it would become an English-only organization , with all communication , verbal and email , in English .

`` English is the only global language , '' CEO Hiroshi Mikitani told CNN at the time . `` We 're doing a global business . I think this is the only way a Japanese service organization can become a global organization . ''

`` If you want to become successful in other countries , you need to internationalize the headquarters , '' he added .

`` In the absence of language strategies , you see so many people getting hurt and diminished , '' Neeley says . `` When a company announces a language change without any thought or preparation for employees , many people lose the promotional path that they 've spent their whole lives developing . ''

• Companies need a clear , well-aligned strategy and `` it needs to be supported and implemented at all levels of the organization , from the CEO down to the supervisor/manager of every employee who is subject to having to convert to a new language , '' she says .

• Off-the-rack tuition wo n't cut it . `` English lessons alone are not enough , '' Neeley says . `` If you have an aggressive environment where people work an extraordinary amount of hours and they 're challenged with goals , language vendors need to help make sure you 're capable of learning successfully while being successful at your job . ''

• Those with English as a first language need to make adjustments too . `` Native speakers need to learn how to dial themselves down and how to accommodate others , '' Neeley says .

• Managers should adopt a zero-tolerance policy to backsliding , to make it clear that the change to English is not only possible but permanent .

Depending on the company 's size , resources and the aggressiveness of its pursuit of English , Neeley estimates implementation is `` a four to 10-year odyssey '' , with ongoing maintenance required thereafter . But she says the journey is worth it , pointing out that a company with English proficiency across the board has greater operational agility and `` can serve all of their market seamlessly by using all of their human capital worldwide to achieve any end .

`` Two years ago they could have never done that , '' she says . `` That shows the extent to which expertise and knowledge flows through the company in ways it would n't otherwise . ''

For individuals too , there are benefits . Depending on their fluency and how far their career has advanced , an employee may experience performance anxiety and job insecurity when asked to work in a new language . But , Neeley says , as fluency increases , the emotional strain diminishes and bilingualism becomes something enjoyable . Perhaps even profitable .
