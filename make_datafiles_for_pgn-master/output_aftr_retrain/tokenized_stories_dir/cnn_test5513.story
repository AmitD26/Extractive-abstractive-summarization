-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Through time the art and architecture of the Islamic world has defined a civilization that once extended from Cordoba in Spain to the Mogul empire in China and India .

Today a new cultural landmark in Qatar brings together 14 centuries of that history under one roof at the Doha Museum of Islamic Art .

Designed by architect I.M. Pei , best known for his glass pyramids at Paris ' Louvre museum , the stunning building houses 3,800 square meters of treasures , spanning three continents .

Treasure trove of antiquities

`` The interesting thing is not only that the Islamic world had trade connections out to China , but that this kind of ware , that was n't used in China -LSB- at the time -RSB- was commissioned . These were works that were commissioned by merchants in Basra to be made in central China , '' Watson explained .

The Chinese `` took the blue color from the Middle East , and the Middle East was the first major customers for Chinese blue and white -LSB- porcelain -RSB- . ''

`` There is the whole history of a whole culture , a whole civilization embedded in these objects , and we are just beginning to explore that , '' said Watson .

Modern architectural icon

`` This building is very special to me , simply because it helped me to learn something about another world , another religion , another culture , '' said Pei at one of the opening events .

Pei found his inspiration for the design in the courtyard of Cairo 's Ibn Tulun mosque , specifically the 13th century ablution fountain in the center , the sabil .
