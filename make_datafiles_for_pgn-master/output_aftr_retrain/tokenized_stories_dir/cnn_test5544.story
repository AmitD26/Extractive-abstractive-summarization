-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Union organizers in the South suffered a setback Friday when workers at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga , Tennessee , voted against being represented by the United Auto Workers .

The vote was 712 against the union and 626 in favor . There are about 1,550 hourly workers at the plant who were eligible to vote .

The vote was seen as the UAW 's best chance to organize a nonunion auto plant , because Volkswagen management did not oppose the effort .

`` We commend Volkswagen for ... trying to provide an atmosphere of freedom to make a decision , '' said UAW Region 8 Director Gary Casteel , who directs the union 's Southern organizing . `` Unfortunately , politically motivated third parties threatened the economic future of this facility . ''

Organizers faced strong opposition by Republican officials who wanted to maintain Tennessee 's reputation as a non-union state in order to attract new businesses .

U.S. Senator Bob Corker , a Republican and former mayor of Chattanooga , praised the ` no ' vote .

`` Needless to say , I am thrilled for the employees at Volkswagen and for our community and its future , '' Corker said in a statement on his website .

The automaker has works councils at virtually every plant it operates around the world . But there were doubts about whether the council could be set up under U.S. labor law without a union being in place .

Volkswagen said it will try to move ahead with a works council , despite the outcome of the vote .

`` Our employees have not made a decision that they are against a works council . Throughout this process , we found great enthusiasm for the idea , '' said Frank Fischer , CEO of Volkswagen Chattanooga . `` Our goal continues to be to determine the best method for establishing a works council in accordance with the requirements of U.S. labor law . ''

Union opponents blame the UAW for problems at U.S. automakers , two of which , General Motors and Chrysler Group , needed federal bailouts and bankruptcy reorganization in 2009 . But GM , Chrysler and Ford Motor , the other UAW-represented automaker , are all posting strong profits today .

`` This is a setback that will resonate throughout the South and , likely , around the world , '' said Jack Nerad , executive editorial director at Kelley Blue Book . `` In VW the union had management that seemed neutral to positive toward its attempt to organize the plant 's workers , and it still failed to gain certification . The UAW 's attempts to organize other nonunion plants are very unlikely to be greeted with as much cooperation from other manufacturers , so this could mark the end to UAW hopes to gain traction in these nonunion Southern state plants .
