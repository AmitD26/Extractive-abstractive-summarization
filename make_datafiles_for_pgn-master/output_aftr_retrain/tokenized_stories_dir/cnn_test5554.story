-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's a children 's book from 1977 called The Big Orange Splot . In it , all the houses on one block look the same . Until one day , when a pelican drops a bucket of orange paint on one roof . Instead of painting over it , and returning to the status quo , Mr. Plumbean decorates the roof -- and then the facade , and then the yard -- with wild , rainbow patterns . His neighbors think he 's lost his mind . But one by one they see the beauty in individual expression , however weird and wacky it may look at first .

From 1965 to 1988 , János Kádár ran things in Hungary . Unlike the leaders of the other Eastern Bloc countries , Kádár practiced a sort of relaxed strain of communism : the Hungarian People 's Republic had a free market , and was tolerant -LRB- more than Stalin , at least -RRB- of individual voices and public dissent . These policies ultimately became known as `` Goulash Communism . '' It 's fitting , then , that during the Goulash Communism era , a peculiar architectural trend took off : People started painting the facades of their houses with abstract shapes , in wild shades of color .

It might be more accurate to say a decorating , or public art movement , began to take off , because the architecture style in question began in the 1920s , long before Kádár 's time . It followed the principles of Communist urban planning : city blocks filled with square , economical row houses . They were designed for efficiency , meaning every house was the same , and every house was boring .

Roters has spent years photographing the Magyar Kocka houses . She 's met some of the original owners , but also is watching as the Cube houses undergo renovations and new paint jobs . `` The intellectual elite in Hungary they hate the kind of housing and the period and the ornamental decoration , '' Roters says . In Hungarian Cubes , she writes : `` In the eyes of the rural population , these houses are simply no longer up-to-date and are therefore ... these witnesses to a way of life are slowly but surely disappearing . '' The houses are a relic of some rare individualism during a time of homogeneous , community-centric thinking .

Hungarian Cubes is available here , through Park Books .
