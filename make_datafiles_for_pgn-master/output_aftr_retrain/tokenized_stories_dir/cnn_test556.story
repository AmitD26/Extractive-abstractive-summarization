In an unprecedented report , a United Nations committee slammed the Vatican 's handling of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church and accused the church of protecting itself rather than the victims .

It calls for the church to immediately remove all known or suspected abusers from its ranks .

The report follows a hearing last month where Vatican officials were grilled over the church 's handling of child abuse allegations .

The Vatican , as a country , is a signatory of the U.N. Convention of the Rights of the Child , and it was the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child that published the report .

The Vatican on Wednesday said it will study the report . Tomasi said the church does more than `` other institutions or even other states '' to prevent further child abuse .

He criticized the U.N. report for saying the church should accept the practice of abortion .

`` The Holy See has consistently placed the preservation of the reputation of the Church and the protection of the perpetrators above children 's best interests , '' the report states .

Since taking the helm of the Roman Catholic Church in March , Pope Francis has told a senior Vatican official to carry out `` due proceedings against the guilty '' in sexual abuse cases .

The report also called on the Vatican to make it mandatory to report all cases of suspected child abuse to law enforcement .

One advocacy group , the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , said the report is evidence that Vatican claims of reform are deceptive .

It is `` utterly tragic '' that a body like the U.N. must tell the church to kick out abusers , the group said .

`` That is , of course , common sense and common decency , '' SNAP said in a statement . `` That the church hierarchy must be told this is damning . ''
