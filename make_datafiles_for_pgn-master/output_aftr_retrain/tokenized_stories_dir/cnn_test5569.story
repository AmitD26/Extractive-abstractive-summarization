-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A combative debate on Thursday between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican challenger Paul Ryan came down to the issue of trust .

Biden achieved his goal of bringing the fight to his Republican challenger in battling Ryan to a draw , boosting the spirits of Democrats disheartened by President Barack Obama 's lackluster performance last week in the first of three presidential debates .

Ryan made a positive impression with his command of both domestic and foreign policy issues that showed him to be a formidable national candidate after a career of local congressional races in his native Wisconsin .

A snap CNN-ORC International poll showed voters who watched Thursday 's debate narrowly favored Ryan over Biden by 48 % -44 % , a statistically even result after GOP presidential challenger Mitt Romney scored a clear debate victory over Obama .

Ryan repeatedly said the Obama administration has taken the nation in the wrong direction , asserting it has hindered economic recovery and weakened U.S. influence around the world .

What would you have asked ?

`` The choice is clear : a stagnant economy that promotes more government dependency or a dynamic , growing economy that promotes opportunity and jobs , '' Ryan said . `` Mitt Romney and I will not duck the tough issues , and we will not blame others for the next four years . ''

Biden called several of Ryan 's remarks `` malarkey '' and challenged Americans to trust their common sense when judging proposals by the Republican challengers .

`` You think these guys are going to go out there and cut those loopholes ? '' Biden asked about unspecified moves promised by Romney and Ryan to balance broad tax cuts they propose .

`` Folks , use your common sense . Who do you trust on this ? '' Biden asked , saying Ryan 's plan would increase Medicare costs to recipients by $ 6,000 a year . Ryan disputed the claim , which was based on a proposal that he has since altered .

The lone vice-presidential debate before the November 6 election pitted Biden , 69 , and his almost four decades of experience in national politics against the 42-year-old Ryan , a 14-year congressional veteran who rose to the chairmanship of the powerful House Budget Committee .

Polling after the first presidential debate showed Romney tightening the race nationally and in some of the nine battleground states considered vital to either candidate 's chances of garnering the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House .

Biden also was more aggressive in his demeanor , repeatedly cutting off Ryan and sometimes talking at the same time as his rival to challenge specific comments .

Ryan repeatedly sought to focus the debate on the Obama-Biden record of the last four years , arguing the administration 's policies hindered economic recovery and weakened the nation 's standing and influence in the world .

Martha Raddatz of ABC News aggressively moderated the debate , challenging both candidates on some claims and moving on to various topics covering both domestic and foreign policy .

`` Romney points out 47 % of the people wo n't take responsibility , '' Biden said . '' ... He 's talking about the people that have built this country . All they 're looking for is an even shot . ''

In the biggest laugh line of the night , Ryan conceded Romney did n't express the thought exactly as he wanted at the fundraiser , then needled the gaffe-prone Biden by saying : `` I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words do n't come out of your mouth the right way . ''

Biden immediately responded `` but I always say what I mean , '' later adding that if anyone thought Romney 's `` little soliloquy on the 47 % '' was just a misstatement , `` then I think you 're ... I 've got a bridge to sell you . ''

Ryan , the conservative congressman from Wisconsin , criticized Obama 's administration for its failure to protect four Americans killed in the Libya attack last month , and for mixed messages about what transpired .

Where they stand : Candidates and issues

`` This Benghazi issue would be a tragedy in and of itself . But unfortunately it 's indicative of a larger problem , '' Ryan said , adding that illustrated an unraveling of the administration 's foreign policy .

On Iran , widely backed international sanctions pushed by Obama and backed by allies have devastated the Tehran economy , Biden said . He rejected assertions that Obama failed to work closely with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , and that the United States lacked commitment to a possible military strike to prevent Iran from becoming capable of developing a nuclear weapon .

`` This president does n't bluff , '' Biden said .

Biden to stump in Ryan 's backyard after debate

Opinion : Ryan should speak for the millennials

Last week , Obama was chided for being passive , and polls conducted after the debate indicate the White House race is now extremely tight ahead of the election .

Key surveys indicate that Obama and Romney are knotted up in the battleground states of Virginia , Florida , Ohio , Wisconsin and Colorado . Most experts believe that nine swing states will determine the next president .
