-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rory McIlroy was confirmed as winner of the Race to Dubai Sunday despite not lifting a club in anger for six weeks .

But eyebrows were raised when the 25-year-old McIlroy said he would sit out the WGC-HSBC Champions and BMW Masters tournaments in China to prepare for a court battle against his former management company .

Germany 's Siem , who won the BMW Masters event , made a brave attempt to win in Turkey to keep the race alive .

He started the final round Sunday just a shot off the lead , but could only card a closing 71 to finish tied eighth , with Donaldson 19th and Garcia 25th .

Koepka , who lives in Florida , clinched his first European Tour victory with a superb closing 65 on the Montgomerie Maxx Royal course at Antalya to finish 17 under par .

It left him a shot clear of England 's Ian Poulter , who was left to rue a missed six-foot birdie putt on the 18th to force a playoff .

Henrik Stenson of Sweden finished third to move into second in the Race to Dubai standings , but 2,726,514 points behind McIlroy , with 1,666,600 on offer to the winner in Dubai next Sunday .

`` That four-week spell over the summer , from the British Open to the US PGA Championship , would have to be the best golf of my life , so I feel like I 've really earned the Race to Dubai . ''
