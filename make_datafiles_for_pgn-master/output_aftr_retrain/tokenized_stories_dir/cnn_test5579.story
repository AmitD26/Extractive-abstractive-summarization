Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The word `` terrorism '' in the United States usually brings to mind plots linked in some way to al Qaeda , while the danger posed to the public by white supremacists , anti-abortion extremists and other right-wing militants is often overlooked .

And if , after investigation , Sunday 's attack on the Sikh temple in Wisconsin is included in this count , the death toll from right-wing terrorism in the U.S. over the past decade rises to 15 .

The shooting suspect , Wade Michael Page , posed with a Nazi flag on his Facebook page and has played a prominent role in `` white power '' music groups . The FBI is investigating the case as a `` domestic terrorist-type incident . ''

The numbers in the New America Foundation database may well understate the toll of violence from right-wing extremists . Another FBI study reported that between January 1 , 2007 , and October 31 , 2009 , white supremacists were involved in 53 acts of violence , 40 of which were assaults directed primarily at African-Americans , seven of which were murders and the rest of which were threats , arson and intimidation . Most of these were treated as racially motivated crimes rather than political acts of violence , i.e. terrorism .

By contrast , 11 right-wing and left-wing extremists have managed to acquire CBRN material that they planned to use against the public , government employees or both .

Not included in those numbers were four elderly Georgia men who were arrested in November , accused of plotting to produce the deadly toxin ricin , which they wanted to throw out of a car window as they drove along a highways in the eastern and southern United States . The government says that one of the men , Frederick Thomas , was recorded by an informant as saying , `` There is no way for us , as militiamen , to save this country , to save Georgia , without doing something that 's highly , highly illegal : murder . ''

Right-wing extremist individuals over the past decade in the United States were as likely to use violence as a means to express their political or social beliefs as those motivated by Osama bin Laden 's ideology . Even more worryingly , during the same time period , right-wing and left-wing extremist groups and individuals have been far more likely to acquire toxins and to assemble the makings of radiological weapons than al Qaeda sympathizers .
