-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When most people think of chocolate , Swiss confectionery houses and Belgian pralines spring to mind . It 's a picturesque scene . It 's also not the truth .

`` We are branding our chocolate ` Uganda , ' '' says Felix Okuye , co-founder of Pink Food Industries , a food startup in Kampala . `` Uganda is not popularly known as a cocoa-producing country , '' he continues . `` As we brand our chocolate , the world out there will know that there is cocoa and chocolate coming from Uganda . ''

`` We took it upon ourselves to teach ourselves , '' says Okuye . `` So with the savings we had we began with the minimum , and as such we also developed artisan equipment , to process our products . ''

` Small player '

The two Ugandan entrepreneurs might be working to ensure people know where their treat is coming from , but their country is still far from being considered a leading cocoa power player -- unlike countries like the Ivory Coast and Ghana .

The Ivory Coast 's lion 's share is increasing year-on-year with cocoa bean production in the country expected to reach an estimated 1.730 million tons for the 2013/2014 cocoa season , compared to 1.449 million tons recorded for the previous period . In comparison , last year Uganda produced an estimated 20,000 tons of cocoa , according to data from the International Cocoa Organization -LRB- ICCO -RRB- .

And it does seem like the Ugandan government has thrown its weight behind local cocoa growers , having established the Cocoa Development Board to oversee the industry from under the aegis of the Ministry of Agriculture , Animal Industry and Fisheries .

John Muwanga Musisi , a coordinator from the ministry 's Cocoa Seedling Project says there is currently an estimated total of 9,000 small cocoa producers in the country , `` with well over 25,000 hectares planted with cocoa at various stages of maturity and production . ''

He continues : `` It is predicted that with the level of planting taking place today , -LSB- the -RSB- land area planted with cocoa will increase to over 50,000 hectares within the next five years , which will produce well over 50,000 metric tons , to earn Uganda over $ 125 million . ''

Meanwhile back at the Pink Food Industries plantation , the founders are working to generate local buzz around the brand . Having launched just six months ago , Sembuya says they 've already had a lot of interest from Kamapla-based buyers . He adds , however , that they are n't going to pigeonhole themselves as just a chocolate startup .

Okuye says : `` We believe that now we have a product out of our very own cocoa in our farm , we now have the confidence to promote cocoa growing in Uganda . ''
