The Republican candidate for Senate in Iowa carries 49 % of support to U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley 's 45 % according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday .

Ernst gained support among independents , a key bloc that favored Braley in the previous Quinnipiac poll . Ernst carried 51 percent of independent support to Braley 's 41 % , a seven-point upswing for Ernst .

Republicans picked up an unprecedented lead in Iowa 's early ballot count last week after a beefed up early voter ground game and the two parties are now neck-in-neck in the early voting game . But the poll showed Braley still winning the early voting game , as Democrats have done in the past , leading among the respondents who had already voted 57 % to 36 % .
