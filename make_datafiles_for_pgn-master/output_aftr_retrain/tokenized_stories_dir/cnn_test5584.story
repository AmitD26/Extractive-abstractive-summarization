`` Hernan was a very happy boy , '' she says . `` He gave me flowers all the time . He 's the first ` man ' -LRB- to -RRB- give me flowers . ''

On Valentine 's Day in 1999 , Hernan suffered severe head trauma while sledding in the snow-covered mountains above the Los Angeles basin .

Eva says she tried to reach her son but could n't navigate thick snow and ice . She flagged down a passing vehicle and asked the occupants to alert authorities .

Hernan was airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital , where , two days later , he was declared brain dead .

A family care coordinator with One Legacy , an organ and tissue recovery agency , approached Eva and her husband , Arnold , to talk about donating Hernan 's organs .

That young girl , 9-year old Megan Corfee , recently recalled the day when she and her mother , Debbie , received word that a donor organ was available .

When Megan was just 7 years old , she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis , a liver disease that she says `` made my body think I did n't have a liver . ''

`` I had my liver transplant when I was 9 years old . I am now 13 and I am doing very well , '' she wrote . `` I am very thankful that you decided to have your loved one 's organs donated . ''

Three years after Megan sent that letter , the two families -- who lived about 30 miles away -- agreed to meet .

Since they first met in 2006 , the Corfee and Perez families get together every year at fundraising events for Donate Life , which handles the national organ and tissue registry and helps to raise awareness about the benefits of organ donations .

The Perezes treat Megan like their own child , and Eva and Megan have formed a particularly close bond , communicating nearly every day , either on the phone or via Facebook .

It 's rare for donor and recipient families to meet , let alone forge such a close relationship , according to Bryan Stewart of Donate Life .

`` In the case of Hernan , it was devastating for the family to lose him in such an accident , '' Stewart said . `` And yet at that time , they saw the opportunity to leave a legacy of life where they could see Hernan 's gift grow into other people . ''

But , Debbie Corfee added , `` I see , especially in Megan , that it 's something that gives her a boost and a spark in life . That life is worth living because of her connection with this family . ''

On a recent Saturday morning at the Rosemont Pavilion next to the Rose Bowl , the Corfee and Perez families met to help hundreds of other volunteers decorate the Donate Life float for the Tournament of Roses Parade scheduled for January 1 .

Eva grasped Megan 's hand tightly and said , `` Look at the float ! ''

Three years ago , the Perez family was chosen to make a floragraph -- a floral portrait of Hernan on the Donate Life float featured in the parade . Eva Perez was selected to walk alongside the float , holding a tether to a hot-air balloon that featured a portrait of Hernan .

This year , Arnold Perez was chosen by his fellow volunteers to represent them on the Donate Life float . He will be one of 28 float riders .

Eva Perez credits the organization for giving `` my son 's death meaning . ''

With their son never far from their thoughts , the Perez family will spend this Christmas at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City decorating Hernan 's grave site with tinsel , wreaths and artificial snow as they do every year .

`` In the six short years that Hernan was on Earth , it was clear to see that he was a marvelous boy , '' Arnold Perez said . `` The fact that he was so marvelous and generous made it easier for us to make the choice to have him be an organ and tissue donor .
