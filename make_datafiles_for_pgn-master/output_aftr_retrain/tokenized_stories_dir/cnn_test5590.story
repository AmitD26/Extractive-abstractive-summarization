`` He 's out in those woods right now , '' Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett told reporters Monday morning . He was flanked by State Police Lt. Col George Bivens , who added , `` I do believe that we are close to him at this point . ''

Frein had been planning the ambush for months or possibly years , authorities said .

Investigators said the items they found were either abandoned or hidden by Frein , who is a skilled marksman and trained survivalist .

Slaying planned for months ?

As to the rifle that was found over the weekend , it was positioned in such a way that it could be seen , and the items were partially concealed , Bivens said earlier .

`` Frein obviously knows we 're there '' searching , he said .

Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein , including members of the FBI , the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .

Hunters should avoid the thick woods , authorities have said .

Bivens also warned that anyone who helps Frein will be charged accordingly .
