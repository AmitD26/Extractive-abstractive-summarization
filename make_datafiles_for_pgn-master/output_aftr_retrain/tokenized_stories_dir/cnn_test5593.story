The 25-year old , who had been hoping to regain his place in the team for next week 's Test match against India , passed away on Thursday after failing to recover from an induced coma at a hospital in Sydney .

Australian team doctor Peter Brukner told a press conference Thursday that Hughes suffered a `` massive bleed into his brain '' during the game on Tuesday afternoon .

He said the ball hit the side of his neck and , `` as a result of that blow , his vertebral artery was compressed by the ball . That caused the artery to split and for bleeding to go up into the brain . And he had a massive bleed into his brain . This is frequently fatal at the time . ''

But he said doctors on the scene , including a specialist who had been in the crowd , managed to resuscitate him . He was later taken to hospital where they made `` an intervention '' to release pressure on his brain . He was then put in an induced coma but failed to recover .

Family devastated

Michael Clarke , Australia 's Test captain , then read a short statement on behalf of Hughes ' family .

`` We are devastated by the loss of our much-loved son and brother . ''

`` It 's been a very difficult few days . We appreciate all the support we 've received from family , friends , players , Cricket Australia and the general public .

`` We would like to thank all of the medical and nursing staff at St Vincent 's Hospital , and Cricket NSW medical staff for their great efforts with Phillip , we love you . ''

Outpouring of emotion

`` His death is a very sad day for cricket and a heartbreaking day for his family . What happened has touched millions of Australians .

`` Australians ' thoughts and prayers are with the Hughes family . ''

Born in Macksville , New South Wales , Hughes was a talented sportsman who counted both cricket and rugby league among his attributes as a teenager .
