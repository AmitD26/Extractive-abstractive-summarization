-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Glenn Beck shared Monday a secret he 's kept from almost everyone for years : He 's been battling a serious and rare illness .

Eventually , he learned what was wrong : he had a variety of ailments , including an autoimmune disorder and adrenal fatigue .

Speaking through tears , the former Fox News host detailed the progression of his illness and the symptoms he suffered .

Beck said he struggled to remember names , faces and conversations . At other times , his hands would shake and he would be forced to curl up into a ball .

`` While I was at Fox , the pain would get so bad that my camera crew , our executive producer Tiffany and I , had worked out hand signals so they would know when to take the camera off of me , '' Beck said .

`` We did n't know at the time what was causing me to feel as though , out of nowhere , my hands and feet , or arms and legs would feel like someone had just crushed them , set them on fire or pushed broken glass into them . ''

At the same time , he said , Beck and his wife continued to look for answers and found them at the Carrick Brain Centers , a rehabilitation center in Texas .

`` We went and after a few short visits they found that I had several things going on -- from an autoimmune disorder to adrenal fatigue , and they found the connection on everything that was going on , '' Beck said .

`` My brain is back online in a big way , '' he said . `` I have received a clean bill of health . ''
