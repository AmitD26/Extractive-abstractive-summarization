-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From scavenging for food through garbage and sleeping in the streets , to becoming an international fashion model and a Hollywood A-lister , Djimon Hounsou 's journey to stardom has been an astonishing one .

The Benin-born actor , one of the most prominent film stars to come out of Africa , has appeared in blockbusters such as `` Gladiator , '' `` Amistad '' and `` Blood Diamond , '' and has worked with Hollywood royalty like Steven Spielberg and Leonardo DiCaprio .

His role in the film `` In America '' made him the first black African man to be nominated for an Oscar , while his performance in `` Blood Diamond '' earned him a second nomination .

It 's a long way from where the soft-spoken actor imagined he would be while growing up under difficult conditions in the West African country of Benin .

`` I was just a very torn child , very wounded in so many areas , with no family support , '' recalls Hounsou , who grew up without his parents , who had moved to Ivory Coast .

At the age of 13 he left Benin to move to Paris with his older brother -- but the hardship continued .

`` The rocky time came right after I left school , '' remembers the acclaimed actor . `` I spent a lot of time at night navigating the streets of Paris trying to find something to eat , '' he says .

Hounsou 's good looks , however , did get noticed by a Paris photographer , who invited him to audition as a fashion model . There , Hounsou met famous French designer Thierry Mugler and soon established himself as a successful high-fashion model .

But the break-out moment in Hounsou 's acting career came three years later with Steven Spielberg 's `` Amistad , '' where he appeared alongside Hollywood legends Anthony Hopkins and Morgan Freeman .

`` It was one of the most powerful stories about Africans that define African Americans ' legacy and that a lot of people were shy about wanting to hear , wanting to see , '' says Hounsou of the film .

Hounsou , who is married to former fashion model Kimora Lee Simmons , is also an outspoken activist and a prominent campaigner in the fight against climate change .

His desire to make a difference has seen him working with charities such as Oxfam and SOS , while in 2009 he spoke at the United Nations ' Summit on Climate Change in New York -- a far cry from his early days as a lonely child in Benin .

He says : `` It was a great journey , but I strongly feel like I 'm still at the beginning of that journey '' .
