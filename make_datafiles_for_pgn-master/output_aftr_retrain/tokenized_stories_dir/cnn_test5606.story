`` This step is very much in the right direction , '' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal , who spearheaded a letter from 17 attorneys general who recently banded together to urge Craigslist to discontinue its adult services section .

The embattled website has been under fire for allegations that it promotes prostitution .

Craigslist representatives told CNN on Saturday that they will release a statement at a later time .

`` The message here is put people over profits , '' said Blumenthal , who is running for the U.S. Senate from Connecticut as a Democrat . He said officials will continue monitoring Craigslist and other websites for such content .

`` The increasingly sharp public criticism of Craigslist 's Adult Services section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it , '' the attorneys general had said in an Aug. 24 letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster and Founder Craig Newmark .

`` We strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women , through the Internet or by any other means , '' said Susan MacTavish Best , who handles press inquiries for Craigslist .

`` We hope to work closely with them , as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement , to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking , and to combat such crimes wherever they appear , online or offline . ''

In a later blog post , Buckmaster said Craigslist implemented manual screening of adult services ads in May 2009 . `` Since that time , before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney , '' the post said .

He said the attorneys are trained to enforce Craigslist 's posting guidelines , `` which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages , newspapers , or any other company that we are aware of . ''

Attorneys general from Arkansas , Connecticut , Idaho , Illinois , Iowa , Kansas , Maryland , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , New Hampshire , Ohio , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas and Virginia made the request a week after accused `` Craigslist killer '' Philip Markoff committed suicide in jail .

Markoff was charged with the April 2009 killing of Julissa Brisman . Boston Police said that Brisman , a model , advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist , and Markoff might have met her through the website .

A CNN investigation of Craigslist 's adult services section , which replaced `` erotic services ads '' two years ago , counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day . Many offered thinly veiled `` services '' for anything from $ 50 for a half-hour to $ 400 an hour .

CNN 's Deborah Doft and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report .
