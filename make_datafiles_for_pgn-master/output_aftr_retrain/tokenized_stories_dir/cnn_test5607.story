-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On December 16 , a young medical student in one of India 's major cities was gang-raped , her body destroyed by the bodies of the men who allegedly assaulted her and also by the rusting metal bar doctors say they used to penetrate her . The bar removed part of her intestines . The rest were removed in a hospital far from home where she struggled for her life for just a few days .

It has taken an attack that lies nearly outside of comprehension to prompt demonstrations , but the outcry has begun .

Over the weekend , women rose up in Nepal , protesting outside the prime minister 's house against gender-based violence .

According to Eve Ensler , the head of V-Day and One Billion Rising , a movement calling for women to rise up on February 14 , 2013 , and demand an end to violence , women in Somalia are planning what may be their first-ever major demonstrations against rape and violence . Ensler will be in Mumbai Jan. 4 and Delhi Jan. 7 and will meet with activists and leaders for events aimed at raising awareness of the movement .

This groundswell -- what Ensler calls `` a catalytic moment '' -- is the perfect chance for us to consider how we think about subjugation , rape , and degradation of women globally .

Gloria Steinem and I have written about how a cult of masculinity is behind the constant violation of women around the world -- that some men brutalize women against their own self-interest because of an addiction to control or domination . To put it plainly : Rape is not about sex .

Opinion : Misogyny in India -- We are all guilty

`` Rape is about violence , '' Steinem says , `` proving ` masculine ' superiority ; often inserting guns and other objects into women 's bodies ; playing out hostility to other men by invading the bodies of ` their ' females , including old women and babies ; occupying wombs with sperm of a conquering group ; owning female bodies as the means of reproduction ; and raping men and boys to make them as inferior as females . ''

This is born out everywhere that rape occurs but especially in war zones like the Democratic Republic of Congo , where Dr. Denis Mukwege , the medical director of Panzi Hospital , told me men use objects as a means to mark a woman -- to indicate that she now carries the message of violence impressed on her body . She becomes an emblem of terror meant to warn the world that nobody is safe . And while rape in war zones carries its own particular kind of horror , there is no escaping the cult of masculinity geographically . The culture of rape imbues whatever space we inhabit .

These are more than just manipulative words ; victim-blaming has consequences . Women are literally dying from fault-finding from Syria to Sudan in honor killings , suicides , and murders because they are blamed for their sexual assaults .

We have to move the focus off the victim . Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that the `` safety and security of women is of the highest concern to our government . ''

It 's time to focus on the perpetrators . And it 's also time for men and women to engage in a consistent dialogue on stopping rape .

Let 's publicly and privately declare all sexualized violence unacceptable .

Let 's hold perpetrators legally accountable and once and for all change laws and justice systems that continue to fail women .

Let 's declare 2013 The Year to End Rape . If this is a problem that men have created , this is a problem that men can help solve .
