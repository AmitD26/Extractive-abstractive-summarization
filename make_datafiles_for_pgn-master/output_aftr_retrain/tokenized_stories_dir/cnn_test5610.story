-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The price of silverware just got a whole lot more expensive .

`` We 've never won it . We have a huge maritime history . We have to bring this thing home . ''

In the 163 year history of the race , Britain has never won the prestigious silver trophy . Adding insult to injury , the first competition took place on its shores in 1851 .

Will the `` Auld Mug , '' as it is affectionately known , finally return to its birthplace in the next edition of the race in 2017 ?

A keen sailor herself , the Duchess went head-to-head against her husband Prince William in a yacht race during their recent tour of Australia and New Zealand -- emerging victorious 2-0 .

It 's hoped she 'll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to Ainslie 's team , but also add the type of international lustre so attractive to the world 's richest investors .

Money matters

Around 40 % of the $ 134 million budget has already been raised , with Ainslie and his board now on the hunt for big commercial sponsorship .

It 's a huge investment -- and one they 're touting as the advertising chance of a lifetime .

`` If you could be the brand that brings the America 's Cup back to Britain , I think that 's a phenomenally powerful thing to be associated with , '' said Charles Dunstone , chairman of the racing team and co-founder of British phone retailer The Carphone Warehouse .

The team will need deep pockets to be a serious contender against reigning champions Oracle Team USA -- owned by tech billionaire Larry Ellison , the fifth wealthiest person in the world according to Forbes .

Ainslie is under no illusions about the challenges ahead . He was part of Ellison 's 2013 winning team , helping them to a thrilling comeback against Emirates Team New Zealand .

`` This is n't Larry Ellison 's budget , so we have to be very focused with the money we have , '' he said , adding that the multimillion dollar pot would go towards design , logistics , and a world class crew .

`` They say Ainslie has the Midas touch -- I 'm not sure about that , but I have seen him time and time again achieve the impossible , '' said Olympic gold medalist and CNN 's Main Sail presenter Shirley Robertson .

Daring design

This is not a competition based on brute strength alone , and part of Britain 's success will come down to the clever design of their vessel .

Gone are the days of heavy yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails .

Today 's multihulls are like airplanes on water , sitting high above the waves , with crew members wearing wetsuits , carry oxygen tanks , and communicating via radio .

`` Finally here was a format the public seemed to absolutely love , '' said Dunstone .

The New Zealander was quick to point out that Ainslie was `` the type of bloke who always gets in the first round of beers , '' and you get the feeling this is n't just an assemblage of world class athletes , but close friends hoping to make history together .

`` I remember as a kid watching these amazing boats racing , '' said Ainslie , who grew up in Cornwall , on England 's picturesque south west coast .

How true that turns out to be , we 'll soon find out .
