Rep. Marcia Fudge , the caucus ' chair , called the grand jury 's decision a `` slap in the face to Americans nationwide '' in a statement released just moments after St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury 's decision .

`` This decision seems to underscore an unwritten rule that Black lives hold no value ; that you may kill Black men in this country without consequences or repercussions , '' Fudge said , calling the decision a `` miscarriage of justice . ''

The shooting of Brown , an unarmed black teenager , at the hands of Wilson , who is white , drove locals and activists around the country to the streets of Ferguson this summer and again this week in anticipation of a grand jury announcement which many hoped would at least deliver a trial in the shooting .

As tensions in Ferguson flared and violence erupted amid largely peaceful protests , the caucus members called on protesters to remain peaceful in expressing their anger and urged activists to channel a moment of frustration into a larger movement to effect change on the justice system and relations between African-American communities and police departments nationwide .

Rep. John Lewis , a veteran of the civil rights movement who helped lead the 1963 March on Washington alongside Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. , sent a message to protestors on Twitter :

Rep. Karen Bass said in a statement Monday that she was `` deeply disturbed '' that the grand jury did not indict Wilson .

`` And tonight the grand jury attacked justice by not holding Officer Wilson accountable for his actions , '' she said . ''

Rep. Lacy Clay , who represents Ferguson and St. Louis County in Congress , called the grand jury 's decision `` extremely disappointing '' and said he shares `` the anger and frustration , '' but called on protesters to be nonviolent .

Clay added that he was not surprised by the grand jury 's decision and said he had been concerned about the local investigation since Brown 's death .

The two senators from Missouri , Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Roy Blunt released statements following the grand jury 's decision calling for protests to remain peaceful .

Blunt said in a statement he hoped the community could `` move forward and heal as we work to find better job opportunities in and more investment for challenged communities . ''

He added that his thoughts were with Brown 's family and with `` those in law enforcement who continue to protect the rights of all they serve . ''

`` While we await the conclusion of that independent investigationâ € '' and continue working together for solutions to systemic issues highlighted by this tragedyâ € '' I 'm praying that the good people of St. Louis and local law enforcement will remain peaceful and respectful of one another , '' McCaskill said .

Another Missouri lawmaker and member of the Congressional Black Caucus , Rep. Emanuel Cleaver , posted a dozen messages on Twitter as St. Louis County prosecutor began his press conference to announce the grand jury 's conclusion .
