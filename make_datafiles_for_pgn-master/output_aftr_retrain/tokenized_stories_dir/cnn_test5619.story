-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The ability to share images and thoughts instantly is one of the marvels of the Information Age . Most of us , thanks to Facebook , have a relationship to a social network that involves a stream of conversation -LRB- albeit often banal : `` I 'm making chicken . ... '' Really ? -RRB-

But more than conversation , our profiles usually include photos and sometimes YouTube video sharing -- and not just ones of Charlie Sheen sounding off , but also home movies of little Annie 's ballet recital or Grant 's first ski run .

Much has been publicized about how important it is for parents to monitor their kids ' use of technology , but what are the guidelines for parents of small children ?

I decided to poll some parents to hear their views .

Mary Kay , mother of two , has no issue having her kids ' photos on the Web . Even her personal profile photo on Facebook is a family shot . She also posts individual photos of them on her Facebook page .

When I asked her if she thinks this could pose a threat to her kids , she said , `` No I do n't . Maybe I am ignorant , but I do n't worry about it . '' She also went on to say that she likes to think people are good .

Then she added , `` Then again , our house did get broken into two weeks ago . '' -LRB- She was not relating this to her Facebook practices , but instead acknowledging she was an optimist when characterizing humanity . -RRB-

She also did n't believe it was a big deal to have her kids posted on YouTube . Michael , on the other hand , father of two , is `` creeped , '' out by having his kids ' images on Facebook or the Web , yet his wife , Stephanie , does use Facebook to keep in touch with their family miles away .

She said , `` As long as you use your privacy settings , and -LRB- have -RRB- location services shut off , I do n't have a huge problem with it . ''

I wondered what I would hear from people who were high profile or had a bit of celebrity standing . I talked to mom blogger Jessica Gottlieb , who has a large Internet following .

She never posts photos of her kids on the Web . She believes her `` children are entitled to make their own first impression . '' Being their friend on Facebook takes this opportunity away . She also said she feels , `` Mom blogs are Disneyland for pedophiles . ''

A mid-30s father of two is shooting a reality television show about his company and his family life . -LRB- He is not permitted to discuss specifics about the show until it airs . -RRB- When asked how he felt about having his kids be part of a TV show , he said , `` At first we -LRB- he and his wife -RRB- were against it . ''

He feels he and his wife are making a show that realistically portrays the juggle of balancing family and work , and will shed insights on that struggle . The show he is involved in is not about the kids , so he has let go of his misgivings about it .

She added she does not want people to be unduly alarmed , but urges parents , `` Make sure only trusted people in their lives have access to your photos . ''

In a statement on the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children 's resource guide , the advice is : `` There is no particular way to prevent your uploaded images from being copied , saved and used by other individuals online . The only way to ensure that no one is using and saving your images is to avoid uploading them to the Internet . ''

I spoke with Pattie Fitzgerald , child advocate and founder of Safely Ever After , an organization in Santa Monica , California , dedicated to children 's safety . I asked about Facebook , specifically .

She said , `` I have not heard of any parents with young children being stalked because they saw pictures of kids on someone 's Facebook page . '' Still , she urged caution , adding , `` It is very easy for information to wind up in the wrong hands . ''

Some people are afraid of flying , others of terrorist attacks . Some are able to , or chose to , live without fear .
