I have often thought of European officials as the proverbial `` plate spinners '' from the circus . Those talented artists who balance spinning plates on sticks , ever increasing the number of sticks , rushing from one to the other , giving them a tug and pull to keep them moving , always aware that if they are too slow or too fast , one of the plates will crash to the ground .

That is exactly what we have in Europe today . Only the artists are European Central Bank president Mario Draghi , Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker , European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso et al , while the plates are Greece , Spanish banks , Italian deficits , eurobonds and German chancellor Angela Merkel .

Family tragedy tells country 's story

Sometimes there are so many plates spinning it is difficult to see which one requires the most immediate attention . Is it Spain 's banks which have just been promised a huge wodge of cash ? Or the French and German banks which will suffer losses if Spanish banks fail ? Perhaps it is the German government 's intransigence ?

Human cost of Greek crisis

The artists are the European leaders , both at national and European Union level . How good are Messrs Van Rompuy , European council president , and his fellow spinners Barroso , Draghi and Juncker at keeping things going -- along with help from Christine Lagarde , at the International Monetary Fund , and others ?

The spinners have given us some heart stopping moments , such as when it looked like they would stare down Greece into leaving the euro , or in midnight summits when they seemed unlikely to reach a deal .

But the sad fact is that while they are keeping the plates spinning , they are doing very little to actually safely remove any of the plates from the stick and bring the act to a close .

Unfortunately that is not the case . The plate spinning is likely to continue for some time to come . We all need to hope that this is one act that has the stamina and ability to get to the end .

Some plates are always spinning , while others need sudden attention

But it is the skill of the artists that matter -- and they show no sign of bringing act to close
