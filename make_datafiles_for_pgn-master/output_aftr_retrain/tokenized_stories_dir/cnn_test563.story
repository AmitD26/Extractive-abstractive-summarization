-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Those probably were not UFOs that hovered over China recently , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology analyst said .

The images of the UFOs have caused quite a stir in China and on blogs around the world .

But many of the images appear to be faked with the software program Photoshop and the ones that were not faked seem to depict the launch of a Chinese ballistic missile , said Geoffrey Forden , an MIT weapons analyst .

`` It seems to me that a DF-21 -LRB- missile -RRB- launch somewhere near Jiuquan and aimed at a point somewhere in the eastern Gobi desert is the most likely cause of this ` UFO ' '' , Forden wrote .

Purported photos of the unworldly object have appeared online , on YouTube and on television news shows .

Meanwhile , The Shanghai Daily reported a UFO appeared above the city of Chongqing a day later .
