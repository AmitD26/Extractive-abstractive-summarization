Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said the piece made him almost want to throw up , and House Speaker John Boehner said he was `` insulted . ''

Putin said he wrote the article `` to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders . ''

Putin 's answer to that ?

`` It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional , whatever the motivation , '' he wrote .

World reaction

He concluded with the line , `` We are all different , but when we ask for the Lord 's blessings , we must not forget that God created us equal . ''

The White House shrugged off the fuss around Putin 's jabs at Obama , describing them as `` irrelevant . ''

Obama himself ignored a question about the op-ed on Thursday . His chief spokesman , Jay Carney , said that Putin has a right to his opinion , noting that America is an exceptional nation .

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi questioned Putin 's views on equality .

`` What I found interesting was the closing -- when he says when we pray to God he judges us all - I do n't know exactly what his words are but he says ` we are all God 's children . ' I think that 's great . I hope it applies to gays and lesbians in Russia as well , '' Pelosi said .

` Hey Putin '

`` Hey Putin , next time you wan na write a letter to convince America about something , how about you skip saying we 're not exceptional ? #rude , '' tweeted Sarah Rumpf , a political consultant in Texas .

Russia 's wars

`` Man who launched military action in Georgia and Chechnya without UN say-so says wars without it are illegal ? '' tweeted the journalist John Podhoretz .

Some Twitter users unearthed a previous op-ed that Putin wrote for the Times about the Chechen war in 1999 .

Putin , then the prime minister of Russia , struck a different tone in which he sought to explain Russia 's military action .

`` No government can stand idly by when terrorism strikes , '' he wrote . `` It is the solemn duty of all governments to protect their citizens from danger . ''

Senator 's stomach turns

The overall tone of Putin 's latest broadside was too much for Menendez , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , who said he read the article at dinner on Wednesday .

`` Putin made a compelling , though disingenuous , case against military strikes . Its effectiveness shows how badly Pres Obama was outmaneuvered , '' tweeted Marc Lamont Hill .

Others saw it in less subtle terms .

For some people , the tension between the two presidents has become a spectacle in its own right .

`` Putin plays his next move on our very own NYTimes . This is almost getting as good as Breaking Bad , '' wrote Twitter user @MiketheEye .

Others said the tone of the article brought to mind some of the famous photos of Putin in macho poses .

`` Putin wrote his Times op-ed on an Underwood , shirtless , with hunting knife nearby , '' joked Chris Regan .
