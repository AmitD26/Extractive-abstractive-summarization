Inside one Tehran coffee shop , a young , veiled Iranian woman held her fianc√© 's hand tightly as the seconds ticked down in Iran 's heart-stopping World Cup match against South American powerhouse Argentina .

Another woman gently bit her French-manicured nails as she sat between two male friends who were drenched with nervous sweat and fast losing their voices .

`` It 's actually much better to watch it with a bunch of people around because it makes you feel more excited , '' said Roya Marzbahan .

Authorities in Iran banned women from entering most sporting events following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because mixed crowds enjoying games was deemed un-Islamic .

For the past 35 years , the crowds at football games -- Iran 's most popular sport -- have been all male .

Iranian women were briefly allowed to attend volleyball matches during the presidency of moderate Mohammad Khatami but the ban was reinstated in 2005 when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power .

But in a country where conservative social norms often clash with a young , defiant , fun-loving population , women have continued to demand equality .

Earlier this month , several Iranian women snuck into a men 's volleyball match in Tehran disguised as Brazilian fans , state media reported .

Others protested outside the match .

`` We have rights too . We should be able to go to games , '' said Negar Valayi .
