Former Gov. Tom Kean , a widely esteemed figure in New Jersey politics who co-chaired the commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks , is accusing the state legislative committee of partisanship and acting in a `` purely political '' fashion .

`` I know something about nonpartisan investigations , this is n't one , '' the Republican told CNN . `` I 'm disappointed . ''

The findings -- set to be released in a report Monday and obtained by CNN 's Chris Frates -- fall in line so far with a review conducted by Christie 's administration earlier this year , in the sense that both have found no wrongdoing on the part of the governor .

Meanwhile , U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman is still conducting a federal probe into the incident , where lanes to the nation 's busiest bridge were closed for alleged political reasons , causing major traffic gridlock in the town of Fort Lee , New Jersey for four days in September 2013 .

He openly questioned Christie 's leadership skills in an interview with the Washington Post , and told the New Yorker 's Ryan Lizza that Christie managed a culture of intimidation within his administration .

Kean on Friday was hesitant to offer his views about Christie 's personality or reputation , only revealing , `` I do n't see it the way I once did . ''

The two have made amends this year , and Kean said Christie asks him for advice `` every now and then . ''

Kean freely admits that he thought the scandal merited investigation from the outset , saying there was a `` tremendous number of questions '' when the news broke .

The makeup of the committee consisted of four Republicans and eight Democrats , including the two co-chairs , Wisniewski and Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg .

Republicans complain that they were n't granted equal participation in the investigation , saying they had no say in the selection of legal counsel for the probe , nor in the selection of witnesses or the private interviewing of witnesses .

The committee hired former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reid Schar of Illinois , the same prosecutor that went after former Illinois Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich .

The internal probe launched by Christie 's own administration -- which cost taxpayers millions of dollars -- was also not a truly bipartisan effort , Kean acknowledged .

But that probe , he continued , `` never pretended to be anything except for what it was , '' and `` when you 're accused of a criminal act as governor , you got to spend time on it . You do n't have much choice . ''

`` If they 're going to continue , they should just do it right , '' he said . `` They should bring in the Republicans . ''

`` We have done absolutely nothing for months upon months . We have received no communications from our chair since this summer , '' Schepisi said . `` I do n't see what else there that we 're expected to do here . ''

A Democratic member , Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle , disagreed that the committee was partisan and felt that she `` was treated the same as -LRB- her -RRB- colleague across the aisle '' in terms of having access to the panel 's lawyers and to documents released by the co-chairs .

She acknowledged that Democratic members were not privy to private interviews of witnesses but said `` we let them have the flexibility , '' referring to the counsel selected by committee leadership .

He denied that he was part of the leak of the latest report , which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal , and said the legal firm was chosen out of state `` so no one could allege there was a political tie '' to a local law firm .

`` I have the highest respects for Governor Kean , but I believe the information he 's acting on inaccurate information , '' he said .

The probe , he continued , has been limited due to a lack of access to witnesses who are also being asked to cooperate in the federal probe . Their testimony could help the panel come to a more conclusive finding , he said , stressing that the report set to be released on Monday still shows uncertainty about what the governor knew and did n't know .

He argued that the Republican backlash over the committee 's work is `` their only recourse '' to criticize the process .

`` Some of Christie 's closest aides and allies put public safety at risk , seemingly to exact petty political revenge , and in the aftermath , they lied about it , '' he said in a written statement . `` That , in itself , is inexcusable conduct coming from the administration of someone who wants to be President of the United States .
