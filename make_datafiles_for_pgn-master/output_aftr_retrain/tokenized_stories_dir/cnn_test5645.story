In Peshawar , the trio met with `` Ahmad , '' an al Qaeda operative who put them in touch with two al Qaeda leaders . Those leaders asked the three from Queens to participate in attacks against the United States . Zazi refused . He wanted to fight the U.S. military in the fields and mountains of his homeland , not to kill American civilians in the streets of his adopted country .

So , according to American prosecutors , al Qaeda 's leaders brought in someone more persuasive -- someone who could speak to Zazi in his own language , someone who had also grown up on the streets of New York City in the 1990s , a man who had had a meteoric rise in the ranks of al Qaeda over the past decade from camp dishwasher to the leader of the group 's operations in the West . His name was Adnan Shukrijumah .

In 1995 , Shukrijumah 's family left New York for the Fort Lauderdale area in Florida , where he did odd jobs like selling used cars , earning money that he used to pay for his studies in chemistry and computer science at Broward Community College .

Around this time , Shukrijumah told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the excesses of the West , such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the skimpy clothes that women wore in Florida . In May 2001 , he left Florida again , and by June he was back in Afghanistan .

Shortly after the 9/11 attacks , Shukrijumah called his mother in Florida , saying , `` Did you hear what happened ? They are putting it on the Muslims . '' His mother advised him not to come back to the States , and she said in 2010 he did not contact her again .

It was Shukrijumah who , in late 2008 , made the pitch to Zazi and his buddies from Queens -- Zarein Ahmedzay , another Afghan-American , and Adis Medujanin , a cab driver of Bosnian descent -- that they could help the cause of holy war best if , instead of fighting alongside the Taliban 's tens of thousands of fighters , they went back to the States after their training by al Qaeda 's bomb-makers and launched attacks there .

They discussed with Shukrijumah potential targets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Times Square , as well as a Walmart store .

Luckily , Zazi 's plan to blow up bombs in the Manhattan subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks was detected by U.S. intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known al Qaeda operative in Pakistan who was in touch with Zazi . Zazi and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot .

It was Shukrijumah who oversaw this plot . After all , who better to oversee al Qaeda plots to attack the States than someone who had grown up in Brooklyn and Florida ?

A Pakistani army spokesman said on Twitter on Saturday that Shukrijumah was killed in South Waziristan along Pakistan 's border with Afghanistan .

The fact that Shukrijumah is now dead makes the United States a little bit safer from al Qaeda 's plotting . And the fact that Shukrijumah was killed in a Pakistani military operation is a sign that Pakistan continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with Afghanistan in a meaningful way , which has long been a demand of the United States .

Finally , Shukrijumah 's death is indicative of how al Qaeda 's core organization that launched the 9/11 attacks continues to dwindle in size and capacity , because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured .
