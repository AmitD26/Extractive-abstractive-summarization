The Pee-wee persona originally developed in the 1970s , evolving from Reubens ' early improv work with Los Angeles troupe the Groundlings . After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of `` Saturday Night Live , '' Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with `` The Pee-wee Herman Show , '' which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special .

As a sign of his character 's '80s legacy , Pee-wee -LRB- not Reubens -RRB- was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame .

In 1991 , Reubens was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult theater in Sarasota , Florida . With Pee-wee then the punchline of dirty schoolyard jokes , Reubens retired the character for most of the decade .
