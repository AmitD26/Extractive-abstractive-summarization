Benedict Arnold was bent on betraying the garrison at West Point to the British during the Revolution . Klaus Fuchs and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg ferreted out nuclear secrets for the Russians . Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen identified American penetrations for ultimate execution by the Soviets .

We have also had our share of leakers .

But Snowden is in a class by himself .

In general terms , it 's already clear Snowden 's betrayal hurts in at least three important ways .

Greenwald has disputed the notion that he aided Snowden , telling David Gregory on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' : `` The assumption in your question , David , is completely without evidence , the idea I 've aided and abetted him in any way . ''

And Michael Clemente , Fox News ' executive vice president of news , has said , `` we are outraged to learn ... that James Rosen was named a criminal co-conspirator for simply doing his job as a reporter . ''

Absent `` rogue '' U.S. action to silence him , Snowden has promised not to reveal this data , but there are already reports of counterterrorism targets changing their communications patterns . And I would lose all respect for China 's Ministry of State Security and Russia 's FSB if they have not already fully harvested Snowden 's digital data trove .

As former director of CIA , I would claim that the top 20 % of American intelligence -- that exquisite insight into an enemy 's intentions -- is generally provided by human sources . But as a former director of NSA , I would also suggest that the base 50 % to 60 % of American intelligence day in and day out is provided by signals intelligence , the kinds of intercepted communications that Snowden has so blithely put at risk .

Others , most notably in Europe , will rend their garments in faux shock and outrage that these firms have done this , all the while ignoring that these very same companies , along with their European counterparts , behave the same way when confronted with the lawful demands of European states .

The real purpose of those complaints is competitive economic advantage , putting added burdens on or even disqualifying American firms competing in Europe for the big data and cloud services that are at the cutting edge of the global IT industry . Or , in the case of France , to slow negotiations on a trans - Atlantic trade agreement that threatens the privileged position of French agriculture , outrage more based on protecting the production of cheese than preventing any alleged violation of privacy .

The third great harm of Snowden 's efforts to date is the erosion of confidence in the ability of the United States to do anything discreetly or keep anything secret .

Manning 's torrent of disclosures certainly caused great harm , but there was at least the plausible defense that this was a one-off phenomenon , a regrettable error we 're aggressively correcting .

Snowden shows that we have fallen short and that the issue may be more systemic rather than isolated . At least that 's what I would fear if I were a foreign intelligence chief approached by the Americans to do anything of import .

Snowden seems undeterred by any of these consequences . After all , he believes he is acting for a higher good -- an almost romantic attachment to the merits of absolute transparency -- and he seems indifferent to the legitimacy of any claims of national security .

The appropriate balance between liberty and security has bedeviled free peoples , including Americans , for centuries . But it takes a special kind of arrogance for this young man to believe that his moral judgment on the dilemma suddenly trumps that of two -LRB- incredibly different -RRB- presidents , both houses of the U.S. Congress , both political parties , the U.S. court system and more than 30,000 of his co-workers .

Arrogant or not , Snowden has thrust into public view sensitive and controversial espionage activities . So what of his facts , fictions and fears and of the national debate that he claims he intended to stimulate ?

He says the large trove of data reveals how America collects much of its intelligence
