Now , it 's Democrats who will take the back seat on Capitol Hill , relying mostly on the power of the filibuster to stymie Republicans and keep Obama 's legacy intact .

In the House , CNN projected the GOP will have at least 246 seats , its largest majority since World War II . Speaker John Boehner , celebrating a widened majority , said he is `` humbled by the responsibility the American people have placed with us . ''

`` The message from voters is clear : they want us to work together , '' Reid said . `` I look forward to working with Senator McConnell to get things done for the middle class . ''

Obama will make a statement Wednesday afternoon on an election many will see as a repudiation of his presidency , and he will host bipartisan leaders Friday to try to chart a way forward .

Democratic losses pile up

The GOP also piled up wins in Montana , South Dakota , Arkansas , West Virginia and North Carolina -- all seats that had been in Democratic hands -- to surpass their magic number of six net gains . With seats still to be decided in Virginia , Alaska and Louisiana -- where there will be a runoff in December -- the GOP currently has 52 seats in the Senate .

Republican numbers stood up when the GOP managed to hold on to seats in Kansas and Georgia which had threatened to fall from their grasp and complicate the Senate math .

It was a night of almost unrelenting misery for Democrats :

• Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor lost to Tom Cotton , who , like Ernst , is an Iraq war veteran . Pryor 's loss comes despite former president Bill Clinton 's efforts to save him in his beloved home state .

• Democrats thought they had Colorado , with its mix of young voters , Hispanics and students locked down for a generation . But Sen. Mark Udall tumbled to charismatic challenger Cory Gardner who shook off claims he was anti-women .

• Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is having a tougher ride than expected against Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in a state Democrats had thought was reliably theirs after Obama won it twice .

New superstars , new villains and other takeaways

Republicans will now look with some optimism on the 2016 presidential election .

But Democrats will console themselves with a more favorable Senate map in two years ' time and the belief that shifting demographics and an unresolved war between the Republican grassroots and the party establishment will make the next presidential race a tough climb for the GOP .
