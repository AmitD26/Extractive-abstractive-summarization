Kristina Larsen , a spokeswoman for Climate Justice Action -LRB- CJA -RRB- -- the group organizing the protest -- told CNN that police have used pepper spray and dogs to contain the protests .

At the same time protesters were marching towards the U.N. summit , a number of delegates were planning to walk out of the Bella Center .

A spokesman for the Copenhagen police told CNN that the majority of arrests have taken place outside the Bella Center but there have been no serious injuries .

On Sunday , police said they had detained 968 people , accusing protesters of donning facemasks , throwing fireworks and stones , breaking windows and setting vehicles alight . A further 212 people were arrested overnight on Monday .

CJA says that protesters are engaged in `` peaceful , nonviolent protest '' and accused the police of being `` out of control . ''

While the protests were going on outside , inside it was being announced that Danish minister Connie Hedegaard had resigned as president of the U.N. climate change summit .

`` The resignation is essentially procedural , '' CNN 's Phil Black said , `` and she 'll be replaced by the Danish prime minister . It 's a reflection of the fact that the talks are now at the high-level phase , and it was deemed appropriate that the PM should now take over . ''

World leaders have started arriving in Copenhagen for the final days of `` high-level '' negotiations . British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was among the first to arrive , holding talks Tuesday with Australian and Bangladeshi counterparts Kevin Rudd and Sheikh Hasina . U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to arrive Friday .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told nations Tuesday that they had the chance to `` change the course of our history '' if they worked together to limit carbon emissions that are blamed for increasing global temperatures .

`` We have a chance -- a real chance , here and now -- to change the course of our history , '' he said , noting that countries had to work quickly , because nature does n't negotiate .

He urged both industrialized and developing countries to do more during this week 's Copenhagen summit toward reaching an agreement on limiting the emissions , saying they `` can and they must do more . ''

`` This is a time to stop pointing fingers , '' Ban added . `` This is a time to start looking in the mirror and offering what they can do more of . ''

Clinton 's assertion came as a major international summit headed into the home stretch . `` Nearly all of the growth in emissions in the next 20 years will come from the developing world , '' Clinton wrote in an opinion piece for the International Herald Tribune . `` Without their participation and commitment , a solution is impossible . ''

Developing countries object to restrictions that they fear would keep them from following the same path to prosperity taken by the United States and other industrialized nations .

The man running the conference warned Tuesday that `` nowhere near enough progress '' had been made toward an agreement .

`` There is still an enormous amount of work and ground to be covered if this conference is to deliver what people around the world expect it to deliver , '' Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change , said at a news conference .
