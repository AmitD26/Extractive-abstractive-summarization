-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The head of the U.S. Coast Guard and a congressman planned to travel to the Coast Guard Academy on Thursday to speak to cadets about the discovery this summer of two small hangman 's nooses on Coast Guard properties .

`` These are going to be our future leaders . The last thing you want are your leaders not being tolerant , '' Rep. Elijah Cummings , D-Maryland , told CNN before heading for the academy with Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen .

A 6-inch string tied as a noose was found in an African-American cadet 's sea bag in July while he was serving aboard the historic tall ship Eagle .

And during race-relations training in August -- set up in response to the first incident -- a white female civil rights instructor found a small noose in her office at the academy in New London , Connecticut .

Initial investigations failed to discover who was responsible . Last week , after the incidents became public , academy superintendent Rear Adm. J. Scott Burhoe ordered the Coast Guard Investigative Service to investigate further .

People found to be involved could be prosecuted under military law , he said in a written statement .

Last month , two teenagers were arrested in nearby Alexandria , Louisiana , after driving through town with nooses hanging from their pickup truck , the night after a protest march brought thousands of demonstrators to Jena .

In Hempstead , Long Island , a suburb of New York , a noose was found Friday hanging in the locker room at a police station . Community leaders called for an investigation into that incident .

`` The noose , to African Americans , is a symbol of hatred and it takes us back to the times when African-American people were being hung from trees for no reason at all , '' Cummings said . `` And so it 's a very offensive kind of thing . ''

The Coast Guard Academy has about 980 cadets , about 14 percent of whom are minorities . African Americans make up about 4 percent of the corps . E-mail to a friend
