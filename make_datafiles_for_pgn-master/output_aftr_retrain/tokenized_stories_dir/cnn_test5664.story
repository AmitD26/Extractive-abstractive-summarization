Honduras President Jose Manuel Zelaya was detained and sent to Costa Rica , the government said .

The political developments that swept Honduras over the past weeks and led up to Sunday 's coup had the makings of a crisis , but the situation in the Central American nation of 8 million people was calm .

Roberto Micheletti was sworn in as provisional president to the applause of members of Congress , who chanted , `` Honduras ! Honduras ! '' Outside the building , supporters of ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya protested , but their numbers were limited , and the streets remained mostly peaceful . Micheletti told CNN en Espa√±ol Sunday evening that he has imposed an `` indefinite '' curfew .

Micheletti , the head of Congress , became president after lawmakers voted by a show of hands to strip Zelaya of his powers , with a resolution stating that Zelaya `` provoked confrontations and divisions '' within the country . A letter of resignation purported to be from Zelaya was read to members before the vote .

Zelaya awoke to the sound of gunfire in his residence and was still in his pajamas when the military forced him to leave the country Sunday morning , he told reporters . He was flown to Costa Rica , where he has not requested political asylum .

`` This was a brutal kidnapping of me with no justification , '' Zelaya said .

The coup was widely criticized in the region , in strongest terms by Zelaya 's leftist allies , including Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez . A statement from Venezuela 's foreign ministry said Zelaya was `` violently expelled from his country by a group of unpatriotic , coup-mongering soldiers . ''

The Bolivian government also condemned the coup , accusing Honduran troops of kidnapping Zelaya and violently expelling him from his country .

Elsewhere , Jose Miguel Insulza , the secretary-general of the Organization of American States , strongly condemned the coup in a statement . And in Washington , President Obama said in a statement that he was `` deeply concerned '' by the news .

But in Honduras , the Supreme Court said in an official statement that the military was acting in accordance with a court order to put an end to Sunday 's scheduled vote , which the court 's justices had found illegal .

No other countries immediately recognized Micheletti as president .

Zelaya , a leftist elected in 2005 , had found himself pitted against the other branches of government and military leaders over the issue of Sunday 's planned referendum . It would have asked voters to place a measure on November 's ballot allowing the formation of a constitutional assembly that could modify the nation 's charter to allow the president to run for another term .

In various interviews Sunday , Zelaya characterized the vote not as a referendum , but as a survey to gauge receptiveness toward a constitutional assembly . He denied that he would have been the beneficiary of any future constitutional changes .

Zelaya , whose four-year term ends in January 2010 , can not run for re-election under current law .

The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled the poll illegal , and Congress and the top military brass agreed , but Zelaya had remained steadfast .

In separate appearances Sunday , Zelaya , Venezuela 's Chavez and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said that the military had also detained Honduran Foreign Minister Patricia Rodas , further raising regional tensions .

`` If they attack our ambassadors , they will be declaring a state of war , '' Chavez said . `` If they have weapons , then we have weapons , too . ''
