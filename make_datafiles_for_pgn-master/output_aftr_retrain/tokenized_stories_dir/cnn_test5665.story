WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama told congressional leaders Thursday he 's planning to pull all combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010 , according to three congressional officials .

President Obama says he plans to keep up to 50,000 support troops in Iraq after combat troops leave in 2010 .

All U.S. troops have to be out of Iraq by December 31 , 2011 , under an agreement the Bush administration signed with the Iraqi government last year .

White House officials confirmed the president will deliver a speech about Iraq to troops at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina on Friday , his first visit to a military base since being sworn into office .

While liberals may be frustrated that Obama is not keeping his campaign promise to the letter , the president could win credit from lawmakers in both parties for giving military commanders more time and flexibility to finish the mission .

What may turn out to be more controversial is the number of noncombat troops that will remain in Iraq under Obama 's plan .

Sen. Richard Durbin , the No. 2 Democrat and a close Obama ally , said before the White House meeting that he 's anxious to get troops home . But he defended the administration , saying it is `` trying to strike the right balance '' between ending the war and maintaining stability in Iraq .

A spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain , the top Republican on the Senate Arms Services committee and an attendee at the White House meeting , told CNN that McCain supports the plan to leave 50,000 troops in Iraq .

`` The president 's objective to withdraw U.S. combat troops from Iraq is one we should pray for , plan for , and work toward , '' McHugh said in a written statement .

`` Our commanders must have the flexibility they need in order to respond to these challenges , and President Obama assured me that there is a ` Plan B , ' '' McHugh said .
