-LRB- CNN -RRB- What is Africa 's most prosperous country ?

According to new research from the Legatum Institute , which last week ranked prosperity in 38 African countries around criteria ranging from economics to education to health , the title belongs to Botswana , the diamond-rich country in southern Africa .

In contrast , the Central African Republic was the lowest ranked country on the continent . The country , which has a per capita GDP of $ 584 , has seen increasing violence since the end of 2012 , and only 21.5 % of the population have access to sanitation according to the prosperity index .

These findings bucked trends across the continent , where 41 % of women are out of work , as opposed to 23 % of men .

As over 44 % of Kenyans thought it was a good time to find employment , the country ranked ninth in terms of entrepreneurship and opportunity . But following the 2013 siege in Nairobi 's Westgate Mall , the country ranked 32 of 38 in terms of safety and security .

Falling down the ranks

Regional partner Tanzania , by contrast , fell eight places since 2012 going from 11th to 19th in the latest rankings . A drop in five-year average growth and an increase in inflation were coupled with a decline in confidence in financial institutions and falling satisfaction with living standards .

The country fared particularly badly in terms of personal freedom , where it fell from 24th to 28th .

In all , average prosperity in Africa has been on the up since 2012 . In the past two years all countries have seen increases in at least one area tracked by the report .
