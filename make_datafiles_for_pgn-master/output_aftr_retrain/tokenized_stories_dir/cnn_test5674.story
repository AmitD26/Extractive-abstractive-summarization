-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's 06:30 am and the sun has just risen over the bustling gardens of Mbuyoni elementary school , in the coastal city of Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .

`` I like to grow blackjack , fame flower , pumpkin leaves and sweet potatoes , '' explains 11-year old Zulfa Mussa in her native language of Kiswahili .

Mussa is new to the world of agriculture and has enjoyed cultivating her favorite crops this morning . `` I did n't know they were edible and now I know , I eat them . '' In fact , she eats them for lunch , along with the rest of her school .

Mussa 's school is putting African traditions back on the menu in a new era of indigenous school meals . Plants native to her home country , Tanzania , are being harnessed as a result of an idea pioneered by people at the other end of the age spectrum -- retired women -- the Regent Estate Senior Women 's Group -LRB- RESEWO -RRB- .

Native plants such as blackjack , moringa , pumpkin , sweet potato and even the leaves of these latter two plants , have high nutritional and medicinal value . But , they 're under-appreciated by the communities in which they grow , often dismissed as weeds .

Setting new traditions

One afternoon in 2007 , Chale invited her senior peers for tea which was made from the leaves in her garden . That day her mission to save gastronomic traditions began . And it began with children .

The elementary school at Mbuyoni has over 1200 students , all of whom appear to have come in at the crack of dawn to tend eagerly to their crops . There are groups of children tilling land , whilst others collect water from the well or wander around with watering cans . A final few harvest leaves and roots to be eaten for lunch that day . This is the atmosphere every morning , I 'm told .

`` In the morning session , normally we have time to clean the environment and take care of our garden , '' says school headmistress , Dorothy Malecela . She has seen the impact the garden has had on the general health and well-being of her pupils . `` It increased school enrollment and reduced dropout because the kids are happy to come in , '' she says .

RESEWO currently works with 10 schools in Dar es Salaam , but hopes for the indigenous food movement to spread across the country .

The need for improved nutrition

One cause of this is the increasing reliance on staples such as maize and sweet potatoes . Another cause is that locals have been eating more food high in fat and sugars , such as burgers . Plants with higher nutritional value , including the leaves of the sweet potato plant , seem to have been forgotten .

Improving diets is a national concern , but for the women at RESEWO , their goal is to get people appreciating the food directly under their nose .

`` In the villages , most of these vegetables grow as weeds , '' says Schundia , who worries that people do n't even seem to use them when they have nothing to eat . By raising awareness into growing indigenous plants , the team hope to get people harnessing these plants as year-round sources of food on their doorstep .

It 's all in the taste

Furthermore , the leaves of a sweet potato plant are high in protein , fiber , and minerals such as iron . The more local blackjack plant also contains vitamins and minerals and has traditionally been used as medicine to overcome anemia . Insight into these plants , and many more , have been compiled into a recipe book put together in association with the slow food foundation for biodiversity , an Italian-based NGO promoting environmentally and culturally sustainable agriculture .

Method :

1 . Wash yams thoroughly and peel . Wash again and cut into pieces the size of an egg .

5 . Add the washed vegetable leaves , cover and leave to cook until ready .
