-LRB- CNN -RRB- Shannon Zwanziger seemed perfectly healthy . She was an active 17-year-old who rarely got sick and had n't been to a doctor in more than three years .

Then one day , she came home with the flu . She died a week later .

It 's blamed for more deaths than it was at this time last year -- including 15 children . That 's as of December 20 . Already , more flu-related deaths are suspected , including a 4-year-old boy in Port Isabel , Texas , CNN affiliate KGNS reports .

It 's still early in the flu season , which often begins in early fall and persists through May , so it remains to be seen exactly how pervasive the flu will be .

Passed out in her mother 's arms , never came to

Zwanziger began administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and screamed for her husband , Terry , who called 911 . Emergency medical workers rushed Shannon to a hospital , which found a slight heartbeat and flew her to a larger hospital . After a few hours , her heart stopped altogether .

`` She was such an incredible kid , '' Gwen Zwanziger said by phone . `` She had her whole life planned out . She was living life to the fullest . If you 're going to have the perfect kid , she was it . ''

But Zwanziger says the family later learned that at some point , Shannon 's liver gave out . And an autopsy confirmed that she had a type A flu .

The CDC said that because of privacy rules , it can say only that there were two `` confirmed reports of flu-pediatric deaths in Minnesota this season . ''

It will be several more weeks before autopsy results show whether Shannon had an underlying health issue that the family was unaware of , Zwanziger says .

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an annual physical exam throughout childhood after the age of 4 . But a study found that one third of Minnesota teens ages 13 to 17 had no preventive care visits , and another 40 % had only one such visit during those years .

Medical care not enough

When Shannon became sick , Zwanziger says , she got excellent medical care , but it was n't enough . She wants more people suffering from symptoms to have blood tests .

The Zwanzigers gave their daughter a choice , and she chose to forgo the vaccine . It 's unknown whether the vaccine would have saved her .

Bad year for the vaccine

`` It 's still about 61 % effective , '' Dr. Seema Yasmin , a CNN medical analyst , said . `` Most flu vaccines protect against three or four different strains of flu actually , so even if it 's not a great match against one particular strain , it will still protect you against the other strains that are going around right now . ''

While alarming , the latest statistics do n't indicate that the outbreak this year will be , overall , worse than in previous years , the CDC told CNN on Wednesday . It 's too early to know .

Flu activity is high in nearly half the country -- 22 states and Puerto Rico , according to a map released by the CDC .

An infectious disease specialist with the Inova health care system in Fairfax , Virginia , said medical staff has been busy .

In the week ending December 20 , nearly 7 % of deaths were blamed on pneumonia and flu . That 's higher than it was at the same time last year , but later on in the season , the percentage of deaths blamed on the flu generally goes higher .

The 2009 season , which stretched from April 2009 to October 2010 and included the H1N1 pandemic , saw 348 deaths .

Totals are known for children but not adults because child deaths must be reported to the CDC ; there 's no similar requirement for adult deaths .

The not knowing

Mixed in with all the pain and grief the family is suffering is the frustration of not knowing how the death happened .

`` I just can not figure out why she died from this , '' the grieving mother says .

CNN had contacted an online fundraising campaign for the Zwanziger family -- her parents and her sister , who is married and has a baby -- to learn more about the girl 's death . Organizers got back in touch , saying Gwen Zwanziger wanted to talk and deliver a message : `` We need to take it more seriously . And you need to be really proactive . ''
