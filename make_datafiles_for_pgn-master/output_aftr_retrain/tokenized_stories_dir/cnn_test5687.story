`` I wanted to be the girl who gets thrown off Shamu , '' she says .

`` We had both fallen in love -- not only with each other , but also with the national parks , '' she says . `` We both decided to go at it together . ''

Her first permanent position came in 2009 at Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site south of Asheville , North Carolina . In 2012 , she returned to Everglades . Shane works as a park ranger in nearby Biscayne National Park and the couple now has an 18-month-old daughter , Sierra Harrington .

For a day trip , do n't miss : Drive the 36-mile main road from Royal Palm to Flamingo . Diaz says there are several boardwalks along the way that are easily accessible and offer 10 - to 15-minute walks into the wilderness .

Favorite less-traveled spot : Snake Bight in Florida Bay . Diaz says Snake Bight is a `` bay within a bay '' where thousands of multi-colored wading birds congregate .

Favorite spot to view wildlife : Anhinga Trail . Diaz says the water is lower during the winter , so wildlife congregates in the deeper waters near the trail . It 's a great place to see birds , alligators and fish .

`` It 's really amazing for its biodiversity , '' she says .

Most magical moment in the park : In 2001 , a flock of birds flew over her kayak while she watched the sunset in Flamingo Bay .

`` There was a loud noise from behind me and I could n't turn around , '' she says . `` They came in waves . Dozens of tropical birds flying back to their roosting areas . ''

Funniest moment in the park : Fish jumping out of the water and into canoes as she led a six-boat tour in 2002 .

`` We must have spooked a school of fish , '' she says . `` Dozens of fish began jumping in a frenzy that lasted about eight seconds . It was such a quiet moment and then we were scrambling to flip them back in the water . ''

`` If you feed them , they will -LRB- begin to -RRB- assume people mean food , '' she says . `` That can lead to negative interactions in the future . ''

`` I have a love affair with giant trees , '' she says . `` I think it would be amazing to be in a forest with trees that are 300 feet tall . ''
