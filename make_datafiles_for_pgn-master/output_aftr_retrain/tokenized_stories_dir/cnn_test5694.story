All three were present at the opening of the Beverly Hilton Hotel in 1955 . Since then this Beverly Hills landmark has hosted Hollywood 's and Washington 's elite -- and its drama .

From former Sen. John Edwards , who was discovered there with his mistress , to Heidi Fleiss , the so-called Hollywood madam whose alleged prostitutes were caught in an undercover sting at the hotel , many public figures have stories that haunt the Hilton 's halls .

But there 's a shiny side to the hotel as well . The Beverly Hilton boasts more than 100 red carpet events each year , including the People Magazine Awards , the Daytime Emmy Awards , the Oscar nominees luncheon and the Golden Globes .

`` In today 's world , when a lot of people think of the Beverly Hilton , they think of Whitney Houston , '' Galloway said . `` It has become a defining thing for -LRB- the hotel -RRB- . ''

Management stays away from discussing the hotel 's Hollywood travails . But like it or not , the Beverly Hilton Hotel has hosted high drama for decades .

`` John F. Kennedy was rumored to have had liaisons there , '' Galloway notes . `` Who knows how many were true and how many were false ? ''

Nixon went on to become president , but `` this turning point in -LRB- his -RRB- life -- and it could have been the end of his political career -- happened at the Hilton , '' Galloway says .

The Beverly Hilton has n't always been a hip spot in Hollywood . When Nixon , then vice president , helped open the Beverly Hilton , he declared it `` magical . '' But the luster and intrigue of the hotel had begun to wane by the time Merv Griffin bought the property in 1987 .

The former producer and talk show host poured money , and himself , into the hotel . With his Hollywood influence , the facade once again shined .

`` He made a big impact on the hotel with the entertainment world , '' said Robertson . `` He had his table by the pool ; he was out there every day and you never knew who was going to come have lunch with him . ''

Today at the same pool , just days before the 72nd annual Golden Globes , tourists wander around , hoping for a glimpse of a star . On this day it 's not meant to be ; only stagehands buzz around , readying the International Ballroom for the awards telecast .
