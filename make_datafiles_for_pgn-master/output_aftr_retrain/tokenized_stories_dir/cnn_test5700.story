The mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv underwent emergency surgery after being shot in the back , city officials and police said Monday , amid continuing unrest in the region .

The attack on Mayor Gennady Kernes happened around noon local time , the Kharkiv city office official website said . It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the shooting .

After a two-hour operation , Kernes was out of surgery but in critical condition , the city office said .

Police said an investigation unit was trying to determine the circumstances of the shooting .

In a major challenge to Kiev 's new leaders , armed rebels have captured towns and government buildings across eastern Ukraine and are holding a team of European monitors hostage .

Western nations accuse Moscow of supporting the separatist gunmen who are occupying official buildings in cities across the region .

The United States on Monday imposed sanctions against seven Russian government officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in its latest action to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine .

The move , Obama said , was to spur Putin to `` walk the walk , not just talk the talk '' in resolving the crisis in Ukraine .

The European Union also announced Monday that it was imposing sanctions on 15 people who are `` responsible for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity , sovereignty and independence of Ukraine . '' A list of the people targeted by the latest sanctions will be published Tuesday and will go into effect at the same time , the Council of the European Union said . The sanctions will include asset freezes and travel bans .

U.S. and Russian defense secretaries speak

According to a Pentagon description of their conversation , Shoigu `` reiterated his assurance that Russian forces would not invade Ukraine . '' Hagel , the Pengaton said , called for an end to what he described as `` Russia 's destabilizing influence inside Ukraine '' and `` warned that continued aggression would further isolate Russia and result in more diplomatic and economic pressure . ''

The Russian government 's description of the call said Shoigu `` definitively denied the groundless allegations of the presence of Russian sabotage and military intelligence groups on Ukrainian territory '' and criticized what he called `` anti-Russian hysteria recently unleashed in the Western press . ''

Ukrainian soldier killed

A homemade bomb exploded near Ukrainian soldiers who were in the eastern Donetsk region Monday , killing one and injuring another , Ukraine 's Defense Ministry said .

The death came days after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants in an operation to clear roadblocks near the city of Slavyansk last week . Police are investigating Monday 's blast , the Defense Ministry said .

Observer freed

Pro-Russian separatists holding a European military observer team in eastern Ukraine released one of the observers for medical reasons Sunday , shortly after parading them before cameras .

At least seven of the inspectors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe appeared at a news conference staged by Vyacheslav Ponomarev , the self-declared mayor of Slavyansk , who referred to them as `` prisoners of war . ''

The freed observer was from Sweden and had been suffering from diabetes , Ponomarev spokeswoman Stella Khorosheva told CNN . Michael Bociurkiw , an OSCE spokesman in Kiev , called it `` a welcome development . ''

Putin has repeatedly criticized what he says is Kiev 's use of force against Ukrainian civilians .
