More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer 's today , with another person developing the disease every 68 seconds . By 2050 , the number of people living with Alzheimer 's disease is expected to triple .

As if those numbers were n't staggering enough , consider this : Alzheimer 's disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 -LRB- it 's currently ranked No. 6 -RRB- in the United States that ca n't be prevented , cured or slowed down .

Ask any expert , and he or she will tell you that early diagnosis is key to helping patients live better day to day , so even though the disease is still progressing , the symptoms are less harsh .

`` Our hope is that if we could identify patients who are developing the disease early , it would give us a much better opportunity to intervene with treatments , and it 's much more likely for those treatments to be effective , '' says Dr. Keith Black , chairman of neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center .

Robillard and her colleagues at the University of British Columbia found that unique monthly visitors for the parent sites hosting the online tests reached as high as 8.8 million .

At the same conference , another study concluded that the misdiagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease in Medicare patients who actually have vascular dementia or Parkinson 's disease leads to substantial excess costs of care . The study , conducted by Analysis Group , Inc. and Eli Lilly and Co. , found the costs of erroneous care to be in excess of $ 14,000 a year per patient .
