The duke will start training in September , a year after leaving the Royal Air Force , where he flew search and rescue helicopters . He will have his first air ambulance shift in spring 2015 .

It 's the first time a royal who 's in direct line to the throne has taken a civilian job . The East Anglian Air Ambulance is operated by a private company , Bond Air Services , but the Duke will donate his salary to charity .

A palace spokesman said Prince William was `` hugely excited and motivated '' by his new job .

The high-profile royal would have had to weigh up the risks of taking on a civilian , as opposed to military , role . Public interest could affect not only his work , but potentially also that of medics and patients on board his aircraft . There is the heightened possibility of phone footage emerging of his rescues which could compromise privacy and security . There 's also the risk of additional hoax calls .

These were not a major issues whilst Prince William was a military search and rescue pilot because he was working in a remote part of west Wales and over water . The two air ambulances in East Anglia are the most widely used in the UK and operate in a built-up area . Their usual landing spots include school playing fields ; residential gardens ; car parks ; beaches and any open space deemed possible by the pilot .

William is currently on what officials have described as a `` transitional year , '' focusing on his royal duties and charitable work . He always planned to return to work and was keen that it would involve flying .

Andrew Egerton Smith , chairman of the East Anglian Air Ambulance said : `` Having the Duke of Cambridge as one of our pilots is marvelous news as he brings much experience to the charity after his successful career as a search and rescue pilot . We have an outstanding track record of attending people in their hour of need which is recognized and generously supported by our local communities . ''

William will spend the autumn and winter in training with the East Anglian Air Ambulance and , once qualified , will start co-piloting in the spring of next year . He will work from Cambridge and Norwich Airports doing both day and night shifts . The Duke is then expected to progress to the position of helicopter commander .

The Cambridges ' country house , Anmer Hall , is being renovated and is set in idyllic rural surroundings which affords the family more privacy than their official residence at Kensington Palace , London , which is constantly monitored by photographers .
