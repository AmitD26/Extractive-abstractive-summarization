The point-blank shooting of two New York City police officers this weekend is testing whether Mayor Bill de Blasio 's brand of unapologetic liberalism can work in a city that 's spent decades under mayors who made law and order a top priority .

But critics -- including those in the police force -- are accusing him of fomenting an anti-police fervor that contributed to the killings of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos .

On Monday , de Blasio tried to reduce tension in the city .

He said the murders this weekend were `` an attack on all of us '' during luncheon remarks at the Police Athletic League shortly before his afternoon press conference . And the mayor also called for a hiatus from the protests that have gripped the city and the nation , saying the should focus instead on Liu and Ramos ' families .

`` It 's time for everyone to put aside political debates , put aside protests , put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time , '' he said . `` Let 's accompany these families on their difficult journey . Let 's see them through the funerals ... then the debate can begin again . ''

`` What are you guys gon na do -- are you going to keep dividing us ? '' a visibly angry de Blasio asked reporters , asserting that the media had unfairly focused on a few examples of violence that did not reflect the majority of protesters .

`` You all are part of this , too , '' he added .

But a startling divide between how white Americans and minorities view the criminal justice system , revealed by a new CNN/ORC poll , underscores the challenge facing both de Blasio and Obama as they struggle to find a solution to broken relationship between the police and the communities they serve .

Just a quarter of non-white Americans feel the same .

And while 50 percent of white Americans say the criminal justice system treats blacks fairly , only 21 percent of non-white Americans agree .

While de Blasio tried to downplay the politics of the situation during a press conference this weekend , Giuliani and others -- largely Republicans -- have argued his policies are directly to blame .

`` It is the right time to talk about -LSB- de Blasio 's -RSB- policies . His policies of allowing protests to get out of control , and of his not emphasizing enough the importance of fatherhood , the importance of education , the importance of an alternative to a public education system that is failing the black children , '' Giuliani , a Republican , said on Fox News this weekend .

Giuliani also placed the blame on `` propaganda '' from the President .

Others took aim at Holder .

Then , much of the criticism from police was the same : `` He never supports us on anything , '' an officer quoted by the New York Times said at the time .

New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said Monday , however , that his first 10 years in the police force , in 1970 , `` were around this type of tension . ''

Bratton cautioned against politicizing the tragedy , but agreed that the shooting of the two officers this weekend `` was a direct spinoff '' of the recent protests , and that de Blasio has work to do in rebuilding support within the police community .

`` I think he has lost -LSB- the trust of -RSB- some officers , '' Bratton said .
