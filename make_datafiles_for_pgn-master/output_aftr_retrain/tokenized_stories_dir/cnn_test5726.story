Here 's what you need to know about Sean Collier , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus cop who was shot to death by the suspected Boston Marathon bombers .

When his car got hit by a swerving vehicle , Collier immediately went to check if the other driver was injured .

`` He had a really great smile . I 'll always remember that , '' Kristina Lozoya , a student volunteer with the MIT emergency medical service , told CNN . `` He was always laughing . He loved his job . ''

She never got an answer .

Such a connection reflected the 27-year-old Massachusetts native 's approach to police work .

While his brother , Andrew , became a machinist in the engine department at Hendrick Motorsports , one of the major NASCAR racing teams , Sean followed a different path .

`` Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling , '' MIT Police Chief John DiFava said in a statement posted on the university website . `` He was born to be a police officer . ''

`` We are heartbroken by the loss of our wonderful and caring son and brother , '' the statement said . `` Our only solace is that Sean died bravely doing what he committed his life to -- serving and protecting others . ''

President Barack Obama praised Collier on Friday night following the conclusion of a daylong manhunt for the second of two marathon bombing suspects , saying he was a dedicated officer .

Collier 's killing and a subsequent carjacking nearby set off the search that paralyzed Boston .

The suspects were identified as brothers . One died following a shootout with police while the second was taken into custody , officials said .

After the blasts Monday near the finish line of the iconic road race , Collier 's slaying further traumatized many in the MIT community who had gotten to know him during his 15 months on the job .

That included the MIT Outing Club , which organizes hiking and skiing excursions in the region . Collier , who was single , was an avid participant in trips to the mountains of New England that he hiked as a boy .

Club members described him as endlessly energetic and a joyous companion on the trail and around the campfire .

Fellow club member Andrew Ding told of the car crash during a drive to New Hampshire , describing how Collier showed no hint of anger or exasperation over the damage to his vehicle .

`` Sean was the first out of our car to go check and see if the -LRB- other driver -RRB- was OK , '' Ding wrote in an email to CNN , adding that `` it would be exceedingly difficult to imagine him not stepping up and doing the right thing when he had the chance , which unfortunately he did last night . ''

Such awareness and devotion were evident in college , said Kristen Kuehnle , who chairs the department of criminal justice at Salem State University , where Collier graduated with honors in 2009 as a criminal justice major .

`` When you 're graduating with honors , you 've demonstrated ability to be thoughtful and look at all perspectives , '' she said .

Describing Collier as a model candidate for police work , she said he had `` the vision that we are looking for in our students . ''

That 's the impression he left on those who knew him at MIT .

To Ding , Collier was `` the kind of guy you 'd ask to watch your wallet . ''

Ben Artin , another EMS volunteer , told how Collier proposed arranging a social event to help broaden the relationship between the campus police and the emergency service workers .
