A 17-year-old Texas student who spent 52 days in a medically induced coma after police used a Taser on him at school entered a full-time rehabilitation facility Friday , his family 's attorney said .

The parents have filed a lawsuit alleging their son never posed a threat to the deputy and that Nino de Rivera suffered a permanent brain injury when he hit the ground after McMillan tased the teen .

The family is also asking the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement to outlaw the devices , along with pepper spray , on state campuses .

Several civil liberties groups , including the American Civil Liberties Union , sent a letter to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement last month calling the use of such weapons on children `` unconscionable . ''

A jumpy surveillance video provided by Loewy shows Nino de Rivera amid a commotion in the hallway of Cedar Creek High School , about 20 miles southeast of Austin . The teen appears to be stepping backward , away from the officer , when he is hit with the stun gun and falls to the floor .

`` As a result of being tased , NDR fell to the ground , striking his head on the floor . While NDR was unconscious , defendant McMillan placed him in handcuffs , '' the family 's lawsuit says .

School officials did not immediately call paramedics , the lawsuit says . When they did , Nino de Rivera was taken to a local hospital and later airlifted to St. David 's Medical Center in nearby Austin , where he `` underwent surgery to repair a severe brain hemorrhage and was placed in a medically induced coma , '' court documents say .

The lawsuit claims McMillan used excessive force and that Nino de Rivera `` posed no imminent threat of death or serious injury to McMIllan . '' It asks for compensatory damages and attorney 's fees and expert 's fees , among other relief .

`` The actions of Deputy McMillan were the actions of a reasonable officer , '' the court documents say .

Kevin Lawrence , executive director of the Texas Municipal Police Association , defended McMillan 's use of a Taser in an interview with CNN affiliate KXAN , saying Nino de Rivera appeared coherent after the incident and apologized to the officers .

Loewy called Lawrence 's account `` 100 % false '' and `` complete nonsense . '' The lawyer further noted that doctors at St. David 's Emergency Center-Bastrop quickly sedated the teen before having him airlifted to the Austin hospital .

`` He never struck the police officer . He never disobeyed instructions , '' Loewy added .

`` There are other methods of de-escalating fights that would n't pose the same risk , '' she said .
