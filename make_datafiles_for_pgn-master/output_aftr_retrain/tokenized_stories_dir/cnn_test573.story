Ikenna Nzeribe was the sole survivor after assassins from Boko Haram stormed his Nigerian church in 2012 , just 60 miles from where the jihadists last month abducted more than 200 girls .

The Muslim extremists fired shots into the air and shouted `` Allah Hu Akbar , '' or God is great .

Nzeribe and 13 other Christians hit the floor .

Now it was Nzeribe 's turn .

`` As soon as I saw the man , I knew it was over for me , '' Nzeribe , 33 , said about the gunman . `` The only thing I could do was say a last prayer , which was ` Blood of Jesus cover me . '

`` And that was it for me , '' he told CNN .

Nzeribe , a handsome banker , was shot in the face with an AK-47 assault rifle , blowing away his jaw , lips and part of his tongue .

He faked death -- `` until they finished , '' he said .

He bled profusely .

He was later flown to London , where surgeons reconstructed his face .

What he saw was `` a very different person , '' Nzeribe said , shaking his head . He stopped the interview , wiping away the tears and finding composure after long breaths .

A zigzagging scar runs up Nzeribe 's chin to his upper lip . His mouth is even more disfigured , but at least he can talk , in soft tones . And he has a great laugh , though he ca n't smile .

A devout Christian whose tale has been publicized in the religious press , he said has forgiven the gunmen of Boko Haram , whose mass abduction of Nigerian schoolgirls has outraged the international community .

`` The first thing I did was to forgive them , '' Nzeribe said . `` Had they known better , they could n't do that . ''

`` Just like al Qaeda , they are very , very destructive , '' he added .

He now prays for the kidnapped 276 girls , still missing in Nigeria .
