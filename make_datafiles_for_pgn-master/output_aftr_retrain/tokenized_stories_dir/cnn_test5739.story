Yes , says Diego Neria Lejarraga , a transgender man who says he had a private audience with the Pope in late January , reportedly a first for the pontiff . Neria was born as a girl in Spain and raised as a devout Catholic .

But after his sex change operation eight years ago , many people scorned him in church in his hometown of Plasencia in western Spain . Neria recalls heated discussions with a parish priest and some others in town . Afterward , he started staying away from Mass. .

`` I 've never lost faith , ever , '' Neria says . `` But the other thing is the rejection . ''

Vatican spokesmen and the local Spanish bishop 's office declined to comment on the meeting , insisting the Pope 's private meetings are just that .

`` This man loves the whole world , '' Neria says of Pope Francis . `` I think there 's not -- in his head , in his way of thinking , discrimination against anyone . I 'm speaking about him , not the institution . ''

Catholic doctrine holds that sex change procedures do not change a person 's gender in the eyes of the church .

And he 's already seen changes at home . The downside : Neria says he 's unaccustomed to the sudden media interest in him since the story broke in the local paper , Hoy , of Extremadura . He says he 's gotten queries from journalists as far afield as India and Colombia . But he also sees a positive side .
