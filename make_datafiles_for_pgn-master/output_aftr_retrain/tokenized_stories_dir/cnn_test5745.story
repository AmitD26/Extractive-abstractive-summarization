A federal judge struck down Oregon 's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Monday .

`` Because Oregon 's marriage laws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without a rational relationship to any legitimate government interest , the laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , '' U.S. District Judge Michael McShane said in his ruling .

In February , the state 's attorney general said she would not defend the ban in court because it would not stand up to a federal constitutional challenge .

`` My decision will not be the final word on this subject , but on this issue of marriage I am struck more by our similarities than our differences . I believe that if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality , we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families , families who we would expect our Constitution to protect , if not exalt , in equal measure , '' McShane said . `` With discernment we see not shadows lurking in closets or the stereotypes of what was once believed ; rather , we see families committed to the common purpose of love , devotion , and service to the greater community . ''

Same-sex couples camped out in lawn chairs outside a government building in Oregon 's largest county while waiting for the news , then cheered as word of the judge 's decision spread .

Multnomah County began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples minutes later , the county said in a statement .

Ben West , one of the plaintiffs who challenged Oregon 's constitutional ban , stood beside his fiance and his son as he told CNN affiliate KGW that he was thrilled by the news .

`` We 're excited . It 's surreal . We 're part of history . Our family is recognized , I mean , I 'm tingling . It 's amazing , '' he said .

`` It means that my son 's family is just as legitimate as the one next door , and that he can grow up proud . ''

At a news conference shortly after the judge 's ruling , activists and attorneys who challenged the amendment celebrated the news .

Ten years ago , Rouse said , the first same-sex marriages in the United States were celebrated in Massachusetts . And 45 years ago marked another historic moment , he said .

Same-sex marriage now allowed in 18 states

Seventeen other states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage within their borders : California , Connecticut , Delaware , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Maryland , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Hampshire , New Jersey , New Mexico , New York , Rhode Island , Vermont , and Washington . Just over a decade ago , there were none .

But court battles over the matter are far from over .

Separate federal appeals courts in recent weeks heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah , Oklahoma and Virginia . Similar appeals will be heard on current bans in Nevada , Texas , Kentucky , Ohio and Michigan .

Federal judge orders Utah to recognize same-sex marriages

Also Monday , a federal judge said Utah must recognize the marriages of more than 1,200 same-sex couples who obtained marriage licenses earlier this year after a court struck down that state 's same-sex marriage ban .

The judge 's ruling Monday says Utah must give those couples `` all the protections , benefits , and responsibilities given to all marriages under Utah law . ''

While some details of the Oregon and Utah cases are similar , there 's a key difference . In Utah , the state is appealing a judge 's decision to overturn its voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage . Gov. Gary Herbert slammed what he said was a decision by an `` activist federal judge . ''

`` Now , finally , all Oregonians will have the opportunity to make a legal commitment to the person they love . Every person and every family in Oregon deserves that chance , '' Gov. John Kitzhaber said in a statement . `` Today is a win for love , for families , and for freedom . ''
