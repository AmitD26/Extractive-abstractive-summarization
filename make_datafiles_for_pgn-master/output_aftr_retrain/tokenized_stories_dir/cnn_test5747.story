`` If there 's a Republican candidate out there -- let 's just say there 's a hypothetical one that 's for Common Core . I 'm saying that that hypothetical candidate that 's for Common Core probably does n't have much chance of winning in a Republican primary , '' the Kentucky Republican told Breitbart.com .

His comments , published Monday , come from an interview last week while Paul was in North Carolina campaigning for Senate hopeful Thom Tillis and Rep. Walter Jones .

Paul did n't mention Bush or any other potential 2016 candidate by name , but the former Florida governor has been a vocal backer of Common Core , a set of national education standards for English and math .

`` The danger of having one central governmental authority deciding curriculum is , what if we get some people who decide we really need to treat Karl Marx fairly , we need to make sure he gets a good writeup in the history , and Adam Smith , oh gosh , he was terrible , '' Paul said . `` You can see how once it 's nationalized , one person can insert a bias into the curriculum , and it goes everywhere , and then you have to fight it . ''

Bush , who was campaigning for Tillis in North Carolina the week before Paul was there , reiterated his support for Common Core , according to The New York Times . Tillis did not express the same support and attacked the Department of Education .

Bush says the standards help prepare students for college and the workforce . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also offered support for Common Core , though he created a panel to review and improve the program 's implementation in the Garden State .

Paul has previously weighed in on his disdain for the program , saying in August that he believes education standards `` should be developed locally '' and reiterating his wish to eliminate the Department of Education .

`` I also think we make a mistake as Republicans blaming teachers for everything , you know , because frankly some of the fault ... we need to look in the mirror ; it 's parents ' fault as well , '' he continued .
