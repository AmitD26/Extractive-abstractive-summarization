Summer could not have come soon enough for Lloret de Mar , a tourist resort north of Barcelona that is brimming with young travelers from Britain , Germany , France and Russia .

By day , they flock to the main beach with its steep descent into the Mediterranean , and by night they crowd the streets lined with clubs called Londoner , Hot Spot or Zoo .

It is a scene repeated up and down Spain 's extensive coastline along the Mediterranean , the Atlantic and its famous archipelagos , the Balearic and Canary Islands .

Spain 's economic crisis is in its sixth straight year yet tourism , worth 11 % of GDP , is holding its own , one of the few bright spots on a bleak horizon .

Summer , of course , is high season for tourism in Spain . The country is the world 's fourth-largest tourist destination , behind France , the U.S. , and China , according to the UN 's World Tourism Organization , based in Madrid .

Spain 's tourism sector has recovered from a 9 % drop -- a loss of five million tourists -- at the height of the crisis in 2009 . Last year , it was back to pre-crisis levels of 57.7 million international visitors .

Like Katerina Kharina and her friend , both choreographers from western Russia , whom we met on the beach .

`` Here it 's very different , '' Kharina said . `` There 's no crisis in Russia . Here it 's cheap . Russians like Spain . ''

And Spaniards like Lidia Gonzalez may thank the Russians for her new career as a maid at one of Guitart 's hotels .

A mother of two , the crisis forced Gonzalez out of her own hair salon business .

`` At last this job came up and there was relief for the whole family , to be able to pay some of our bills , '' said Gonzalez , taking a break from cleaning a room .

She and many others have contracts just for the summer high season , and many worry what comes next .

Some experts worry , too , about the tourism industry 's future . They say that Spain 's tourism formula has been the same for decades -- sun and sand . But with the economic crisis , there are growing calls for that to change .

Guitart 's company is already pushing innovation , trying to go upscale with a five-star hotel and casino in Lloret de Mar , while also maintaining some of its more typical mass tourism hotels .

Breaking away from the popular tourism hotel model may be the future for Spain 's industry , but it wo n't be easy . Lloret de Mar , like many others in Spain , still caters to mass tourism .

Just ask the young foreigners on the beach by day and in the clubs by night .
