Amman , Jordan -LRB- CNN -RRB- Was an American hostage held in Syria killed by a Jordanian airstrike ? That 's what ISIS said in an online posting Friday , claiming that she died in the group 's de facto capital , Raqqa .

The posting Friday included a picture of a collapsed building and a claim that the woman -- confirmed by her family to be Kayla Mueller -- was being held there .

Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said his country is looking into the claim . But , he said , `` we are highly skeptical '' because of ISIS 's proven lack of credibility , and he questioned whether they could identify Jordanian warplanes so high in the sky or would hold a hostage in a `` weapon warehouse . ''

`` What we know about this terrorist organization is that they are liars when it comes to these things , '' al-Momani told `` The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer . ''

`` They tried to cause problems internally in Jordan and have n't succeeded , '' Majali said . `` They are now trying to drive a wedge between the coalition with this latest low PR stunt . ''

CNN has not previously named Mueller because of a request from the family .

`` After going to extraordinary efforts to keep Kayla 's name out of the media for so long , by securing the cooperation of journalists throughout the world , her name was released today . This news leaves us concerned , yet , we are still hopeful that Kayla is alive . We have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately . ''

Asked about ISIS 's claim of the woman 's death in Raqqa , State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that she could not `` confirm those reports in any way . ''

`` Obviously -LRB- we are -RRB- deeply concerned ... , '' she added . `` We have not , at this point , seen anything that corroborates -LRB- ISIS 's -RRB- claims . ''

When it comes to ISIS , there 's plenty of reason for skepticism .

After the video came out , Jordanian officials said they have reason to believe al-Kasasbeh was actually killed in early January . That suggested that during the month between , while signaling its openness to a prisoner exchange with Jordan , ISIS had known all along that the pilot was dead .

CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank is among those very dubious that ISIS is telling the truth this time around , including its claim that the U.S. hostage was alone in the building and that no militants died in the strike .

`` It seems very , very convenient for propaganda purposes , from the ISIS point of view , '' Cruickshank said .

Though there is no evidence Mueller was killed , U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are working on a theory that she may have died weeks or months ago , sources said .

Intelligence and law enforcement sources said the theory comes from prior intelligence on her captivity and ISIS ' past behavior with hostages .

The claim of the Jordanian airstrike killing her likely is a convenient way for ISIS to explain why it killed a woman , which could be problematic for its message , the sources said .

This all comes in the wake of al-Kasasbeh 's horrific killing , which spurred outrage in Jordan and beyond .

His father , Safi al-Kasasbeh , afterward called on Jordan and its allies to `` annihilate '' ISIS . Government officials appear , at least in their rhetoric , determined to do just that .

'' -LRB- Jordan will extract -RRB- revenge that equals the tragedy that has befallen the Jordanians , '' government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said .

On Thursday -- a day after executing two jihadists in retaliation -- the Middle Eastern nation launched its first strikes since the news emerged about al-Kasasbeh .

A squadron of warplanes from the Royal Jordanian Air Force on Friday carried out a number of strikes against ISIS targets , the military said in statement . The Jordanian armed forces did not immediately provide details on the number of aircraft nor what targets were hit . Activists told CNN that one strike killed 47 ISIS fighters .

Until now , ISIS has n't shown any inclination to back down . Just the opposite , in fact : The terror group has been relentless and brutal in its quest to establish a vast caliphate under its strict , twisted version of Sharia law .

The organization 's savagery seemingly knows no bounds , not only in its use of captives ' killings as grisly propaganda tools but in its campaign of mass killings , rapes , kidnappings and other atrocities while taking over swaths of Iraq and Syria .

Al-Kasasbeh 's killing was an attempt by ISIS `` to instill terror and fear in the hearts of its enemies , '' making them less willing to provoke or put up a fight , says a prominent Sunni Muslim cleric who has been exiled from Syria .

`` What 's happening is the opposite , '' Shaykh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour this week . `` The martyrdom of Moath has united Muslims ... against ISIS , leaving no slight room of doubt that these people do not represent Islam . They represent savagery , terrorism and extremism . ''

Thousands filled the King Hussein Mosque there , listening to a sermon decrying ISIS as antithetical to Islam and insisting that Muslims can not stand idly by .

After prayers , crowds spilled out onto the streets to march calmly and defiantly toward Palm Square . Many held up banners and signs -- including Queen Rania , with a poster that read , `` Moath , the martyr of justice '' -- and chanted , `` Long live the King . ''

Jordan for months has been one of a handful of nations in the region taking part in the U.S.-led coalition , a fight it continued with airstrikes Thursday and Friday at different sites around Iraq and Syria .
