-LRB- CNN -RRB- Police in a patrol car chase down a man on a scooter . The car stops , and two officers get out and beat the man with their fists and batons . His orbital bone fractures and he suffers lacerations on his head , yet he is the one who is charged with aggravated assault .

What happened next was captured on the surveillance video and contradicts the original police report claim that Rivera grabbed Robinson and `` slammed him against a brick wall . '' It also accuses Rivera of `` throwing elbows during the struggle . ''

The grand jury found , however , that Rivera was wailing loudly and showed no aggressive actions as he was lying on the ground and being struck repeatedly by the officers .

`` The video undermined every aspect of the officer 's account , '' said Williams .

Rivera , 23 , was cleared of all charges and has been awarded a $ 200,000 settlement for pain and suffering .

Rivera is very satisfied with the charges against the officers , according to his lawyer , Leon Flynn , who spoke to CNN affiliate WPVI . `` How can I get beat up , but there were no consequences for the people who did this to me ? '' was a question Rivera asked repeatedly , Flynn said .

Robinson 's attorney , Fortunato N. Perri Jr. , said in a statement that his client `` has been a well-respected and dedicated member of the Philadelphia police department for the past seven years . He looks forward to clearing his name . ''

The officers are not getting any sympathy from the police department , however .

`` It is painful , it is embarrassing , '' Chief Charles Ramsey told reporters this week . `` We have 6,500 sworn members . These guys do not represent the majority of police officers . ''
