When I rode the No. 7 train to Citi Field last Sunday , I was one of the few women in a train car packed with Hasidic Jews . My knees were in full view , but I shielded my face behind a pair of shades and a copy of Christopher Hitchens ' atheist bible , `` God Is Not Great , '' held conspicuously aloft . Toward the end of our shared journey , when it had become clear that the only people left on the train were headed to the same event , I looked up from my book , removed the sunglasses and asked the men sitting across from me if they were there to protest the Internet or the abuse .

Taken aback , they looked at me for a moment before answering `` both . '' They did not recognize me as Deborah Feldman , the author of the controversial memoir about the life I fled as a Hasidic woman .

Some 60,000 ultra-Orthodox men had gathered to discuss the dangers that prurient elements of the Internet present to their community . They were probably unaware of the planned counterdemonstration , which was being organized by a good friend of mine named Ari Mandel . He 's a fellow ex-Hasidic Jew , who , like me , felt compelled to protest the rampant injustice and abuse covered up within the Hasidic and ultra-Orthodox worlds , some of which we had seen or experienced firsthand .

After exiting the train and lingering in the parking lot for a moment , persona non grata because of my female status , I was approached by an erudite-looking Jew , who asked what I was doing there . He claimed that I could n't possibly understand what the rally was about , that the event was for men only . Reporters inched closer , extending mikes and cameras . People seemed to think something juicy was going to happen . I opened my mouth to talk , and suddenly I felt a surge of adrenaline , the kind that makes your knees all shaky , fuel my words . It was my first time standing face to face with a man who represented my former oppressor .

What I said boiled down to this : I am horrified that religious Jews would spend millions of dollars on a rally to protest an unstoppable force such as the Internet instead of focusing their attention on the real problems their community is facing , such as the sexual abuse scandals that are now public knowledge . The Internet can never be stopped , but parents and kids can be educated as to how to use it , just like in the real world . Instead , I argued , the ultra-Orthodox were just trying to bury their heads in the sand and ignore the real problems by waving a giant distraction in front of it .

I spoke with emotion because five minutes later I would join a group of people across the street , some of whom were formerly Hasidic or Orthodox , and others who were still part of the community , but had summoned the courage to speak for the voiceless , all of whom had suffered or witnessed some form of abuse at the hands of the religious leadership . We held signs that said , `` The Internet Is Not the Problem , '' or `` The Internet Did n't Molest Me , '' because we felt outraged that real problems were being ignored while the community spent millions on a gathering designed to deal with the `` evil '' of the Internet .

Words can not adequately describe the depth of my disappointment regarding this woman 's attempt at public relations . She said she felt compelled to write this in the wake of negative media attention , but she could have opted for a thoughtful essay on how she had come to choose her spiritual path and why it made her feel so fulfilled . She could have shared her personal journey without diminishing the pain and suffering of women who had n't been consulted before she put pen to paper .
