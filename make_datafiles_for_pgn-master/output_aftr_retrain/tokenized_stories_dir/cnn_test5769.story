Kelly 's process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband , Doug Gissendaner .

A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult , yet compassionate , conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection .

This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years . Her commitment to Kelly , along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns , provided steady , ongoing love that fostered change . So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation . She was , in the words of the Apostle Paul , a `` new creation '' -LRB- 2 Cor . 5:17 -RRB- .

In the theology program , Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church `` on the outside , '' as well as in prison . By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers , Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic .

She asked honest questions about her relationship to God , others and the world . She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions . She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work . `` From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger , '' she said in her 2011 graduation speech . `` I became so hungry for theology , and what all the classes had to offer ; you could call me a glutton . ''

`` Since I could n't go to the theology class ... the instructors came to me . Still , this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate . It was hard ... but I pushed on . I pushed on because of that hunger . That gate ... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me . But that gate could n't keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for , nor friendship and community . And it sure could n't keep out God . ''

This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday . We continued to read theological texts together , including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams .

Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories , `` the ruins of the past , '' and building from them here and now . Restoration , Williams writes , `` is going back to the memories of the painful , humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present ... to Christ -LSB- who -RSB- comes to repair the devastation . ''

I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories , took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done .

The fruits of Kelly 's redemption are now well-documented : reconciliation with her children , ministry to inmates full of despair , counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others . On the night Kelly thought would be her last , she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates , urging them not to worry about her , but to be encouraged .

Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian JÃ¼rgen Moltmann , who is widely known as the `` theologian of hope '' and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010 . Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave . Rather , hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now -- God 's intended social order `` on earth as it is in heaven '' -LRB- Matt . 6:10 -RRB- .

Biblical hope `` revolutionizes and transforms the present . '' It is the hope of the psalmist who `` looks for the goodness of God in this life '' -LRB- Ps . 27:13 -RRB- . In the words of Kelly 's favorite scripture , it is a hope that proclaims : `` I shall not die but live , and declare the works of the Lord '' -LRB- Ps 118:17 -RRB- .

In Kelly 's own words :

Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly 's journey of hope . While I struggle to find adequate words , what I do know is that Kelly 's story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits .

It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance , forgiveness , redemption and hope . Indeed , even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make .

Today , Kelly 's life hangs in the balance . The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution , citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her . The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete .
