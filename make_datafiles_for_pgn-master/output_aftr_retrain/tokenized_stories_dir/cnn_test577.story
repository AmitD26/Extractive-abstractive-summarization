Israel

As Israelis were taking cover from Hamas rockets and the Gaza-based Islamist group announced it was also targeting planes flying in and out of Israel 's main airport , a television anchor in Lebanon offered a most unhelpful suggestion . Iran , she said , should give nuclear weapons to Hamas to fight Israel . Meanwhile , Iran 's Supreme Leader reiterated his wish to see Israel wiped away .

These messages remind Israelis of the seriousness of their situation . Hamas has no interest in a two-state solution . It is committed to obliterating Israel . Israelis do have disagreements regarding settlements and withdrawal from the West Bank . But when it comes to Hamas , there is no question . The Hamas charter reads : `` Our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious . ''

As the writer David Grossman put it , leftist Israelis now see that `` the right wing 's fears are not mere paranoia , '' and the right will see that there are limits to the use of force .

The imperative to find a new way forward with moderate Palestinians will re-emerge after frayed nerves cool . But an old obstacle has grown : Israelis ' greatest fear is a Palestinian state falling to extremists , as Gaza did to Hamas , receiving weapons from Iran and others . There is no way Israelis will now accept an armed Palestinian state within tunneling distance of its major cities , especially if Hamas remains a dangerous player .

Palestine

With Hamas fighters hidden in tunnels , drawing Israeli fire to civilian areas , no matter how much you hate your enemy , is a tactic that warrants examination if not outright condemnation .

In a stark shift from previous conflicts , criticism of Hamas was widespread in Arab media . Egyptian journalists , in particular , fulminated against Hamas .

Europe

Europe saw some of the ugliest eruptions of blatant anti-Semitism since the 1940s . Critics of Israel often claim that Israel unfairly hides from critics by charging anti-Semitism , but cries of `` death to the Jews , '' `` slit the Jews throats , '' or `` Jews to the gas chambers '' along with the smashing and torching of Jewish-owned shops and attacks on synagogues , have pulled back the cover , revealing anti-Jewish sentiment that still runs deep , and in most cases remains unspoken in polite circles . We will find out how seriously European leaders address the matter now that we have found what lay hidden behind the curtain of civil discourse .

Middle East

Advocating for Islamists in Gaza is particularly beneficial to their political objectives , because the Palestinian cause draws popular support . That 's why Egypt 's decision to stand back is so remarkable . Egypt under its new government has taken a firm stance against Hamas and increasingly clashes with its supporters , particularly with Turkey . These political alliances complicate matters for the Washington .
