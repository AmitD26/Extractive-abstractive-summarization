-LRB- CNN -RRB- An Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown was shot and killed by an unknown assailant , according to Dallas police .

Dallas police spokesman Jeff Cotner said Al-Jumaili , who recently immigrated to the U.S. , had never seen snow and `` just like all of us , a pretty snowfall brings the child out in us . ''

There is `` extreme heartache ... and no shortage of sadness for this beautiful young man who had just come to this country 20 days ago , '' said Alia Salem , executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area .

Salem said the Muslim community wanted to know whether the shooting death was random or whether Al-Jumaili was targeted . Police say they have no indication so far that it was a hate crime .

From the vantage point of the camera , it is difficult to make out any of the features of the suspects or even the gender , although police have said they are looking for four black males .

Cotner said Friday that other than that , police have little to go on . `` We ca n't solve this crime alone , '' he said . Authorities are appealing to the public to contact them with any information that might help the investigation .

North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a $ 5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and an indictment , police said .

Salem is encouraging anyone with information about the shooting to share it .

She said there are online campaigns underway to help raise funds for the family 's expenses , as well as an effort to raise additional funds to contribute to the reward .
