For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco , here 's the whole story in one telling statistic : While for-profit colleges enroll only 13 % of the nation 's college students , such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults , according to Department of Education statistics .

For comparison 's sake , the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis .

How do these colleges operate ? It 's deviously simple : Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans , keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors , and watch the money roll in .

I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics . My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently , and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number .

But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis . Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a `` debt strike , '' publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans .

In response , Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects .

The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed . Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim , and their debts should be forgiven .

Yes , `` victim '' is the right word . If these degrees actually helped people get jobs , we should be celebrating them . But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department , the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout .

In one example , an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor , `` It 's not hard to get a 100 % on the second try ; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again , '' according to The New York Times .

In 2013 , Career Education Corp. paid $ 10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims . All told , no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014 .

After selling off 95 of its campuses last year , Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses , blaming the failure on `` federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions '' on potential buyers .

You ca n't hide your bad behavior forever , and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them . Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half , to about 213,000 .

We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis , and it 's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges . To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now .

For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam . Now it 's up to their rich benefactor , Uncle Sam , to make sure they do n't go back to school in the fall .

Editor 's Note : An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year ; that issue has been resolved .
