The Cameroon international was sent off for the challenge in his side 's 1-0 defeat in the Champions League match in Glasgow last Wednesday .

Scotland international Brown avoided injury , but claimed Binya had tried to break his leg with the tackle in the 85th minute -- and demanded that Europe 's governing body take further action .

Binya , 24 , apologized for the challenge -- described by officiating referee Martin Hansson of Sweden as one of the worst he had ever seen -- on the day after the match .

But UEFA 's control and disciplinary body announced their sanction on Friday morning , having deliberated on the case on Thursday .

Benfica can appeal against the ban , which rules Binya out of the Portuguese club 's remaining Group D matches against AC Milan and Shakhtar Donetsk .

The suspension will also carry over to future seasons if , as seems likely , Benfica finish bottom of Group D and bow out of Europe for this campaign .

Brown , who has been passed fit for Scotland 's Euro 2008 qualifier against Italy , said straight after the Benfica match : `` He obviously tried to do me as hard as possible . ''

It is the second time that UEFA has had to intervene following an incident involving Celtic this season .
