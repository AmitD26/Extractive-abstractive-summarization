Fire officials said more than 265,000 people have been evacuated and nearly 4,900 firefighters are battling the fast-moving blazes , which began over the weekend .

By Monday afternoon , the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention had reported 13 active wildfires have consumed more than 98,000 acres and destroyed or damaged at least 50 homes and businesses across six counties .

`` It 's a tragic time for California , '' California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said earlier Monday .

He declared a state of emergency in seven counties and asked the National Guard to pull 800 soldiers from patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border to help battle the wildfires .

Monday evening , Schwarzenegger asked U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to order delivery of all available Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems -LRB- MAFFS -RRB- to help fight the fires . Watch fires devour homes and land ''

Citing the proliferation in the number of fires , Schwarzenegger wrote , `` Your immediate assistance is necessary to deploy Department of Defense aircraft located in Wyoming , North Carolina and Colorado to assist California in our firefighting effort . ''

According to the White House , the federal Agriculture Department will provide fire crews , air tankers and helicopters to fight the fires , and the state will receive assistance grants to help pay firefighting costs . See where fires burn across Southern California ''

Hardest hit was San Diego County , where 250,000 people have fled from five fires . One person was killed and 18 were reported injured in the county , including five firefighters . Local officials said the fire situation had worsened throughout the day , prompting new evacuations .

`` We have a very dangerous , unpredictable situation , '' said Ron Roberts , chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors . `` We have some of the highest temperatures , some of the driest landscape conditions and some of the most powerful winds -- all the ingredients for a perfect firestorm . ''

Residents of four housing areas at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in northern San Diego County were put on notice for possible evacuations and told to pack personal belongings as a precautionary measure .

Earlier Monday , fixed-wing firefighting aircraft were grounded by the strong winds , officials said , making the jobs of fire crews on the ground even harder .

Two fires that erupted Monday morning in San Bernardino County near Lake Arrowhead have destroyed at least 123 structures and charred 1,800 acres , said Loretta Benavidez , a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino National Forest . Several communities in the area , including Green Valley Lake , Arrowbear and Running Springs , were evacuated .
