-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 3 Maria Sharapova has blasted the ruling body of women 's tennis over its demands for top players ahead of this month 's Italian Open in Rome .

Maria Sharpova is furious after being threatened with a $ 300,000 fine by the WTA .

`` They want me to do this shoot on Sunday , Monday or Tuesday of the Rome tournament after flying 12 hours from Los Angeles .

`` I have set my own personal rules when it comes to doing shoots and I never do shoots before tournaments because they are mentally draining and I want to just focus on my tennis .

`` Now the WTA is telling me if I do n't do this shoot they will fine me over $ 300,000 . As you can see the WTA Tour loves to fine players .

`` To be honest , I would love to do this and help promote the tour as much as possible , but to force me to do this shoot the day before a Tier 1 tournament is just not right . ''

`` The WTA Tour makes many players enter tournaments that they know the players will not be playing , '' she told her Web site . `` I informed the WTA several months ago that if I played Charleston , I would have to pull out of Berlin .

`` Now they are forcing me to give an injury for the reason why I am pulling out or they will give me an additional fine on top of the $ 125,000 fine already given me . I am a very giving person but I refuse to give any more of my money to the WTA Tour .

`` So I want everyone to know that apart from getting sick the past few days , I am healthy and I am looking forward to playing Rome . ''

Meanwhile , top seed Vera Zvonareva has reached the final of the Czech Open in Prague , beating Slovenian fourth seed Katarina Srebotnik 6-2 6-4 on Saturday .
