When Microsoft introduced a preview version of a fresh and inventive webmail service it called Outlook.com last August , it was pretty clear that it was telling the world that it intended to start winding down its venerable Hotmail sooner or later .

The company is announcing that Outlook.com is coming out of preview mode and is now officially available worldwide . And so it 's going to start moving more than 300 million Hotmail users over . They 'll be able to keep their Hotmail.com e-mail addresses -- or Live.com or MSN.com , if that 's what they 've got -- but the Hotmail service and brand will be going away .

At the moment , Microsoft says , Outlook.com has 60 million active members , a third of which are Gmail users . -LRB- Presumably some of those are true defectors from Gmail , while others use both Gmail and Outlook.com . -RRB- Once the Hotmail transition is complete , Outlook.com will have hundreds of millions of users , giving it the same sort of massive scale as Gmail -LRB- 425 million users as of June 2012 -RRB- and Yahoo Mail -LRB- 281 million users as of December 2012 -RRB- .

And Microsoft seems to be serious about winning over lots more users from Gmail and other services : It 's planning to advertise Outlook.com heavily in all sorts of media . The company has posted a couple of splashy TV spots -- both of which , unlike the current Scroogled campaign , are devoted to making people feel good about Outlook.com rather than bad about Gmail .

While I 'm favorably impressed by Outlook.com , I 'm not considering dumping Gmail myself anytime soon ; Google 's service remains a much richer platform , with additional useful features , mobile apps and support from third-party apps and services . Microsoft says to expect more Outlook.com features now that the service is out of preview mode , including Skype video calls and a calendar , both of which the company first promised when it announced the service last year .

I 'll be keeping an eye on it -- an Outlook.com which retained its sleek look and competed with Gmail in depth and breadth of capabilities could be spectacular .

I 'm still getting used to the notion of Microsoft , of all companies , being a plucky underdog -- but I 'm glad it 's giving Google at least two incentives to avoid resting on its laurels .
