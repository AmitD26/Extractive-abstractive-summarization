A statement from the ministry said Patterson was also told that the attacks have cost lives and undermined public support for Pakistan 's counter terrorism efforts .

Pakistan has repeatedly raised objections to foreign nations violating its sovereignty to pursue terrorists . A U.S. ground operation in September that left several civilians dead rankled relations between the two countries .

Last week , Pakistan 's parliament passed a resolution that condemned any incursion on Pakistani soil by foreign forces .

The ministry said it handed Patterson a copy of the resolution .

They have become frustrated with Islamabad over the years , saying it is not being proactive enough against militants -- a claim Pakistan denies .

The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from drones , which are controlled remotely .

In another development , suspected Taliban militants kidnapped three government officials from an administrative office in Pakistan 's tribal region Wednesday , officials said .

Mohmand is in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where U.S. and Pakistani officials have reported a presence of militants .

Also Wednesday , a suicide car bomber detonated explosives outside a police checkpoint in northwest Pakistan , killing two security personnel , officials said .

The Wednesday afternoon attack in the Bannu district of the North West Frontier Province also wounded a dozen people , military sources said .

The bomber targeted a check point near a military hospital , said the sources who did not want their names revealed because they are not authorized to speak to the media .
