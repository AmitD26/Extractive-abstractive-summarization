CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nine bodies have been found in a common grave in the desert south of Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , according to Chihuahua state prosecutor 's spokeswoman Daniela Gonzalez .

Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua , but the situation has been getting worse .

The discovery of the bodies comes as 5,000 Mexican soldiers are descending this weekend on Juarez in an effort to end the violence that has claimed more than 400 lives so far this year .

Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN he is hopeful Operacion Conjunto Chihuahua -LRB- Chihuahua Joint Operation -RRB- will be successful .

Enrique Torres , spokesman for the Chihuahua Joint Operation , said by Sunday there will be 7,500 military personnel , 2,300 federal police and 1,600 city police working together to patrol the city and aggressively fight the cartels .

`` We are launching a full frontal attack '' Torres said . `` We will also be tackling other types of organized crime -- money laundering and kidnappings . ''

Corruption among the police force has been a major concern to local and international authorities . Torres said the city has been preparing for a year to `` clean up the local police . '' Watch panel discuss escalating drug war ''

Ferriz , the mayor , said government officials are doing everything in their power to stop the violence ; they have brought in consultants from Colombia and adapted programs that have proven successful there , such as a civilian corruption watchdog program .

But he explained that a big part of the problem is coming from the north .

`` The majority of the weapons used for homicides here have been identified as coming from the United States '' he said .

Ferriz said that during a recent raid , local police confiscated two .50-caliber military-style rifles . Some weeks later they arrested another man bringing in another .50-caliber rifle .

Ferriz siad he plans to travel next week to Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers about the security situation in and around Juarez .
