Stephen Hawking in Pasadena , California , in March .

Cambridge University said the 67-year-old is `` comfortable '' and will stay overnight at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge .

Hawking , one of the world 's most famous physicists , is also a cosmologist , astronomer , and mathematician .

On his Web site , Hawking has written about living with ALS . `` I try to lead as normal a life as possible , and not think about my condition , or regret the things it prevents me from doing , which are not that many , '' he wrote .

He added : `` I have been lucky , that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case . But it shows that one need not lose hope . ''

Hawking was born in Oxford , England , on what turned out to be an auspicious date : January 8 , 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei .

A Cambridge University spokesman told CNN : `` Professor Hawking is very ill and has been taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital , Cambridge . ''

Professor Peter Haynes , head of the university 's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics , said : `` Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague , we all hope he will be amongst us again soon . ''

Hawking has guest-starred , as himself , on Star Trek : The Next Generation and The Simpsons . He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe , his choice would be Marilyn .

In October , CNN 's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking . The following are some quotes from that interview :
