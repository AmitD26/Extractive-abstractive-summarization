WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Terror attacks have spiked dramatically in Afghanistan and Pakistan as extremists in both countries strengthen their power and expand operations , according to a State Department report released Thursday .

The number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan , like this bombing in April , has more than quadrupled from 2006 to 2008 .

The report says al Qaeda and its extremist supporters have moved across the Afghan border `` to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier , where they have used this terrain as a safe haven to hide , train terrorists , communicate with the followers , plot attacks and send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan . ''

The rise in violence has complicated the Obama administration 's effort to implement its strategy of boosting military and civilian programs in both countries .

The report says the largest number of attacks occurred in Pakistani provinces near the Afghan border , including Balochistan , the North West Frontier and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , where extremists have sought to challenge the government and extend Islamic law .

It also notes the government 's inability to get a handle on the extremists . Despite having 80,000 to 100,000 troops in those provinces , it says , `` the government of Pakistan 's authority in the area continued to be challenged . ''

Ronald Schlicher , the State Department 's acting coordinator of counterterrorism , told reporters the Obama administration has `` real concerns '' that al Qaeda 's senior leadership may be operating from those areas and could be plotting attacks against the United States .

`` We have a real sense that it 's happening , but we have imperfect knowledge of what they 're doing , '' he said .

Pakistan has asked the United States to supply its forces with helicopters , communication equipment and night-vision technology as part of a U.S. plan to beef up the country 's counterterrorism efforts .

President Obama told reporters Wednesday night that he is `` gravely concerned about the situation in Pakistan . ''

Speaking at a news conference capping his 100th day in office , Obama said the United States has `` huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable '' and does n't end up a `` nuclear-armed militant state . ''

After making two visits to Pakistan in less than three weeks , Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , is `` very alarmed by the growing extremist threat in Pakistan and remains frustrated particularly by the political leaderships ' inability to confront that threat , '' according to his chief spokesman .

The State Department report notes the terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India , in November , attributing them to the Pakistan-based Kashmir terrorist group Laskhar-e-Tayyiba and to its fundraising subsidiary , amaat ud-Dawa . Although Pakistan has cracked down on some of the groups ' camps and made several arrests , the report warned of continuing tension between India and Pakistan .

`` The anti-government insurgency remained a capable , determined and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , '' the report warns . Although the Taliban continued to suffer heavy combat loses , the report says its ability to leverage support from al Qaeda and recruit soldiers `` remained undiminished . ''

`` Taliban information operations were increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , '' it says . `` Streams of Taliban financing from across the border in Pakistan , along with funds gained from narcotics trafficking , have allowed the insurgency to strengthen its military and technical capabilities . ''

`` Since at least 2006 , Iran has arranged arms shipments including small arms and associated ammunition , rocket-propelled grenades , mortar rounds , 107 mm rockets and plastic explosives to select Taliban members , '' it says .

While terrorists in Iraq still launched attacks last year , `` there was a notable reduction in the number of security incidents throughout much of the country , including a decrease in civilian casualties , enemy attacks , and improvised explosive device attacks in the last quarter of the year , '' the report says .

There were 3,258 terrorist incidents in 2008 , down almost half from the 6,210 attacks in 2007 , Travers said . He added there was a decrease during the first quarter of 2009 , although there has a been a spike in terrorist attacks in April .

The report calls the government 's response to the terrorist threat `` intermittent and its ability to pursue and prosecute suspected terrorists remained weak due to a number of shortcomings , including stalled draft counterterrorism legislation . ''

It was a month later that at least seven assailants dressed in Yemeni security-service uniforms attacked the U.S. Embassy with explosives and suicide vests , launching what the report calls a `` sophisticated and well-coordinated '' attack .

The report says Iran `` remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism , '' including supporting terrorist groups such as Hamas , Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , all of which opposed the Middle East peace process , as well as Iraq-based militants and the Taliban fighters in Afghanistan .

It cites the Qods Force , an elite branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , as the regime 's `` primary mechanism for cultivating and supporting terrorists abroad . ''
