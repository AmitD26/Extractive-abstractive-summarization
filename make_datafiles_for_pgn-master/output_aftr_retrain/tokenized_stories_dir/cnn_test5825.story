However , no link has been established between the drug -- a powerful sedative and anesthetic called propofol -- and the singer 's death .

The agency is not involved in the investigation into Jackson 's death , he said .

`` All of the cases had high fevers , some muscle aches , headaches , but no issues with heart problems that we were told of , '' he said .

Jackson died June 25 of cardiac arrest . The exact cause of death is pending toxicology results .

All of the people who had taken propofol recovered ; only one was hospitalized and that patient was quickly discharged , he said .

But , he added , `` at high doses , endotoxin can absolutely cause lowered blood pressure and much more serious reactions . ''

`` It can cause decreases in blood pressure , which could precipitate problems with your heart . ''

The manufacturer , Teva Pharmaceuticals , is working with the Food and Drug Administration to determine how the contamination occurred and is voluntarily recalling the affected lots , he said .

A spokeswoman for Teva said about 57,000 vials were included in the recall of the drug , and said the company had been contacted by the Drug Enforcement Administration .

She would not say whether the contact was related to the Jackson investigation .

ProPublica , an online news organization , first reported a possible link between Jackson 's death and the drug recall on Tuesday .

But an FDA spokeswoman denied there could have been a link .

`` This is fever , chills , '' said Karen Riley . `` Does that sound like heart failure ? ''

Authorities have said the cause of Jackson 's heart failure will not be determined officially until toxicology tests are complete .
