Ali Velshi : Tell me about the wind . Now , you are buying , for a start , more than 600 wind turbines from General Electric . You 're going to put them on this big tract of land in Texas , and you 're going to generate a lot of electricity .

We start receiving those turbines in mid 2010 . We will have the total 4,000 megawatts finished by the end of 2015 . That power will go into a transmission line that will tie into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system in the state of Texas , and it will be transmitted downstate . Watch why Pickens is willing to spend billions on wind ''

Velshi : What 's your view of wind power ? It 's one of several things that we should be looking at in terms of powering our homes , electrical power ? We get most of it from coal and natural gas , and some from nuclear . Are you thinking it 's one of the formats of power we should be thinking about , or is this going to be bigger than we all thought ?

Pickens : The Department of Energy came out with a study in April of '07 that said we could generate 20 percent of our electricity from wind . And the wind power is -- you know , it 's clean , it 's renewable . It 's -- you know , it 's everything you want . And it 's a stable supply of energy .

It will be located in -LSB- the -RSB- central part of the United States , which will be the best from a safety standpoint to be located . You have a wind corridor that goes from Pampa , Texas , to the Canadian border . And it has -- the wind , it 's unbelievable that we have not done more with wind . Look at Germany and Spain . They have developed their wind way beyond what we have , and they do n't have as much wind as we do . It 's not unlike the French have done with their nuclear . They 're 80 percent power generated off of nuclear , we 're 20 percent .

Velshi : I 'm fascinated by wind power . I love going by a field of these turbines . And I think they 're fascinating .

You do n't happen to think they 're attractive , and you 're not really putting them on your land . You 're going to be using other people 's land to put these things on .

Pickens : That 's right . And it 's very clear , these are my neighbors . And they want them . It generates income for them .

That can be repeated over and over and over again all the way to the Canadian border . Then you have a solar corridor that goes from Sweetwater , Texas , west to the West coast , and that solar corridor can also be developed .

But we are going to have to do something different in America . You ca n't keep paying out $ 600 billion a year for oil .
