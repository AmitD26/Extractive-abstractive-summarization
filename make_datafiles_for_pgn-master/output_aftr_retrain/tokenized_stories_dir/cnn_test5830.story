LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Blind women are being trained to use their sensitive touch to help detect breast cancer earlier and more precisely than doctors .

The blind assistants use tape strips with braille coordinates to accurately locate cancerous lumps

Using these strips blind women are trained to become Medical Tactile Examiners -LRB- MTUs -RRB- because they are more able to detect smaller lumps than sighted doctors .

Hoffman argues that because of their disability , the blind can possess a more acutely developed sense of touch , which has proved to be a valuable asset in breast examinations .

`` We are turning a disability into a gift , '' Dr. Hoffmann told CNN .

A study at the Essen University 's women 's clinic , Germany , concluded that MTUs found more and smaller tumors than doctors in 450 cases .

Another advantage of having MTUs is that they are able to dedicate more time to examining a patient .

Dr. Hoffman said he had previously been able to spend only a few minutes on each examination due to his other commitments , whereas MTUs can commit half an hour .

So far , ten blind women have qualified as MTUs . One of the women , Marie-Luise Voll , 57 , told CNN : '' The work brings me a lot of joy . ''

Voll had previously practiced as a nurse before losing her sight in 2007 , but used the experience when training at Düren for her new role .

If an abnormality is located the doctor will decide how to proceed , with ultrasounds and mammography being the most frequent course of action .

The program has been acclaimed as a success by both patients and practitioners in Germany .
