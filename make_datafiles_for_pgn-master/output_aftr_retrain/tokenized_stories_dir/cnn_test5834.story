-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity .

Rifqa Bary , 17 , ran away from her family in Columbus , Ohio , in July . She claims her father threatened to kill her .

The 17-year-old girl , Rifqa Bary , ran away from her family in Columbus , Ohio , in July and took refuge in the home of the Rev. Blake Lorenz with the Global Revolution Church in Orlando , Florida .

At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando , the girl 's parents denied all the allegations against them .

The parents , Mohamed and Aysha Bary , could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them . They denied they ever threatened to kill their daughter because she converted to Christianity .

`` We would n't do her harm , '' the father said , adding that he knew his daughter was involved with Christian organizations .

The teen had heard of pastor Lorenz and his church through a prayer group on Facebook . The girl 's parents reported her missing to Columbus police , who found her two weeks later in Florida through cell phone records .

Also at Thursday 's hearing , the judge sealed a report on the girl from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and issued a gag order for attorneys in the case .

At one point during the hearing , the girl 's court-appointed guardian , Krista Bartholomew , told the court : `` This is not a holy war but a case about a broken family . ''
