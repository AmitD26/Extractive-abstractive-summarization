WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Military hardware that can be used in nuclear devices and ground fighting can be easily purchased In the United States and shipped overseas , a government investigation revealed Thursday .

used in homemade bombs , was easily bought and shipped overseas .

The Government Accountability Office -LRB- GAO -RRB- watchdog agency set up fake companies to obtain military and dual use items -- which have both military and commercial use -- in the United States and ship them overseas , according to a report made public at a House subcommittee hearing .

The domestic purchases allow buyers to avoid U.S. restrictions on sales to foreign entities , it noted .

Items purchased in the bogus transactions included parts for making nuclear devices and guiding missiles that could carry nuclear warheads , as well as night-vision devices , body armor and other hardware for ground combat , said the report provided to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee .

`` There appears to be a gigantic loophole within our laws that makes it easy for our enemies to get hold of our superior military technology and use it against us , '' said Rep. Bart Stupak , D-Michigan .

He stressed that no laws were broken by any of the companies that sold items to the undercover GAO operation , and that the magnitude of trying to check all overseas travelers and shipments made it impossible to halt illegal export of the items under current law .

Committee members said the lack of regulation or export controls made the situation particularly troubling .

Kutz held up some of the items purchased by undercover investigators , including a small device that looked like a spark plug called a triggered spark gap . The item has medical applications and can also be used to detonate a nuclear weapon , he said .

Undercover investigators complied with all required checks in purchasing the equipment , Kutz said , including the submission of end-user agreements that forbid exporting the equipment or using it in any nuclear , biological and missile weapons . Such documents amount to an `` honor system '' pledge , rather than any enforcement mechanism , he said .

`` The kind of front company we used and the kind of scheme we used is the kind being used by terrorist organizations today , '' Kutz said . `` This was not a hypothetical situation ; this is being done . ''

He declined to name the country , but said it was in southeast Asia and that the shipments were simple packages labeled documents and sent by regular mail .

One of those duped by the investigation -- Nicholas Fitton , a technology dealer in Georgia -- told the committee he complied with all required checks in selling an F-16 engine computer to what he thought was a legitimate U.S. buyer .

Fitton said existing regulations were counter-productive , with seemingly harmless items associated with military gear more tightly controlled than the dual-use items of the investigation . At the same time , he said , making the system too restrictive would harm the competitive ability of U.S. manufacturers .

Export laws in the United States have remained virtually unchanged since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , Anne-Marie Lasowski of the GAO told the committee .
