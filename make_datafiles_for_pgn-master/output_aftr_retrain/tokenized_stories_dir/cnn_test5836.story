GUADALAJARA , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama said Monday the United States remains Mexico 's partner in the fight against drug cartels , despite some calls in the United States to delay counter-narcotics aid because of alleged human rights violations by Mexican soldiers .

Mexican President Felipe Calderon reaffirmed his commitment to transparency and human rights in his offensive against the cartels , Obama said .

Some $ 100 million in anti-drug aid , known as the Merida Initiative , could be delayed because of concerns about human rights violations , it was reported last week .

`` We have been very supportive of the Merida Initiative , and we remain supportive , '' Obama said .

The remarks came at a summit of North American leaders in Guadalajara , Mexico .

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper also expressed support for Mexico 's strategy , saying that the drug cartels were a problem shared by all three countries .

Turning to immigration , Obama said he is committed to `` fix the broken immigration system . ''

The three North American countries depend on their borders being safe and secure , Obama said , adding that he supports `` orderly and legal '' migration , while respecting the American tradition of welcoming immigrants .

Harper agreed with Obama 's stance .

Turning to trade , Obama said a `` Buy American '' provision in his economic stimulus plan had little effect so far on the multibillion-dollar trade partnership with Canada .

Obama told journalists that Harper has raised the issue every time they have met .

Harper responded to the same question by saying the leaders had a good discussion on the issue , and their respective trade ministers also were talking about it .

Canada is the top trade partner of the United States , with cross-border commerce worth more than $ 1 billion a day .

The $ 787-billion stimulus package enacted in February included a provision that only American goods be used in stimulus projects . It also stipulated that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement .

Opponents of health care legislation in the U.S. House and Senate say it will lead to a single-payer system like the government-run program in Canada , with some warning the Canadian system means restrictions on treatments and long delays .

Obama noted the U.S. system is based on employers providing health insurance for most Americans . Throwing that out would be too radical an overhaul , he said .

`` I suspect that you Canadians are going to continue to get dragged into the debate , '' he said .
