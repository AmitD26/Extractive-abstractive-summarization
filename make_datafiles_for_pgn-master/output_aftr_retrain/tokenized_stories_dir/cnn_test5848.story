KABUL , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai bowed to Western pressure Tuesday , agreeing to take part in a presidential runoff vote in two weeks .

Hamid Karzai failed to score a first round win in August 's election .

Karzai , who will face his main challenger Abdullah Abdullah in the November 7 second round , said he was putting his country 's interests over his own .

Western powers , particularly the United States , had been pushing Karzai to accept the final election results in order to ensure Afghanistan has a legitimate government , particularly as Washington considers beefing up its military presence there .

The U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission had invalidated nearly a third of Karzai 's votes from the August 20 presidential election because of `` clear and convincing evidence of fraud . ''

Last month , final uncertified results showed Karzai with 54 percent .

The International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- in Afghanistan said that it would `` support the Afghan National Security Forces ' preparations to ensure a safe runoff election . ''

Spokesman Col. Wayne Shanks said that ISAF had been preparing for a possible runoff election `` for some time . ''

`` We believe with this decision by the president today that a time of enormous uncertainty has been transformed into a great opportunity , '' Kerry said . Watch President Karzai and Sen. John Kerry discuss runoff elections ''

Obama is considering sending more troops to Afghanistan , and Kerry has said the results of the country 's election should be settled before the United States makes any decision on troop levels . Watch Nic Robertson discuss pressure President Karzai is under ''

Abdullah told CNN on Monday he was prepared to participate in a runoff , but said `` the door is open '' to other alternatives .

`` There are some practical questions ahead , '' Abdullah told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour , citing winter , the security situation `` and other realities on the ground . ''

Such a delay , he warned , would be a `` recipe for disaster '' that would create confusion in Afghanistan and heighten tension between the United States and Karzai 's government .
