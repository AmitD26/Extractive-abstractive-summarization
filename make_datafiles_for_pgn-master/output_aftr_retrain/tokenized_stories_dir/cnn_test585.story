A woman was hogtied and disemboweled , her intestines protruding from three deep cuts on her abdomen . Attackers left her topless , dangling by her feet and hands from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo . A bloodied man next to her was hanging by his hands , his right shoulder severed so deeply the bone was visible .

Signs left near the bodies declared the pair , both apparently in their early 20s , were killed for posting denouncements of drug cartel activities on a social network .

`` This is going to happen to all of those posting funny things on the Internet , '' one sign said . `` You better -LRB- expletive -RRB- pay attention . I 'm about to get you . ''

Mexico 's notoriously ruthless drug gangs regularly hang victims from bridges and highway overpasses .

Investigator Ricardo Mancillas Castillo said he had not encountered a threat against Internet users in his four years based in Nuevo Laredo . But the signs of torture -- the cuts , the disembowelment -- were along the lines of what officials are used to seeing in drug-related violence .

Thirty-six hours had passed since the bodies were found Tuesday morning , but no one had come to claim them and they remained unidentified , Mancillas said .

It will be nearly impossible to determine if the two victims actually posted anything about cartels on the Internet , as people do n't usually use their real names online , he said .

The placards threatened those who report violent incidents through social media networks . It listed two blogs by name , Al Rojo Vivo and Blog del Narco .

They were signed `` Z , '' a possible reference for the Zetas cartel , which operates in the area .

On the Al Rojo Vivo forum , where citizens can make anonymous tips , one person wrote : `` Do n't be afraid to denounce . It 's very difficult for them to find out who denounced . They only want to scare society . ''

One Twitter user echoed that sense of defiance in light of the threats .

`` Enough ! If we shut up today , we will have lost the ground that we have gained . This is the time to show what we are made of , '' the owner of the @QuestoyQuelotro Twitter account wrote .

In a statement sent to CNN , Blog del Narco said its site is not dedicated to denouncing crime , as are other sites .
