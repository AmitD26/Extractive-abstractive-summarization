In a September 9 indictment unsealed Tuesday , Justice Department officials also moved to seize $ 18 million worth of property owned by the suspects , including seven homes , three businesses and an apartment complex .

All but one of the arrests occurred in Puerto Rico . The lone arrest on the U.S. mainland was in Miami , Florida .

Drug Enforcement Special Agent in Charge Javier Pena said the airline industry cooperated in the investigation .

`` By denying the drug traffickers alternate smuggling routes , we disrupt the flow of drugs into Puerto Rico and discourage the use of the island as a transshipment point in the Caribbean , '' he said in a news release .

The agency said that if they are convicted , the defendants taken into custody would face sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison and personal fines of up to $ 4 million .

`` As a company , we hope that the actions of a few employees do n't reflect negatively on the tens of thousands of ethical American Airlines employees who work hard to serve the public daily , '' Wagner wrote .
