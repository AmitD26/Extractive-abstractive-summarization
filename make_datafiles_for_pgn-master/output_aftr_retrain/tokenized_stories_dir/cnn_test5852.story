LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As the man in the Dodgers jersey walked quickly around the perimeter of the infield , fans poured down from the bleachers begging for autographs .

No , it was n't home run king Manny Ramirez . It was Armando Christian Perez , the Cuban-American rapper better known as Pitbull .

In five years , he 's gone from a mouthy Miami street hustler to a chart-topping hip-hop star whose infectious Caribbean beats have enticed crossover audiences to swing their hips and sing along -- even taking on some of the words in Spanish . His fourth studio album , `` Rebelution , '' debuted in the Top 10 on the mainstream Billboard chart .

`` One more try ! '' he signals . The second attempt is closer to the mark .

It 's symbolic of Pit 's career . `` It 's not how you start . It 's how you finish it , '' he likes to say . Watch how Pitbull leads his `` Rebelution '' ''

CNN : Tommy Lasorda was out there giving you a little bit of grief .

Pitbull : Tommy Lasorda told me , `` It was the worst throw I 've ever seen in my life ! '' I said , `` Well , I 'll throw you in the studio . You rap , I 'll play baseball . '' He goes , `` I 'll rap a whole lot better than that throw ! '' -LRB- Laughs -RRB-

Pitbull : -LSB- Humor is -RSB- everything . Everything . Usually the negatives turned out to be the most positive for me . In the music industry , any other artist would have looked at the situation I was in and thought , `` Oh man , this is not for me . '' I looked at it more like -LSB- Darwin exploring -RSB- the Galápagos Islands . You know -- survival of the fittest .

Pitbull : Not a troublemaker . I 'm sharp . Slick , if you want to call it . What the street taught me how to do is how to hustle . How to make something out of nothing .

CNN : In the music industry , street cred may help an artist .

CNN : How much do you want to cross over ?

Pitbull : They did n't want to leave Cuba ! They would have stayed in Cuba . They did n't want to get out of there . There were forced out of that country .

CNN : Would you ever go to Cuba and play a concert there ?

Pitbull : No way . I 'd never go to Cuba and play a concert . -LSB- I 'd consider playing there -RSB- as soon as I know that it 's confirmed that Castro 's out of there . I mean , if you ask me , I think Castro 's been dead for years . He handed power to Raúl , and he slips pictures here and there . He keeps giving these pictures to the media with the same shirt on -- same jacket , same everything .

CNN : How do you feel about other artists of your generation who feel compelled to go and perform in Cuba as kind of an olive branch ?

Pitbull : Juanes just did it . Papa , you ca n't change Cuba . History will tell you that you ca n't change Cuba . I respect him as an artist -- he 's like U2 , the Bono of Spanish . I do n't respect his decision . Maybe he does n't really understand it at the end of the day because he 's not Cuban . -LSB- Juanes is Colombian . -RSB-

CNN : Even though you were born in America , how much are you influenced by your Cuban roots ?

Pitbull : My mother , she 's like , `` Look , you 're American , son . You were born here in the States . '' My father ? My father said , `` You 're Cuban-American . '' My mother would call me Chris , because my middle name 's Christian . My father would say , `` No , your name 's Armando . '' But in my blood , what it tells me is , `` You 're Cuban-American . '' The music is what makes you , the food is what makes you , the way you 've been taught mentally .
