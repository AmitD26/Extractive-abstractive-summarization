-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In just 200 days , Michelle Obama has put her own stamp on one of America 's most unusual political positions -- the unelected , undefined job of being first lady . And the way she 's done it ? It 's largely through the fashion choices she 's made .

The use of fashion and image as a political strategy is an underrated factor . While Washington 's political cognoscenti debate the successes and failures of the young Obama presidency , one half of Washington 's newest power couple fine tunes fashion as a political strategy -- and it 's working for her .

The fashion authorities who are gathered this week in New York for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week , more than seven months into the Obama presidency , are watching Michelle Obama 's redefinition of the role of first lady with professional and personal interest .

The contemporary standard for the job was set decades ago by Jacqueline Kennedy , who had both a high sense of fashion and the style to pull it off . Carl Sferrazza Anthony , the historian at the National First Ladies ' Library , points out that Mrs. Kennedy wanted to be well-dressed , liked European style and had American designers copy it . She even went as far as to personally design her own outfits on three important state occasions , including her famous White House dinner for Nobel laureates , while letting other designers take the credit .

But while Jackie was high fashion , Michelle Obama is trendy but traditional . And that approachability extends to her personal style as well , her advisors having absorbed the lesson that the first lady 's style is all too easily linked to her husband 's presidency . Ronald Reagan 's opponents used his wife Nancy 's interest in fashion and her intent to look like the wife of a president , rather than mimic the school-marmish attire of her predecessor , as a gateway through which to attack the president .

And whatever the style mavens have to say about that , it produces political benefits . J. Crew 's shares jumped 10 percent within 24 hours after the nation saw her in its clothing , which prompted NBC 's Conan O'Brien to suggest the president consider wearing a Buick .

As Women 's Wear Daily media reporter Stephanie Smith says , this child of Chicago 's South Side has become `` the biggest celebrity in the world . '' Forbes lists her among the `` Most Powerful Women , '' and there 's no doubt she 's expanding the boundaries of perceptions surrounding the role of a `` traditional '' first lady , balancing her visits to homeless shelters and military bases with taking part in her children 's soccer games .

According to Anthony , the general public 's fascination with Michelle Obama spills over and helps the administration . To him , everything the media and the public criticize or praise is visual . `` It 's not anything she 's saying or doing . That 's perhaps somewhat tactical . If she 's unpopular based on her clothes choices , the White House can say it 's really not of importance . ''

Mrs. Obama , because she has made fashion `` more democratic , '' says style expert Robert Verdi , has made her own impact on a world full of elites and -- let 's face it -- snobs . Mrs. Kennedy , he says , `` was very contemporary and up-to-the-moment in fashion . But fashion at that time as not democratic . There was no Zara , no J. Crew , no Banana Republic . It was not accessible ; it was exclusively aspirational . ''

On balance , though , Michelle Obama has shown a feminine but bold approach to her style by rattling the image of what a `` Washington '' first lady must look like . For other professional women and moms , the impact may not be purely imitation , as was the case with Jackie Kennedy , but rather the timely embracing of a new image of a modern , professional woman .

Whatever it is , it 's clearly by design . The push-pull of knowing fashion and appropriately wearing fashion may take Mrs. Obama longer to manage . Though a risk-taker and eager to highlight the equivalent of `` mom and pop '' designers , she , like many women , is still safely wearing styles others create rather than something new we could aspire to . Still -- whatever the implications for fashion -- on a political level , the first lady 's approach is working .
