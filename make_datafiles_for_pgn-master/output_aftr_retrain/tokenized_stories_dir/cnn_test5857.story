A statement posted on the embassy 's Web site said `` successful counter-terrorism operations '' conducted by Yemeni security forces on Monday , north of the Yemeni capital , Sanaa , addressed `` a specific area of concern and have contributed to the Embassy 's decision to resume operations . ''

However , Mohamed Ahmed al-Haniq , the al Qaeda unit 's leader , and an unknown number of his `` companions '' were able to escape during the clashes , SABA reported , citing Yemen 's Interior Ministry .

The U.S. Embassy said the threat of terrorist attacks against American interests in Yemen `` remains high , '' and it urged American citizens in the country `` to be vigilant and take prudent security measures . ''

The United States ' decision to close its embassy came after intelligence suggested that four al Qaeda operatives were planning an attack on the compound , a senior administration official said Monday .

It was not immediately clear if the same al Qaeda members in Monday 's clashes were among the group of eight suspected terrorists .

On Monday , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the situation in Yemen a possible threat to regional and global security , but commended Yemen for taking action against al Qaeda networks .

The United States and Britain closed their embassies Sunday . Britain 's Foreign Office also cited security concerns and its embassy remained closed Tuesday .

`` The British Embassy in Yemen will remain closed to the public today , '' a statement from the embassy said .

`` Some embassy personnel will be in and whoever needs to contact the embassy can do it via the phone or e-mail but people wo n't be able to walk into the embassy . ''

Several other nations also made changes at their Yemen-based embassies Monday , including Japan , France , Spain and Germany . Each cited the need for increased security measures .

France closed its embassy to the public , although French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said Tuesday that embassy employees will continue their work .

Valero said the embassy will reopen once work to secure the site , already in progress before the latest threat , is finished .

Spain also restricted public access to its embassy , the Spanish Foreign Ministry said , adding that the embassy continued to function `` normally . ''

Japan halted service at the consulate section of its embassy . The Japanese Foreign Ministry said the decision was based on the threat of terror , not a specific threat .

Germany said that while its embassy remained fully operational , security measures were increased . The German Foreign Ministry said fewer visitors were allowed into the embassy compound .

The wave of concerns follow last month 's alleged attempted terrorist attack by a Nigerian man who boarded a flight in Amsterdam , Netherlands , and allegedly tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight approached Detroit , Michigan .

The attempt failed , and other passengers and crew grabbed the suspect .

The Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day plot . U.S. President Barack Obama has also linked the suspect , Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , to the group , which is a combination of al Qaeda networks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen .
