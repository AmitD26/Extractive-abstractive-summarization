In recent years , the cemetery -- where President Kennedy and thousands of fallen U.S. soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines are buried -- has had a number of embarrassing problems .

In 2003 , as workers were digging a grave for a new burial , they discovered a casket already buried there . There was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who . Only recently , after a report by a journalist at Salon.com , did the Army take action on the problem . Over the summer , the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads `` Unknown . ''

As McHugh ordered the new investigation , the Army released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery . That investigation focused on the discovery of the `` Unknown '' grave .

A spokesman for the Military District of Washington , which conducted the review , said `` Cemetery records , the MDW investigation , and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife , who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site , were instead buried in adjacent graves . ''

One of the problems discovered by the MDW investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery . Last year Arlington conducted 4,377 burials , up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years . During that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent . Currently the cemetery has four employees to schedule 135 to 150 funerals a week as well as maintain all grave records .

Arlington , which sits on a hill across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial , has been the final resting place for America 's military heroes since the Civil War , when the Union seized the estate from the family of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee .

McHugh hopes this new investigation will `` ensure America 's confidence in the operation of its most hallowed ground . ''
