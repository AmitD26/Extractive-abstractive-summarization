Those being discharged were part of a group deemed `` disqualified '' by United Nations findings in 2007 , which identified at least 4,008 such combatants -- including 2,973 minors .

More than 15,000 died in the fighting and more than 100,000 people were displaced , according to the United Nations Web site .

`` Those who left the Sindhuli camp today are no more members of the -LSB- Maoist -RSB- People 's Liberation Army , '' Nanda Kishore Pun , commander of the Maoist People 's Liberation Army , told CNN in a phone interview from Sindhuli , about 150 km -LRB- 93 miles -RRB- southeast of Kathmandu .

As part of the rehabilitation package for the disqualified combatants , the United Nations has offered to provide vocational skills training and education up to high school to those who want such opportunities , but Pun said that these offers are still being discussed .

Once the minors remain out of the command and control of the Maoist military structure for six months to a year , the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist -LRB- UCPN-M -RRB- can be considered for removal from the list of parties that recruit and use children , which is included in the annual U.N. Secretary-General 's report on Children and Armed Conflict .

As the discharge and rehabilitation process began , about a dozen of the disqualified combatants were listed as being under the age of 16 and about 500 were under the age of 18 . Though called combatants , the United Nations said the minors were used as messengers , cooks and porters during the fighting .
