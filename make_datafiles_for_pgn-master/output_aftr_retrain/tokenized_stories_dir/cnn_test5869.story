`` I served my time for what I did , and I did n't feel like I should be incarcerated again , '' said this man , who asked that his identity not be revealed for fear of retribution . `` It was a scary thing to know that you could be committed to a mental institution for the rest of your life . ''

The practice of confinement in mental hospitals or treatment centers for those with severe mental illness has been around the United States since its founding . Around the turn of the 20th century , many laws dealing with sexual psychopaths were passed . Over the decades , the laws were repealed or rarely applied .

`` The evidence is showing that it 's only becoming a detainment center for people they do not went on the streets , '' said Derek Logue , a sex offender who was released and now advocates for offender rights through his Web site , oncefallen.com . `` They have no hope of getting out , and the odds are stacked against you . ''

According to Justice Department statistics , 20 states use civil confinement , involving about 4,000 rapists , pedophiles and other sex offenders nationwide . Estimates are that these programs cost taxpayers more than $ 700 million a year , almost $ 150,000 per individual . That is about four times more than confining them in prison .

Virginia passed its civil commitment law in 1999 but had never fully funded it . Andrews found out from a reporter in 2002 that his attacker was just weeks away from being released after 29 years behind bars . Once a victim , now an empowered advocate , Andrews realized he had to act .

But Andrews mobilized , lobbying lawmakers to quickly fund the program , despite a budget shortfall . It worked , and the state has become a national model , using a tool called `` Static 99 '' that assesses which offenders qualify for civil commitment .

Andrews ' attacker remained behind bars but was killed by a fellow inmate before ever going into the treatment program .

The catalyst for the state 's change were once-dormant memories for Andrews , who now knew that he had to tell his story .

As a teenager in Portsmouth in 1973 , Andrews was walking to the store in snowy weather when a van pulled up and the man inside asked the boy whether he wanted to earn some extra money moving furniture . Andrews agreed but instead was taken to a rural area and a metal box dug into the side of a hill .

What followed was days of brutal rapes and beatings . Ausley eventually left , and Andrews would certainly have died if some rabbit hunters had not stumbled upon him after hearing his screams .

Andrews believes that civil commitment is not the best tool , but for the most dangerous predators , `` it is the only tool we have that is 100 percent effective , because they are removed from society . They are removed from their triggers . ''

The case before the Supreme Court on Tuesday deals with a federal law that has kept as many as 77 inmates held in federal prison in North Carolina under indefinite commitment .

The justices will decide whether the program enacted under the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 is constitutional by infringing on a traditional state function . The law was named after the son of `` America 's Most Wanted '' host John Walsh .

`` We have never held that the Constitution prevents a state from civilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available but who nevertheless pose a danger to others , '' Justice Clarence Thomas said .

Janus worries about the slippery slope if such laws -- federal or state -- are allowed to continue without strong judicial checks .

`` The main danger of civil commitment of sex offenders is that it provides a precedent for doing an end run around those governmental protections , and we all may be comfortable right now because we say , ` Well , this is those people . It 's not us . It 's not our rights that are at stake , ' '' he said .

`` I think we all ought to be cognizant of the fact that these laws set a precedent that greatly expands the power of government to take away our liberty , not for something we 've done in the past , not after we 've been convicted and punished , but out of fear that we might commit a crime in the future , and this is a very very powerful and dangerous idea , '' Janus said .

The white-haired man sitting with his lawyer outside Richmond says he is no longer a danger to society . He served nearly eight years in prison for molesting three girls and nearly five years in forced civil commitment . Despite that state confinement , including being the first of only about four men to be released from it , he says post-prison treatment helped him .

`` I think that civil commitment is unfair , '' he said . `` I 'm not against treatment . I have done everything in my power to help myself '' understand the effects of sexual abuse .

He said that being told just days before his scheduled 2003 release that he was being civilly committed left him feeling `` hopeless . ''

Shortly afterward , the man castrated himself with a razor in his jail cell . After the transfer and years in the rehabilitation unit , he was freed and lives a quiet life -- albeit under constant electronic surveillance -- with no further reported incidents , says his attorney .

Lawyer David Hargett convinced the Virginia Supreme Court that his client had a constitutional right to contest his civil commitment .

`` This treatment facility ... is a prison , let 's be honest . It has barbed wire and locked doors . '' He said most in the Virginia facility realistically will never get out .

The high court case is U.S. v. Comstock -LRB- 08-1224 -RRB- .
