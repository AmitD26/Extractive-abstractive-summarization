Americans are sharply divided along racial lines as to whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged with murder in the shooting death of Michael Brown , a new CNN/ORC poll out Monday finds .

Fifty-four percent of nonwhites -- including blacks , Latinos and Asians -- say Wilson should be charged with murder , while just 23 % of whites agree . And 38 % of whites say Wilson should be charged with no crime at all , while just 15 % of nonwhites hold that position .

Most Americans agree that Wilson should at least face some form of criminal charges , the poll finds .

There is broad 63 % agreement that peaceful protests are justified if a grand jury does n't indict Wilson for murder . But a racial divide exists over whether violent protests are justified in that case , with 22 % of nonwhites saying yes while 10 % of whites agree .

Voices of Ferguson

The differences underscored the broader perceptions of prejudice among police officers .

Half of all whites say that `` almost none '' or `` none '' of the police in their areas are prejudiced against blacks . Only 35 % of nonwhites agreed with that view .
