-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Democrats and Republicans woke up this week with a fresh perspective on the midterm elections .

To many political observers , the election of Republican Scott Brown is a game changer . He overcame what at one point was a 30-point deficit to defeat Democrat Martha Coakley in a special election to serve out the remainder of the late Ted Kennedy 's Senate term .

`` As a Frank Sinatra fan , I think of the great song ` New York , New York , ' and really for Republicans right now , we think if we can make it there in Massachusetts and New Jersey , we can make it anywhere , '' Republican strategist Doug Heye said . `` There 's no state in the union right now that Republicans do n't feel that they can be competitive in . ''

Dr. Elizabeth Ossoff , a psychology professor at Saint Anselm College who specializes in voting behavior , said voters start from an emotional perspective and then get rational .

`` If you can grab them emotionally , I think you 've gone a long way toward getting them where you want them to be , voting either Democrat or Republican , '' said Ossoff , who is also the director of research for the New Hampshire Institute of Politics .

President Obama rode into the White House on a compelling message of change , inspiring his base while also winning over independent voters . But a year after his inauguration , polls suggest that much of the excitement that followed him has disappeared .

'' -LSB- Democrats -RSB- will try to mobilize more voters , but you have to overcome the enthusiasm gap . The best grassroots , ground operation will only work if the territory is fertile , '' Gans said .

He predicted the economy will be the most important issue in the midterms . The Obama administration has said it plans to emphasize job growth both in this week 's State of the Union address and in the months to come .

`` He had a year in which he could blame the Bush administration for not dealing with the economic problems . The economy is now his baby , as Afghanistan is his baby , '' Gans said .

This scenario played out last year in a special election for New York 's 23rd Congressional District . Local Republican leaders backed state assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava because they thought she would appeal to centrists and independents . But more conservative party members revolted and instead backed Doug Hoffman , who ran on the Conservative Party line .

A similar battle could take place in Florida , where Republican Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio are competing to be their party 's nominee for the Senate race . Crist has the backing of mainstream Republicans , and Rubio is the darling of the right .

`` Rubio has the enthusiasm of the birthers and the Tea Party people and others like that , and that may propel him to the nomination , but it will be harder for the Republican Party to win in Florida under Rubio than it would be under a more moderate person , '' Gans said .

Going ahead , both parties need to clarify their messages and why their strategies are the best options in order to engage voters , Ossoff said .

`` What the Democrats have to do is get off the defensive if they want to win and start packaging themselves in a more positive light . ... They need to not only say , ` This is what we are going to do because it is right , ' but ` those guys over there do n't want us to do that ' and paint -LSB- the Republicans -RSB- as bad guys .
