Hoppy Ray , 84 , was among the last people to leave the toxic town of Picher , Oklahoma .

A toothpick dangling out of the corner of his chapped mouth , Ray greeted several old friends as if he were in any other small town in America .

Gray mountains of toxic gravel loomed behind the school , just out of sight , as Hoppy hobbled past a bundle of balloons and through the front doors , cane in hand . He tipped his hat as he entered .

As his abandoned town fades to dust , Hoppy has gone into the business of memories . He wants to remind townspeople , and the world , that a person 's home should always be loved -- no matter how toxic . See Hoppy share memories of Picher ''

Hoppy did n't understand what all of the fuss was about .

It was 2006 , and the federal government announced it would pay people to leave Picher and the Tar Creek Superfund Site , which is part of the government 's toxic-waste cleanup program . A report had found that much of the area was at risk of collapsing into the extensive lead and zinc mines . Timeline : How Picher became toxic ''

But not Hoppy .

Hoppy swore he would n't leave his hometown , that he would die before he 'd leave Picher , even if his electricity and water were turned off .

He 'd grown up there , worked in the mines alongside his father -- and all three of his brothers . But Picher was more than a place to make money . It was a place of patriotism and purpose : The metals they dug out of caves deep in the ground were processed and turned into bullets that armed U.S. soldiers in both world wars .

The wars ended , though , and so did the world 's interest in Picher . By 1970 , the last mine shut down .

Hoppy 's family stayed .

After making a quick stop in the crowded school cafeteria , Hoppy found a more suitable post on the sidelines of the reunion , in a narrow hallway .

He sat in a chair with a smirk on his face , using his cane to ping friends in the shins , or sometimes in the groin , to get their attention .

Hoppy 's son and grandson arrived with several cardboard boxes of books , pulled from the bed of the old miner 's pickup . With the help of another local-history buff , Hoppy has self-published three books . The latest , `` Just Call Me Hoppy , '' chronicles his memories of a pre-toxic Picher , a time he believes everyone else has forgotten .

In those years , Picher was a bustling town with neon signs `` like Las Vegas , '' Hoppy recalled . See photos of the town ''

`` I thought it was important that people ought to know what Picher 's role was in two world wars , '' Hoppy said . `` Hell , to me , it was important . ... Without the mines here in Ottawa County -LSB- Oklahoma -RSB- , those wars would 've lasted a lot longer . ''

Hoppy figures the world hears plenty about all that . He 'd rather focus on the Picher he loves . The walls of his pool hall -- the sign in the window says `` Hoppy 's Museum '' -- are now papered with photos and artifacts .

Neighboring buildings are boarded up , their windows broken , the paint peeling . Tree-size weeds crack the sidewalks .

Hoppy 's pool hall breathes life into this abandoned place , where only a few people still live . On Monday nights , he opens the doors to local musicians . When he goes home , he leaves a single bulb lit over the door .

It 's the only light on the street .

One morning , about two weeks before Picher 's June 13 reunion , Hoppy 's son moved his dad out of town while Hoppy was at his favorite restaurant eating breakfast .

Hoppy was furious .

`` I unlocked the door ... and I did n't have a stick of furniture , '' he said . He stood in the entryway in disbelief .

David Ray showed up behind his dad , bearing the news that Picher had left him behind . It was time to go . He was moving to Miami , a town just 10 miles south .

On the rare instances when that has worked , Hoppy has dreamed of a pre-toxic Picher . He sees packed movie theaters and bar fights .

He sees the people from the photos on the walls of his pool hall , all of whom are gone .

His house in Picher , the one where he lived for nearly half a century , is tagged with yellow spray paint : TBCD .

Why is moving just 10 miles away so devastating ?

It 's no wonder they seek solace in memories .

From his post in the hallway at Picher 's wake , Hoppy sold $ 300 worth of books -- not enough to cover costs but enough to leave him satisfied .

He had two heart attacks in recent weeks , and doctors said the stress was getting to him .

Hoppy 's family loaded his unsold books back into the bed of his pickup , and the old miner drove down empty streets to a still-unfamiliar home .

He says he moved to Miami `` under protest . '' But he 's easing to the idea a bit .

He 's not happy about having to leave his home . But he 's no longer the stubborn man who could n't dream of the world beyond Picher .

`` There 's not any point in thinking about it , '' he said , `` because there ai n't a damn thing you can do about it -- just break out , go someplace else and start all over again . ''

The walls in his new living room are still bare . But he has ordered two 6-foot-long murals of Picher , photographs of the town in its heyday .

The mountains of gravel waste were smaller then -- and growing . For Hoppy , the photos capture a town on the upswing .

He left with a sense of relief .

And afterward , for the first time in weeks , he slept through the night .
