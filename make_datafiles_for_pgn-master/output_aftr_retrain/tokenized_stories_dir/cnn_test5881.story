Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama 's senior economic adviser said Sunday the government was delaying a report to Congress in order to provide more time to address China 's alleged currency manipulation .

Summers said the upcoming meetings offer opportunities to engage China and other countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States .

China has opposed more sanctions , but last week signaled a willingness to negotiate the issue within the U.N. Security Council , according to Susan Rice , the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations .

Lawmakers from both parties have called on the Obama administration to speak out against China 's refusal to let its currency appreciate . China has kept its yuan at about 6.83 to the dollar for almost two years . Many U.S. economists say the currency is undervalued by as much as 40 percent .

Some analysts have argued that this is costing the United States 1.5 million jobs and impeding the country 's economic recovery .

`` Everyone knows China is manipulating the value of its currency to gain an unfair advantage in international trade , '' said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley , adding he was disappointed in the treasury secretary 's decision .

`` If we want the Chinese to take us seriously , we need to be willing to say so in public , '' said Grassley , the ranking Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee . `` The past few years have proven that denying the problem does n't solve anything . ''

`` The Chinese government will not succumb to foreign pressure to adjust our exchange rates , '' said Zhong Shan , vice minister of commerce , late last month .

Premier Wen Jiabao has been equally stern in his response .

`` We oppose the practice of finger-pointing among countries or strong-arm measures to force other countries to appreciate currencies , '' he told reporters last month .

`` A move by China to a more market-oriented exchange rate will make an essential contribution to global rebalancing , '' he said .

`` If the multilateral effort does not result in China 's making significant changes , the administration and Congress will have no choice but to take appropriate action , '' said Levin , a Democratic lawmaker from Michigan .
