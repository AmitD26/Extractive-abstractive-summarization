Sotheby 's will auction off one of the earliest versions of the Magna Carta later this year , the auction house announced Tuesday .

This will be the first time any version of the Magna Carta has ever gone up for auction , according to David Redden , vice chairman of Sotheby 's .

Redden , who has also sold dinosaur bones , space race artifacts and a first printing of the Declaration of Independence , called the Magna Carta `` the most important document on earth . ''

The charter mandated the English king to cede certain basic rights to his citizens , ensuring that no man is above the law .

The version up for auction rested for six centuries with the Brundell family in Deene Park , England , until being bought in 1984 by businessman Ross Perot . Since then , the Perot Foundation has kept the copy on display at the National Archives in Washington .

The Perot Foundation plans to distribute the money from the auction to various causes such as medical research and helping wounded soldiers .

The Magna Carta will be coming up for auction during the week of December 10 . E-mail to a friend
