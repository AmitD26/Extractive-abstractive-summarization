-LRB- OPRAH.com -RRB- -- My orthopedic surgeon took a few Pringle-like bone shards out of my knee this summer . I made a good recovery , and at our knee-review appointment I asked him if I could go back to playing tennis .

This is what it comes to , in middle age . What do you have that you 're stuck with and what do you have that may prove useful and how much room to grow and change and mitigate will you give yourself ?

In real life , my parents also had a lot of books , and the resemblance ended there .

So , what now ? Just as I once saw a life that was as close to Not-My-Parents as possible , I see a future in which my parents ' habits and strengths and weaknesses poke up determinedly like weeds through the sidewalk of the next ten years .

Oprah.com : The one thing every parent wants

I hope I wind up with my father 's cheerful , if impenetrable , view of himself . My father thought , until the day he died , that the way he was , was just fine .

I would not like his inability to sustain relationships -- for the relationship gene , I turn to my mother . My mother had friends from the third grade .

When she was maybe 70 , we were walking up Madison Avenue and a man about her age hailed us from across the street . `` Dellie Cohen ! James Madison High ! '' She did n't really remember him , but he remembered her . They caught up . `` Everyone loved your mother , '' he said . `` They still do . '' -LRB- `` Ma , '' I said later , `` you were the rock star of James Madison High ! '' She smiled . -RRB-

My mother had weekly conversations with at least six friends . She went on vacations and all-girl getaways about twice a year . She wrote long , fond letters to her grandchildren , bought things that I did n't need and foisted them on me regularly , and kept up with everyone who mattered to her -- in a meaningful way -- for 80 years . I would like that for me , too .

Neither of my parents complained about their physical health or other problems , and I am hoping to copy that as well . But there are other ancestral traits I have to watch out for , and I can sometimes feel their ivy twining around me .

All my aunts , and my mother , began dyeing their hair as soon as it had more than a sprinkle of gray , and I do , too . But I check in with my daughters , regularly , to make sure that I have not followed in the suddenly-ash-blonde delusion that my mother was so fond of .

The past is one of our clearest indicators of the future . Everything I saw in my parents -- the good and the bad -- has given me something . I am cursed with my mother 's arthritis but blessed with my father 's stamina ; his toughness , her kindness .

So , ten years from now : no tennis and no whining . Still working , still loving my friends and family . Still dancing -LRB- thanks , Daddy , for teaching me the cha-cha -RRB- .
