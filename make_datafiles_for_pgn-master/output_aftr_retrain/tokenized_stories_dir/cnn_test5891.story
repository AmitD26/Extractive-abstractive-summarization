Arlington , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It may surprise the casual visitor at Arlington National Cemetery to see a rubber duck on a headstone or an old football helmet lying in the manicured grass of a fallen soldier 's grave .

After all , America 's most hallowed ground is the final resting place for war heroes , astronauts , even two U.S. presidents .

But this new generation of warriors are frequently remembered with mementos like cans of beer , teddy bears and even tiny bottles of hot sauce . The message in the mementos is unknown but likely very personal .

`` Obviously , the deceased service person was a Crimson Tide fan . Letters , hotel keys . I 've seen jewelry , lots of things . ''

For the first time the Army , which runs Arlington National Cemetery , is collecting many of the items left on the graves , cataloging them according to what grave they were left on and storing them for posterity .

Before this effort began late last summer , most of the items were thrown away . Some cemetery employees tried to gather some special mementos , but no record was kept about what graves those items came from .

Now , curators from the Center of Military History are making sure a thorough record is kept .

There was a case where some items were collected from a grave , but the family did n't want the items moved , so the center returned the materials to the family . The curators also pay attention to when the materials are left . If they are birthday cards and a birthday is approaching , they will usually leave them . But if the birthday has passed , they will collect them .

Like a poem left on Cmdr. Phil Murphy-Sweet 's grave that reads :

`` In Arlington , a small white stone there ,

That 's where he 'll stay .

But instead , he stays there . ''

The poem is signed `` Jeanne and Lelila Musgates . '' But it 's unclear why it was left on Murphy-Sweet 's grave . Were they relatives , friends or just patriotic Americans who wanted to remember a fallen soldier ?

Once the poem and all other mementos have been collected , catalogued and saved , the Army secretary will decide what will be done with them .
