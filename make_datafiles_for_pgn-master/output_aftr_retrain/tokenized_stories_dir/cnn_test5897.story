The world number one handed each person a signed glove by way of apology as he battles to recapture his best form .

After his final round Woods was asked in a press conference if he was running low on gloves . He replied : `` No kidding , huh . I kept getting everybody out there today . No , but thank God I get them -LSB- gloves -RSB- for free . ''

He admitted his form is still patchy but that he was heading in the right direction : `` I have to take it step by step . It 's a process . I hit shots this week I had n't hit in a long time and got four rounds in .

`` It 's a shot-making golf course , '' he said . `` You have to hit the ball well there because the greens are so small . People do n't realize some of these putts you have to hit the ball in correct spots . ''

Woods finished tied for 19th place -- some way off 29-year-old Rose who was ecstatic after securing his first win in the U.S after years of trying .

`` To win here at the Memorial , at Jack 's tournament , I could n't think of a better place to win my first tournament . ''
