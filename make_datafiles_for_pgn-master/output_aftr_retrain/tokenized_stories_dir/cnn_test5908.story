Torres was forced off the pitch inside the first 10 minutes of Sunday 's defeat by Blackpool with a groin injury , and the 26-year-old could now face two weeks on the sidelines .

He has already been ruled out of Spain 's Euro 2012 qualifiers at home to Lithuania on Friday and away to Scotland on Tuesday .

`` Fernando was assessed at Melwood and underwent a scan this afternoon , '' Liverpool 's head of sports medicine and sports science , Dr Peter Brukner , told the club 's official website on Monday .

`` He will have intensive treatment over the next couple of weeks , but it is too early to say if he will be fit for the game against Everton . ''

The former Atletico Madrid star has endured a frustrating year , battling for both form and fitness .

He has also struggled to find the net at the start of the 2010-11 Premier League season , scoring just one goal in six matches .

After their latest defeat , the five-time European champions have picked up only one win from seven league matches , dropping into the relegation zone below Everton on goal difference .
