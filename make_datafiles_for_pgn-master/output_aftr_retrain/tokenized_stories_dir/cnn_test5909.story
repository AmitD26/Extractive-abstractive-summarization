Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Justice Department , as promised , moved Tuesday to block a court ruling preventing use of government funds for embryonic stem cell research .

The lower-court decision that bars the use of publicly funded stem-cell work had stunned the Obama administration , which had vowed to appeal .

`` The government is seeking a stay of the court 's injunction to prevent the irreparable human and financial harm that could occur if these life-saving research projects are forced to abruptly shut down , '' said Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler .

`` We 've said from day one that embryonic stem cell research is a top priority for this administration , and we 're going to do everything possible to prevent the potentially catastrophic consequences of this injunction , '' said White House spokesman Reid Cherlin .

The government said if Lamberth has not granted the stay by September 7 , the government would `` present their stay request to the Court of Appeals the following day '' .

Government lawyers filed the appeal on behalf of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , the National Institutes of Health , and its director , Francis Collins .

Judge Lamberth had ruled that all embryonic stem-cell research involves destroying embryos . He said a provision of federal spending bills `` unambiguously prohibits the use of federal funds for all research in which a human embryo is destroyed '' .
