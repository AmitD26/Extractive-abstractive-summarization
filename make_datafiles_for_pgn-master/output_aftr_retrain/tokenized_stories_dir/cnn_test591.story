Angela Campbell , 67 , was beaten and kidnapped days after Zimbabwe 's runoff election .

Though Campbell signed the document , her son-in-law said she has no intention of giving up her battle ; Campbell 's family will be in Windhoek , Namibia , on Wednesday to present arguments to a Southern African Development Community tribunal .

Mugabe blames the West for his nation 's soaring inflation and poverty . But analysts say Mugabe 's 2000 `` resettlement '' policy , in which property was snatched from white farmers and redistributed to landless blacks , is more to blame for the country 's turmoil . Watch a report from the time of the Campbell attack ''

`` All I want to see is justice , '' said Richard Etheredge , 72 , a white farmer who was evicted from his farm last month . `` The world can not carry on with criminals . ''

`` We 're going to murder you if we catch you , '' Etheredge recalls an assailant yelling from outside his son 's house two days later .

The senator bused `` criminals '' to his property , Etheredge said . Etheredge , his wife and one of his twin sons escaped , but the other twin and Etheredge 's daughter-in-law were later beaten , he said .

Looters stole his computers , farm equipment , antiques , custom gun collection and a safe with billions in Zimbabwean currency -LRB- hundreds of thousands in U.S. dollars -RRB- . Etheredge said he watched the thieves abscond with his possessions in vehicles belonging to the senator .

The looters also caused about $ 1 million in damage to his property , which includes three houses and a fruit-packing plant that was once among the most sophisticated in southern Africa . The Etheredges have been farming for 17 years and , before the attack , were producing 400,000 cartons of navel oranges and kumquats a year , he said .

`` The destruction is absolutely incredible , '' Etheredge said .

Mugabe 's cronies visited the adjacent Mount Carmel farm about two weeks later , just days after Mugabe won a majority of votes in a runoff denounced as a `` sham '' by the international community . Watch how violence persists after the election ''

Like the Etheredges , Mike and Angela Campbell were warned that Mugabe loyalists , members of his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front , were planning to invade their farm . The government had given the 1,200-hectare -LRB- 2,965-acre -RRB- tract to a Zanu-PF spokesman who also served as Mugabe 's biographer , according to the Campbells ' son-in-law , Ben Freeth .

On June 29 , Freeth received a phone call : `` War veterans , '' as the clans of pro-Mugabe thugs call themselves , were heading to his in-laws ' house . Laura and her brother , Bruce , gathered their children . Laura fled with the children through a fence on the northern boundary of Mount Carmel farm , Freeth said .

`` These guys had already arrived , and they started shooting at me as soon as I drove through the gate , '' he said .

The men tied up Freeth , he said , and took him to where his in-laws were lying bound on the gravel outside their home .

The heavily armed men threw the three in the back of Mike Campbell 's Toyota Prado truck , and `` the next nine hours were quite a nightmare , '' Freeth said .

`` They were pointing guns at us the whole time , telling us they were going to kill us , '' Freeth said .

It was during this time that their captors made Angela sign a document promising to drop the case scheduled this week before the tribunal .

Mike Campbell moved in and out of consciousness , as Ben and Angela prayed -- not for their lives , but for their captors . Freeth said he had never understood Luke 6:28 -- `` Bless those who curse you '' -- until that moment , and a `` supernatural '' peace came over him .

It was almost midnight when Freeth and the Campbells -- still bound -- were tossed in the back of the Prado . They bounced around the sport-utility vehicle as their captors drove 30 kilometers down a craggy dirt road to Kadoma , where they were dumped in the streets .

`` I managed to walk toward a light and knocked on the door of a house and used the phone to phone my wife , '' Freeth said .

The Campbells were released from the hospital last week . Both remain weak and still bear considerable scrapes and bruises . Angela has a pin in her arm . Mike , 75 , suffered four broken ribs , a broken collarbone and a dislocated finger .

The hospital released Freeth at the weekend after neurosurgeons had to drill a 4-centimeter -LRB- 1 1/2 - inch -RRB- hole in his skull to relieve pressure from a hematoma stemming from the rock and rifle-butt blows to the head .

`` I think it means a lot to him whether SADC is going to isolate him or continue to support him , '' Freeth said . `` Once we get to the SADC tribunal and we get a judgment and it 's basically binding in black and white , it 's going to be difficult for Mugabe to say , ` We 're abiding by our own law . ' It 's going to be very difficult for him to defend what he 's doing . ''
