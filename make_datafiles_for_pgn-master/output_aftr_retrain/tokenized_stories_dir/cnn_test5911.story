`` I 'm Still Here , '' Casey Affleck 's fascinating and scary documentary about his brother-in-law , is powerful evidence that the answer is neither -- and that , in fact , it 's much sadder .

The Joaquin we see in `` I 'm Still Here '' is a slurry , bloated shell of his former self , with taped sunglasses that never come off and unwashed hair that 's matted into crusty dreads .

On stage in Miami , during the notorious performance where he dove into the audience to brawl with a spectator who ticked him off -LRB- apparently an easy thing to do -RRB- , the hapless violence that we all saw 100 times on YouTube is less shocking than the extraordinary , dilapidated numbness of Phoenix 's demeanor during his abbreviated rap song .

Standing there in his shades and overly tight suit jacket , holding his cigarette as if he could n't be bothered to put it out for his act , Phoenix , without doing much of anything , radiates such smarmy contempt that you may think : Who is this -- the second coming of Andy Kaufman 's Tony Clifton ? A reincarnation of the last days of Lenny Bruce ?

By trashing what he 's done before , Phoenix thinks he 's not just another lowly entertainer on puppet strings but a pure artist who does n't give a damn about celebrity . -LRB- Even though his celebrity is the only reason anyone would begin to pay attention to his rap career . -RRB-

He 's become the kind of convoluted narcissist who flogs his sincerity until it becomes a twisted form of phoniness .

That bedraggled desire to declare himself above and apart from everyone else is the defining feature of what now passes for Joaquin Phoenix 's `` conversation . ''

Some of the movie is funny in a hungover , `` Entourage '' - meets-Christopher Guest sort of way .

When Ben Stiller shows up , with the script of Greenberg in hand , to offer Joaquin a role in the movie , Phoenix is so blurry and out-of-it that it 's clear he has never even looked at the script and has absolutely no idea which role he 's being pitched . He assumes that Stiller wants him to play Greenberg -- which only caps how annoyed Stiller is to be wasting his time with this bum .

That Phoenix 's handlers -- and Casey Affleck -- enable his behavior by never attempting an intervention amounts to an ethical lapse .

Yet the film 's unflinching honesty is , in the end , its own justification . Affleck uses Phoenix 's descent to forge a riveting -- and , in its way , cautionary -- case study of a celebrity self-destructively addicted to his own psychodrama .

Phoenix may say that he 's left acting behind , but whether he 's trolling the Internet for hookers , trying -LRB- hilariously -RRB- to convince Diddy to produce his rap album , getting huffy with an entertainment journalist at a junket for Two Lovers , or lashing out at fame while still enjoying all of its perks , the movie understands that his Last Honest Man in Showbiz routine is really a performance -- even if it 's one the actor himself is only dimly aware of .

The real hoax is the one that Phoenix has perpetrated on himself . It 's the illusion -LRB- to quote one of his bad hip-hop songs -RRB- that he 's a `` compli-f -- in ' - cated '' rebel rather than just another vain burnout who needs help .
