The assembly voted 93 to 43 Monday night to place a temporary moratorium on hydraulic fracturing , so the state can investigate the safety and environmental concerns . The state Senate passed a similar bill in August .

The moratorium -- which would only be in effect until May -- seeks to halt new drilling permits for horizontal hydraulic fracturing , dubbed `` fracking , '' a controversial method of extracting natural gas .

The drilling process has come under scrutiny because of the potential effects on drinking water , public health and the environment .

Can shale gas be produced safely ?

If signed into law , New York would be the first state to impose a fracking moratorium , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .

The proposed moratorium in New York was described as `` misguided '' by Kathryn Klaber , who represents a large natural gas industry coalition in the northeast United States .

Using hydraulic fracturing , drillers pump large amounts of water mixed with sand and chemicals into the shale formation thousands of feet underground under high pressure . Fracturing the shale around the gas well then allows the natural gas to flow freely .

The process has raised concerns about whether those chemicals are contaminating the underground water . Some residents near hydraulic fracturing drill sites along the Delaware River Basin -- located in Delaware , New Jersey , New York , and Pennsylvania -- have been able to set their water on fire .

Several residents in rural Pennsylvania have filed a lawsuit against Cabot Oil & Gas , blaming the company for the contamination .

The company has said the hydraulic fracturing process is `` proven and safe , '' citing a 2004 hydraulic fracturing study by the EPA that concluded the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids `` poses minimal threat '' to underground sources of drinking water .

New York City gets roughly half of its water from the Delaware River Basin , which was recently named the country 's most endangered river because of the threat of natural gas .

Last month , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called for a cautious approach to the drilling .

`` The City has invested more than $ 1.5 billion in watershed protection programs that have resulted in improved water quality throughout our watershed , as well as to our releases downstream , which benefit all members of the Commission , and the 15 million people who rely on the Delaware River watershed for clean drinking water , '' Bloomberg wrote .

Over the past few years , technological advances and increased profit margins have spurred increased use of hydraulic fracturing , according to the EPA . The U.S. Department of Energy estimates shale gas will make up more than 20 percent of the nation 's total natural gas supply by 2020 .

Currently , most natural gas is burned to produce electricity or heat and cool buildings . When burned , it emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal .

For that reason , most of the country 's big environmental groups are cautiously supportive of increased shale gas development .
