-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bad weather forced NASA to delay the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery by at least a day Thursday .

The latest launch attempt had been set for Thursday afternoon .

Before that , it was expected to blast off Monday , but Discovery was delayed to repair helium and nitrogen leaks in its system .

A planned Tuesday liftoff was canceled so engineers could fix a glitch to a backup system that controls a main engine .

With 38 voyages to date , Discovery has flown more missions than any other orbiter in the fleet .

Discovery flew the first female shuttle pilot , the first African-American spacewalker and the first sitting member of Congress to go to space .
