Wilmington , Delaware -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A parking lot attendant in Wilmington described a strange encounter with a former Pentagon official , just two days before his body was discovered in a Delaware landfill .

'' ` I 'm not drunk , I 'm not drunk , ' '' Goldsborough quoted Wheeler as saying .

Two days later , police say , Wheeler 's body was found in Wilmington 's Cherry Island Landfill . Goldsborough said when she saw the news reports about his death , she recognized him as the man she had spoken with that night .

A man whom police identified as Wheeler was recorded by security cameras in an office building in downtown Wilmington as late as 8:30 p.m. December 30 , the day before his body was discovered , according to a police statement Wednesday .

He appeared confused , the statement said .

The man had been approached earlier that day by several people who police say had offered him assistance , which the man declined , according to the statement .

Pharmacist Murali Gouro , who had filled prescriptions for Wheeler in the past , said he offered to call a taxi , which the former Pentagon official declined , the website reported .

Gouro told CNN the report was accurate but would not confirm the details of his alleged encounter .

`` If we can find the location where this happened -- that will lead us hopefully to the killer , '' said Newark Police Lt. Mark Farrall .

He said police are also working with Amtrak officials in an effort to determine whether Wheeler had been on a train from Washington to Wilmington that he had been scheduled to take near the time of the death .

`` We are cooperating fully with the Newark Police Department regarding our surveillance tapes of our Dumpster , '' said Mike Childers , a manager at Newark Toyota . `` Beyond that , I can not go any further . ''

Wheeler 's vehicle has turned up in a different parking garage near Wilmington 's Amtrak station , Farrall said .

Wheeler worked in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan , George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush . He served as a special assistant to the secretary of the Air Force from 2005 to 2008 .

While in the Army , he served as a staff officer in Vietnam and later as head of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund .

Wheeler also worked as a part-time consultant for the MITRE Corporation , a not-for-profit organization that provides systems engineering , research and development and information technology support to the federal government .

He had been been working on promoting discussions about cyberdefense between governments , industry and academia , according to a company statement .

`` At this time our thoughts are with his family , '' said spokesman Jennifer Shearman in the statement .

`` It is only fitting that we pause now and remember Jack Wheeler , who served his country honorably , then dedicated himself to ensuring that our nation 's service members are always given the respect they deserve , '' said Jan Scruggs , president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund .

What Wheeler `` cared about was civic values and civic virtue , '' wrote James Fallows , national correspondent for The Atlantic magazine and a longtime friend .

`` He was a complicated man of very intense -LRB- and sometimes changeable -RRB- friendships , passions , and causes . ... I feel terrible for his family and hope they will eventually find comfort in knowing how many important things he achieved . ''
