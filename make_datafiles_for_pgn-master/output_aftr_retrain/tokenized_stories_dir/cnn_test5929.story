-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serie A champions Inter Milan have completed the signing of striker Goran Pandev on a deal until 2014 .

Pandev was a free agent after winning his legal battle against Lazio to be released from his contract .

The Macedonia international has penned a four-and-a-half-year deal and is excited about linking up with Jose Mourinho 's side .

`` I hope to contribute a lot , but it is especially important to win , then who gets the goals is a side issue . ''

Lazio were ordered to release Pandev from his contract by the Lega Calcio just before Christmas . He had been at Lazio since 2004 and quickly became a fans ' favourite at the Stadio Olimpico .

However , matters turned sour last summer when Lazio revealed they would not accept a bid of less than 19 million euros for Pandev after he filed a transfer request .

He was linked with several clubs across Europe , including Liverpool , but opted to remain in Italy .
