-LRB- CNN -RRB- Abu Mohamad just wanted to sell some pizza .

An electrician-turned-entrepreneur , he knew his upstart pizza parlor needed a kick . So Abu Mohamad came up with the idea of using bikes to bring his customers their margarita , za'atar and mince pies .

`` We had to adapt , '' he said .

The camp began in July 2012 as a small patch of tents for scared and worn Syrians . As the refugees ' numbers grew , their perspectives changed . The civil war in their homeland was n't going away anytime soon , and neither were they .

So these resilient Syrians went to work . For men like Abu Mohamad , who , like other refugees , prefers not to be identified by his full name , there was n't much choice but to adjust to their new lives , new livelihoods and new ways of doing things .

`` I could n't sit and wait for the situation to change , '' said Abu Mohamad . `` We always want more for our families . ''

They 've gotten it . Abu Mohamad 's business is booming , with up to 50 deliveries a day to humanitarian workers , government officials and fellow refugees .

Syria 's civil war has been raging since 2011 , when a government crackdown on protests in Daraa spiraled into a full-blown armed conflict .

The war has also produced 3.3 million refugees , most of whom ended up in camps in Turkey , Lebanon , Iraq and Jordan .

At least in Zaatari -- which , within its packed 1.3 square miles , is already one of the world 's largest refugee camps and ranks as Jordan 's fourth largest city , according to the United Nations -- refugees have taken matters into their own hands by transforming their new home .

No , not the iconic boulevard in Paris , though the common name is a nod to that street and a reflection of Syrians ' sense of humor . That 's also the name of the Zaatari camp 's now vibrant main drag .

And any economic activity is a plus for the Syrian refugees , two-thirds of whom live below the national poverty line and one in six who live in abject poverty , according to the United Nations .

That 's why Syrians like Abu Mohamad and humanitarian officials like Touaibia are pleased with what 's happening in Zataari . While its residents ' lives have been far from happy or normal of late , the refugee camp -- more and more -- is becoming just that .

As Touaibia said , `` It is like any downtown , in any city , in the world . ''
