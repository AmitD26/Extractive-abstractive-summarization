San Francisco -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barry Bonds ' personal trainer refused to testify against the baseball home run king in his perjury trial Tuesday , prompting the judge to order the trainer held in custody until he changes his mind .

Anderson , flanked by lawyer Mark Geragos , told the judge he would not testify ,

`` It 's very important that you testify so that the whole truth can some out in this trial , '' U.S. District Judge Susan Illston told Anderson , as she found him in civil contempt .

Geragos said he would immediately appeal the judge 's decision to send Anderson to jail on the grounds that he was not given a fair hearing .

Anderson has already served several months in prison for previously refusing to testify against Bonds before grand juries in 2006 . He also was sentenced to three months in prison after pleading guilty in 2005 to illegally possessing anabolic steroids with the intent to distribute .

`` He does n't trust the prosecution , '' Geragos said of Anderson . `` He will never cooperate with these guys . ''

Prosecutors will try to convince a jury of eight women and four men that Bonds knew his trainer was giving him illegal steroids and that he lied about it to a grand jury in December 2003 .

The witness list includes Bonds ' ex-girlfriend Kimberly Bell , who will testify that Bonds told her he was taking steroids prior to the 2000 Major League Baseball season , according to the prosecution .

`` Ms. Bell will further testify to personal observations regarding changes in the defendant 's body during the period of time beginning in the year 1999 , including bloating , acne on the shoulders and back , hair loss , sexual dysfunction , and testicular shrinkage , '' the prosecution 's description of its witnesses said . `` She will also testify about changes in the defendant 's temperament , including an increase in angry , threatening , controlling , and violent behavior . ''

Ruby , in his opening statement , attacked the former friends who are expected to be called as key prosecution witnesses .

These witnesses `` cooperated with the media as anonymous sources on many of the poisonous things about Barry , '' he said . `` They have tried to create a caricature of Barry Bonds , a terrible guy , always bad , mean and so on . ''

A former IRS agent who fished through the trash at BALCO every week for a year testified Tuesday afternoon that a magazine clipping he found in the garbage bin led him to Barry Bonds as a witness in his investigation .

Bonds holds the major league record for home runs with 762 in his 21-year career . He also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001 when he hit 73 balls out of the park .

Bonds did not officially retire after he was indicted , but he never played another game .
