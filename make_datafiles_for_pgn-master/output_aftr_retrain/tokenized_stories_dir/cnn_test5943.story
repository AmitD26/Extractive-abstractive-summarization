Oranjestad , Aruba -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aruban prosecutors plan to release Tuesday the results of tests conducted on a jawbone found on an island beach and disclose whether it belongs to missing U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway , officials said .

Aruba Solicitor General Taco Stein said prosecutors will issue a statement Tuesday with the test results .

Tim Miller , director of Texas EquuSearch -- a search-and-rescue organization that has looked for Natalee Holloway -- said the girl 's father believes it is his daughter 's bone .

The prosecutor said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in Aruba , who determined it was from a young woman . But Blanken cautioned the final determination would be made by the forensic institute .

Also on Monday , police collected a second bone that was found earlier this month on the beach by a New Jersey family , said Ana Angela , spokeswoman for Aruban prosecutors . However , `` it does not appear to be human , '' said Richard Roy , general manager of the Westin Hotel .

The bone was found in the same general area as the first . The family , who was staying at the Westin , put it on their hotel balcony . They told CNN that once they returned home and heard media reports on the jawbone , they called the FBI and then contacted the Westin . Staffers at the hotel found the bone on the balcony and notified police .

Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30 , 2005 , leaving an Oranjestad nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men . She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham , Alabama .

Van der Slootwasdetained twice in connection with Holloway 's disappearance but never charged . He is now awaiting trial in Lima , Peru , on a murder charge in the death of Peruvian student Stephany Flores . Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot . A surveillance camera captured images of the two entering the room .

Van der Sloot , 23 , is also charged with wire fraud and extortion in Alabama for allegedly attempting to extort more than $ 250,000 from Holloway 's family in return for disclosing the location of her body .
