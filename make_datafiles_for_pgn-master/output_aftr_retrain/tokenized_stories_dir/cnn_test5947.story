Witnesses said police came in with dozens of vehicles , surrounded the roundabout and began firing `` pellet bullets , '' rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators .

The area had become a magnet for pro-democracy activists , angered by the killing of two demonstrators by security forces earlier this week .

Most of the casualties have being sent to Salamaniya hospital , according to an operator at Manama 's other main hospital , Bahrain International .

CNN 's Nic Robertson was there at the hospital . He reported that a large group of `` very angry '' people had gathered , along with distraught family members looking for loved ones . Robertson said demonstrators he 'd spoken to were outraged by the way they 'd been treated by security forces .

Inside the hospital 's emergency treatment room , the scene was one of `` complete , uncontrolled chaos , '' according to Robertson . He described injured people struggling to survive and medical personnel working frantically to save them . He saw serious head traumas , bloody wounds in the head and chest , and people hooked up to breathing apparatuses . Robertson told CNN that all the indications pointed to a very bloody confrontation on the part of police .

During the crackdown in Pearl Roundabout , an ABC reporter was attacked while he was on the phone , describing the scene for the network . In the midst of his report , Miguel Marquez could suddenly be heard shouting on the audiotape , `` Journalist ! Journalist ! No ! No ! '' Heavy thuds and the sounds of police yelling could also be heard .

After several minutes , Marquez insisted repeatedly `` I 'm going ! I 'm going ! '' and called out for co-workers . Finally , he returned to the audio line and told what had just happened . His voice broke as he said , `` These people are not screwing around . ''

`` We were sleeping , '' he said . `` There were guys , kids , schoolchildren , women , and suddenly they just attacked us with tear gas , stun bombs . ''

Hussein said many people were wounded in the attack , and he helped take people to hospitals . Police were outside the hospitals as well , he said .

Ebrahim Sharif , secretary-general of the opposition National Democratic Action Society , said he saw ambulances taking people to hospitals but that police were blocking people from going in that direction .

`` The whole area here has been surrounded , '' he told CNN by telephone . `` There are probably 500 to 1,000 policemen . ''

Dozens of large police vehicles lined a highway overlooking the roundabout and helicopters buzzed the area . Police were also taking up positions to create a perimeter as much as a mile around the roundabout , preventing people from returning .

An hour after police moved in , the square , where thousands of people had been , was largely empty except for police . It was not immediately clear where the protesters had gone , but police activity indicated they were still involved in moving the demonstrators further from the roundabout .

On Wednesday , Bahrain 's Interior Ministry had said those involved in two deaths during previous protests had been placed in custody .

`` We express our regret over those who died or were injured in the latest incidents and extend our sincere condolences to their families and to the people of Bahrain , '' according to a statement on the ministry 's website .

King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa had vowed Tuesday that his government would investigate the killings of the two protesters by security forces .

The Interior Ministry said in its statement that '' ... our constitution and laws guarantee the freedom of expression through peaceful means '' and that `` citizens can ask for rights and reforms through available legitimate channels . ''

Bahrain is among the latest Arab states to face a surge of dissent following the revolts that toppled longtime autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt .

`` It 's a very relaxed atmosphere , '' Mansoor Al-Jamri , editor of the newspaper Al Wasat , had told CNN . `` You 'd assume it was a picnic area if you did n't know it was the aftermath of people who died . ''

Activists have decried the use of pellet guns at short range by Bahrain 's security forces . Amnesty International called the deaths `` tragic '' and `` a very worrying development . '' In a recent report , the group said Bahraini authorities detained 23 opposition political activists in August and September , and held them without contact for two weeks , `` during which some allege they were tortured . ''

Bahrain is an American ally and houses the headquarters of the U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet . In Washington , the State Department said Tuesday it was `` very concerned '' by the violence and said it welcomed the promise of an investigation .
