In March , international figures , including U.N. data , put the death toll in Darfur at 200,000 , with another 2.5 million people displaced .

But 300,000 are believed to have died in the tribal conflict in the past two years , said John Holmes , who also is the United Nations emergency relief coordinator .

`` I am sad to say that the humanitarian situation remains as grim today as it was then , if not more so , '' he said .

In 2008 , 100,000 civilians have fled their homes , many not for the first time .

`` Darfur today is still characterized by insecurity , lawlessness and impunity , '' he said . `` A particularly worrying feature is evidence of high levels of sexual violence and exploitation in the northern corridor of west Darfur over the past two months . ''

This is shown by the increased number of women and girls seeking treatment after sexual brutality , Holmes said .

The World Food Programme announced last week that it will have to cut back its food distributions in May , partly because of attacks on convoys that reduced the amount of supplies they can get through , Holmes said .

Six aid workers have been killed this year , and 42 humanitarian posts have been attacked .

The supply line also is hurt by soaring food prices : The price of staples such as millet has doubled since April 2007 , Holmes said .

He said he was `` saddened and angry '' that after five years , there has been no lasting solution to the suffering .

He made several recommendations to the government , including disbanding the Janjaweed , providing security for citizens , ending impunity for criminals and shouldering more of the financial burden for humanitarian aid .

Holmes also said rebels must stop their attacks against people and humanitarian convoys . E-mail to a friend
