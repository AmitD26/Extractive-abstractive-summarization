The AQAP `` eulogy '' states that while the United States killed al-Awlaki , it `` can not kill his ideas , '' according to an English translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group , which monitors jihadi forums .

The message said the United States killed al-Awlaki and Khan but `` did not prove the accusation against them , and did not present evidence against them . '' The statement claims such actions go against the values the U.S. espouses .

The New York Times reported Sunday that the Justice Department prepared legal guidance in the summer of 2010 which said the United States could kill al-Awlaki if it was not possible to capture him .

U.S. officials say he recruited Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab , the Nigerian man known as the underwear bomber , who was charged with trying to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight as it landed in Detroit on December 25 , 2009 .

The militant cleric is also said to have exchanged e-mails with accused Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan , who is accused of killing a dozen fellow soldiers in Texas .
