Candace Bushnell attends a fashion show during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in September .

Although all of her characters are fictional , Bushnell said each one is based on a common type of person .

`` I 've always been interested in people . It 's part of being a novelist , really , part of the job , '' she said . `` As a writer you can never know a real person as well as you know your characters . '' Watch Bushnell talk about her new book ''

Bushnell said a minor character or two often will appear in several of her books . Other characters she develops in her head for years before releasing them on the literary scene .

For instance , she kept one fictional character , Schiffer Diamond , under wraps for 20 years , never seeing a place where she fit in -- until `` One Fifth Avenue . ''

`` One Fifth Avenue '' touches on art and antiquities theft , crosses back into the world of blogging and zips over to the stock market in less than 400 pages .

Though the book is just out in stores , it was written months ago . So how did the author -- who 's been celebrated in the past for her ahead-of-the-curve approach to trends -- know the economy would be such a central focus of her readers ' current lives ?

`` I keep my eyes open , '' she said with a smile .
