-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As President Barack Obama was about to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday , his prospective Republican challengers were busy laying the groundwork for their efforts to challenge the incumbent .

Three of the four Republican candidates held events in Florida on Tuesday , a week before the state 's crucial primary .

While focusing criticism on Obama to try to dim the president 's limelight , the candidates also managed to get in some shots at each other in the aftermath of a spirited debate Monday night .

Romney spoke at an abandoned factory , in front of an American flag and a banner that read , `` Obama is n't working . '' He later spoke in front of a foreclosed Florida home to emphasize the economic hardships facing many Americans .

`` Today , too many factory floors are silent , warehouses are deserted , corporate offices are empty and real estate endeavors are abandoned , '' Romney said . `` Floridians are struggling to find a job , keep a home and raise a family . This is the real state of our union , but you wo n't hear stories like those at President Obama 's address tonight . The unemployed do n't get tickets to sit next to the first lady . ''

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , whose poll numbers have surged in the wake of his primary victory on Saturday in South Carolina , said at an event in St. Petersburg that change must occur at the White House , in Congress and in the bureaucracy of Washington .

`` It 's bigger than Obama , '' Gingrich said . `` While he 's the start , there 's much more to getting this country back on track than Obama . ''

`` By the time President Obama lands in Chicago , we will have dismantled about 40 % of his administration , '' Gingrich said to cheers .

A different candidate has won each of the first three nominating contests so far , but Romney 's strong organization and war chest are considered an advantage as the primary process proceeds .

Still , Gingrich 's campaign finances were improving : A super PAC backing Gingrich , Winning Our Future , bought $ 6 million in ads in Florida , a spokesman for the group , Rick Tyler , told CNN .

Also Tuesday , Romney 's 2010 tax return and an estimate of his tax liability for 2011 underwent scrutiny .

The documents reveal he made $ 42.7 million over the past two years and paid $ 6.2 million in taxes , with an effective federal income tax rate of just under 14 % .

`` When you see my tax return , you will note that I do not have the riches of others in this race , '' said Santorum , who is vying with Gingrich to become the favored conservative candidate of the primary campaign against the more moderate Romney .

Santorum preemptively criticized Obama 's speech by blaming the president for increasing the size of the government , increasing deficits and debt , and seeing the U.S. credit rating downgraded on his watch .

Santorum , citing Obama 's legislation on health care and Wall Street , called him `` the worst president this country has ever seen . ''

`` You are going to hear a bunch of flowery rhetoric and all this stuff about all the things he has done , '' Santorum said . `` But what he has done -- he has grown the tax burden on the American public through Obamacare , through Dodd-Frank and through other bills . ''

`` Income inequality is going to happen , some people are going to make more , some people are going to make less , '' Santorum said . `` People ask me , ` What do you think about Mitt Romney , you know , making a gazillion dollars last year ? ' Good for him , that 's what I say , good for him . I wish I 'd made some gazillion dollars last year . I 'd be in a little better shape financing my own campaign like he 's done . Good for him , that 's OK . The problem is , and this is something Republicans and conservatives need to be concerned about , is the ability of people to rise . The ability of people to climb the ladder . ''

Pelosi needed no polls in making her prediction about the outcome of the race . `` He 's not going to be president of the United States , '' she said . `` That 's not going to happen . ''

According to the state , at least 53,000 ballots had been cast in early voting that started on Saturday . Of the 475,000 people who requested and were sent absentee ballots , 180,000 had been filled out and sent back by last Wednesday .

Those absentee votes came in before Gingrich rose in the polls and won South Carolina 's primary by a double-digit margin . In 2008 , nearly 1.95 million people voted in Florida 's GOP primary .

The national poll showed Romney at 29 % and Gingrich at 28 % . After the New Hampshire primary this month , Romney was at 37 % and Gingrich at 14 % in the same poll .

Monday 's poll results showed Paul at 13 % and Santorum at 11 % . The sampling error was plus-or-minus 3 points .
