Beverly Hills police said Sunday the teen was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at about 11:15 a.m. . She was released later Sunday and was expected to head to New Jersey , where her grandmother lives , as early as Sunday night , a source close to the family told CNN .

Singer Kim Burrell , a family friend , told CNN on Sunday afternoon from the Grammy Awards ' red carpet that she was with the teenager on Saturday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel after Houston died . This was a few hours after Burrell said she 'd exchanged messages with her close friend , Houston , after she arrived in Los Angeles for the festivities .

`` As to be expected , she 's overwhelmed -- it 's her mother . She knows how much her mother meant to the world . And Bobbi Kristina has a huge heart , just like her mother , '' said Burrell , adding that that Bobbi Kristina affectionately refers to her as `` Auntie Kim . ''

`` She loves hard , '' Burrell said of Bobbi Kristina . `` She 's going to be OK , and we 're going to see to it . ''

Bobbi Kristina Brown was born in 1993 , during Houston 's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown , which ended in divorce in 2007 .

The daughter of music royalty became publicly known during the mid-2000s reality show `` Being Bobby Brown , '' where she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks .

Houston once said of her only child , `` She encourages me and inspires me . When I look at her eyes and I see myself , I go , ` Okay . I can do this . I can do this . ' ''

Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009 , when the two sang `` My Love Is Your Love '' in Central Park on ABC 's `` Good Morning America . ''

Bobbi Kristina Brown proved she could do it on her own when she posted a video on Twitter of herself singing Adele 's `` Someone Like You '' last September . So far the video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube .

On Sunday afternoon , the mom and daughter were paying their last respects to Houston outside the Beverly Hilton Hotel , where the 48-year-old singer died the day before . The parent and child came to the hotel to add a light-pink rose to a growing sidewalk memorial of flowers and candles created by fans .
