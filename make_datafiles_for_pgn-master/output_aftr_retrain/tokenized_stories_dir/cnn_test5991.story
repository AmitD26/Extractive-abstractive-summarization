The defense and prosecution have rested in the murder trial of George Huguely , which is expected to resume on Wednesday .

`` Yes , George contributed to her death . But no , he did n't kill her ... he left there with her alive , and that is not in dispute . There was no intentional killing , because she was n't dead when he left , '' defense attorney Francis Lawrence said during his closing statement . `` There 's no intent to rob , and no intent to kill . ''

Huguely faces six charges , including robbery and first-degree murder in the May 2010 death of Yeardley Love , a 22-year-old senior who was also a lacrosse player . On Saturday , the defendant officially waived his right to testify .

Lawrence described his client as `` stupid , drunk -- but not calculating . '' The defense has said Love 's death was an accident .

Police were initially called to Love 's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported `` a possible alcohol overdose , '' Police Chief Tim Longo said at the time .

`` When somebody 's little girl does n't wake up the next day , and there 's no reason why they should n't ... I ask you to do no more , and no less , than to hold him responsible for what he did , '' said Charlottesville Commonwealth 's Attorney Warner D. Chapman .

At several points during his closing statement , Love 's mother and sister cried . Twice , it appeared Chapman was also crying , or chocking back tears .

After closing arguments , the judge had hoped to give the case to jurors , but they felt they were too tired to continue . The trial will resume Wednesday morning and deliberations are expected to begin shortly thereafter .

The defendant wrote , `` I should have killed you , '' and Love responded , `` You should have killed me ? '' according to Chapman . Huguely responded that the pair should talk , Chapman said .

The prosecutor also told jurors that Love 's death was slow and painful , claiming she could have remained alive for a couple of hours after Huguely left her apartment . The defense agrees Love was alive when Huguely left .

Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that `` George Huguely admitted on May 3 , 2010 , that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and , during the course of the altercation , he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall .
