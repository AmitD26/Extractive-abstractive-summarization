`` Today , thanks to the sovereign decision of the Dominican people , I am the president of all Dominicans , '' Medina wrote .

He led with 51 % of the vote , with 99 % of votes counted in the election authority 's preliminary tally of Sunday 's election results .

In an interview with CNN en EspaÃ ± ol on Monday , Medina vowed to address drug trafficking , education and incomes in a country where more than one-third of the population lives in poverty .

`` I want to build a middle-class society . That is my main goal -- to have a population that is able to go shopping , to have the capacity to consume , '' he said .

The election is a rematch of the nation 's 2000 presidential contest , where Mejia defeated Medina . Since the end of Mejia 's term in 2004 , the presidency has been held by Leonel Fernandez , of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party , the same party that Medina belongs to .

Some see the candidates as similar in some respects , but passions nonetheless on both sides are strong .

The boisterous campaigns stretched from the island to New York , where there is a large population of Dominicans .

Ahead of Sunday 's vote , some 200 foreign electoral observers were in the country , and 60,000 police and troops were deployed for security .

`` The big difference , obviously , is that one of these candidates was already president and showed us who he was , and the other candidate has certainly been close to the government , but has never held the executive position and is known as a very qualified official , '' said Javier Cabreja , president of the civic group Citizens ' Participation .

Medina , 60 , was elected to four-year terms as a lawmaker in 1986 , 1990 and 1994 . He also served as president of the country 's House of Representatives . He twice served as secretary of state .
