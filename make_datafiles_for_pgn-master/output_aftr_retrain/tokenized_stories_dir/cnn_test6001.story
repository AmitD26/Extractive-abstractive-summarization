Johannesburg -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Three of four minors accused of taking part in a brutal videotaped gang rape of a teenager will face full prosecution , a spokesman for a South African court said Wednesday .

A bail hearing will be held May 3 for the minors and June 20 for the adults , said the spokesman , Mthunzi Mhaga .

It is unlikely that the suspects , accused of a crime that has shocked many in South Africa , will be granted bail , officials have said .

An eighth suspect -- a man who was found with the victim -- is scheduled to appear in court on May 4 , court officials said .

The images of the assault of the 17-year-old girl , believed to be mentally ill , swept across the Internet last week and touched a nerve in South Africa .

The girl went missing on March 21 . Police suspect she was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave .

The Daily Sun , a local tabloid , alerted police about the attack after a concerned mother whose daughter was watching the video handed it over to the newspaper .

Police embarked on a search for the girl and the people in the video .

More than 60,000 cases of sexual assault were reported in the year to March 2011 , down from 70,000 in 2008 , police said .

Women 's rights activist Lisa Vetten says in the province of Gauteng , where Johannesburg is located , one in every five rapes is a gang rape .

`` Rape is a young man 's crime , '' she said . `` It 's a bit of a performance for them , showing off to each other how macho they are . We need to teach our young men that you can be masculine in ways that do not involve violence and degrading women . ''

The mother of the 17-year-old has said this was not the first time her daughter has been raped .
