El Khalifi came to the courtroom wearing a jail jumpsuit with the word `` prisoner '' stenciled on the back . He was not in restraints .

El Khalifi was arrested February 17 as the result of an FBI sting operation .

According to a statement of facts signed by El Khalifi , he accepted what he thought was a suicide vest containing explosives and a MAC-10 automatic gun . He put on the vest and was quickly taken into custody as he attempted to leave a parking garage and walk toward the Capitol building .

`` Unbeknownst to El Khalifi , both the weapon and the bomb had been rendered inoperable by law enforcement , '' according to court documents . El Khalifi told an undercover FBI agent and another man assisting law enforcement agents that he intended to use the MAC-10 to `` shoot people before detonating the bomb . ''

El Khalifi thought he was working with al Qaeda , but a man referred to in court documents as `` Yusuf '' was an undercover agent . U.S. officials said El Khalifi had been closely monitored , and the public was never in danger . The U.S. officials also said he was not connected to terrorists and was working alone .

El Khalifi admitted performing surveillance at the Capitol and asking an associate named Hussien who was secretly assisting law enforcement to remotely detonate the bomb if El Khalifi ran into problems with security officers .

`` He absolutely was the real deal , '' U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said after the court hearing . MacBride said El Khalifi chose his targets and weapons , thought he was a working with al Qaeda and wanted to carry out `` the first-ever suicide attack in the U.S. ''

FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Bryan Paarmann said El Khalifi is another yet another homegrown extremist , although he did not offer a theory on why he became radicalized . According to Paarmann , El Khalifi `` had the intent , the disposition and the desire '' to commit acts of violence .
