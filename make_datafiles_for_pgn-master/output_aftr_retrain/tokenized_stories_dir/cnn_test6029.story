Las Vegas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mirna Castaneda pays close attention to the instructor showing her the best way to make a bed .

It 's not as if Castaneda does n't know how to make a bed that a Las Vegas visitor can gleefully climb into after a day -- or night -- out on the town . She has already spent five years working at different hotels , but this training is required for her new job this time as a member of the Culinary Workers Union .

That makes all the difference in the world for people like Jazmin Rivera , 21 , who is hoping to land a job as a busboy . She says she has had a hard time finding a job since her employment as a census worker ended last year .

But for Castaneda and Rivera , their union membership could provide more than a steady job with benefits . They could be getting a political education , too .

`` We spend almost a full year before the election making sure all of our members are registered to vote , '' said Yvanna Cancela , the political director for the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 .

Cancela said the union also encourages and assists in navigating the citizenship process for members who qualify .

Both parties rolling the dice in Nevada

The process is now in the hands of a three-person panel appointed by a federal judge and charged with solving the stalemate .

Latinos are already making their mark in politics .

They are credited with saving the seat of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Democrat , in the midterm elections . They helped then-Sen . Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Nevada presidential primary .

Cuban-born Griselda Marino is one of those who caucused for President Obama .

`` It was very interesting to participate , especially for someone like me who came from another country and had different views of the political process , '' she said .

Marino said she hopes her example inspires people like Castaneda , who is more focused on getting health insurance for her family than thinking about who is running for office .

`` I keep politics on the side , '' Castaneda said .

Marino and the members of Local 226 will have a chance to flex their political muscle in January when Nevada holds one of the earlier caucuses in the presidential selection process . It could also be a preview of the role the Latino vote will have in November 2012 .
