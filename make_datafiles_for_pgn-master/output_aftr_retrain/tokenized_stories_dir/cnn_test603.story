Blame it on the baby bump and our pop cultural infatuation with celebrity , but today , regular women have yet another reason to feel inadequate : motherhood .

In the past decade , for the celebrity set , babies have become as fashionable as Birkin bags . The media has fueled the fertility frenzy by outing every pregnant , or potentially pregnant , Hollywood starlet . But then there 's more -- with every aspect of a celeb mom 's glamorized pregnancy reported , from excessive weight gain to dramatic post-partum weight loss , regular women are fed a distorted depiction of pregnancy .

Ironically , motherhood has never been so chic at a time when so many women are struggling to get pregnant . The number of women between age 40 and 44 who remain childless has doubled in a generation ; in 1976 it was one out of 10 , by 2006 it was one in five , according to the U.S. Census .

In Selvaratnam 's deeply personal and provocative book , she shares her own journey of three miscarriages , multiple IVF treatments , cancer and the ultimate toll it took on her marriage . She explores the impact of delayed motherhood and the bad information that women receive , not only from aspirational celebrity images , but also from their own doctors .

Forty may be the new 30 , but our ovaries have not gotten the same makeover . Even with all the advances in reproductive technology , our eggs have a finite shelf life and the odds of having a child over 40 years old are shockingly slim .

According to the Southern California Center for Reproductive Medicine , a woman in her 20s has a 20-25 % chance of conceiving naturally per menstrual cycle . In her early 30s , the chance of pregnancy is 15 % per cycle . After 35 , the odds of pregnancy without medical intervention are at 10 % . After 40 , that number falls to 5 % , and women over 45 have a 1 % chance of conception .

From the Pew report : `` Among older women , ages 40-44 , there are equal numbers of women who are childless by choice and those who would like children but can not have them , according to an analysis of data from the National Survey of Family Growth . ''

Perhaps one of the greatest myths today is the ability of science to step in and make babies for women at virtually any age . Selvaratnam says that we see the success stories , but rarely hear about the huge numbers of failed attempts . A 2009 report on Assisted Reproductive Technologies , or ARTs , by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the single most important factor affecting the chances of a successful pregnancy through ARTs is a woman 's age . Selvaratnam reports that at age 40 , the chance is 18.7 % ; at 42 , it 's 10 % ; at 44 , it 's only 2.9 % .

She also argues that feminism may have misled Gen X women by avoiding the topic of motherhood and biology . The trend of delaying motherhood was meant to empower women , but ironically it may have boomeranged , leaving scores of women infertile and desperate to have a baby . Selvaratnam believes that we need to reset the conversation and reconcile motherhood with also being an educated , independent , successful woman .

Like birth control , Selvaratnam suggests that information be promoted about fertility and the realities of delaying motherhood . She suggests that every young woman be shown a chart of her overall fertility so she understands when her eggs are best and when the number will start declining . She thinks that with the information , women can be more strategic about trying to get pregnant or at least not be blindsided if they have difficulties because they waited .

Ironically , in our uber-sharing age , infertility still remains shrouded in silence . Selvaratnam wants to de-stigmatize miscarriage and infertility and get people connected and talking .

`` When women have miscarriages or infertility we feel like failures . I want people to realize how common these issues are . When you see the statistics , it becomes clear you are not alone , '' Selvaratnam said . `` You look at celebs and think ` What 's wrong with me ? ' when it seems to work out for all of these other people . But the truth is , for most people , it does n't work out . ''

Selvaratnam is also hoping that her book will be a policy changer . She 's advocating for better health insurance to cover infertility treatments as well as better public education for women . Changing the paradigm for women in the workplace , increasing work-life flexibility and creating more affordable child care , she believes , is also intricately linked with supporting women so they can become mothers . Taking some time off from your career , or easily coming back to your job is a fundamental issue for easing the path for women to have a baby in their late 20s or early 30s -- the optimal time for fertility , but often a terrible time to interrupt careers .
