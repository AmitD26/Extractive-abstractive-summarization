New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The New York City Marathon -- scheduled for Sunday -- was canceled Friday amid burgeoning criticism as the area recovers from the devastation wrought by Superstorm Sandy , city and race officials said .

Mayor Michael Bloomberg had said earlier in the week the race would go on -- despite transportation , power and other issues -- contending , among other things , that businesses could use the economic boost the event provides .

`` We can not allow a controversy over an athletic event -- even one as meaningful as this -- to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track . ''

In the end , marathon did n't feel right

The announcement was widely applauded on social media with Twitter posts such as , `` Finally ... Marathon Cancelled ! After Days of Pressure , #Marathon Is Off . ''

`` It was clear that this was not going to be a celebration of New York . It was going to be a divisive , difficult day , '' Wolfson said . `` That 's not what anybody wanted . ''

`` We became concerned that ... no runner -- the best in the world or somebody hoping to finish -- was going to receive the welcome that we thought they 'd receive , '' Wittenberg said .

But Wittenberg said the decision was made to cancel this year 's race entirely , cognizant of the real-life strains on volunteers and that many participants had planned everything around a November 4 race date .

While there has been significant progress since Sandy , large swaths of the city remained without power Friday and public transit options remain limited .

First held in 1970 , the New York City Marathon attracts about 47,000 runners and 12,000 volunteers -- not to mention an estimated 2.5 million spectators who annually line the course , which goes through all five city boroughs .

The race had been scheduled to begin Sunday morning on Staten Island , where runners would have crossed the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into Brooklyn and run through Queens before crossing the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan and the Bronx .

But the 26.2-mile course does not include lower Manhattan , where heavy flooding left many neighborhoods in the dark .

CNN 's Eden Pontz , Chris Kokenes , Deborah Feyerick and Greg Botelho contributed to this report .
