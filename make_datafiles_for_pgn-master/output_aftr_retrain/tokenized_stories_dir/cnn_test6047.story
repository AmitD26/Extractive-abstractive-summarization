Amine El Khalifi made a brief appearance in federal court and waived his right to have a preliminary hearing and to contest his detention .

El Khalifi was arrested on Friday as the result of an FBI sting operation . According to a criminal complaint , El Khalifi accepted a MAC-10 automatic gun and what he thought was a suicide vest containing explosives . He was quickly taken into custody as he attempted to leave a parking garage wearing the vest and walk to the U.S. Capitol building , said the document .

U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said Friday that El Khalifi `` devised the plot , the targets and the methods on his own . ''

Threatening letters sent to congressional offices

El Khalifi , age 29 , came to the United States in June 1999 under a B2 visa , which allows visitors for tourism and medical treatment . But U.S. officials said his visa expired later the same year and he has been in the country illegally ever since .

The court document said that in January 2011 a confidential source reported to the FBI that El Khalifi met with people at a residence in Arlington , Virginia , where another individual brought out some weapons , including an AK-47 . `` El Khalifi expressed agreement with a statement by this individual that the ` war on terrorism ' was a ` war on Muslims , ' and said that the group needed to be ready for war , '' according to the affidavit .

A young man who would only give his last name as Mohamed attended Wednesday 's court hearing . Afterward he told reporters that he and El Khalifi often attended prayers at the same mosque . Mohamed said the extent of his relationship with El Khalifi was to exchange greetings with him , but he said El Khalifi stood out for having tattoos and sometimes sporting a Mohawk haircut , and because he sweated so much that he carried a towel around at the mosque .

U.S. officials said that El Khalifi was not entrapped . The affidavit prepared by an FBI agent said there are video and audio recordings that were taken during the course of the investigation , but the document does not discuss what is in those recordings .

In an e-mail , El Khalifi 's federal public defender , Kenneth Troccoli , said he would make no immediate comment .
