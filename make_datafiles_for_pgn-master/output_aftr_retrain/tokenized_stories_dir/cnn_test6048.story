Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan troops are surrounding the city of Bani Walid , awaiting orders to enter what had been a stronghold for late dictator Moammar Gadhafi as those inside appeal to the international community for help .

Massoud al-Waer , a local official , told CNN late Friday that Bani Walid was under siege with no food or fuel able to get in , nor even fresh oxygen for its main hospital .

The standoff -- and possible military offensive -- stems from the death of a Libyan revolutionary fighter from Misrata credited with capturing Gadhafi last year .

The chief of staff for Libya 's army issued a statement Thursday calling on the people of Bani Walid to cooperate by handing over the wanted individuals to avoid a military assault .

Yet many in Bani Walid remained defiant Friday , turning out in large numbers to protest the national government 's demands and call for the release of those from the city being held about 130 kilometers -LRB- 80 miles -RRB- to the northeast in Misrata , according to al-Waer .

Hundreds of Bani Walid residents have been arrested by armed militias , according to the human rights advocacy group Amnesty International . Many continue to be detained without being charged , or put in trial , across Libya , and have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated , Amnesty said .

Bani Walid was a holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists until the very end of the fighting late last year . And tensions between residents and fighters aligned with what was the National Transitional Council -- and later the fledgling Libyan government -- continued to simmer after the city 's fall .

A petition was being circulated Friday around the inland city , which is about 170 kilometers southeast of the capital , Tripoli , asked the U.N. Security Council to convene an emergency meeting and act `` to immediately intervene to protect the civilians in the town . ''

The petitioners claimed that pro-government `` armed militias '' were trying to indiscriminately kill large numbers of people in Bani Walid , because of the city 's history in support of Gadhafi . They report `` bombing on civil neighborhoods '' on October 1 `` with no regards to the lives of unarmed civilians . ''

Amnesty joined those calling for restraint Friday night . It issued a statement urging `` Libyan authorities to avoid unnecessary and excessive use of force in the city and to ensure essential medical supplies are allowed into the city . ''
