From around Aleppo in western Syria to small areas of Falluja in central Iraq , al Qaeda now controls territory that stretches more than 400 miles across the heart of the Middle East , according to English and Arab language news accounts as well as accounts on jihadist websites .

The focus of al Qaeda 's leaders has always been regime change in the Arab world in order to install Taliban-style regimes . Al Qaeda 's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri acknowledged as much in his 2001 autobiography , `` Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet , '' when he explained that the most important strategic goal of al Qaeda was to seize control of a state , or part of a state , somewhere in the Muslim world , explaining that , `` without achieving this goal our actions will mean nothing . ''

Now al-Zawahiri is closer to his goal than he has ever been . On Friday al-Qaeda 's affiliate in Iraq seized control of parts of the city of Falluja and parts of the city of Ramadi , both of which are located in Iraq 's restive Anbar Province .

Sectarian tensions in Anbar recently burst into several all-out revolts against the government , and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -LRB- ISIS -RRB- , as the al-Qaeda affiliate there is known , quickly seized the opportunity to notch some battlefield victories .

Government forces increased their presence around Falluja in response and on Tuesday tribal leaders issued a statement urging people who had fled the city or stopped reporting to work to return .

The group has also released videos on jihadist websites claiming that it is providing services to the people of several towns in the governorate of Idlib , which borders the Aleppo Governorate to the west . Al Nusra claims that it is a quasi-government and service-provider in the towns of Binnish , Taum , and Saraqib .

In September a CNN reporting team concluded , `` Al Qaeda has swept to power with the aim of imposing a strict Islamist ideology on Syrians across large swathes of Syria 's rebel-held north . ''

Al-Nusra is engaged in a protracted fight to maintain a foothold in the eastern city of Dayr al-Zur , where , as in Ash Shaddadi , the militants have their hands on an energy source , this time in the form of natural gas .

Similar videos released throughout the second half of 2013 depict al-Nusra fighters providing health care , legal services , electricity and food to civilians in the cities of Daraa , Homs , Hama , and even the suburbs of the capital Damascus , where the government still enjoys fairly secure authority .

The infighting amongst Syrian rebels is not good news for the fate of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , but it could prompt the United States to increase its shipments of arms and supplies to `` moderate '' Syrian rebels in the FSA . However , even an increase in U.S. aid to the rebels would be unlikely to sway the conflict significantly , which means al-Assad will remain in power and the war will continue as it has over the past three years .

Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that the United States will `` do everything that is possible to help '' the Iraqi government control al Qaeda 's expansion in Anbar , but stressed that no American troops would be sent back to the Middle Eastern nation .

Last month , the United States quietly sent Hellfire missiles and surveillance drones to the Iraqi government to support their fight against increasing al Qaeda-related violence .

For the United States the widening reach of al Qaeda in the Middle East does n't necessarily translate into an immediate threat at home . So far only a handful of Americans have fought in the Syrian conflict alongside al Qaeda 's affiliates there so concerns about some kind of `` blowback '' from the Syrian war in the U.S. are , at this point , unfounded ,

European countries are rightly concerned , however . Many European countries have seen their citizens drawn to the Syrian war ; more than a hundred from Britain and many dozens from countries like Norway , Denmark and the Netherlands , according to multiple European officials we have spoken to . These countries are concerned that the retuning veterans of the Syrian conflict might launch terrorist attacks in Europe .

In October for instance , British authorities arrested militants who were allegedly planning a terrorist attack . Two British officials who work on counterterrorism issues told us that that the militants had recently traveled to Syria .
