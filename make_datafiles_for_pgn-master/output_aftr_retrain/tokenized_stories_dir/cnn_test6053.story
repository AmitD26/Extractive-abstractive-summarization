-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A DNA link may signal a break in a 36-year-old investigation into the slaying of four children , the Oakland County , Michigan , prosecutor 's office announced Tuesday .

The so-called Oakland County Child Killer is believed to be responsible for the deaths of Mark Stebbins , 12 , Jill Robinson , 12 , Kristine Mihelich , 10 , and Timothy King , 11 , who were kidnapped and found dead between 1976 and 1977 .

Investigators were able to establish a mitochondrial DNA , or mtDNA , profile link between the hairs , establishing they came from the same person , essentially proving the two crimes were connected .

According to prosecutors , the testing revealed that the hairs recovered from the Bonneville had the same mtDNA profile as the hairs recovered from the boys ' bodies .

The owner of the car , 70-year-old Archibald `` Ed '' Sloan , is serving a life sentence for two counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree . Sloan was tested for a DNA match , but it was determined he did not share the same DNA profile : The hairs found on the boys and in the car were not his .

`` It is believed that Sloan would allow others to use his 1966 Bonneville , as well as the other described vehicles , so investigators are looking for information concerning any other people who may have used this car , or had access to any of these vehicles . Finding anyone like this who turns out to be the donor of the hair may be the key to solving these two murders , '' Cooper said .
