-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Williams have become the first of the 10 current Formula One teams to confirm their entry for the 2010 world championship .

With the deadline for entries closing on Friday , Williams have been forced to act , making it clear their position in no way undermines the unified efforts of the Formula One Teams ' Association in their ongoing debate with governing body FIA with regard to next year 's proposed rule changes .

On Sunday , the teams handed FIA chief Max Mosley a letter in Monaco demanding he scrap the 2010 rules , notably the budget cap and the prospect of a two-tier championship , in return for their commitment to the sport through to 2012 . That was despite the fact Mosley had earlier claimed that progress was being made in the on-going dispute .

`` We extended that for five years up until the end of 2012 . Bernie has honored his obligations to us under that agreement . We have been paid in full for our participation . We feel morally and legally obliged to honor our side of that contract .

`` Secondly , we are a Formula One team . We do n't do anything else . It is something we have been doing for 31 years . It is very important for our employees , sponsors and fans to know we will be in Formula One for next year and many years to come . ''

`` A lot of credit for that must go to -LRB- Ferrari president and FOTA chairman -RRB- Luca di Montezemolo , as well as the other teams for their support .

`` We want FOTA to continue their discussions with the FIA , who have made huge concessions , more than I thought possible . Max Mosley has been very conciliatory . But what we have here is a marriage . It 's too important for everyone for that to break up . ''

`` But the FIA is right in saying it is both necessary and opportune to create the opportunity for a number of new teams to come into the sport .

`` In that context we can not delay the entries . We are trying to be reasonable and find a sensible solution . ''
