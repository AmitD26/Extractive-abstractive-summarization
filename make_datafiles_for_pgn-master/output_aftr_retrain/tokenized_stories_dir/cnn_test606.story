First a meteor exploded over Russia , followed closely by an asteroid fly-by . Now , two comets are expected to put on a naked-eye spectacle for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere .

Up first is Comet Pan-STARRS , which gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in June 2001 : the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System in Hawaii .

The comet is already visible through telescopes in the Southern Hemisphere , and it should swing into view over the Northern Hemisphere beginning around March 8 .

It 's hard to predict exactly how bright Pan-STARRS will be , but you should be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes , said Don Yeomans of NASA 's Near-Earth Object Program . It should be about as bright as the stars in the Big Dipper .

`` There is a chance that it will be a little brighter than this , but likewise , it might not get quite that bright , '' said Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab .

Part of the brightness will depend on how close Pan-STARRS gets to the sun . Comets are made up of water , ice , dust and other elements and minerals , all loosely packed together , Battams said . As a comet gets closer to the sun , the sun 's heat causes these elements to melt , spewing out dust and gas in a brilliant tail .

`` About half an hour after sunset would be a good time for people take a look , '' he said .

Here are some key dates :

March 12 and 13 : The best dates to look for Pan-STARRS ; it should emerge in the western sunset sky not far from the crescent moon .

3 -RRB- Look carefully ! The sky will still be bright at dusk , which can make it hard to spot comets .

4 -RRB- If the skies are clear , and you are away from city light pollution , you may be able to see the comet with your bare eyes . If not , use binoculars .

Second chance to catch a comet

Some early comet prognosticators -- and reporters -- have tagged ISON `` the Comet of Century . '' But Yeomans is n't buying it just yet . He remembers being duped by another comet with that same moniker . In 1973 , Kohoutek was hyped , too , and it fizzled .

Battams is optimistic , but he said we wo n't know until late summer what to expect from ISON .

`` I 'll be surprised if we do n't have a bright comet this fall and/or winter , but it 's still just too early to speculate , '' he said .

So , like Pan-STARRS , ISON 's fate will be decided by the sun . It could burn brightly and earn that `` Comet of the Century '' title ; it could melt or it could just break apart .

Scientists say neither comet poses any threat to Earth , but if both comets hold together , sky watchers will get a rare treat : two comets , both bright enough to be seen with the naked eye , in one year .

Fingers crossed !
