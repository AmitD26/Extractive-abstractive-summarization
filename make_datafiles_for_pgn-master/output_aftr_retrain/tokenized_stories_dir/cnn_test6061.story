Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the eve of the inauguration , President Barack Obama 's second term may also be America 's second chance .

The country , in the last four years , has been battered by an economic earthquake while trying to reconcile a debt load threatening to cripple the next generation .

It has been pulled apart by political extremism and the inability to compromise in Washington . The people have been divided -- by demographic shifts , cultural battles and clashes between the rich and the poor , the haves and the have-nots .

So , days before the president 's second inaugural , the nation , too , is set to regroup . What it does differently this time around and the decisions the people make , experts say , will speak to the kind of America that emerges during the next four years .

Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company

Obama is perhaps more keenly aware of this than most .

Hope and hurdles

The 44th President was ushered into the Oval Office by a wave of seemingly limitless optimism and buoyed by the historic nature of his presidency as the first African American elected to the lead the free world .

His plan to reform the nation 's healthcare system further expanded political divides in Washington and helped lead to huge losses among his party 's moderates in the 2010 election .

The public saw hints of that assertiveness on Monday during a surprise news conference , where he lashed out at Republicans in Congress for playing politics with the debt ceiling .

From Obamacare to the economy to Sandy Hook

Over the next four years , the country will also get a chance to see whether the Affordable Care Act -- or `` Obamacare '' -- is a positive or negative step for the nation . In 2014 , many of the most controversial provisions , including requiring individuals to either participate in a health insurance program or pay a penalty , take effect .

`` We will see whether or not we have the strength within ourselves to figure out how we should deal with entitlement programs , '' Schmuhl said . `` In a way , it 's a period when the administration will be dealing with problems that are in process . ''

`` If the economy becomes more robust you will have no doubt he will point back and say see that 's what I was doing , '' said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and CNN contributor .

Reagan , Clinton faced similar issues

`` There was clearly a shift in the mood , '' Zelizer said . `` In both cases , the presidents were good at claiming credit for it . ''

Mood matters in the age of austerity

Everyday folks have learned to cut back and suck it up -- some after finding themselves underwater on mortgages they could not afford to pay ; others after losing jobs that their companies could no longer afford to keep .

`` Americans will be realistic , just as those in government need to be realistic , '' Schmuhl said of citizens ' likely approach to their own finances over the next four years .

But , as Obama enters his second term , both the housing and job markets have been on a slow and steady uptick . Housing sales were up 6 % in 2012 -- the biggest gain since 2005 , according to CoreLogic -- and the unemployment rate had dropped to 7.8 % in December , although there are still 4.8 million Americans -- or 39.1 % of the jobless -- classified as long-term unemployed , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .

Obama appeared to prevail on that skirmish , delivering on a promise to raise tax rates on wealthy Americans -- although he shifted his definition of `` wealthy '' from those making $ 250,000 or more to those making $ 400,000 and up .

Some 41 % of those polled disapproved of the deal , according to Pew , and 52 % thought the deal would hurt people like them . In the Gallup poll , 67 % - disapproved of congressional Republicans ' handled the negotiations while 55 % disapproved of how Democrats performed .

Still , partly due to deliberate redistricting to protect -- or create -- more partisan congressional districts , American voters continued to elect or re-elect safe representatives to do their bidding in Congress . For instance , most of the 435 members of the House of Representatives -- Republicans and Democrats -- faced little real opposition on Election Day in 2012 .

Other battlegrounds : Sequester , gun control , immigration

But the next battle looms . Just weeks after Obama takes his oath of office , a new Congress will be tasked with addressing the automatic spending cuts , or sequester , that were kicked down the road in order to pass a smaller deal at the end of the year .

The new Congress will also consider raising the nation 's debt ceiling , or the ability of the U.S. Treasury to borrow money to pay America 's bills . Most agree that defaulting on the nation 's obligations would be disastrous for America and the global economy , but some Republicans in Congress are starting to hint that they may be prepared to let that happen anyway if large spending cuts are not secured .

Immigration reform , another White House priority , will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress . For the first time , the House Democratic caucus is dominated by women and racial minorities , while the Republican caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men . In the Senate , 20 women -- the largest number in history -- currently hold office .

And that 's where the nation 's shift over the next four years may be most visible .

Reeling from the turmoil of the last four years , the country may be ready to regroup

President Obama , adopting a more assertive posture , will need to still persuade a divided country to get things done

The economy is improving , the nation 's demographics are shifting and a new America is emerging
