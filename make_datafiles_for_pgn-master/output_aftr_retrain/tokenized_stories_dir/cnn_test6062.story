Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend , as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity .

After sunset , the only light in one corner cafe came from two candles . Their flickering glow barely lit the faces of men seated at a handful of tables , where they were breaking their Ramadan fast .

Nearby , residents trudged down the center of empty streets enveloped in darkness . Some men played music from parked cars . Others sat silently in doorways , their presence only marked by the glow of a cigarette butt .

`` It 's a disaster . My father 's neighborhood has n't had electricity for five straight days , '' said one Libyan man who asked not to be named , for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities . He said he evacuated his entire family to Egypt and was staying behind to keep an eye on his property .

This week , a nightly talk show that fiercely supports Moammar Gadhafi on state television addressed the growing problem of the black-outs .

`` The Tripoli power cuts are caused by NATO and rebel attacks on power stations , '' announced a television presenter on Thursday .

Frustration could be felt at a recent government press conference , when a Libyan man repeatedly pressed Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on why some Tripoli neighborhoods had power while others suffered black-outs for days .

`` Surely a large country like Libya does n't depend on one power station , '' the Libyan man said .

In an e-mail to CNN , NATO military spokesman denied accusations that the alliance targeted Libyan electrical power lines .

`` One liter of petrol , 4 dinars ! '' a taxi driver yelled on Saturday , as he thumped a plastic jug full of fuel sitting in the back passenger seat of his car . That is roughly the equivalent of 13 dollars for a gallon of gasoline , a huge price surge in a country long accustomed to cheap , heavily subsidized fuel . Until anti-Gadhafi protests first erupted last February , Libya was a major oil-exporting country . Since then , oil exports have slowed to a trickle .

Hopes for a reprieve in the fuel shortages were dashed this week when the regime in Tripoli announced rebels somehow seized control of the fuel tanker ship Cartagena off the coast of Malta .

`` The age of piracy is coming back to the Mediterranean because of NATO , '' Kaim concluded .

According to the energy trade publication Petroleum Economist , the Cartagena was the property of the Libyan state-owned shipping company GNMTC .

`` The MV Cartagena was outside Maltese territorial waters , '' an official from the Maltese Foreign Ministry wrote to CNN in an e-mail , after being asked about allegations of the ship 's capture by rebels .

A NATO spokesman in Naples , Italy , wrote to CNN , `` On the afternoon of 3 August a NATO warship established visual and voice contact with the MT Cartagena and found the crew cooperative . NATO concluded that the ship could proceed to its next port of call Benghazi . Following this decision the NATO warships returned to their patrol duties and did not escort the ship to Benghazi as suggested in some media reports . ''

`` We 've had no power all day , how are we going to work like this ? '' said one angry merchant as he stalked out of his women 's clothing shop .

`` At a time like this people want air-conditioning , '' said 26-year old Ridha Abdullah , who runs a children 's clothing store . Abdullah said the power outages began within the last two weeks .

But , as is often the case in public places , other Libyans discreetly approached CNN reporters to whisper messages of dissent against the Gadhafi regime .

One store owner decided to deal with summer heat and lack of electricity by simply closing shop early .
