MLB.com posted a photo of the new navy blue batting practice caps with a red and white scripted ` A. ' The team will wear those hats at spring training , which starts Tuesday .

The Braves said a decision on the batting caps had not been made yet when a potential design was leaked several weeks ago . That design drew ire for its `` screaming Indian '' logo .

`` I like the selection we made this year , '' Braves President John Schuerholz said in a statement Monday . `` We had a variety of choices that we looked at , some more thoroughly than others . But at the end , we liked this one . ''

But writer Paul Lukas of ESPN 's Uni Watch blog , who broke the news of the cap design in December , was n't buying the Braves ' statement . He suggested the Braves withdrew the design because of the furor it caused .

`` In other words , the Braves are claiming that they were never committed to the Indian head cap to begin with , '' Lukas wrote . `` But that does n't ring true .

Kevin Gover , director of the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of the American Indian , said in December that the use of the screaming Indian logo would be going backward .

The screaming Indian is an image of an imaginary Indian , Gover said . It and other stereotypical sports mascots , he said , do not portray Native Americans for who they truly are .

The team also had a mascot , Chief Noc-a-Homa -LRB- knock a homer -RRB- , who wore Native American dress and war paint .

But not everyone agreed with the Braves ' decision .

@mattplanet said : `` Okay , so we all know some prototypes of that screaming indian Braves BP cap were made ... somebody got to get us one ... ''

Debate over sports mascots is , of course , not new . U.S. professional and collegiate sports teams have used Native American logos and names for years . Baseball 's Cleveland Indians , for instance , continue to feature a smiling Indian dubbed Chief Wahoo , criticized as a racist caricature .

Sometimes this happens with the blessing of Native American tribes , and other times -- like with the NFL 's Washington Redskins , a term that many feel advances a demeaning stereotype -- they have been denounced as racial slurs .
