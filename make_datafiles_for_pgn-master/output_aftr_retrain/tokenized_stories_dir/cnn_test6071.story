A military spokesman declined to comment on the plane 's mission or the number of people aboard , but said rescuers are searching for survivors .

Local media reported that the plane , which had taken off from a Pretoria airbase Wednesday night , was carrying a team of doctors responsible for the former president 's health care .

Mandela , 94 , has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa .

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of blacks in South Africa . He became the nation 's first black president in 1994 , four years after he was freed from prison .

Despite his rare appearances , Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation .
