The sheer scale of the event came as a complete surprise to the organizer , a 22-year-old Facebook user who identified himself only as Crazzy Eve .

`` At a quarter to seven people just flocked into the station like someone opened a plughole and the water went out , '' he said . `` They just kept coming in like sheep . As it grew and grew , I just thought , ` This is going to be huge . ' '' iReport.com : Were you there ? Send your photos and video

His main memory of the event is `` the volume of people -- you could n't see the floor , '' he said .

He left after 15 minutes -- the scheduled ending time -- for fear of the police , he said , adding that he had deleted his name from the event Web site and refused to identify himself to CNN for the same reason .

`` The entire main concourse was packed full of people dancing , cheering and screaming , '' said CNN 's Simon Hooper , who was passing through the station on his way home .

`` There were camera flashes going off constantly . There were also loads of people crammed around the edge of the upper level of the station , looking down at the scene below .

`` There were a lot of bemused commuters wandering around the edges , trying to get to their trains but nobody seemed to mind too much . Everyone seemed pretty good humored , '' he said . `` I think a lot of people who pass through Liverpool Street regularly are getting used to this sort of thing . ''

Police did not have an immediate estimate of the crowd size , but more than 14,000 people joined the Facebook group `` Liverpool Street Station Silent Dance . ''

The T-Mobile commercial which inspired the event shows several hundred people dancing in the station . The dancing in the advertisement appears to be spontaneous but was actually choreographed . It was filmed January 15 and has been widely broadcast since then .

The success of the event has prompted Crazzy Eve to call for another silent dance at Trafalgar Square in central London on February 13 . A group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later .

The station has a large open space with a balcony surrounding it . User videos shot from the balcony and posted on Facebook showed every available inch of space filled with people , many of them cheering , though the event was billed as `` silent . ''

Charlie Todd , a comedian and founder of the New York group Improv Everywhere , which organizes flashmobs , says the point of the group 's `` missions '' is simple .

`` In the process we bring excitement to otherwise unexciting locales and give strangers a story they can tell for the rest of their lives . We 're out to prove that a prank does n't have to involve humiliation or embarrassment ; it can simply be about making someone laugh , smile , or stop to notice the world around them . ''
