`` While we have obligations to abide by decisions of the AU , we are also under obligation to other international agreements including the Rome Statutes , '' Kachali said .

Kachali said the summit appears to be headed to the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa , also the AU headquarters . Sudan asked the AU to move the meeting there after Malawi said al-Bashir would not be welcome .

Undule Mwakasungula , director of the Malawi Center for Human Rights and Rehabilitation , is quoted in a Human Rights Watch news release Friday that `` Malawi has done right by Darfur victims today . ''

The AU , the organization of countries across the African continent , has said before that its members should n't cooperate with al-Bashir 's arrest .

Al-Bashir made trips abroad for meetings despite the ICC warrants against him crimes in the Darfur region , where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003 .

The Human Rights Watch said Chad , Kenya and Djibouti have permitted him on their territory . But other countries have canceled visits or have said that the wanted president is unwelcome .

`` Malawi joins an increasing number of countries that have declined to welcome al-Bashir , '' said Alan Wallis , international justice lawyer at the Southern Africa Litigation Center , quoted by Human Rights Watch . `` More states should follow Malawi 's example . ''

Banda became president in April after Mutharika died . After she took power , she said Malawi would host the summit but stressed that al-Bashir would n't be welcomed because of the arrest warrant . the Human Rights Watch said .

`` Civil society groups across the African continent have repeatedly urged governments to arrest -- not host -- al-Bashir , '' said Elise Keppler , senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch . `` African activists have called for their governments to stand with victims , not with suspected war criminals . ''
