Earlier this month , North Korea again called for the resumption of the so-called six-party talks without preconditions . North Korea pulled out of six-party talks in 2008 .

The six-party talks involved China , Japan , Russia , South Korea , North Korea and the United States . The goal was nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula .

North Korea has called for the resumption of six-party talks without preconditions before . The United States and South Korea , however , have insisted on some tangible demonstration that North Korea is serious about denuclearization .

Ahead of the the Kim 's visit , Russia 's foreign ministry announced Friday that it will send up to 50,000 tons of wheat to North Korea to alleviate some of that country 's food shortage .

`` We view this humanitarian operation as a contribution to the strengthening of traditionally neighborly relations between the peoples of our two countries , '' the foreign ministry said in a statement .

CNN 's Pierre Meilhan and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report .
