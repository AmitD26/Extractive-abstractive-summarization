`` You can imagine the Chinese public may start to express some dissatisfaction with the dominance of princelings -LRB- sons of revolutionary leaders -RRB- , with the elder and retired top leader Jiang Zemin 's interference in the process of succession , and also that two liberal leaders Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang are excluded in the new Politburo Standing Committee -LRB- PSC -RRB- , '' he said .

As expected , the number of seats on the PSC shrank from nine members to seven and included the names at the top of many speculative lists : Xi Jinping -LRB- President -RRB- , Li Keqiang -LRB- Premier -RRB- , Zhang Dejiang , Yu Zhengsheng , Liu Yunshan , Wang Qishan and Zhang Gaoli .

`` One of the Tuanpai members -- Liu Yunshan -- is actually very close to Jiang Zemin . So this lack of balance will potentially be a serious problem in the months or years to come , '' Li added .

CNN asked Li for his immediate reaction to the lineup and the possible implications for Xi 's term as China 's new president .

After months of mystery , new leaders revealed

One is that Hu Jintao stepped down as Chairman of the Central Military Commission , making the succession more institutionalized and complete . By and large , this leadership transition is another orderly transition in PRC history . The leadership change follows the rules and norms of age limits , and the turnover rates in all leadership bodies are all very high : 64 % for the Central Committee , 77 % for the Disciplinary Commission , 68 % for the Secretariat , 71 % for the PSC .

The size change -LRB- from nine to seven members of the PSC -RRB- , including the elimination of the police czar and the propaganda czar , is a welcome development . These are all positives but , in my judgment , this leadership lineup does not generate an uplifting spirit for the nation ; I think this is a major opportunity lost .

Why are they out ?

The reason , in my view , Wang Yang is out because he is seen by many conservative leaders as a threat . Particularly as Wang 's main political rival Bo Xilai is out , they do n't want him to be in -- previously Wang and Bo tended to balance each other in terms of power , influence and policy preference .

In many ways , both are very outspoken , very courageous , very innovative in politics -- they reach out to the public for support -- so in a way , some conservatives are very scared . In my view , this group of seven leaders is very capable in economic and financial affairs , but politically they are quite conservative .

How long will it take for Xi to make his presence or policies known ?

Xi will enter a short honeymoon period despite all the criticism and worries that have already emerged . The criticism may not be against him but rather against Jiang Zemin , against the dominance of princelings .

He needs to demonstrate that he can provide new hope and confidence for the public with new economic policies . He should do so relatively quickly . He ca n't wait too long because a large number of people are very unhappy with rampant official corruption and growing economic disparity .

I think he will emphasize economic reform -- to make the middle class happy -- and to promote the private sector , to introduce more economic reform mechanisms , including banking reform and state-owned enterprise reform , basically with the goal to promote private sector development .

What can Li Keqiang bring as Premier ?

In many ways , he 's surrounded by Jiang Zemin 's people who will tremendously restrain his power . There were previously a lot of people who wanted to block him from the premiership -- that failed . But now even in the state council , certainly in the standing committee , he 's quite alone .

What does it say about the enduring influence of Jiang ?

Why and how is Jiang still able to wield such influence ?

It 's still too early to give a well-grounded answer due to a lack of reliable information about what happened inside Zhongnanhai -LRB- Communist Party headquarters in Beijing -RRB- .

There are several possible reasons : One is , Hu wants to make a contrast between himself and Jiang Zemin . Jiang stayed in power for two more years after the transition at the 16th Party Congress . But Hu wants to immediately give up that position . So it is an institutional improvement . Secondly , his volunteering to give up that position makes Jiang 's activity to promote his protégés in the past few months very problematic .

The balance in the Politburo Standing Committee is broken , but the balance in the Politburo and the Central Military Commission -- between the two camps -- largely stays intact . There are many of Hu 's people in the central committee . Consequently , this may create structural tensions between these very important leadership bodies .
