-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Facebook is adding new security features , which come after a pair of high-profile cracks in the site 's defenses that surfaced this week .

This multiple-choice photo quiz is a new take on a common Web system called Captcha .

The older method displays a picture of some squiggly letters and asks you to type those on the keyboard . It 's used for verifying that a site 's user is a person and not a computer program looking to exploit systems .

Adding this human touch could not only combat robot intruders but also weirdos who try to thumb through your account after you forget to log out of the library computer .

Facebook also started rolling out the option to securely browse the social networking site using a secure connection .

Like the technology used by banking and some e-mail services like Gmail and Hotmail , this defense encrypts all information to and from Facebook so that it 's much harder for someone to eavesdrop on the Wi-Fi line .

`` With a little motivation and not much skill , it 's fairly trivial to sniff HTTP traffic , '' Alan Ross , the lead security analyst for Intel IT , told CNN in November . `` Maybe I want to see all Web traffic for Facebook because I want to see what the interesting person across the cafe is updating on Facebook .
