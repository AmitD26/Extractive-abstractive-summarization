Several hundred parents in the mountain state 's capital packed a school board meeting earlier this week to debate the 62-page proposal . It includes four pages of charts listing what elements of human sexuality should be introduced at which grades .

The proposed curriculum guide is part of a broad range of health courses that also teach nutriition , disease prevention , anatomy and environmental health . It would teach students as early as second grade that using anti-gay slurs is hurtful and teach children in older elementary grades about sexual harassment and abuse .

Students would be told as early as kindergarten to properly name body parts . The concept that people `` can love people of the same gender and people of another gender '' would be introduced in first grade , though homosexual relationships are n't discussed until fifth grade .

Ackeman , who has two elementary-age daughters and a third approaching kindergarten , said parents should be told `` who decided this , when did they decide it and how did they decide it ? ''

`` We really have n't seen where that age-appropriateness comes from , '' he said . In addition , he said the district has not figured out how to implement the program .

`` There is n't any sort of implementation in place right now that says this is how we 're going to teach this , '' Ackerman said .

Implementation plans will be developed later , he said -- and if parents object , he added , `` They have a right to opt out . ''

`` It sounds like they are teaching body parts and things that are facts of life , '' Areu said . `` I feel more comfortable with my daughter learning about this in a classroom than from a boy in the hallway . ''
