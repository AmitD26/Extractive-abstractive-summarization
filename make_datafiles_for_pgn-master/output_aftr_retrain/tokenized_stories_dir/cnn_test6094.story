`` On November 1 , 2012 , officials at the -LRB- Veterans Affairs Western New York Healthcare System -RRB- reported that while conducting pharmacy inspection rounds on the inpatient units , they discovered that insulin pens intended for individual patient use were found in the supply drawer of the medication carts without a patient label on them , '' said the memo , obtained by CNN through the office of U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins , D-New York . `` Although the disposable needles were changed each time it was used , the insulin pens intended for individual patient use may have been used on more than one patient . ''

`` There is a very small chance that some patients could have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus , the hepatitis C virus , or HIV , based on practices identified at the facility , '' the congressional memo states . '' -LRB- The health system -RRB- determined that all veterans who were prescribed the insulin pen during an inpatient stay from October 19 , 2010 , to November 1 , 2012 , should be notified . ''

The veterans ' health care system has found that 716 patients may have been affected during this time period , Jim Blue , regional director of the VA 's Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs , told CNN . `` Veterans and their families will have an opportunity to speak with a nurse who will answer questions they may have and assist with managing followup care , '' Blue said .

However , slow patient outreach has also been a contentious issue .

`` Beyond the fact that the error occurred at all , most concerning was the length of time it took the Buffalo VA to catch the error -- over two years , as well as the three-month delay in informing patients who may have been exposed , '' Higgins , whose district includes the city of Buffalo , wrote in a letter to the VA on Monday . `` Also detail why affected patients were n't notified immediately . ''

Higgins has also requested a detailed response outlining what steps will be taken to prevent any similar issues in the future .
