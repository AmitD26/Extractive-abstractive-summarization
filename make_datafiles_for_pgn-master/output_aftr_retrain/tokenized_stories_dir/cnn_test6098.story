Atlanta -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The young Georgia woman fighting a flesh-eating bacteria underwent a successful skin graft this week as she continues her astounding recovery .

Georgia flesh-eating bacteria victim 's condition upgraded

`` I say ` final initial ' because I understand that skin surfaces continue to break down over time and that Aimee will need follow-up surgeries to repair those areas in the weeks , months and years ahead , '' Andy Copeland wrote . `` Aimee 's wound repair is a lifelong process that will require ongoing attention and medical care , however , the surgery today will bring her one step closer to her biggest challenge yet : rehab . ''

Aimee Copeland speaks , jokes , father says

The young Snellville woman 's ordeal began May 1 , when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River , about 50 miles west of Atlanta . The line snapped , and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close .

Three days later , still in pain , she went to an emergency room . Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila .

Copeland late last month began breathing on her own and talking for the first time in weeks , and even cracked jokes , her father said .
