Sex between consenting homosexual partners is once again illegal in India after the country 's Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling Wednesday .

Four years ago , India 's High Court decriminalized such a relationship , in what was then hailed by gay rights groups as a landmark ruling .

The Supreme Court overturned that ruling .

Known as Section 377 , the law has been in the books since India 's Colonial-era days . It bans people from engaging in `` carnal acts against the order of nature . ''

It was up to parliament , the court said , to decide whether or not to keep the law in the statute books .

Amnesty International India called Wednesday 's Supreme Court ruling `` a black day of freedom in India . ''

`` It is hard not to feel let down by this judgment , which has taken India back several years in its commitment to protect basic rights , '' the group said .

` Setback to human dignity '

Until now , India has n't maintained a central database of prosecution under Section 377 , said Akhilesh Kumar , a chief statistical officer at the National Crimes Record Bureau -LRB- NCRB -RRB- .

`` Henceforth , we will be compiling crimes committed under this relevant section , '' Kumar said . `` Maybe from the next year . ''

Rights activists say a number of gay couples have faced court cases because of their relationships .

`` The Supreme Court 's ruling is a disappointing setback to human dignity , and the basic rights to privacy and non-discrimination , '' the group said in a statement . `` But now the government should do what it should have done in the first place and seek to repeal section 377 . ''
