If you own or work for a small business that has a loan from a bank , I 'm quite sure your business has a budget -- and a rather detailed budget at that . Every year around tax time , many American families sit down to fill out tax forms , estimate their income , and set spending priorities for the upcoming year . It 's the responsible thing to do .

And yet , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appears to believe it is not necessary for the Senate to fulfill its legal responsibility by debating and passing a budget to account for $ 3.8 trillion in federal spending next fiscal year , $ 15.6 trillion of debt and , according to figures produced by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff , more than $ 65 trillion in additional unfunded liabilities .

Even worse , President Barack Obama and his administration seem to view budgeting as just one more political maneuver . His efforts have been so completely unserious that the President 's 2012 budget was rejected by a vote of 97-0 in the Senate . And three weeks ago , when Rep. Mick Mulvaney , R-South Carolina , sponsored a budget proposal based on Obama 's 2013 budget plan , it lost in the House by a vote of 414-0 .

Democrats claim that last year 's Budget Control Act is an adequate substitute for a real budget because it `` deems '' spending caps . Obviously , it is not . It is only half the equation . It includes no plan for saving Social Security or Medicare , for reforming taxes , or for ever living within our means . But it does prove that Washington is certainly good at making sure spending continues .

Business owners and consumers all over America are watching Washington , shaking their heads in disgust , and holding on to their wallets . These are the people we need to get our economy moving again , but these are the very people that are under assault by Obama and his policies .

The Obama administration 's agencies are regulating business to death , limiting the use of America 's domestic energy resources , threatening to punish success by increasing tax burdens , and providing no credible plan for reining in our debt and deficit . As self-defeating as all of these policies have been , not having a credible long-term budget plan might prove to be the most harmful .

Now our debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 100 % , and over the last three years , America 's borrowing cost has been kept at an artificially low rate of 1.5 % . How long can that last ? Nobody knows .

This is unsustainable . Increased interest expense resulting from higher rates , the true cost of Obamacare , and reduced revenues from slower economic growth caused by uncertainty and lack of confidence , all significantly raise the risk of dramatically higher debt and deficits . Employer surveys by McKinsey , as well as analysis by former Congressional Budget Office Director Holtz-Eakin , show that far more Americans will lose employer-provided care than CBO estimates . Additionally , Congress is unlikely to implement the hundreds of billions in Medicare cuts that are called for in the president 's health care law

It is past time for Obama , and his allies in Congress , to show the American people a credible plan to address our looming financial crisis . It is time for Senate Democrats to pass a budget .
