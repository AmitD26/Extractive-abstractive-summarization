`` I 'm not going out there to play my best ; I 'm going out there to win , '' Novak Djokovic said after setting up a Sunday final showdown with eight-time defending champion Rafael Nadal at the Monte Carlo Masters .

While Djokovic is returning to fitness after injuring his ankle on Davis Cup duty earlier this month , Nadal 's longterm knee problems seem to be behind him after earning his fifth consecutive final appearance since his February comeback .

The 11-time grand slam champion was tested for the second match in a row before defeating France 's world No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3 7-6 -LRB- 7-3 -RRB- in Saturday 's opening semifinal in one hour and 36 minutes .

`` Playing five tournaments in a row after injury , being in five finals in a row is great , '' said Nadal , who has won three of four of those so far .

They have not met since Nadal won last year 's French Open final -- his record seventh title on the red clay of Roland Garros -- and the Spaniard holds a 19-14 career advantage in their matches .

Meanwhile , the Czech Republic 's grip on the women 's Fed Cup title slipped on Saturday after Italy took a 2-0 lead in Palermo .

Kvitova , who also lost to Vinci last weekend in the final of the Katowice event in Poland , must now beat last year 's French Open runner-up Errani to prevent Italy taking an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five rubber .

`` I hope I can cancel this match in my mind and have a free mind for tomorrow , '' Kvitova said . `` I 'm still getting better , and it 's obviously tough to be 100 % ready to play these girls on clay but we 'll see . ''

Slovakia also need just one more point to reach the November 2-3 final after taking a shock 2-0 over Russia in Moscow .

Dominika Cibulkova beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 5-7 6-1 6-4 , and then Daniela Hantuchova defeated Maria Kirilenko 6-2 6-4 as the Slovakians seek to reach their first final since winning the 2002 title .
