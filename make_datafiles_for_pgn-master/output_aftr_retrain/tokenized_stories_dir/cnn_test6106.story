-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Retiring baby boomers are cashing out on their decades of paying into Social Security . The problem ? Social Security is no longer running a surplus , worrying many that the entitlement program is in trouble .

In 2036 , the Social Security Administration reports that it will no longer have enough money to fully pay out scheduled benefits . Solutions put forth by President Obama 's bipartisan fiscal commission , on which Republican vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan served , include raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for wealthier Americans .

As the debate over how to save Social Security continues , we look at the program by the numbers :

7.8 million - Number of elderly people in the United States in 1934 . Approximately 50 % of them lacked enough income to support themselves . Only 5 % of retired people were receiving pensions .

56 million -- Number of Americans receiving Social Security benefits in 2011 , approximately 18 % of the total population .

36 million -- Number of those receiving Social Security in 2012 who are retired workers . The other 20 million are surviving spouses , disabled people and dependents .

$ 1,023 -- The average monthly retired worker benefit for a woman in 2010 .

49 % -- Percentage of retired worker Social Security beneficiaries who were women in 2010 .

86 % -- The percentage of single people over 65 who received Social Security benefits in 2009 .
