Last week , nearly 1,000 `` unaccompanied alien children '' had already arrived in Tucson and Phoenix from places like McAllen and El Paso , Texas , as part of a resettlement process of the minors , most of whom come from Central America , to their native countries .

Although children crossing the border alone has long been an issue , the recent spike could be attributed to better weather or worsening economic conditions in their home countries , officials said . Others simply want to be reunited with their parents , who may have left them with relatives in their native countries .

`` I am disturbed and outraged that President Obama 's administration continues to implement this dangerous and inhumane policy , meanwhile neglecting to answer crucial questions our citizens demand and deserve , '' Brewer wrote .

As of late last week , Immigration and Customs Enforcement was no longer releasing `` large family groups '' at the bus stops in Arizona , a DHS spokesman said , but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state .

Raising a larger humanitarian concern are the conditions to which the immigrant children are arriving .

A facility in Nogales , Arizona , with capacity for about 1,500 , does not have enough food or beds to accommodate the current demand , a spokesman said .

There are currently no showers for the immigrants , either , but those were expected to be in place by Tuesday , according to a spokesman .

`` Upon completion of CBP processing ... custody determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis , '' the statement said .

The record spike in migrants coming from Central America and crossing into the United States via Mexico is not expected to slow down , a spokesman told CNN .

More than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles are expected to cross in 2014 , said Chris Cabrera , vice president of the National Border Patrol Council in the Rio Grande Valley , a U.S. Border Patrol workers union .

`` We are seeing numbers that we 've never seen before in this part of the country , '' Cabrera told CNN last month . `` Yesterday , we had 60 minors in one station alone . You 're talking kids from 17 years old , on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old , traveling by themselves . ''

Last year , roughly 10 % of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors , according to a Border Patrol official .
