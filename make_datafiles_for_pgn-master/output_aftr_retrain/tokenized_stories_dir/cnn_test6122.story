-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Disappointment , anger , disgust .

Words like these are echoing throughout social media about a national icon : The Boy Scouts of America .

And then this week , the so-called `` perversion files '' were publicly released , naming more than 1,000 suspected child sex abusers since the mid-1960s with links to Scouting .

`` Some of the aspects of Scouting morality I find is sort of old school -- like they 're stuck in the 1950s . ''

Eventually , the Boy Scouts will have to change , Stansbury says , or else the organization will become socially irrelevant .

The group is standing at a key moment in its survival , says Stansbury . If it fails to `` get with the modern times '' within the next decade , `` alternative youth organizations will appear that are more inclusive and based on equality . ''

The majority of Scouts agree with the policy , the BSA said in July . But `` no single policy will accommodate the many diverse views among our membership or society . ''

Scouting offers to teach members skills in `` character building '' and making good `` moral choices , '' says BSA spokesman Deron Smith . But he also says it 's important to separate `` the discussion of larger societal issues '' from the operation of Scouting . `` The state of Scouting is very strong . ''

` Living your values '

`` People with young kids are trying to live their lives more in accordance with their beliefs and their values , '' says Stansbury . It 's hard , he says , to participate in something like the Boy Scouts and everyday question your own integrity .

In protest , Stansbury sent his Eagle medal back to Scout headquarters a few months ago , along with hundreds of other ex-Scouts .

Boy Scout policies and procedures evolve over time , says Smith . For example , the child sex abuse concerns decades ago spurred the BSA to implement strict screening , education and prevention policies that continue today and represent a `` gold standard '' for protecting kids , Smith says .

Boy Scout Zach Plante of Menlo Park , California , does n't like the ban on atheists or gays and lesbians . But he loves Scouting .

So the 16-year-old basically looks the other way , he says , along with the rest of Troop 222 . `` In my troop I do n't know of any particular Scouts that are gay or atheist , but I know that our troop would n't necessarily kick a Scout out of the troop for being gay or atheist . ''

Zach 's dad , psychology professor Tom Plante , does n't see any conflict between his support for Scouting and his opposition to the bans . Plante says he does his best to live his values and to make changes where he can . `` But at the end of the day we 're not going to agree 100 % with all the policies and procedures of every organization that we 're a part of -- whether it 's Scouts or the United States government or churches or companies . ''

Ryan Andreson 's troop was n't so understanding . When Andreson , who lives in Moraga , California , was denied his Eagle rank because he 's gay , he mounted a campaign that gained national attention . Part of that campaign included collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures on a petition for local Scout officials . So far , Andreson is still waiting to get his Eagle .

Religious ties

Among the biggest backers are the Catholic Church and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , according to BSA . In 2011 , Mormon-backed Cub Scout and Boy Scout units accounted for more than 420,000 of all Scouts nationwide , while more than 200,000 other scouts were members of units affiliated with the Catholic Church .

Those affiliations over the years have resulted in a complicated political maze that 's difficult to navigate when it comes to change , Stansbury suggests . `` Oh yeah -- the Catholic and Mormon churches have a lot of influence on the Boy Scouts , especially the leadership of the Boy Scouts , '' he says . `` I certainly believe that 's a big part of why the Boy Scouts have stubbornly held onto this policy .

`` It would be a much better organization , not having those people involved . But it 's not going to go away immediately . ''

If the U.S. military can accept openly gay and lesbian troops , he asked , why ca n't the Boy Scouts of America ? `` Every day I question my personal integrity for choosing to stay involved with a discriminatory organization . ''
