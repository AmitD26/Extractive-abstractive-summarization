`` We 've been keeping a close eye on the weather the last few weeks and keeping our fingers crossed , hoping for some good snow and it just got to the point where we decided it 's better to reschedule and pay to change our plans than to go out there and be disappointed , '' said Kommer , who was planning to fly from Dallas to meet up with friends at Beaver Creek Resort . Now they 're planning to go in February .

Weather patterns are moving in and out too quickly and nothing is locking in to produce significant snowfall , he said .

Any snow would be a welcome change for the Lake Tahoe area straddling California and Nevada , where odd spring-like weather has plagued snow seekers . Base snow averaged about 14 inches at seven area resorts on Thursday , with summit averages of a little more than 19 inches . The annual average summit snowfall at one of the resorts is 350 inches .

It 's no good for skiers , but the warm weather is pleasant , said local restaurant manager Vicky Mallett .

`` We 're really busy because -LRB- visitors are -RRB- not skiing . '' People who would usually be on the trails all day are skiing in the morning and then coming into town , Mallett said , but she suspects the novelty of the warm weather will wear off for vacationers .

Ski resorts in other parts of the West did n't experience such steep declines in December business . In Colorado and Utah , revenue was down by single digit percentages over the holiday week , said Michael Berry , president of the National Ski Areas Association .

Some of Colorado 's biggest resorts -- like Aspen and Vail -- are surviving on high altitude , cold temperatures and enough money to produce a lot of man-made snow , said Patrick Crawford , content director of snow sports website OnTheSnow .

Aspen/Snowmass CEO Mike Kaplan penned a blog post this week titled `` The Glass is Half Full '' highlighting some of the best trail conditions , and a Facebook comment complaining about attractive photos of `` fake snow '' on the resort 's page received this upbeat response : `` Yep - sometimes we 've got to lend a hand when Mother Nature is being fickle . Sure beats doing nothing , right ? ''

Vail Resorts , which owns six resorts in Colorado and California , is looking at a .6 % increase in total lift ticket revenue from the start of the season in November through the beginning of January over the same period last year , according to CEO Rob Katz .

Katz said that slight uptick after last year 's incredible season is due in large part to the company 's investment in snowmaking and family-friendly activities and amenities . So while a lot of expert terrain is closed , the intermediate terrain is available to vacationing families .

`` For an expert skier who wants to ski everything , no question , they come and they say ` hey , this is n't as good as it was last year , ' absolutely , '' Katz said .

Despite a very slow start to the ski season , there are a few brighter spots , Crawford said . Western storm systems have split to the far north and south of the country , so conditions in New Mexico , Arizona and southern Colorado in the south and the Pacific Northwest , Alaska and Canada are looking pretty good .

`` We ca n't complain certainly , '' said Kathleen Goyette , a spokeswoman for Ski Washington . Resorts in Washington got 20 to 35 inches of fresh snow during the last week of December . The state 's resorts are aware of their luck compared with many other areas of the country , she said .

`` We 've been there before , '' Goyette said . `` We 've been the ones with no snow . ''

Not so compassionate is Big Sky Resort in Montana , which is taking a run at Vail Resorts ' business with an offer of free lift tickets to holders of the company 's Epic Pass , which allows unlimited access to all six Vail-owned resorts in Colorado and California . Epic Pass holders must book lodging through Big Sky to be eligible for free skiing .

Things have `` turned the corner '' at ski areas east of the Mississippi after a 10 % to 15 % slump in holiday week revenue , said Berry of the National Ski Areas Association . There has been some natural snow in some areas this week and colder temperatures mean resorts are `` making snow like crazy . ''
