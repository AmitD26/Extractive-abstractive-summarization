Most of the dead were members of the country 's Tutsi minority , who were killed by Hutus .

The killing of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu militants ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- composed of Tutsis under the leadership of current President Paul Kagame -- halted the Hutu militants .

The experts and judges traveled to Rwanda in September 2010 to view the scene of the attack , the attorneys said . Once there , they had the opportunity to conduct field surveys and simulations , and `` they could also hear eyewitnesses who saw or heard the firing of missiles .

`` It is clear from their analysis that the probable location of firing was strictly inaccessible at the time to the men of the RPF , '' Maignain and Forster said .

In 2006 , French Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere , who was previously in charge of the investigation , requested arrest warrants against nine Rwandan nationals belonging to the RPF , according to Maignain and Forster . Seven people are still `` under investigation , '' they said , but they also accused the former judge of dismissing all evidence suggesting the RPF might not have been the perpetrators of the attack .

The latest report , the attorneys noted , is a `` turning point . ''

The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report , saying it was part of a judicial investigation started because the crew members of the downed plane were French .

`` The crash served as an excuse for key perpetrators to execute a meticulously planned genocide against the Tutsi , '' the government 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation said in a statement .

The plane , which was struck as it prepared to land at Kigali International Airport , was bringing Habyarimana home from negotiations over the Arusha peace accords , which had created a power-sharing government between rebels and the Rwandan government .

`` Today 's findings constitute vindication for Rwanda 's long-held position on the circumstances surrounding events of April 1994 , '' said Louise Mushikiwabo , foreign minister and government spokeswoman , in the statement .

`` With this scientific truth , Judges Trevidic and Poux have slammed shut the door on the 17-year campaign to deny the genocide or blame its victims . It is now clear to all that the downing of the plane was a coup d'etat carried out by extremist Hutu elements and their advisers who controlled Kanombe Barracks . ''
