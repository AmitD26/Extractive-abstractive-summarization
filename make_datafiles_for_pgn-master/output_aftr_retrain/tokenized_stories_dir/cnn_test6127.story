-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hugo Chavez 's 14 years as president of Venezuela were so personality-driven that the movement behind him became known as `` Chavismo . ''

`` In authoritarian regimes , you always have a crisis moment when you see a change in leadership , '' Corrales said .

Chavez was democratically elected , but his efforts to consolidate power in the presidency led to accusations of authoritarianism .

After Joseph Stalin died in the Soviet Union , there was a complete break with his regime under the new leader , Nikita Khrushchev . Khrushchev rejected Stalin 's terror tactics .

Change in Cuba was more subtle after the passing of the torch from Fidel Castro to his brother Raul Castro , Corrales said . The Castros share their communist views , but after the younger Castro took office , he purged some men and has since pursued policies to somewhat open up Cuba .

If elected , Maduro eventually will have to purge some of the Chavez loyalists and shake up the Cabinet to consolidate his own power , Corrales said .

The lasting power of Chavez 's image

Chavez 's dedication to putting the nation 's poor at the forefront of his policies made him a hero among a large sector of the population . His freewheeling spending of his nation 's oil wealth was criticized by some economists as unsustainable , but Venezuela 's poor saw results and elevated Chavez to hero status .

In Latin America , such status carries a lot of weight .

Hero or villain ? The many ways to see Chavez

Consider a movement in Nicaragua that has survived over the years : Sandinismo . Augusto Sandino was the leader of a rebellion in the late 1920s and early 1930s against an American occupation . The Sandinistas are in power today in Nicaragua , under President Daniel Ortega , though the movement has little to do with its origins , said Andres Perez , a professor of political science at the University of Western Ontario .

Years after Sandino was killed , Nicaraguans used his image as a symbol in their own rebellion to overthrow a dictatorship . A movement , the Sandinista National Liberation Front , was born . The current Sandinista president uses the same symbol and movement , though it has been manipulated from earlier Sandinismo , Perez said .

`` When people find a symbol or answer to their aspirations , they tend to perpetuate it , '' Perez said .

Already during last year 's electoral campaign , the opposition vowed not to undo the social missions that Chavez initiated , but only to modify them .

The director of the polling firm Datanalisis , Luis Vicente Leon , predicted something similar in a series of Twitter posts before Chavez died .

`` To count out Chavismo without Chavez is to ignore that there is Peronism without Peron and Sandinismo without Sandino , '' he tweeted . `` It will suffer a great loss without Chavez , but it has a legacy of power and symbolism that it can exploit . ''

Peronism is a movement named after former Argentine President Juan Peron , a legacy that has been claimed over the years by parties both on the political right and left .

Despite suffering from cancer , Chavez resoundingly won re-election in October . His popularity , combined with the outpouring of tributes in the wake of his death , make a Chavista victory likely in the new elections that must be called .

Maduro was named by Chavez as his preferred successor and could easily win the election , but he will have to put the movement 's unity as his priority , said Steve Ellner , a professor at Venezuela 's Universidad de Oriente who has written several books about Chavez 's Venezuela .

There are divisions within Chavismo that have come to light as Chavez 's health faded . Some stand behind Maduro , who is close with the Cuban regime , while others side with Diosdado Cabello , the National Assembly president who is more of a nationalist . Because Chavez was never sworn in for his latest terms , there is even a debate over which of the two , constitutionally , should be the interim president .

`` I do n't see a turn to the moderate policies that some favor , '' Ellner said .

One of the characteristics of Chavismo is the fervor of its adherents . Chavez was a master of cultivating that fervor , and the next Chavista leader will have to do the same , Ellner said .

`` In any process of far-reaching changing , it is essential , '' he said .

Maintaining that level of fervor keeps followers from becoming disillusioned , he said . One of Chavez 's strategies was to surprise Venezuelans with new policies that invigorated the rank-and-file , a formula that future leaders may have to follow , he said .

In a speech at his swearing in as interim leader , Maduro promised to follow Chavez 's path .

`` We still have him in our hearts , '' he said . `` I have him here , here , as if he was the name in my soul , because I am his son . ''

`` It will depend on opposition voters understanding that Chavismo without Chavez is beatable and deeply vulnerable if they mobilize , '' he said .

If Chavismo is victorious in its first election without Chavez , the new leader will have to face decisions that may cause dissatisfaction among the movement , said Corrales , the Amherst professor .

Supporters of Chavez are more optimistic about the lasting legacy of Chavez .

`` Chavismo , at one point , was focused on the figure of Chavez as the all-emcompassing one , but it grew and expanded to become this mass movement that has crossed the borders out of Venezuela into the world beyond and has affected countries around the world , '' Eva Golinger , a Venezuelan-American attorney , author and adviser to Chavez told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour .

`` Chavez -LRB- was -RRB- a very powerful personality , very charismatic person , larger than life , and most media attention went to him , '' Golinger said . `` But in the end , what really has been going on in Venezuela is a whole transformation of the country , that 's why it 's called a revolution , changing every sector of society .
