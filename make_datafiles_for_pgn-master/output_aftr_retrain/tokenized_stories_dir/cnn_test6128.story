Mental health problems would prohibit potential buyers from purchasing a gun .

Currently , states are not required to send reports of mental health problems , which would prohibit buyers from purchasing a gun .

The number of states submitting the information also grew , from 23 before the Virginia Tech tragedy to 32 after it .

The majority of the new records came from California authorities , who submitted more than 200,000 entries , the Justice Department said . Ohio boosted the amount of entries from three in March of this year to 7,845 in November .

`` But as we learned in the tragedy at Virginia Tech , the checks must be accurate and complete to be effective . ''

Virginia did not report his name to the FBI system because he had n't been committed to a mental health facility .

Officials say making sure information -- such as mental health records -- that would keep a person from buying a gun is available at a national level ensures that the individual does n't go across state lines to try to make a purchase .

Background checks , however , are n't necessary for firearms purchases made at gun shows or from a private seller , which , according to estimates , account for about half of the guns sold in the United States each year . E-mail to a friend
