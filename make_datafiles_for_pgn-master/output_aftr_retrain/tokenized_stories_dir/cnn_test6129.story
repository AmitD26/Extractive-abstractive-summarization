-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- China is rallying around fallen hurdler Liu Xiang Wednesday after he failed to make it past the first-round heat for a second consecutive Olympics . The sympathetic response was a stark contrast to the public outcry over his high-profile withdrawal from the Beijing 2008 Games .

`` What Liu Xiang did today reflected the true Olympics spirit , '' said Feng Shuyong , the leader of the Chinese athletics team , in quotes carried by Chinese state news agency Xinhua . `` Winning is not so important , participation is what matters . ''

Local newspapers in cities across China carried Liu 's story on their front pages , urging fans to support the athlete as he struggles to recover from injury . `` It is time for him to take a good rest , '' wrote the Chongqing Morning Post .

On the Sina Weibo microblogging platform , where Liu Xiang was the top trending term Wednesday , the topic page for the Liu Xiang hashtag included the subheading : `` Liu Xiang fell and lost his chance to qualify for the semi-final . Write one sentence to comfort him . ''

All eyes in China were on Liu at the London Olympics Tuesday , as he sought to redeem himself after limping off the track at his first-round heat at the Beijing 2008 Olympics .

Some complained that they had paid 20 times the retail price for tickets to see Liu compete in Beijing , and demanded a refund .

China 's sympathetic response this time around may be attributed to Liu 's symbolic completion of the race , as well as the Olympics not taking place on Chinese home turf . At 29 , Liu is also not expected to compete in another Olympics .

The Shanghai native shot to international stardom when he won a gold medal in the 110-metre hurdles at the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics . His victory secured China its first men 's track and field gold medal .

After a 13-month recovery period , Liu returned to the track at the 2009 Shanghai Grand Prix , finishing in second place . He went on to place first in several 110-metre hurdles competitions , including the 2010 Asian Games , 2011 Asian Championships , and 2012 Diamond Leagues held in Oregon and Shanghai .

His coach , Sun Haiping , told Xinhua on August 3 that Liu 's Achilles tendon injury had flared up at his training camp in Germany ahead of the London Olympics , although he said they were confident it was under control . Liu also pulled out of the London Diamond League in London in July , citing back problems .

His performance of 12.88 seconds in 2006 IAAF Super Grand Prix is his personal best and the world 's second-fastest record after Cuba 's Dayron Robles .
