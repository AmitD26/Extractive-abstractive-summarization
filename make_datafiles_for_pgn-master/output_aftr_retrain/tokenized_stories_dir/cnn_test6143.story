-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The rise of Brazil as an economic force has brought with it a policy challenge familiar here in the United States : immigration .

Recently crowned the world 's sixth-largest economy , Brazil has become an immigration magnet , both to low-skilled workers -- some of whom enter illegally -- and high-skilled workers looking for opportunities in the country 's thriving sectors .

Before , people left Brazil to chase a better life , he said . Now , the tide has turned .

In recent decades in Brazil , the education levels of the population have increased significantly , said Ernesto Amaral , a demographer and professor at the Federal University of Minas Gerais , Brazil .

`` But this negative impact is decreasing because we have the demand for skilled labor in Brazil , '' he said .

To meet this challenge , Brazil will have to ramp up its education efforts even more .

`` Immigration is important in the short run . We need these workers in Brazil right now , '' he said .

At the same time , an opposite effect is happening for low-skilled work , Amaral said .

The percentage of low-educated Brazilians is decreasing , but the demand for low-skilled labor is decreasing faster , he said .

Facing with illegal immigration from Haiti , Brazil 's National Council on Immigration agreed this month to provide 1,200 work visas per year to Haitians affected by the 2010 earthquake who emigrate to Brazil .

The work permits will be good for five years , a period during which the immigrants will find jobs and apply for extensions , or will return home . Unlike other work visas in Brazil , applicants need not have a job contract in hand when they arrive .

Under the plan , those immigrants already in the country who entered illegally will be `` regularized . ''

He continued : `` Immigrants add cultural value to Brazil and collaborate in the development of the nation . ''

But pleasantries aside , Brazil has an economy to protect , and the work visas might signify a closing of a door rather than an opening .

`` The attempt to grant visas is an attempt to limit and control the number that come , rather than being generous and open , '' said Albert Fishlow , professor emeritus at Columbia University and the author of `` Starting Over : Brazil Since 1985 . ''

The approach toward immigration by Brazil and the United States is n't that different after all , he said .

`` Both countries want to benefit from advances in technology and both countries want to attract people who are relatively skilled and have an opportunity to contribute to that , '' Fishlow said .

As for low-skilled immigration , there are other forces raising opposition to their entry .

The Haitian immigrants are arriving mostly to the western states of Amazonas and Acre , in the heart of the Amazon rain forest . A debate of great importance in Brazil currently is how to protect the Amazon . This is the larger issue behind the immigration debate , Fishlow said : will the Amazon be less protected with an influx of newcomers ?

One reported proposal would create two `` lines '' for foreigners applying for work visas in Brazil . One for highly-educated applicants , and one for everyone else .

The coordinator for the project , Ricardo Paes de Barros , declined to speak to CNN about the commission 's deliberations .
