-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In his campaign to become Alabama 's first African-American Democratic nominee for governor , U.S. Rep. Artur Davis downplayed race , bucked the black establishment and watched his opponent rack up endorsements from the state 's key minority political groups .

Sparks will face the winner of the Republican contest , which will be decided in a July 13 runoff . Current Republican Gov. Bob Riley could not seek re-election because he is term-limited by law .

`` As I leave the stage , I hope that this district will continue to advance . Let 's keep on believing in Alabama . Let 's keep on believing in tomorrow , '' he said in a speech from his congressional district .

Had the four-term congressman come out on top , he could have become Alabama 's first black governor and only the third elected black governor in United States history .

The historical implications of a Davis victory were not lost on the Deep South . A black man could have taken the oath of office near where Gov. George Wallace declared `` Segregation today , segregation tomorrow , segregation forever ! '' in his 1963 inaugural address and where Jefferson Davis took the oath of office as president of the Confederate States of America in 1861 .

`` He sees himself as a leader rather than a black leader , '' said Glen Browder , a former Alabama Democratic congressman and author of `` Stealth Reconstruction : An Untold Story of Racial Politics in Recent Southern History . ''

Davis opted against soliciting the endorsements of the major black political organizations in the state , all of which went to Sparks .

`` The African-American voters who will participate in the primary need no permission , and no sample ballots , to decide who they favor in this governor 's race , '' Davis said of his decision , The Birmingham News reported .

`` They still carry the scars of the civil rights movement , where blacks had to stick together , '' said Browder . '' -LSB- Davis -RSB- does not have those scars , but he is the beneficiary of those wars . It 's a generational fight that 's going on throughout the South . ''

A primary win for Davis would have `` rewritten the textbook on Southern racial politics , '' he said , sending a message to Democratic candidates that they can win without those groups ' backing .

His loss shows that the old guard has not lost its grip on the black electorate , Browder said .

But it was n't just the clout of the black establishment that made some black voters question Davis .

`` Artur Davis did do something to make black people not want to vote for him , and that is his ` no ' vote for health care reform . Even before the black political groups stepped in the picture and refused to endorse him , he had already established a negative relationship with some of the black voters , '' said Angela Lewis , an associate professor of black political behavior at the University of Alabama-Birmingham .

Davis , a friend of President Obama and an early supporter of his campaign , voted against the president 's health care reform package in November . While none of Alabama 's representatives voted in favor of the bill , Davis was the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus to vote against it .

Davis has tried to keep the focus off of race throughout his years in politics . During Davis ' first successful campaign , incumbent Earl Hilliard tried to portray his challenger as not `` black enough '' for Alabama 's 7th District , which includes urban areas in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa and rural , predominately black areas in the western part of the state . The argument failed to resonate , and Davis won the election .

In announcing his gubernatorial run in February 2009 , Davis said he 's always clung to one central belief : `` I think the poet was wrong when he said that the past shall guide our steps and that we shall judge the future by that which has already happened .
