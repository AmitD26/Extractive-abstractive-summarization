It 's a sign of how stretched Democrats are in defending their own turf across the country that they can no longer afford to go on offense in the marquee race against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .

`` Money is not an issue in this campaign , '' a Grimes source said .

While the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is coming off the air , national Democrats are still likely to spend money on the ground in Kentucky before election day to help boost Grimes ' get out the vote operation .

Grimes has been under fire for twice in the last week -- first in an editorial board meeting , and then in a debate with McConnell -- dodging questions about whether she voted for President Barack Obama -- which led NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' moderator Chuck Todd to say that the Democratic secretary of state had `` disqualified herself , '' and Republicans to immediately place that comment in a TV ad .

The source said Grimes ' campaign has n't polled on how the fallout over her refusal to disclose how she voted has affected the race , but sees it as a national media-fueled issue .

`` The people of Kentucky accept her explanation , '' the source said , adding that `` not one person has come up to her to say she needs to divulge '' how she 's voted .
