-LRB- AOL Autos -RRB- -- Robert Lutz , vice-chairman of General Motors , caused a stir in the auto industry -- and in the automotive press -- when he announced in January of 2007 that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric car would be ready for mass production and on the road , by the end of 2010 .

Because he was making this pronouncement at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan , -- in conjunction with the unveiling of the Volt concept car -- skeptics thought that Lutz 's statement was a bit too optimistic .

Some thought it might be one of those that falls into the category of `` speaking more from hope than experience , '' and that it was more a rallying cry for the troops than an attainable reality .

After all , at the time , reliable long-term and cost effective lithium-ion batteries required to power a plug-in electric cars seemed to be years away . But now , almost two years later , GM still seems confident that the 2010 launch date will be met .

And in June , Ford also dispatched an Escape Plug-In Hybrid flex-fuel vehicle -- which means it can run on E85 -- to the U.S. Department of Energy . Both of those deliveries were for purposes of road-testing the vehicles to see how they perform over the long haul .

Some obstacles still need to be overcome , but with gasoline projected to stay high , automakers may have more incentive than ever to bring a plug-in electric car to market . AOL Autos : Most-popular fuel-efficient cars

So this seemed like a good time to check in with the major players in the plug-in sweepstakes -- and talk to a research group that is working in conjunction with the automakers -- to get an update on their progress .

It also offered a chance to discuss the various aspects of the march toward the electric car being not only a reality , but perhaps a ubiquitous presence on American highways . AOL Autos : Best resale value cars

How it works

The above-named automakers are each using somewhat different variations of plug-in electric-car technology -- that is , they 're using different variations of plug-in battery technology and a gas engine .

Volt owners will be able to fully charge its lithium-ion battery by plugging it into a 110-volt outlet for approximately six hours a day , which for most drivers will presumably be while they are sleeping . AOL Autos : Luxury cars with best gas mileage

Eighteen months ago , many in the industry thought that the internally-mandated 2010 date was just too much to expect , given all of the technology and cost implications .

`` Well , it is definitely a compressed time frame , '' Posawatz conceded . `` It is unusual to develop a new vehicle and a new propulsion system at the same time . But the analogy that Mr. Lutz used was when he compared it to President Kennedy saying that we were going to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade , not ` whenever we feel like it . '

`` Ideally , engineers would like the time to make a new product that 's just perfect , but the beauty of this time line is that is makes a statement that GM wants to take a leadership position in this endeavor , with all of those benefits and privileges that would come with that , '' Posawatz continued . `` There is a tremendous opportunity for whoever is the technological leader when it comes to displacing petroleum as the primary source of fuel for automobiles . ''

`` Obviously , prospects for having a plug-in electric vehicle on the road , in high volumes , are better than they have ever been , '' Duvall said . `` Back in 2001 , we conducted a study and projected 2010 as the year that the plug-in electric car would be able to be commercialized , so the current schedule is indeed meeting our expectations .

`` The current gas-electric hybrids have been an important step , because they really have allowed for the most efficient use of gasoline to date , because they 've minimized a lot of the waste of fuel that occurred during starting , stopping and idling .

`` But a plug-in vehicle , if you 're the average driver , gives you a chance to completely eliminate the use of gasoline , '' Duvall noted . `` That would be a tremendous boon to the individual consumer , and would obviously be a boon to the environment , and would benefit the nation geopolitically , given our current dependence on foreign oil . ''

Cost and durability

As mentioned previously , the hurdles to a mass-market launch thus far have been the cost and the efficiency of the lithium-ion battery . John Hanson , Toyota 's National Manager of Environmental , Safety & Quality Communications , thinks that these are significant challenges .

`` These are environments where there are dramatic temperature swings , and where the batteries will be subjected to dirt , debris , moisture , vibration , and possible crash situations , '' Posawatz said . `` So the challenge was to develop a battery that is not only cost effective , but one that can also meet these rigorous operational requirements , and one that will also last 10 years or 150,000 miles . ''

GM is currently working with a few different battery developers , who are sharing their research , and `` we have techs testing them for hours , and there is nothing we have encountered , from a technical standpoint , that was unexpected , or that would deter us from the 2010 date . ''

Posawatz also noted that `` one challenge has been getting the weight of the battery pack down , and we now have it down to 375 pounds . ''

As for cost , Posawatz is also aware that `` the price of the first batteries are frankly going to be unacceptable , from a long-term perspective , but we 're marching ahead regardless , because we know that once we get these cars into the marketplace , and the sales volume increases , the cost will come down . We 're not looking at making a profit on the first Volts we introduce to the public -- but that will happen over the longer term , as they become more popular and we ramp up production . ''

EPRI 's Duvall reframes that proposition , observing that , `` any carmaker who comes out with a new , revolutionary technology like this knows that the product will have to cross the valley of death initially , in that they wo n't make any profit from it . Profit will come later , after they 're on the market for a while and volumes have increased . ''
