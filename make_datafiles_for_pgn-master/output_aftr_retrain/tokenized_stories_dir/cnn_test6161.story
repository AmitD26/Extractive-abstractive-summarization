-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police from California 's Bay Area Rapid Transit system have begun questioning witnesses to a confrontation that led to a BART police officer shoving an unruly man into a glass window , a top official said Monday .

`` We will take our time and we will cover everything that needs to be covered , '' said Daniel Hartwig , the patrol commander for the BART police force .

The incident was captured on video and posted on the Internet , but has since been taken down . Hartwig said investigators have asked the person who posted the video online for his help , but had not received a response .

Police released recordings of 911 calls in which witnesses and a train operator complained that the man arrested , Michael Joseph Gibson , appeared drunk and combative . In a statement issued earlier , BART police said he was `` yelling racial slurs and profanity at passengers and challenging customers to fight . ''

The video showed Gibson being pulled off the train by an officer who put him in an arm grip and forcibly walked him toward the station wall , which is topped by large windows . In the video , the officer forced Gibson against the window , which shattered .

It was unclear exactly what caused the glass to break . The officer sustained facial cuts requiring stitches and a concussion , while Gibson suffered cuts to his hand , forearm , palm and head . The officer was placed on leave due to his injuries , authorities said .

Gibson , 37 , of San Leandro , California , is to appear in court Tuesday afternoon , according to jail paperwork . He faces charges of battery on a police officer with injury and resisting arrest -- both felonies -- and public intoxication , a misdemeanor .

His sister , Lisa Gibson , told CNN on Sunday that her brother was diagnosed with bipolar/schizophrenic disorder and is under a doctor 's care . She said he was released from hospitalization earlier this month .
