`` As a result , they believe they do n't have to answer to any government authority , including courts , taxing entities , motor vehicle departments or law enforcement , '' the agency says .

`` They are one step away from becoming domestic terrorists , '' Emmett said .

Sovereign citizens have served fraudulent paperwork at banks and courthouses , the agent added .

`` It 's interesting to note that the homes that sovereign citizens chose to occupy are often high-dollar homes , often in the million-dollar range , '' said Emmett . `` We find -LRB- it -RRB- very hypocritical that they seek out these nice homes in nice neighborhoods to occupy . ''

On March 3 , a sheriff 's department in an Atlanta suburb evicted a couple who had filed invalid papers claiming ownership and stayed in a foreclosed home for months , authorities said . Fearing the pair had guns , the department used a SWAT team .

The male resident , who claimed to be associated with the Black Hebrew Israelites , had first gone to court , arguing , `` It would be unfortunate that the people are subject to Sheriff as the peace breaker and promoter of unhappiness , and the people have to protect themselves from the ones employed to protect the people , '' Mitchell said .

The man was not arrested because he made no specific threat , according to CNN affiliate WSB . No weapons were found .

`` We 're definitely seeing an increase in the sovereign citizen movement , '' Sheriff Kemuel Kimbrough Sr. told WSB . `` But this is the first one where we 've had significant amount of threats of violence . ''

The FBI said sovereign citizens are responsible for many crimes , including impersonating police officers , threatening judges and using fake currency and documents .

The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery , Alabama , has warned about the movement 's growing popularity and calls it a magnet for far-right extremists .
