The initiative is the brainchild of Fred Swaniker , a Ghanaian-born entrepreneur who hopes to instil a new generation with the skills to navigate Africa towards prosperity in future years .

`` We get young people from all across the continent , bring them here initially for two years -LSB- and -RSB- give them this hands-on leadership practice , '' says Swaniker .

This , he says , helps prepare them for a future at the very top of society , whilst equipping them with the skills `` to do something much bigger for the continent '' in the future .

So far over 400 students have taken part in the ALA 's leadership program and over the next 50 years , Swaniker says the school 's aim is to create 6,000 new leaders for Africa .

This rigorous selection process is designed to single out not only the brightest students from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds , but also those who have shown strong tendencies towards initiative , communication and leadership , Swaniker says .

`` The best leaders are not necessarily the smartest people , '' he explains .

`` At the heart of what we 're doing is a belief that the main reason why Africa has not met its full potential today is due to the quality of the leaders that we have , '' he says .

`` So this is really an attempt to solve that issue ... the Africa Leadership Academy , is really saying : let 's address -LSB- this -RSB- , instead of trying to deal with all the symptoms of bad leadership that we have in Africa . ''

Swaniker identifies his own formative experiences as a teenager as a key factor in his desire to found the ALA. .

At just 17 years old -- and on a gap year before beginning university -- he was appointed headmaster of a school in Botswana . He says the practical knowledge he gained in his time there gave him the confidence necessary to achieve success later on in his career , not least in setting up the ALA. .

`` We 're trying to create leaders in all segments of society , so leaders in science and technology , leaders in business , entrepreneurs who can create the millions of jobs that we need on the continent , political leaders who can create the policies that we need to develop properly , '' he says .

`` We really need leaders from all walks of life to solve the diverse challenge that we have in Africa , '' he adds .
