They got what they wanted .

In fact , this week , they may have gotten more than they wanted .

The current curator of @Sweden is a foul-mouthed mother of two who has tweeted photos of herself breastfeeding and of a dish she called strawberries with milk and urine . She 's also made a joke about Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury having AIDS , the disease that led to his death .

Some followers of the account found her musing about why some people hate Jews particularly shocking .

Sonja Abrahamsson 's series of tweets on the subject Tuesday began : `` Whats the fuzz with jews . You ca n't even see if a person is a jew , unless you see their penises , and even if you do , you ca n't be sure !? ''

She went on to point out that the Nazis made Jews wear stars so they could tell who was a Jew , mentioned that she grew up in a place with no Jews and concluded : `` Im sorry if some of you find the question offensive . Thats was not my purpose . I just do n't get why some people hates jews so much .

Abrahamsson also ruminates in extremely crude terms about what would result from crossing the movie `` Snow White '' with the thriller `` Seven . ''

And she expresses a certain open-mindedness about fans of teen idol Justin Bieber : `` If someone likes Justin Bieber in Sweden , we dont care . We let them . We dont call him ` gay ' if we mean ` he sucks ' . We say ` he sucks . ' ''

Her tweets have prompted dozens of questions and some criticism .

`` we 've been to Sweden . And your behaviour is extremely unbecoming . They should take your passport away , '' one person tweeted at her .

Her personal biography on the @Sweden website says she 's `` a single and low educated mother , but at least I do n't do drugs and prostitution . ''

They knew what they were getting into when they handed over the keys to the account , Visit Sweden marketing director Marie Ziv said .

`` We have n't called her or told her to stop or back down . We want her to continue being herself , '' she said . `` It 's our choice not to censor anyone because we want to keep it real . ''

@Sweden aims to `` create interest and arouse curiosity for Sweden and the wide range the country has to offer , '' the project says online . It started on December 10 and has had 24 curators so far , Ziv said .

Abrahamsson did not immediately respond to a tweet from CNN .
