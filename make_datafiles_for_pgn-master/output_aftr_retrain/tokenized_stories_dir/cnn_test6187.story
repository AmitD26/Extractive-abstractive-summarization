Documents that had been stored in secret archives for years show that the `` massacre was committed on the direct orders of Stalin , '' a draft of the declaration says , according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency .

The masterminding of the Katyn Massacre has been a lingering , contentious issue between the two former communist nations .

The World War II massacre , in which an estimated 20,000 Polish officers were murdered at point blank in the village of Katyn , has tainted Russian-Polish relations . The Duma 's Friday vote comes as Russian President Dmitry Medvedev prepares to travel to Poland in December .

For decades , the Soviet government blamed the killings on Nazi Germany .

In 1990 , Russia finally admitted to what many in Poland had long suspected : The Soviet Union secretly murdered as many as 22,000 Polish soldiers and civilians in the early days of World War II in an attempt to pre-emptively suppress a Polish rebellion against communist rule .

That year , Russian prosecutors also launched a criminal case into the killings , but that case was closed in 2004 . Since then , the country has handed over some investigation files to Polish officials .

This year , a 2007 film about the massacre aired on Russian television for the first time .

Communists , who opposed the declaration , claim German authorities actually executed the Polish soldiers . The party 's leader has dubbed attempts to blame Stalin part of `` Soviet history falsification '' as part of an `` ideological war , '' RIA Novosti reported .

Former Polish President Lech Kaczynski was killed in a plane crash earlier this year when he was headed to a memorial at the massacre site .
