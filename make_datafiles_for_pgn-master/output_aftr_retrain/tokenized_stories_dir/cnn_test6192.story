Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A police officer removed a sheet covering Whitney Houston 's naked corpse and remarked , `` Damn , she 's still looking good , huh ? '' according to another officer at the scene .

The accusation against the Beverly Hills Police detective was revealed in a labor dispute filing made last week by Brian Weir , who was the senior patrol sergeant called to Houston 's hotel room after she was found dead in a bathtub on February 11 , 2012 .

Weir 's complaint , filed on September 11 with California 's labor department , said he covered Houston 's body with a sheet `` to prevent contamination or potential DNA and other potential evidence on the body '' and to `` preserve the dignity of the remains . ''

It said that Nutall -- who was assigned to investigate fraud , forgery and auto burglaries -- `` knelt beside and leaned over the decedent , removed the sheet and/or other covering from the body of the decedent to an area below the pubic region of the decedent 's body and came in close proximity to touching the body of the decedent while making inappropriate comments to the effect and substance that the decedent ` looked attractive for a woman of her age and current state ' and ` Damn , she 's still looking good , huh ? ' ''

Weir , who had been in the `` coveted positions '' of sergeant with the SWAT and K-9 units , claims he told Beverly Hills officials about the incident , which he said he believed violated state and federal laws .

After complaining to his superiors and others in the Beverly Hills government , Weir was removed from his `` coveted positions '' of sergeant with the SWAT and K-9 units , denied promotion to other positions , removed from supervisory duties , denied special pay , denied training , harassed and ostracized , given inappropriate and harassing comments an/or documents , and subjected to conduct undermining his authority as a superior , the filing said . He also lost overtime pay , the filing alleged .

When the assistant returned to the locked room at 3:35 p.m. , she found Houston `` lying face down in the bathtub filled with water , unresponsive . ''

When paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later , they moved Houston to the living room floor . At 3:55 p.m. , 20 minutes after she was found by the assistant , paramedics concluded she was dead , the report said .

Houston won six Grammys and sold 170 million albums , singles and videos over her career .

In recent years , the singer 's accomplishments were overtaken by her struggles with drug addiction .
