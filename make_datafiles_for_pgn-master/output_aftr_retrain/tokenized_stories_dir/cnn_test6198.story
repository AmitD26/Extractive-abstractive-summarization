Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The air traffic controller suspended for failing to respond to two planes heading into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport has told investigators that he had fallen asleep , according to the National Transportation Safety Board .

The controller , a 20-year veteran , `` indicated that he had fallen asleep for a period of time while on duty , '' according to a statement released Thursday by the safety board . `` He had been working his fourth consecutive overnight shift -LRB- 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. -RRB- . ''

Federal Aviation Administration chief Randy Babbitt said earlier Thursday that the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident and that the air traffic controller has been suspended from all operational duties .

The situation began at 12:10 a.m. Wednesday , when an American Airlines plane attempted to call the tower to get clearance to land and got no answer , said Peter Knudson , a spokesman for the safety board . The plane had been in contact with a regional air traffic control facility , and a controller at that facility advised the pilot that he , too , had been unable to contact anyone at the tower , according to a recording of air control traffic at the website liveatc.net .

`` 1012 , '' the controller said , using the airline 's flight number , `` called a couple of times on landline and tried to call on the commercial line , and there 's no answer .

`` The tower is apparently unmanned . ''

Apparently asked why by a pilot , the controller later responded , `` Well , I 'm going to take a guess and say that the controller got locked out . I 've heard of this happening before . Fortunately , it 's not very often , '' he said .

Knudson said the plane landed without incident in a situation termed an `` uncontrolled airport . ''

The controller 's admission that he was asleep during the landing emergency underscores concerns about the effect of fatigue on underslept controllers at work .

`` That fatigue has contributed to controller errors , '' Rosenker wrote .

-- A September 25 , 2001 , incident in which a Denver air traffic controller approved a request from a cargo plane pilot to take off from a runway that had been closed for construction . The aircraft came within 32 feet of hitting lights that had been installed in the construction zone . The controller said he 'd slept only two hours between work days .

-- A July 8 , 2001 , incident in which a Denver controller cleared one passenger plane to cross a runway where another was about to land . The landing pilot hit the brakes , stopping 810 feet from the other plane . The controller said he had worked three shifts in two days .

`` I am outraged by it , '' Babbitt said . `` We 're going to make sure something like this never happens again . ''

`` That said ... this should not have happened , '' Babbitt said . `` We should not have had this gap in communication . We had to rely on a backup system , which should n't have happened . ''

`` It is not acceptable to have just one controller in the tower managing air traffic in this critical air space . I have also asked ... Babbitt to study staffing levels at other airports around the country , '' he said .

Knudson said it 's not uncommon for planes to land at uncontrolled airports . He said control towers at some fields across the country shut down for the night , and planes still land . However , he could not comment on whether that practice was ever used at Reagan National .

The American Airlines flight , which was coming from Miami , had 91 passengers and six crew members aboard , airline spokesman Ed Martelle said . The United Airlines flight was arriving from Chicago with 63 passengers and five crew members , spokeswoman Megan McCarthy said .
