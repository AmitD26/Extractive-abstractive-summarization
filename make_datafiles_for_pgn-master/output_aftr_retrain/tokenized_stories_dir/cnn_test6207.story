-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As relatives began to say their final goodbyes to their slain children , investigators in Connecticut worked Monday to better understand what happened to them , including digging deeper into the gun and computer use of the 20-year-old man who ended their lives .

Why ? Authorities have n't given a motive . But they are looking into shards of the remnants of the shooter 's smashed home computer -- -- including e-mails he may have sent and websites he may have visited -- hoping it will shed light on his thinking , a law enforcement official said Monday .

The weapons belonged to his mother , Nancy Lanza , who was found shot dead in her Newtown home Friday . She collected firearms , shot them and went to gun ranges , Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives spokeswoman Debora Seifert said Monday .

Beyond such developments , officials overall were tight-lipped Monday about their investigation . Hundreds of state troopers , detectives and other law enforcement personnel are analyzing every round of ammunition fired , examining the gunman 's medical history and talking to witnesses , said Vance , the state police spokesman .

Investigators plan to interview a pair of adults wounded `` in their lower extremities . '' The hope is the two -- whom authorities have not identified , though a parent last week said one was a vice principal at the school -- could , `` when it 's medically appropriate , '' play a key role in helping to reconstruct what happened , said Vance .

`` I 'm not at liberty to discuss any of the information so far uncovered , but suffice it to say ... we will cover every single facet , '' the police spokesman said of the investigation .

First funerals and addressing ` the unthinkable '

The anguish caused by the shooting was visible Monday outside a Newtown funeral home , as young and old streamed in to pay their respects to 6-year-old Jack Pinto .

The 6-year-old himself was a budding athlete . Shortly before his death , he wrestled in his first match and earned a medal , said New Milford Youth Wrestling Association President Ken Linder .

Many of his teammates wore medals into Jack 's funeral Monday . Others , many of them about his age , came in Newtown youth sports shirts . The funeral home could n't contain the mourners , with the line extending to the street .

Jack was n't the only one remembered Monday . So , too , was Noah Pozner , another 6-year-old whose family said he could get what he wanted just by batting his long eyelashes .

`` How do you tell them that 's how their brother died ? '' Victoria Haller said Sunday . `` It 's the unthinkable , really . ''

More funerals are coming . For instance , there 's Jessica Rekos on Tuesday . Benjamin Wheeler on Thursday . Madeleine Hsu on Friday . All of them are 6 years old .

`` Once it settles in , I think my heart will break . ''

When he was the Newtown public schools ' director of security , Richard Novia knew Adam Lanza . In high school , the then-teen had psychological issues and would sometimes `` withdraw into his own little world , '' Novia said .

But he never saw Friday 's carnage coming .

Lanza worked with Novia in Newtown High 's Tech Club , with his mother -- who the former security director described as `` doting '' and very involved in her children 's lives -- often taking part in its activities . She 'd also be called to the school when Adam Lanza `` would have little episodes ... where he could not ... talk or communicate , even what he was feeling . ''

Citing local school authorities , Vance said Monday there was `` no connection '' between the shooter and with the elementary school he targeted . Cynthia Jaroszewksi , though , told CNN that Lanza once attended that school and was even in the same first - and third-grade classes as her daughter , Rebecca .

No class for Sandy Hook students ` until further notice '

As to Sandy Hook 's current students and faculty , they will be out of school `` until further notice , '' Newtown Police Lt. George Sinko said .

School will be in session for other students in town Tuesday , albeit after a 2-hour delay .

Massacre stirs debate about gun control

Read more : `` We ca n't tolerate this anymore , '' Obama says

While gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association have been largely silent since Friday 's shooting , others have spoken up .

Malloy , Connecticut 's governor , said Monday , `` I 'd love to hear the people argue that we need 30-round magazines and that 's somehow tied to the right to bear arms . We 're not talking about basic weapons that are used in hunting . ''

Sen. Joe Manchin , a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and `` proud gun owner , '' said he 's now committed to `` dialogue that would bring a total change '' given what happened in Newtown .

The debate is playing out not just in Washington , but across America .

John Licata told CNN 's iReport there needs to be better vetting before people buy guns , and assault weapons should be banned -- something Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , says she 'll propose once the new Congress convenes in January .

CNN iReporter Jameson Riley said the shooting shows the need for more armed guards in schools . Riley , a gun owner , said recent mass shootings have made him consider getting a concealed weapon permit .

`` I have a 2-year-old daughter , and she is the light of my life , '' he said . `` And I would like to protect her . ''
