Vaughan Foods of Moore , Oklahoma , is recalling romaine lettuce with `` use by '' dates of May 9 and May 10 , the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement . The company sold the lettuce to restaurants and food-service facilities , the administration said .

`` Food safety continues to be Vaughan Foods ' number one priority , '' said Mark Vaughan , president and CEO of the company . `` Vaughan management is not aware of any links to any food-borne illness associated with any product produced by Vaughan Foods . ''

Vaughan 's recall comes after Freshway Foods recalled romaine lettuce last week because of a possible connection to an outbreak of food-borne disease linked to E. coli O145 in Michigan , Ohio and New York .

A sickened Ohio State University student sued Freshway on Tuesday .

Freshman Richard Cardinale filed a lawsuit after his stool sample tested positive for E. coli O145 , according to court documents . He suffered from gastrointestinal problems including bloody diarrhea and dehydration and was hospitalized on April 14 for treatment .

`` We have a new form of deadly E.coli to contend with , '' said food safety lawyer Bill Marler , who is representing Cardinale .

`` It is past time for the government and industry to track this bug as it does E.coli O 157 : H7 , '' he said , referring to the best known form of toxic E.coli .

Authorities are investigating a farm near Yuma , Arizona , where the tainted lettuce was harvested , the Food and Drug Administration said . Vaughan Foods received lettuce from that farm , the administration said .

Though most healthy adults recover from E. coli O145 within a week , young children and the elderly are most at risk of developing HUS .

Federal health authorities are encouraging anyone with such symptoms to contact a health care provider immediately .

Ohio-based Freshway Foods said that the recalled shredded romaine lettuce was sold to wholesalers , food service outlets , and some in-store salad bars and delis .

The company said it sold the lettuce in question to businesses in Alabama , Connecticut , the District of Columbia , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Maryland , Massachusetts , Michigan , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Tennessee , Virginia , West Virginia and Wisconsin .
