-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 23rd hat-trick for Real Madrid on Saturday as Real Sociedad were brushed aside 5-1 at the Bernabeu .

The Portuguese maestro opened the scoring in the 12th minute before French striker Karim Benzema doubled the lead six minutes later .

The game was effectively over eight minutes later when Ronaldo tucked away his second goal of the night from the penalty spot .

Sami Khedira made it 4-0 in the 36th minute before the visitors reduced their arrears with Antoine Griezmann scoring in the 61st minute .

Inevitably it was Ronaldo who had the last word , bagging his third and Real 's fifth with 14 minutes remaining .
