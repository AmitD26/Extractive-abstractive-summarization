Chicago -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich arrived at a Colorado federal prison Thursday to begin serving a 14-year sentence on a corruption conviction , a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons said .

He was convicted of corruption in June 2011 after a jury returned 17 guilty verdicts against him . Among other allegations , he was accused of trying to profit as he considered whom to appoint to take Barack Obama 's open Senate seat .

Blagojevich called his impending prison stint a `` dark and hard journey , '' and said he should have been more humble .

His wife , Patti , remained cinched under his arm , squeezing back tears as the former governor spoke .

`` This , as bad as it is , is part of a long and hard journey that will only get worse before it gets better , '' Blagojevich said , telling his wife that he loved her .

He 'll serve his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution Englewood , southwest of Denver .

`` It 's difficult to put into words the challenges he and his family now face . But he draws strength from the incredible support he continues to receive from the people of Illinois and beyond . ''

Blagojevich also accused U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald of hiding taped evidence that would prove his innocence during that news conference .

`` I challenge Mr. Fitzgerald ... Why do n't you show up in court tomorrow and explain to everybody , explain to the whole world why you do n't want the tapes that you made played in court ? '' Blagojevich said to reporters at the time .

`` I 'll be in court tomorrow . I hope you 're man enough to show up , '' he added , referring to Fitzgerald .

Prosecutors said court-authorized wiretaps caught Blagojevich offering Obama 's Senate seat in exchange for personal gain , including a job with a nonprofit or union organization , corporate board posts for his wife , campaign contributions or a post in Obama 's administration .

He expressed frustration , according to prosecutors , that Obama transition officials were `` not willing to give me anything except appreciation . ''

Blagojevich also considered appointing himself to the post , mulling whether he might be better off being indicted as a senator rather than governor , and saying contacts he would make in the federal job would benefit him later , according to prosecutors .
