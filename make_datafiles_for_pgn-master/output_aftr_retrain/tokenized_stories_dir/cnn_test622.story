Until recently , the White House has understandably been focused on countering the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , a reality that allowed the Europeans -LRB- especially Germany -RRB- to take the lead in crafting a response to Russia 's aggression . But this U.S. reluctance to take center stage has allowed the Russians to exploit splits within Europe in the knowledge that the EU states would not fight force with force .

True , this openness to providing arms left Obama at odds with Merkel and many other European leaders , who feared it would escalate the conflict . But it also increased the pressure on Merkel and French President Francois Hollande to press for a deal to avoid what they feared might be a bigger conflict , fueled by U.S. weapons .

Yet even if U.S. weapons would not reach Ukrainian forces for months , the very commitment to provide them would insert the United States much more directly into the conflict . That commitment , more than the weapons themselves , is what could be a game changer .

Opponents of arming Ukraine have argued that weapons , even in fairly small quantities , could easily become the first step down a slippery slope of escalation . They are right , of course . But they also miss the bigger political context . The question is less whether some anti-tank missiles could turn the tide in the Donbas , and more what the decision to provide those missiles would say about Washington 's commitment to the fight for Ukraine and against Russia .

Left to themselves , the Europeans would be reluctant go down this path , but would likely do so should Moscow expand the conflict in the face of a wider U.S. role .

That is why Washington 's aversion to lethal assistance and outsourcing the search for a solution in Ukraine to the Europeans was a mistake . While better than letting Ukraine fight a losing war on its own , the Minsk agreement remains heavily tilted in Moscow 's favor , even if it holds .

Earlier , and more assertive U.S. involvement -LRB- including a commitment to provide military assistance -RRB- , would likely have produced a better , and quicker agreement . As it is , lethal assistance from the United States should remain on the table , along with the prospect of more drastic sanctions , as long as the ceasefire remains tenuous .

As Moscow fully understands , only the United States can confront Russia on its own terms . And if Washington truly cares about the success of Ukraine 's transformation and checking Russia 's revisionist aspirations , it needs to insert itself more squarely into the process , including with its hard power capabilities . Above all , Washington must continue being the main underwriter of European security .

The Kremlin knows that confronting the U.S. is much different from confronting the divided , economically vulnerable Europeans . Hopefully , the White House does as well .
