-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Elmore Leonard is something of a living legend among lovers of crime fiction . A favorite of millions of readers , a hero to scores of writers , he 's been called `` America 's greatest crime writer . '' The 86-year old author has been writing bestselling books for sixty years , mostly Westerns and crime novels . Many of them have been turned into hit movies , including `` 3:10 to Yuma , '' `` Get Shorty '' and `` Out of Sight . ''

Now , Leonard returns to one of his favorite characters in his newest book , his 45th novel to be exact , titled simply , `` Raylan . '' That would be U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens . The laid back , Stetson-wearing lawman first appeared in Leonard 's novels , `` Pronto '' and `` Riding the Rap '' and again in the 2001 short story , `` Fire in the Hole '' which became the basis for the hit TV show , `` Justified , '' starring Timothy Olyphant as the title character . The actor and the show are winning over fans , critics and Leonard himself . So much so that Leonard has returned to writing about `` Raylan . ''

The book just hit store shelves the same week the show had its third season premiere . Leonard , gracious and unassuming , shows no signs of slowing down at this point in his career .

CNN : Raylan feels like a character from one of your Westerns transplanted into one of your crime novels .

Leonard : He could have been and maybe that 's where I got him . The critics see him as a western character because of his hat but his hat was n't my idea , that was his -LRB- Olyphant 's -RRB- idea . I pictured a businessman 's Stetson , a much smaller cowboy hat if you will but one that 's kind of worn out and shaped exactly the way he likes it . I think the hat works . I did n't care for it at first but after a couple of episodes I liked the hat .

CNN : Do you have an active role with the TV show beyond your inspiration ?

Leonard : No and I do n't want to know what they 're doing because I do n't want to interfere with them . While I was writing `` Raylan '' I would send them pages and I said use what you want , if you do n't use any of it OK but if it fits use it . They found some places to use some scenes where they 're taking body parts from victims and selling them . They 're going to do it one of the episodes this year so that 's very gratifying . I like the way they write , boy . Sometimes I think the show is better than my writing .

Leonard : One of my favorites is George V. Higgins who wrote , `` The Friends of Eddie Coyle . '' Today I like reading Pete Dexter , Cormac McCarthy , Martin Amis , Margaret Atwood , Ron Hansen and Richard Bissell . He only wrote three or four books but he was a pilot on the Mississippi , piloting a string of barges up and down the river . The way he described his characters and the way they talked , I just loved him and he was funny . That 's what I missed in Hemingway because he never showed any sense of humor . I do n't know why he was so serious . I still read Hemingway . I still read his short stories because they 're so good . He does n't waste any words .

CNN : You 've been writing professionally for sixty years , where do you find your inspiration ?

Leonard : Absolutely , that 's it . To me writing is the most fun . It 's not always fun but finally when you make it come out the way you want it then you can say its fun , boy . Even writing a scene I 'll enjoy a particular scene and then several years later I 'll happen to read that scene again , not looking for it , I 'll just happen to open an older book and read and think oh my god and start laughing . I did n't laugh when I wrote it maybe I smiled , I do n't know . I was startled by the scene ; I thought why 'd I think of that ? Why did I put that in there but it seemed to work .

Leonard : It 's got to be re-writing . It takes me at least three handwritten pages to get one clean , typed page with every word in place . The next morning I 'll read these pages again and I 'll start to make little changes , not much usually I 'll just add things . The first time I write it 's more spare then when I finally get into it , just add a word maybe add a cigarette or a drink or something like that . I do n't want it to sound like writing . I say leave out the parts people tend to skip . Just do n't overwrite .

CNN : What 's next for you ?
