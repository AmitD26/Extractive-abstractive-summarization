Two employees of the court 's Office of Administration told CNN of an ongoing kickback scheme involving Cambodian staff . The staffers asked their identities be protected out of fear of retribution to themselves and their families .

`` We are talking about 30 to 40 or even a little bit more ... a month , '' said one employee , referring to the total amount allegedly taken from employees . `` Thousand dollars . Thirty or 40,000 dollars a month . ''

Cambodian staff at the office , they say , are forced to hand the money over -- a chunk of their salaries -- and the funds go to an official .

The Cambodian government told CNN a senior Cambodian court official was investigated for corruption , but was exonerated . `` They told me they can not find any proof of kick-back or corruption , '' said Khieu Kanharith , government information minister . `` If you want the court -- the trial -- to go ahead , separate the two cases . ''

However , a defense attorney for one of the defendants said the trial and the allegations of corruption are inextricably linked .

Defense attorneys say they plan to bring up the corruption allegations during the trial in an effort to discredit the court .

The Cambodian government refused United Nations requests for an independent international war crimes trial for the Khmer Rouge defendants , agreeing only to a joint trial where the government participates along with the international judges . Watch a report on the trial a Khmer Rouge torture camp commandant ''

Prosecutors are attempting to prove that the five defendants played a significant role in the deaths of as many as two million Cambodians during Khmer Rouge rule of the country from 1975 to 1979 . The trial has already cost $ 56 million , more than $ 10 million per defendant .

But the court has asked for another $ 50 million to carry it through the end of 2009 . The total could go higher if the trial continues into 2010 .

The United Nations says its internal affairs body -- the Office of Internal Oversight Services -LRB- OIOS -RRB- -- is investigating the corruption allegations within the court , but wo n't elaborate .

`` This matter has been under investigation by OIOS , whose work is confidential , '' the United Nations said in a statement . `` The result of the probe will be submitted to the Cambodian government for further action . ''

`` To me , it is really sick . How can you take money from people each month and look people in the eye and say , ` Oh , I do n't know anything about it ? ' '' one employee asked .
