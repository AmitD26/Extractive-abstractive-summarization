-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In South Africa , Nelson Mandela 's 95th birthday is being marked by celebrations , good deeds , and an exhibition of stunning new posters of the country 's former president .

Mandela himself will be spending the day in hospital in Pretoria , where he is said to be in a critical but stable condition , battling a lung infection .

Since 2009 , Mandela 's birthday has been designated `` Nelson Mandela International Day . '' The celebration encourages people around the globe to partake in 67 minutes of public service : one minute per year of service that the former statesman , also known as Madiba , has given to his country .

It 's a day that many feared might not come , as Mandela has been receiving urgent medical care since June . Now breathing with the help of a machine , family and friends have been optimistic about his response to treatment , with former president Thabo Mbeki even suggesting he may soon be discharged .

Admirers worldwide are hoping for the Nobel Peace laureate 's recovery , with Mandela Day providing the perfect opportunity to celebrate his life and achievements . A survey released last week found that 89 % of South Africans planned to commemorate the day , with thousands of school children across the country singing `` happy birthday '' this morning .

Also marking the occasion , at the University of Pretoria the Mandela Poster Project is exhibiting images of Mandela from around the world .
