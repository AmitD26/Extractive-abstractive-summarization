Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Before it 's signed , the freshly minted security agreement between the United States and Afghanistan must face the scrutiny of the Afghan people in Kabul , starting Thursday .

Whether or not to support the presence in their country of a limited number of U.S. troops beyond next year , when Washington plans to end their combat mission .

`` They have to pass it , '' said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry , who announced Wednesday that he and Afghan President Hamid Karzai had arrived at the agreement . `` It 's up to the people of Afghanistan . ''

But is the jirga 's decision binding ? And what happens next ?

The meetings are intended to bridge divides between the country 's divergent ethnic groups and create consensus among them .

Is the loya jirga 's decision binding ?

Not really . The loya jirga is by no means fully democratic , but the opinions of its 2,000-plus members are an important indicator of how the Afghan people feel . In the past , Karzai has said he respects the body and would acquiesce to its decision .

He has been heckled at least once at a past gathering .

After the opening session Thursday , the jirga will break up into smaller working groups for the next three days . The members will discuss the agreement among themselves and then present their recommendations to the full gathering .

If the loya jirga passes the security agreement , what 's next ?

On Thursday , he told the tribal elders that the arrangement wo n't be signed until after elections scheduled for April 2014 , and Karzai has reached the term limit set by his country 's constitution . He told CNN 's Christiane Amanpour it 's `` absolutely time to go . ''

If all goes well , when does the agreement go into effect ?

The final language of the security agreement -- which Kerry and Karzai reached a deal on -- guides the role of American troops in Afghanistan .

According to the tentative deal :

-- U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan .

-- It mentions U.S. government funding for Afghan security forces .

-- It gives the U.S. military strict jurisdiction if a U.S. soldier is alleged to commit unlawful acts on Afghan soil .

-- On the other hand , Afghan authorities may request that anyone be removed from the country .

So , what are the sticking points ?

But the agreement does not address past transgressions .

Why not ?

But the U.S. has made a promise , Karzai told the loya jirga Thursday . President Obama has vowed that U.S. troops wo n't raid Afghan homes barring exceptional cases involving direct threat to American citizens .

In a letter from Obama to Karzai , made public by Afghan officials , the U.S. President reiterates that U.S. forces in Afghanistan will `` continue to make every effort to respect the sanctity and dignity of Afghans in their homes and in their daily lives , just as we do for our own citizens . ''

`` As this new agreement states , U.S. forces shall not enter Afghan homes for the purposes of military operations , except under extraordinary circumstances involving urgent risk to life and limb of U.S. nationals , '' Obama wrote . `` The U.S. commitment to Afghanistan 's independence , territorial integrity , and national unity , as enshrined in our Strategic Partnership Agreement , is enduring , as is our respect for Afghan sovereignty . ''

Is the issue of immunity a deal-breaker ?

The U.S. has said that unless American troops get immunity from Afghan prosecution , it will pull out all its troops by the end of 2014 -- like it did from Iraq at the end of 2011 . That could have significant consequences for Afghanistan . It needs some troop presence for training its forces and for stability .

Can this obstacle be resolved ?

`` I can go to the Afghan people and tell them that , well , if we are to ask for a U.S. presence in Afghanistan for that broader security and stability , there are things that they want in return , '' he told Amanpour in January . `` And immunity is the principle thing that they want . So I will argue for it . And I can tell you with relatively good confidence that they will say , all right , let 's do it . ''

President Barack Obama has promised to end U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014 . The key word here is `` combat . '' Speaking on Wednesday , White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that same point : `` The war in Afghanistan will end next year , as the president has promised . The combat mission will be over . ''

But the approval of a security agreement would pave the way for American troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that .

Kerry said the U.S. military 's role in Afghanistan would be `` very limited , '' adding `` it is entirely -LRB- to -RRB- train , equip and assist '' Afghan forces .
