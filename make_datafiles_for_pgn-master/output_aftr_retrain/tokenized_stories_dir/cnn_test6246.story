Austin , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Podcasting saved Kevin Smith 's career .

So said the filmmaker -LRB- and you can throw a few slashes after that title these days -RRB- at the South by Southwest festival here on Monday during a panel called , appropriately , `` The Business of Kevin Smith . ''

`` I had no idea , but that would become the f -- ing center of everything I 'm doing now , '' said Smith , who broke into moves after making 1994 's indie hit `` Clerks '' for roughly $ 25,000 .

Smith said he was working on `` Zach and Miri Make a Porno , '' which he wrote and directed , when he realized the passion that led him to make movies like `` Dogma '' and `` Chasing Amy '' was gone .

And that led to `` SModcast , '' a weekly podcast that he and friend/co-producer Scott Mosier launched in 2007 and do to this day .

It was free . But as its online audience grew , the opportunities to make money arose .

Then came paid advertising . -LRB- The first sponsor notoriously being adult product Fleshlight -RRB- . Then a paid version of the podcast , `` SModcost , '' which contains bonus features but no ads .

In a way , the podcasting model is a logical extension for Smith , who took to the Internet early .

In the mid - '90s , a friend told him he had to go see a website someone had created for `` Clerks . '' Smith had to go to an Internet cafÃ © to view it . And as he admitted Monday , he was n't exactly Web savvy .

`` I was like Scotty in ` Star Trek , ' '' he said . `` I was like , ` Computer ! Take me to ` Clerks ' ! ''
