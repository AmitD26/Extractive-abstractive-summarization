-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A strong , politically savvy woman is just what Japan and the United States need to strengthen relations on both sides of the Pacific .

Not that there is a dearth of other pressing problems at stake .

North Korea 's nuclear aspirations show no sign of abating , while worries about tensions in the East China Sea over a handful of barren rocks possibly triggering armed conflict between Japan and China persist . Meanwhile , an arms race is building up in the Asia-Pacific , and the United States needs to strengthen ties with solid allies such as Japan more than ever .

A skillful diplomat should be able to navigate those choppy waters under the leadership of the Obama administration . Where an ambassador can make a real difference in bilateral relations is in highlighting issues that are not necessarily being pushed forward by her bosses at the State Department . For Kennedy , her cause should rightly be unleashing the power of women in Japan and the United States .

Japan is woefully behind most other industrialized countries -- and developing nations alike . According to the World Economic Forum 's 2012 gender equity survey , it ranks in 101st place among 135 countries .

The United States , meanwhile , comes in as number 22 , and European countries dominate the top tier of the ranking that measures women 's economic opportunities , education , health and political empowerment .

Not only does Japan need major policy overhaul to encourage more women to be more ambitious professionally , but there also needs to be a significant shift in mindset to convince women that they can and should strive for economic empowerment .

As John F. Kennedy 's only daughter , Caroline Kennedy 's personal experiences hardly resonate with the average woman . Yet she has enjoyed access to some of the world 's most powerful and inspiring people since an early age , and she can leverage her position as ambassador to highlight what women in Japan and the United States can aspire .

Kennedy could encourage high-powered women such as Facebook 's chief operating officer , Sheryl Sandberg , to spread a U.S. brand of self-made powerful women who have prospered in places such as Silicon Valley . She could reach out to people such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to talk about her personal struggles in juggling personal ambition and family needs , which will resonate with all women regardless of nationality or economic status .

Japan has a very long way to go to for gender equality . The United States does much better , but it could do more as well . Both countries can acknowledge that there is a problem and be open to learning from nations that have encouraged female leadership and success to blossom .

Given Kennedy 's high profile , she could shed light on the issue and push for concrete action . And by being humble and acknowledging America 's failings in promoting women to leadership positions , Kennedy would avoid the label of trying to impose U.S. values on her host country .

By becoming a champion of female leadership in Japan and the United States , Kennedy could leave a powerful legacy of helping to enhance U.S.-Japan relations .
