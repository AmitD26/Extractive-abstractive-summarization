-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jersey , Guernsey , Holstein ; the world 's dairy cattle breeds bear the names of some of the wettest , lushest , and greenest places in Europe , testament to the fact that to produce milk you need a lot of water .

Saudi Arabia -- with an average annual rainfall of just 2.3 inches -LRB- 59 mm -RRB- -- might seem an unlikely candidate to be among the world 's top 10 dairy producers , but its mega-dairy Almarai has grown to be one of the biggest food producers in the Persian Gulf .

`` The Californian model is simply that you do n't have to grow all your grass and raise your own feed crops , you can import feed and water and all your input and house a thousand head of dairy cattle on just 40 acres of land , '' Butler told CNN .

`` The other side of sustainable , of course , is whether they get the price they want for the milk they produce , but I assume that they do , '' he said .

From food security to big exports

Forty years later and the company is a diversified regional giant selling juices , poultry , baked products and infant formula .

With a total herd of 135,000 dairy cattle , Almarai 's installation at Al Kharj 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- south of the capital Riyadh , houses one of its largest herds of 67,000 .

The company 's statistics are staggering : the entire herd produces 2.5 million liters of milk a day -- an average of 40 liters per cow per day roughly double the European average .

Technology to beat the heat

The secret to making a dairy successful in one of the world 's most arid environments is to apply technology -- and a lot of it .

At normal desert temperatures that can reach as high 50 degrees Celsius , milk production would normally plummet , the produce would spoil quickly and dangerous bacteria would form .

However , every step of the process of keeping the Holstein milking cows at a perfect temperature of between 21 and 23 degrees Celsius -LRB- 70 and 73 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- is automated .

Overhead misters in the open-sided sheds that house the herds send out clouds of moisture that wet the flanks of the herd to keep them cool . Fans also keep them dry and prevent puddles from forming .

After the cows are milked , the mega-factory goes through the process of pasteurizing the dairy products , bottling and packaging it . Almarai 's fleet of 1,000 refrigerated tankers then deliver it to 55,000 stores in six Gulf nations .

Saudi is not the only Gulf State to have automated its milk production .

In the nearby United Arab Emirates , the Al Ain Dairy Farm , the largest in the UAE and a competitor to Almarai , has per cow yields at 10,000 liters a year , almost the equal of Almarai 's 12,400 liters a year .

However , critics warn that the high yields of Almarai and other Gulf dairies carry a cost .

Seen from Google Earth , the irrigation pivots of Al Kharj stand out like green crop circles in the rocky brown of the desert . Just 40 years ago , Saudi Arabia 's underground store of fossil water was estimated at 500 cubic kilometers , enough to fill Lake Erie , according to a report published by University of London SOAS .
