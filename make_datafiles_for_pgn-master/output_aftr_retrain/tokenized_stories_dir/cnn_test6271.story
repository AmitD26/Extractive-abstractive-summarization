And you 've probably daydreamed about winning the Powerball lottery and retiring to someplace where they 've never even heard the words Polar Vortex .

How slim ? Try one in 1 in 175,223,510 .

That means you have a greater chance of being killed by a shark , according to National Geographic . Those odds are 1 in 3,700,000 .

And , as long as we 're being morbid , you also have a 1 in 134,906 chance of being struck by lightning , say the folks over at the National Safety Council .

On the up side , you also have a 1 in 88,000 shot of dating a supermodel .

Go ahead and hedge your bets , but you have a greater chance of winning your office 's Oscar pool . Of course , those odds depend on whether your office couch potato co-worker enters this year .

But who knows ? You could get lucky like last week 's winner .
