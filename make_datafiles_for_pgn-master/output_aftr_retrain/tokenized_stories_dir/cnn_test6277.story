-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Qatari Sheikh Joann Al Thani has broken the world record paid for a yearling filly by splashing out $ 8.38 million for a daughter of 2001 Epsom Derby winner Galileo at the Tattersalls bloodstock auction in Newmarket , eastern England .

Galileo also sired the unbeaten Frankel , who retired last year as the world 's highest rated racehorse after 14 straight wins .

The mare , Alluring Park , is a half-sister of the 2008 Epsom Derby winner New Approach .

`` She is a magnificent specimen , '' he said . `` We bought her sister last year and we think she could be special .

`` We did n't want to miss this one -- let 's hope she is the next Treve . ''

Bidding on the filly , a sister of 2012 Epsom Oaks winner Was , was brisk with Irish owner John Magnier competing strongly for the purchase .

The horse , a descendant of the famous sire Northern Dancer , suffered injuries and his racing career was limited to three starts without a victory .
