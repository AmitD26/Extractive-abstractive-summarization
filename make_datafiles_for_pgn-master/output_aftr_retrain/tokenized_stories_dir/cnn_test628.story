Instead , Arsenal put in a supremely disciplined performance against a Manchester City team without their talismanic midfielder Yaya Toure , who is now at the African Cup of Nations , and struggling to score goals .

It took a soft penalty to open the scoring , when Manchester City 's captain Vincent Kompany was judged to have impeded Nacho Monreal as he marauded into the box . Santi Cazorla , by far the best player on the pitch , dispatched the penalty despite Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart guessing the right way .

`` The penalty changed the game , '' Manchester City coach Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports after the game , hinting that he believed Monreal deceived the referee . `` It was not a penalty , '' he added .

Manchester City did n't look like equalizing and it was n't a surprise when Olivier Giroud doubled the lead with a header early in the second half , converting from a Cazorla free kick .

`` We played high up in their half and it worked because we knew we wanted to make the space tight and we did it well , '' Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger said after the game . `` People are very quick to judge and you forget we have many defenders out . It was down to discipline . We have a very important fight in front of us . ''

The victory lifted Arsenal into fifth place , one point behind Manchester United . Manchester City , however , are now five points behind leader 's Chelsea . The two meet at Stamford Bridge in a fortnight .

Second half goals from Andy Carroll , Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing kept up their outside shot at Champions League qualification .
