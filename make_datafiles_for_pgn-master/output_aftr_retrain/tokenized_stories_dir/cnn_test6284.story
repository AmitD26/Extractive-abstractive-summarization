Philadelphia , Pennsylvania -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is on the hunt for a new location to hold its final public hearing on a planned study of hydraulic fracturing , the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground , agency officials say .

`` We wanted a central location and wanted to keep it in the area where the drilling has been proposed . We 're leaving no stone unturned , '' said agency spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara . `` We are pushing to make an announcement as swiftly as possible . ''

In July , public hearings were held in Fort Worth , Texas ; Denver , Colorado ; and Canonsburg , Pennsylvania , to help determine how the EPA will conduct the study .

A final public hearing was slated for Thursday at Binghamton , New York , but on Monday it was rescheduled for Saturday in Syracuse , New York , and on Tuesday it was postponed indefinitely , agency officials said . About 1,800 people had registered to speak for two minutes each , Alcantara said .

`` The last-minute change to Syracuse was caused by Binghamton University taking several actions to dissuade the EPA from holding the meetings at its campus , including increasing the cost from $ 6,000 to almost $ 40,000 , '' the EPA said in a statement Tuesday .

Victoria Switzer , who registered to speak at Thursday 's hearing , is among 15 residents of the northeastern Pennsylvania township of Dimock who filed suit in November 2009 against Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. , alleging it contaminated their well water . Cabot solicited Switzer for a gas lease in 2006 , according to court records .

Changing the location and then postponing the meeting was upsetting but did not come as a total surprise , Switzer said .

Julie Sautner of Dimock planned to attend the EPA meeting with her husband , Craig , a cable splicer , and 17-year-old daughter Kelly . They also are a part of the lawsuit .

The EPA announced in March that it would study the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water , human health and the environment , agency officials said .

`` People have raised important concerns that require our attention , '' said Jeanne Briskin , EPA liaison on hydraulic fracturing from the agency 's the Office of Research and Development . `` I 've worked for EPA for a long time , I was here in the early '80s , this is a case that is unusual . ''

The EPA plans to complete the study design by September 2010 , begin the study in January 2011 and release initial results by late 2012 , she said .

`` This is an expedited process ; it usually takes longer , '' Briskin said of the timeline . `` As we get results , we 're going to be reporting them . ''
