Researchers used several software programs to reconstruct the face of the man who liberated Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Panama , Peru and Venezuela from the Spanish crown .

Scans of Bolivar 's skeletal remains , which investigators exhumed two years ago , factored into their calculations .

So did historical paintings , photos of restored uniforms Bolivar wore and images of middle-aged Venezuelans , officials said .

An investigation into what caused Bolivar 's death continues , the Venezuelan government said .

Most historical accounts say tuberculosis killed Simon Bolivar , who died in 1830 at the age of 47 . But Chavez , who often mentions Bolivar in speeches and describes him as a personal hero , ordered investigators to exhume the body of the former military leader and determine whether he was murdered .

A report released this month said the investigation had been inconclusive .

With the national anthem playing in the background , a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth , revealing a skeleton on the table below . The broadcast then faded to black , showing Chavez singing along to the national anthem .

`` Bolivar is alive . Let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton . He is like lightning , like a sacred fire , '' Chavez said after the exhumation in 2010 .

Tuesday was the 229th anniversary of Bolivar 's birth .

In 1819 , Bolivar founded Gran Colombia , a federation of what is now Venezuela , Colombia , Panama and Ecuador . He is credited with spreading democratic principles in Latin America .
