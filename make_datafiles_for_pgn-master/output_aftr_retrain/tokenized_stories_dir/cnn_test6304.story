-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A third case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the United States has been reported . An unidentified Illinois man was infected after having `` extended face-to-face contact '' with an Indiana man who was diagnosed with the MERS virus . Fortunately , he is no longer ill .

Concern is appropriate , because the coronavirus responsible for MERS can evolve to become more potent public health threats . However , I do n't yet see evidence that will happen .

Hospitalized patients with pneumonia-like MERS receive vigorous respiratory interventions such as intubation , assisted ventilation , drugs that dilate airways and chest percussion . These interventions may bring virus into the environment in aerosols and on the surfaces of medical equipment , resulting in infection of hospital personnel and other patients . Since the MERS coronavirus has been shown to be stable for up to 48 hours , it may be difficult to determine the source of infection as people and equipment circulate in the health care environment .

To date , cases of human-to-human transmission have only been reported in hospitals and in families where there is intimate contact with an infected person . If we notice a change in this pattern such that clusters of infections begin to appear in communities with more casual contact , that would be a strong sign that the virus is evolving to become a pandemic threat .

The first two cases reported in the United States , in Indiana and Florida , were health care workers returning from Saudi Arabia . Although a third case has been linked to contact with the Indiana case , I am cautiously optimistic that a cluster of cases will not be triggered .

Nonetheless , vigilance is essential . Saudi Arabia has more than 7 million foreign workers and hosts more than 3 million religious pilgrims annually . If new cases arise they will almost certainly be imported .

The key to an effective pandemic response is to acknowledge that infectious disease challenges are global rather than national . Information and biological samples must be shared freely to facilitate surveillance and the development of diagnostics , drugs and vaccines .

The recent MERS cases should not trigger an alarm . But if a pandemic happens , it is important we are prepared to combat it .
