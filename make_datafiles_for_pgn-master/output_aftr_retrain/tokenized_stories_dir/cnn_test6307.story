-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Anthony Howe makes sculptures that refuse to stay still .

His mammoth-sized , stainless steel kinetic sculptures twist , turn and transform their shape in ways that can call to mind anything from a giant squid to electrons buzzing around an atom 's nucleus .

`` Growing up , I was fortunate to have spent a lot of time in the ocean , in the water , '' he says .

`` My father traveled a lot , we lived in eight different cities in the United States , so I was exposed to all kinds of things , besides books and whatnot . ''

Since 1994 , the artist made his home on 10 acres of Orcas Island , Washington state , which now incorporate Howe 's gallery and sculpture park .

His new creation -- a 17 ft-tall spike with a rotating ring of steel arms -LRB- below -RRB- -- has just taken pride of place on the lawn , and you can watch it in action in the new video here .

Howe has been making kinetic sculptures since 1990 . After graduating art school , he spent five years in a house he built on a remote mountaintop in New Hampshire . It was there that he painted water colors of the landscape , but eventually grew bored . He got a job as a superintendent in a warehouse and moved to Manhattan .

Today , the -LRB- now extremely complex -RRB- sculptures begin life on a computer , where Howe makes a digital `` sketch '' in modeling software packages 3ds Max and Rhinoceros .

Each component can be sent from the computer to a laser cutter which precisely carves out the curvilinear form .

In addition to the organic forms of underwater and plant life , Howe points to the illustrated books of 19th century author Jules Verne as early inspiration . Verne dreamed of nature-inspired helicopters and submarines -- before they were created in real life -- in adventure classics such as `` Journey to the center of the earth '' and `` Twenty thousand leagues under the sea . ''

Like these creations , Howe 's works transform the organic movement of the natural world into cold steel -- yet they retain their own hypnotic mystery .

`` I 'm just making a lot of choices based on what looks right to me , '' he says simply .

For Howe , knowing that others are beguiled by his works his creations is a source of happiness :
