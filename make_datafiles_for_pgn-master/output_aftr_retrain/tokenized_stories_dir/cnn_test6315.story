Health investigators have confirmed reports of 28 rabid raccoons in or near Central Park this month and last , compared with just three cases from 2003 through November .

Dr. Charles Rupprecht , chief of the rabies program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said Friday that ideal conditions in Central Park for animals -- few predators -- could exacerbate an outbreak .

`` Urban ecosystems sometimes have the ideal measures , '' he said . `` When you get an infectious agent like rabies , it tends to have these untoward effects , meaning an outbreak . ''

Similar outbreaks of rabies in Eastern Pennsylvania and Washington , however , were contained through the same measures that officials in New York are following , he said .

In addition to the increased surveillance and vaccinations , authorities in New York are suggesting that visitors to city parks keep pets on a leash and be wary of raccoons they see during the day .

Raccoons are nocturnal animals who rarely venture out in the daylight . Being out during the day `` means they are probably carrying rabies , '' said Marlene Elizondo , a nurse with the International SOS , which offers medical care and consulting services to companies , nonprofits and other organizations .

Most of the cases it has seen in the past two months were from the northern part of Central Park , between 79th and 110th streets .

If left untreated , rabies will infect the central nervous system and ultimately cause death . Health professionals encourage people who come in contact with infected animals to seek medical attention immediately .
