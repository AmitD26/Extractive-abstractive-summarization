Whatever excuse Speaker Boehner has for abdicating his responsibility as a national leader , it is not good enough , and he has now given the President ample excuse to act on his own . Which he is now doing .

A family secret that changed his life

Obama and Democrats were willing to compromise at every corner -- and despite disapproval from advocates and allies -- even held off on pressuring Republicans in hopes that would help create space for reform .

But it did n't work .

Opinion : Like those children , I too fled Central America

No matter what they did , the GOP refused to move . Republicans chose to play politics and spew excuses , rather than honor the will of the majority of the American people and pass such needed reform .

In 2013 they said they did n't have enough time in the legislative calendar to pass reform , but they did have time to shut down the government which cost us $ 24 billion .

Republicans have used every excuse in the book to block a bill that would have actually addressed their biggest priorities when it comes to immigration reform -- border security , enforcement , employment verification , high tech visas etc. .

So after more than a year of excuses and delays , we at least have clarity on something Americans have suspected all along : The anti-immigrant extremist faction of the GOP is calling the shots , making it impossible for Republicans to deliver any real substantive action on this issue .

Make no mistake , Republicans should understand something very clearly : In killing immigration reform , Speaker Boehner and the GOP are not only killing the hopes of millions of immigrants in this country counting on reform to allow them to fully come out of the shadows and shield them and their families from deportations , but the GOP is in effect committing long-term institutional political suicide and saying `` adios '' to any chance of the GOP capturing the White House in 2016 .

Even the GOP 's self-interest was not enough to motivate them to support and lead on the issue .

Let 's be clear , the President did not want to act alone . He did everything he could to work with Republicans in Congress and he knows that a long term permanent solution has to be legislative , but he also knows that if Congress wo n't act , he has to .

The American people and the immigrant community support reform , and want brave leaders who are willing to fight for them and do the hard work .

The President proved that he 's willing to go to bat for immigration reform . He will act because the GOP wo n't . The country deserves better .

Mr. President , America is behind you on this every step of the way .
