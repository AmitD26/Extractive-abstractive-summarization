-LRB- CNN -RRB- The UK 's Metropolitan Police has summoned five football fans to answer allegations of racism .

The video , widely shared on social media , also depicted the group of men chanting : `` We 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it . ''

The man in the video was blocked several times from boarding the train and shoved off at least twice . He was later identified as Souleymane S , a 33-year-old Parisian on his way home from work .

The authorities have not identified any of the alleged perpetrators .

Chelsea were quick to condemn the group , saying in a statement after the incident that the chanting was `` abhorrent '' and something that `` has no place in football or society . ''

Manager Jose Mourinho said he was `` ashamed '' by the flashpoint , while the club moved quickly to suspend the five men involved . It said they faced a life ban should they be found guilty .

`` It is enough for me , it is sad enough for me . It is a humiliation for that gentleman , I imagine myself in that same situation , I want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport . ''

Chelsea invited him to attend the return fixture at Stamford Bridge but he declined the offer .

`` I do n't want to sit in that stadium next to those people who pushed me . I still hear the voices of those people who pushed me because of the color of my skin . ''

Football banning orders can last for between three and ten years , and any breach can result in a criminal offense , with a prison sentence of up to six months .
