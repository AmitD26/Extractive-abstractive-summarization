-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's almost entirely illegal to use drones for money-making purposes in the United States . But a little Hollywood magic could change that .

The U.S. government is considering a request from movie and TV producers to let them use unmanned aircraft to shoot aerial video .

Currently , there 's only one exemption to the Federal Aviation Administration 's nationwide ban on commercial drones , called unmanned aircraft systems or UAS . That 's a spot off Alaska 's coast where drones are used by an oil company .

But a second exemption could make it easier and less expensive to create memorable movie moments like the opening sequences from Stanley Kubrick 's `` The Shining '' and Academy Award winner `` American Beauty . ''

`` We welcome the FAA 's leadership and support their guidance to safely authorize the use of UASs for the motion picture and television industry . ''

`` However , all the associated safety issues must be carefully considered to make sure any hazards are appropriately mitigated , '' the statement continued .

SnapRoll Media , a production company that specializes in aerial shots , is one of the companies that have asked for the exemption . In their application , published by Ars Technica , a CNN content partner , Snaproll said shots done with lightweight , remote-controlled drones would be safer and less disruptive than current shoots that use helicopters .

The suggestion of an exemption marks something of a change for the FAA . As companies from Web retail behemoth Amazon to pizza chain Domino 's have toyed with the idea of deploying drones , the administration has been slow to craft new rules and regulations for them .

The Alaska exemption , for ConocoPhillips oil company , came only after prodding from Congress .

Hobbyists in the United States are allowed to fly small drones below 400 feet for noncommercial purposes . But one of the administration 's key concerns is how to allow commercial drones without endangering airplanes and other existing , manned aircraft .

In its statement , the FAA said companies from three other industries have filed similar appeals for exemptions to the federal ban on commercial drones : agriculture , power line and pipeline inspection , and oil and gas-line inspection .
