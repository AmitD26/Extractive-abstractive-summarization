-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When Senators Trent Lott and Tom Daschle ran the Senate , partisan politics was nonexistent and the chamber ran with no hiccups .

In the late 1990s and early 2000s , they dealt with President Bill Clinton 's impeachment , controversial tax cuts , and welfare reform just to name a few contentious issues .

But Tuesday , the two former majority leaders said that partisanship has gotten so extreme that things need to change .

`` As we have seen throughout our careers , many political decision-makers increasingly favor partisan rancor over reasoned debate in discussing national policies , '' Daschle and Lott said in releasing a set of recommendations to turn things around in Washington .

The Bipartisan Policy Center 's Commission on Political Reform offered changes to the legislative system and the electoral process , recommendations that Daschle said are aimed at transforming Congress `` into a high performing '' entity .

Among the proposals :

* Congress pass budgets every two years . Currently , annual budget fights exacerbate partisanship .

* Create a national primary day and ease access to voting and registration . Primaries are staggered nationally , and controversy has flared over Republican-led voter ID campaigns , which critics say disenfranchises minorities .

Writing the report is the easy part . Implementing it is not .

The political heavy hitters plan to use their heft to push the ideas in Congress and state legislatures .

Lott said that when he ran it by the current Senate leaders , Republican Mitch McConnell and Democrat Harry Reid , they were `` both moderately not happy . ''

That 's a good place to start , Lott said , grinning .
