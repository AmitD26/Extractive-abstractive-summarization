In 1960 , the movie `` Scent of Mystery '' opened in theaters , marking the first and only official attempt at Smell-O-Vision , in which strategic odors were emitted during the film from little pipes near the seats .

At the time , it was big thinking and an interesting draw for moviegoers , sort of like the collective asthma attack everyone developed a few years ago for modern 3-D . Which I think most of us will now agree is more trouble than it 's worth .

Like wearing pants .

`` I liked it up until the 30-minute bathroom scene . Two stars . ''

`` Scent of Mystery '' was eventually de-odorized and retitled `` Holiday in Spain , '' at which point Smell-O-Vision was neatly tucked away in the vault of American bad ideas .

It now shares that space with game footage from the XFL .

Git-R-Done !

Not that it would necessarily change things .

`` Um , Jarrett , did you just pass gas ? ''

`` Yes . Yes , I did . ''

Naturally , this new little gizmo is still in development , but they hope to have it out in markets by the fall for both iPhone and Android . Which , sadly , will be months too late for strategically teaming up with Bonnaroo so tech-savvy music fans can olfactorily brag to everyone back home with the familiar summer festival smell of a hot Port-O-John .

`` Sounds like Heather is having fun . ''

`` Do n't you mean smells like Heather is having fun ? ''

`` Ha ha ha ! Yes . We have indoor plumbing . ''

So , you never know . Perhaps there 's hope for something interesting . I just ca n't think of what that might be .

Clearly , they 've never been to a Meatloaf concert .

Not that you 'd want to .

At least it has indoor plumbing .
