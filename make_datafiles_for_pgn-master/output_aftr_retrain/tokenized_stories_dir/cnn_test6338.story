Ukrainian military forces suffer heavy losses in battles against terrorists equipped with the newest Russian weaponry . We 've seen reports of the pro-Russian thugs shooting women and children , cynically calling it a `` protection of the Russian-speaking population . ''

The price we are paying to bring peace back to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine is too high . Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has proposed the decentralization of power as part of his peace plan . It means more freedom , more economic autonomy and more opportunities to use languages spoken in a particular community for every region .

How rebels in Ukraine built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies

Ukraine has also demonstrated its genuine willingness to resolve this crisis through negotiations and compromises . Our armed forces have shown exceptional restraint during their military operations in order to avoid casualties among peaceful civilians and prevent destruction of their towns and villages . Our unilateral cease-fire in the zone of the conflict had lasted from June 20 to June 30 , during which 27 Ukrainian servicemen , from all over Ukraine , were killed by the bandits .

Ukrainians , knowing too well the bitterness of loss , sincerely share grief with the families of the deceased . Our government is conducting , together with a team of international experts , a thorough investigation of the circumstances of this heinous act of terrorism . There is already incontrovertible evidence that the airliner was shot down by an anti-aircraft missile system that had arrived from Russia .

When civilian planes are shot down

For the first time since 1983 , when a Soviet jet fighter deliberately shot down a South Korean Boeing 747 , Russia stands entangled in such a horrendous tragedy . We remember that an objective investigation of that catastrophe was made possible only 10 years later , after the USSR collapsed . We would not like to have to wait that long to learn the truth about the tragedy of MH17 .

International and internal terrorism , as well as unbridled export of conventional and high-tech weaponry , have no regard for state borders , national sovereignty or human lives .

We strive for a world based on the respect for international law and trust between nations .
