-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Without action from Washington , on January 2 , 2013 , the U.S. defense budget will undergo the most dramatic and dangerous cuts in its history .

Because of the failure of the supercommittee to agree on a deficit reduction plan , the 2011 Budget Control Act automatically cuts about $ 500 billion from the defense budget . These cuts fall on top of the already agreed-upon $ 487 billion in reductions . All told , the cuts would amount to about $ 1 trillion over a decade .

The results would be nothing short of catastrophic . But do n't take my word for it .

On November 14 , 2011 , Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta wrote a letter to Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham explaining the ramifications of the full sequestration defense cuts . Should these cuts take place over the next 10 years , he said , the United States would be left with its smallest ground force since World War II ; the smallest Navy since 1915 ; the smallest fighter force in the history of the Air Force ; and the smallest civilian work force in the Defense Department 's history .

Who 's to blame for threat of defense budget cuts ?

Last week on my radio show , `` Morning In America , '' Sen. Graham said the full brunt of these cuts would mean `` no more F-35s , no more modern fighters '' and `` it means that those who are serving in the military will be sent off to future wars ill-equipped and unprepared . ''

The remainder of the cuts will fall on the Defense Department 's wide network of contractors . In a recent study , the Aerospace Industries Association found that the sequester cuts could eliminate more than 2 million jobs and add 1.5 % to the unemployment rate .

Rep. Buck McKeon , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , fired back at the White House and told contractors to ignore the Labor Department .

Now that the cuts will be disclosed in full view , one can not believe the president would go against the wishes of his own secretary of defense and generals and allow the military to be subjected to these traumatic cuts and massive layoffs .

Rather , the president seems to be engaging Republicans in a high-stakes game of chicken -- his demands , like tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans , or the threat of sequestration . Republicans should n't yield , but call this what it is -- reckless and dangerous politicking .
