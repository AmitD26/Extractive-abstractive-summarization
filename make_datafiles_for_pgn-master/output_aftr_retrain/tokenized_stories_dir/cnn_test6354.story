In truth , little else was expected of a team that took the field in the Welsh capital Cardiff to reports that at a reputed cost of $ 612 million , it was the most expensive ever assembled in the sport .

The focus was largely on its new recruits , Colombia 's World Cup poster boy James Rodriguez , and Toni Kroos , who lifted the trophy in Brazil with Germany .

But it was the world footballer of the year Cristiano Ronaldo that shone yet again , even taking the gloss off Gareth Bale , the world 's most expensive player who was back in his hometown .

The first was provided by Bale , a hometown hero who said prior to the clash that Real were gunning to win all six titles on offer to them this season .

The second was the result of another fine move , as Ronaldo was released by France striker Karim Benzema , before slamming the ball into the top corner .

`` Obviously it 'll take a little bit of time for everyone to settle in but I think we played very well tonight , '' Bale told ITV . `` We gelled as a team and we 've got a lot of time to improve .

`` The most important thing for us tonight was to get the job done , get the trophy and go down in history .

`` Everybody comes to Real Madrid to win trophies , we want to play with the best players in the world . We 're going out to win every trophy this season . ''

Successful soccer sides seldom stand still and no-one can accuse Carlo Ancelotti 's men of doing that this summer .

The Spanish giants , who ended a long wait for their tenth European Champions League crown last season with victory over city rivals Atletico , have bolstered their ` galatico ' ranks in typical fashion .

His six goals helped Colombia to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history , and secured him the golden boot -- awarded to the tournament 's top scorer .

Rodriguez looked a little ring rusty on his first competitive outing for his new club , a heavy first touch often belying the skill he showed in Brazil , when the ball seemed to be attached to his foot .

Real 's other new recruit looked sharper and more comfortable in his surroundings .

Ronaldo 's first effort of menace on the night was smartly saved by Beto , the goalkeeper standing tall to repel his shot after neat work from Benzema .

The Portuguese repeated the feat in the fledgling stages of the second half as Benzema released him inside the area , Ronaldo 's shot flashing into the corner .

Krychowiak and Diogo Figueiras went close in the dying stages for Sevilla before a fine save from Beto denied Bale the goal he and the large portion of Welsh fans so desperately craved .

Real then took that familiar climb up the stairs to accept its first silverware of the season . One down , five to go .
