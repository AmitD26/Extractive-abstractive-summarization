This year is likely to be no different with big launches expected from all the major players except Apple .

So what can we expect ? Some phone makers have already announced their MWC line up , some have hinted , others have been rumored . Talking to sources , joining the dots , and getting the word on the street , this is what is expected at the show :

HTC

Although Samsung was expected to launch the Samsung Galaxy S III at MWC this year , the company has now confirmed that it wo n't . With a number of pre-MWC launches already detailed , Samsung is expected instead to focus on tablets at the show . If rumors are to be believed , it will launch a 10.1-inch version of the Samsung Galaxy Note announced in September 2011 . The difference from all the other tablets it sells ? It will have a built-in stylus .

LG

Following Samsung 's lead with the Galaxy Note , LG has announced its LG Optimus Vu prior to the show . A cross between a phone and a tablet , it will measure 139.6 mm x 90 . mm , meaning it 's going to be one for those with big hands and big pockets . There are also rumors that the company will announce a follow up to the LG Optimus 2X called the 3X . Expect it to have a quad-core processor too .

Research In Motion

Panasonic

Having just announced a new waterproof and dustproof phone called the Eluga , Panasonic has also confirmed it has a second handset in the pipeline to launch at MWC . It will feature a dual-core processor , OLED screen and will run Android .

Fujitsu

Motorola

Motorola 's MWC plans are even quieter than Sony 's with the company traditionally focusing on CES in Las Vegas to launch many of its first-half-of-the-year handsets . There is a suggestion that Motorola has teamed up with Intel to launch one of the first Intel-powered smartphones , but that is still to be confirmed . Motorola does n't have a press conference at the show , but Intel does .
