` Big Bang Theory ' contract talks stall production

Here 's what we 've heard fans should expect for season 8 of `` The Big Bang Theory '' :

Sheldon 's return

At the end of season 7 , Sheldon Cooper -LRB- Jim Parsons -RRB- announced that he could n't handle all of the new developments happening in his life , and was `` getting on a train and leaving forever . ''

His plan to `` live off the land '' did n't go so well , as he makes his return in season 8 's hour-long premiere after getting robbed on the train . As a sneak peek shows , Leonard -LRB- Johnny Galecki -RRB- and Amy -LRB- Mayim Bialik -RRB- have to head down to Arizona to collect Sheldon and bring him back home .

Do n't expect a wedding for Leonard and Penny

Penny -LRB- Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting -RRB- and Leonard may have ended the seventh season with an engagement , but executive producer Steve Molaro told TV Guide they 're not rushing the couple to the altar . They 're going to take it so slowly that Molaro is `` 99 % '' sure that a wedding wo n't happen in season 8 .

`` We 're not anti-wedding . It 's just they 're feeling this out , '' the EP said . `` Stuff with money and things like that can come up with them being engaged without us having to rush to the altar and change the fabric of the show . ''

Besides , Molaro added , he 's just not ready to see Leonard and Sheldon cease being roommates .

Howard has mother issues

But the couple 's come too far for Sheldon 's social fumbles to get in their way . `` We 're always moving them forward in baby steps , '' producer Molaro told TVLine . '' `` They 're on the same trajectory that they 've been on since they met , and that is she is continuing to drag him along into this relationship , whether he wants to admit that he likes it or or not . He 's come a long way . ''

Season 7 ended with each main character finding love , and that included Raj -LRB- Kunal Nayyar -RRB- , who 's now dating Laura Spencer 's Emily .

The couple is still together as season 8 begins , and Molaro promises that we 'll learn more about Emily as the season progresses .

`` The Big Bang Theory '' will air on CBS Monday nights at 8 p.m. ET until October 30 , when it will shift back to its usual timeslot of Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET .
