-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It hurts me to say this , but I bet when I say `` Kim , '' you know the last name .

And so into this vortex of extreme public relations savvy comes Kim K , one of the people who is `` famous for being famous . '' How did she do it ? By flaunting her vapid lifestyle , her great body and good looks and her money .

Of course America idolizes her . But as it turns out , not nearly so much as she idolizes herself .

Normal people would find a 352-page compilation of selfies in bad taste . But in truth we recognize the basic instinct : It 's hard to resist walking by a mirror and not having one of two reactions -- to look or , at all costs , to avoid looking .

Unlike Kim K , the Queen of Narcissism , most of us have a more ambivalent relationship to our own image . We look at pictures of ourselves and more often than not , cringe . If it 's a flattering picture , we save it for our Facebook page or give it to our partner . But few of us , even few movie stars , want to create books of how glorious we look .

Yes we all are mini-narcissists , but most of us have a sense of our flaws and the limits of how much time we should spend on adoringly looking at our own image . Kim K is a lesson in how extreme it can get when you are a canny self-promoter : You just love yourself so much 24/7 .

If you , like me , is relieved at the disappearance of Paris Hilton from the front pages and are not a fan of pathological narcissism , you know we should ignore Kim K and shun falling into her PR trap .

But the fact that she has an esteemed publisher and that the editors there must think this book will sell well presents a serious issue : Why are young women entranced with this woman ? -LRB- I understand why young men would be . -RRB- But young girls who are easily impressionable and hooked by hype may be enchanted with the ease with which she seems to float through life and take on her `` struggles '' -LRB- Which brand name shall I buy ? Which mini-feud will I rage about ? -RRB- as ones they would rather have than the ones they have in real life .

They envy her . The fact is that the Kardashians have gained traction in their lives . They have built an empire and no one can deny she and her posse have figured out how to make a fortune based on her brand . Kim K wo n't be around forever . But is it some failure of feminism among the young that allows this kind of person to be a star ?
