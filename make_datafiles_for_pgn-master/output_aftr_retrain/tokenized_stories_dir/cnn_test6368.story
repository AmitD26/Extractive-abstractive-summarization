Sterling , an attorney and billionaire real estate mogul , is now fighting to keep his co-ownership of the NBA franchise after the league said it would ban him forever in the wake of allegations that he disparaged African-Americans in an audio recording .

The Sterling controversy contains as many surprises and exchanges as the ongoing NBA playoffs , which , by the way , still include the Clippers in contention for the league title . In fact , on Thursday , the attorney for Sterling 's wife , the other co-owner , told CNN that she 's distancing herself from her husband and has informed the NBA she wants the team in her name .

How the scandal began

Last month , NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the league was imposing a lifetime ban and a $ 2.5 million fine against Donald Sterling , co-owner of the Clippers since 1981 , for `` offensive and disturbing '' remarks he made about blacks . Those remarks were uttered in an audio recording published by the celebrity news outlet TMZ , which asserted the two people talking on the tape were Sterling and his `` girlfriend , '' V. Stiviano .

CNN has n't independently confirmed the audio recording . Sterling and Stiviano have n't returned CNN 's calls for comment .

In a recent interview with ABC 's Barbara Walters , however , Stiviano tacitly confirmed the authenticity of the recording when she stated she and Sterling often discussed race : `` There 's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one . ''

In the recording , Sterling argues with Stiviano about how she posted to Instagram a photo with legendary NBA player Earvin `` Magic '' Johnson .

`` In your lousy f ** ing Instagrams , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , '' Sterling says .

`` If it 's white people , it 's OK ? '' the woman responds . `` If it was Larry Bird , would it make a difference ? ''

When the woman says she does n't share the man 's views about race , he tells her : `` Well , then , if you do n't feel -- do n't come to my games . Do n't bring black people , and do n't come . ''

In her only substantial interview , Stiviano , 31 , told ABC that Sterling , 80 , is now hurting . `` Tormented . Emotionally traumatized , '' Stiviano said .

They also have a financial arrangement , she said .

`` He at first started paying me as an employee , and then he started paying me off the books , '' she said .

Stiviano is writing about book about her life , but she does n't have a book deal connected to the Sterling controversy , Nehoray said .

In fact , in March , Shelly Sterling sued Stiviano , accusing her of having an affair with her husband and targeting extremely wealthy older men .

Stiviano 's attorney dismissed as `` absolutely false '' any description of Stiviano as a `` gold digger '' and a `` con artist . ''

Shelly Sterling 's suit claims that her husband used the couple 's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari , two Bentleys and a Range Rover .

Stiviano also took over a $ 1.8 million duplex through fraud and received about $ 250,000 in cash from Sterling , the court document claims .

Stiviano is fighting back , saying in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts . She also says she never took advantage of him .

Sterling had largely been silent on the controversy . The only significant comment he made was published last week on DuJour.com , which quoted Sterling as saying `` I wish I had just paid her off '' in reference to Stiviano .

The website specified that Sterling was referring to Stiviano in a discussion with one of its writers , but the publication did n't state when the remark was made .

CNN could n't independently confirm the remark .

On Thursday , however , another celebrity news outlet , RadarOnline.com , published a new audio recording of Sterling conversing with an unknown man about allegations of Sterling being a racist .

Sterling emphatically denies being a racist in the conversation .

`` You think I 'm a racist ? '' Sterling tells a person Radar Online calls `` a long-time friend in the recorded phone conversation . ''

`` I grew up in East L.A. ... '' Sterling continues . `` I was the president of the high school there . I mean , and I 'm a Jew ! And 50 % of the people there were black and 40 % were Hispanic . ... So I mean , people must have a good feeling for me . ''

Sterling also declares in the recording that he wo n't sell his co-ownership in the Clippers as the NBA is now demanding .

`` You ca n't force people to sell property in America , '' Sterling says .

At one point in the conversation , Sterling sounds bewildered when the friend tells him that rapper-producer Sean `` Diddy '' Combs is among the celebrities seeking to buy the Clippers .

Friend : `` Sean Combs and Oprah . ''

The `` Oprah '' cited on the recording is Oprah Winfrey , who is among a long list of public figures reportedly seeking to buy the Clippers , one of 30 teams in the NBA .

Meanwhile , Shelly Sterling has no intention of surrendering her stake in the team and has been in touch with the NBA about keeping the team , according to her attorney , Pierce O'Donnell , who spoke Thursday to CNN .

Shelly Sterling owns 50 % of the team , and her husband the other 50 % , through a family trust , O'Donnell said .

`` Mrs. Sterling has denounced in the strongest terms possible terms her husband 's racist comments , '' O'Donnell said .

CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said that for all practical purposes , the NBA effort to make Donald Sterling sell the team also applies to his wife .

`` They 're the same ownership group . That is not separate ownership , '' Toobin said .

As for the Clippers ' more immediate prospects , the team is now tied 1-1 with the Oklahoma City Thunder in a best-of-seven-games playoff series . Both teams are vying to advance to the Western Conference playoffs , whose winner will play for the league title against the Eastern Conference winner .
