-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Indiana , and with a slowly decreasing population of just under 10 million -LRB- 1.7 million of whom live in the capital , Budapest -RRB- , Hungary is a land in thrall to its history .

The horse is still revered here , Franz Liszt is huge and goulash is a soup not a stew .

1 . It has Central Europe 's largest lake

At almost 80 kilometers -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- long , and covering an area of almost 600-square-kilometers -LRB- 230 square miles -RRB- , Lake Balaton is so big it 's known as the `` Magyar tenger '' or the Hungarian Sea .

The annual Balaton Sound summer music festival is held in the nearby town of Zamárdi .

Hungary has hot water to spare .

There are more than 1,000 natural springs in the country -LRB- and the world 's largest thermal lake at Hévíz , near Lake Balaton -RRB- , with 118 in Budapest alone .

On the Pest side of the river in the capital , Széchenyi Thermal Baths -LRB- Állatkerti körút 9-11 , 1146 Budapest ; +36 1 363 3210 -RRB- claims to be the biggest thermal bathing complex in Europe .

Another good Budapest bathing spot is the art nouveau Gellért Baths and Hotel -LRB- Kelenhegyi út 4 , 1118 Budapest ; +36 1 466 6166 -RRB- , at the foot of Gellért Hill .

3 . Hungarians are smart ; just ask the people at Nobel

Hungarians have also invented many things , from the biro ballpoint pen -LRB- named for inventor László Bíró -RRB- to computer science -LRB- János Neumann -RRB- to Rubik 's cube .

As minister of state for economic strategy Zoltán Cséfalvay recently said : `` I am very proud to be able to say that everything was invented by a Hungarian . ''

Sort of .

4 . Franz Liszt is still huge

The reason ?

Surrounded by trendy cafes and restaurants , it 's extremely popular in summer .

5 . The ` little gate ' is a way of life

They 're reputed to be the only people who can enter a revolving door behind you and emerge ahead .

They also have an opinion on everything , so much so that it 's said if you have three Hungarians in a room , they 'll form four political parties .

6 . Goulash is n't what you think it is

What 's served in Western restaurants , however , is usually a stew , while what you get in Hungary is a soup .

Everyone claims to have the best recipe , with an annual goulash festival held each September in Szolnok -LRB- 120 kilometers southeast of the capital in central Hungary -RRB- .

The version at one of Budapest 's best known restaurants , Gundel -LRB- Gundel Károly út 4 , 1146 Budapest , next to Budapest Zoo entrance ; +36 1 889 8100 -RRB- , will set you back HUF 3,800 -LRB- $ 17 -RRB- .

There 's one element of Hungarian cuisine that 's present in every kitchen , from Grandma 's to that of the country 's first Michelin-starred restaurant , Costes -LRB- Ráday utca 4 , 1092 Budapest ; +36 1 219 0696 -RRB- : paprika .

It 's so important it was national news when spice and sauce maker Univer announced in late October that its paprika-based condiments would continue to be made from 100 % Hungarian produce , despite a poor harvest .

Walk along Budapest 's answer to London 's Soho -- the pedestrianized Ráday utca teeming with bars , restaurants and galleries in the center of Pest -- and you 'll hear little clinking of beer glasses .

When the Hungarians lost the 1848-49 Revolution and War of Independence , Austrians executed 13 of the most senior Hungarian generals , and supposedly celebrated by drinking beer and clinking their mugs .

Hungarians vowed not to clink beer glasses for the next 150 years .

Although that period ended in 1999 , the `` ban '' is still widely observed , especially among more elderly people .

It 's fine to clink wine and spirit glasses .

Tokaji is measured by its sweetness , shown by the number of `` puttonyos . ''

The best Tokaji -LRB- also rarest and most expensive -RRB- is the Essencia style .

10 . Hungarians are sports mad

Hungarians love sports and are extremely proud of the fact that , per capita , the country has one of the highest tallies of Olympic medals -LRB- 482 across both winter and summer games -RRB- .

The Hungarians rode into the Carpathian Basin -- the central European territory they conquered -- on horseback and have been in love with things equine ever since .

There are plenty of other places throughout the country to take riding lessons or simply go for a hack .

A good choice is the Hilltop Riding Farm -LRB- Repülőtéri út 0117 / 15 hrsz , 2100 Gödöllő , Hungary ; +36 30 636 8553 -RRB- , in the town of Gödöllő , outside Budapest .
