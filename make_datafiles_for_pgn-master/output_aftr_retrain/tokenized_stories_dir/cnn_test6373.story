Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A slate of Cabinet ministers for Libya 's emerging government was finalized Sunday , two spokesmen for the National Transitional Council said .

The transitional council has organized the military and political movement to unseat Libya 's long-time ruler Moammar Gadhafi . It moved its capital from Benghazi to Tripoli last month , after anti-Gadhafi forces took over the city , and is recognized as Libya 's legitimate government by many nations and world bodies , including the United Nations and African Union .

One of those places that remains a battle zone , in addition to Bani Walid and Sabha , is Sirte .

Souad Masoudi , a spokeswoman for the International Committee of Red Cross , earlier this weekend claimed that about 10,000 people had fled Sirte . The group described humanitarian conditions inside the besieged city as dire , adding that medical supplies appeared to be in dangerously short supply .

On Sunday -- after having earlier efforts , by boat , aborted due to `` the security situation '' -- a Red Cross team entered Sirte by land from the west , the group said in a press release . They met with civil representatives who claimed dangerous shortages of drinking water , hygiene items and food , including for infants .
