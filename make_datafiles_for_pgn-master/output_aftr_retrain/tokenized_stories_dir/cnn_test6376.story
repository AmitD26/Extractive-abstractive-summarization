Six of those states -- Colorado , Kansas , Kentucky , Illinois , Missouri and Iowa -- have confirmed cases of Enterovirus D68 , also known as EV-D68 .

Enteroviruses , which can cause a variety of symptoms , are n't unusual . If you 've ever had a bad summer cold , it was likely caused by an enterovirus . The CDC estimates there are 10 to 15 million viral infections each year in the United States . The season often hits its peak in September .

But this particular type of enterovirus -- EV-D68 -- is less common . And health officials are concerned by the number of hospitalizations it has caused this year .

`` It 's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care . I would call it unprecedented . I 've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics , and I 've never seen anything quite like this , '' said Dr. Mary Anne Jackson , division director for infectious diseases at Children 's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City , Missouri .

What parents should know about EV-D68

Staff members noticed an initial spike on August 15 , Jackson said .

`` It could have taken off right after school started . Our students start back around August 17 , and I think it blew up at that point , '' Jackson said .

Survive the September asthma epidemic

Children 's Hospital Colorado has seen a 12 % to 15 % increase in emergency room visits and admissions this month compared with the same time frame last year , Nyquist said . The hospital sent 25 samples to the CDC from patients with respiratory illness . Around 75 % were confirmed to be EV-D68 .

EV-D68 was first identified in the 1960s , and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time . But it 's possible that the relatively low number is due to the fact that the CDC does n't require health departments to track EV-D68 .

`` It 's one that we do n't know as much about as we would like , '' Schuchat said .

`` It 's important to make sure your children with asthma are on their medicines and keeping up with their medication routine , '' Schuchat said .

Like other enteroviruses , EV-D68 appears to spread through close contact with infected people .

To reduce the risk of infection , wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds , especially after changing diapers . Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands , and avoid contact with people who are sick . Disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs , and stay home when you feeling under the weather to avoid infecting others .
