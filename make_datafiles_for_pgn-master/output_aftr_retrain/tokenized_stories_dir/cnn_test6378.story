-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts is entering the aviation game .

Sort of .

The Toronto-based luxury accommodation brand has leased its very own Boeing 757 , to fly guests on global tours starting February 2015 .

Flatbed seats and in-flight Wi-Fi are a given .

'' -LSB- It 's -RSB- a natural extension of what we 've been doing in our hotels for more than 50 years , '' said Susan Helstab , executive vice president of marketing , in a statement .

On November 28 , 2005 , Boeing wrapped up the 23-year run of the single aisle 757 passenger airplane but says more than 1,030 of its 1,050 757s are still in service .

Commercial airlines usually fit out these planes with at least 200 seats , but the Four Seasons Jet will have 52 in a 2-2 configuration .

Four Seasons says it 's already accepting reservations for trips in February , April and August .

The price is $ 119,000 per person and stops include Hawaii , Bora Bora , Sydney , Bali , northern Thailand , Mumbai and Istanbul .

In-flight staff will include a concierge to coordinate with local Four Seasons concierges in each destination .

Is there a market for such an indulgence ?

In a 2014 report on the global business of luxury , the Boston Consulting Group said that today 's ultra rich are looking for experiences out of the ordinary .

In terms of competition , luxury tour companies like Abercrombie & Kent , National Geographic Expeditions and Remote Lands offer similar journeys geared toward wealthy travelers looking for a bit of adventure .

And the list of potential clients keeps growing .

The number of ultra high net worth individuals -LRB- UHNWIs -RRB- across the world has ballooned by 59 % since 2003 , taking the number of people with more than US$ 30 million in assets to over 167,000 worldwide , according to global real estate firm Knight Frank 's 2014 Wealth Report .

The fastest growth has been seen in the Middle East , Latin America , Australasia and Africa .
