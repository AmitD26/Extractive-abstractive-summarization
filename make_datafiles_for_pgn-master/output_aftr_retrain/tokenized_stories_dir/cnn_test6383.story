But it was n't always that way , for this was one kitesurfing tale which almost ended in tragedy .

Rewind 11 years and with her father Pete , a five time British senior champion , watching on in horror . Whiteley came within inches of serious injury -- and maybe even death .

It was a moment which would have forced lesser beings into nightmares and cold sweats -- but not this British-born battler .

`` I was getting dragged down with the kite and heading into the wavebreakers .

`` I thought I was going to hit the pier and that was scary , but I hit the ground and was in a daze . Some guy came and helped tame my kite and made sure I stayed still .

`` When you crash in the water , the water turns into concrete , it 's not soft . You get a lot of whiplash in your neck and it gets flung back .

Standing on a small board , the rider uses the wind to power the large kite , which propels it across the waves at rapid speed .

Since returning to action at the age of 15 , Whiteley has gone on to establish herself as one of Europe 's rising stars -- an outcome which looked unlikely following her first ever event .

On that occasion , the amateur competition ended in disappointment after she finished last , beaten by a considerable distance and defeated by a far more experienced field .

`` I went out and trained as much as possible after that . ''

Reaching the top

That chastening experience powered Whiteley through months of training , hitting the waves at every opportunity despite the infamous British weather .

At just 15 , Whiteley became the youngest ever female to win the British Amateur Ladies title , repeating the feat the following year at the professional championship .

Now at the age of 21 , and voted as the country 's most influential female kitesurfer , Whiteley has her sights set on reaching the very top .

`` I 'd really like to be European champion , '' she added .

`` There 's plenty of time for me to progress and have fun . ''

Magical

Australia , Turkey and Hawaii are just three of her favorite places -- although she retains an affection for her local beach at Lytham St Annes in the north west of England .

But it does n't matter whether its brown water off the British coast or sharks lurking beneath sunnier climes , nothing puts Whiteley off taking her kite into the deep unknown .

`` It 's a pretty magical feeling when you 're out kitesurfing , '' she added .

`` You have so much freedom on the water and it takes you to beautiful places you would n't normally go to . It 's amazing . ''
