-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Formula One racer Jules Bianchi continues to fight for his life in a Japanese hospital , his Marussia team says it has been angered by `` a number of media reports '' into the cause of the accident .

The French driver spun off in rainy conditions in the closing laps of the Japanese Grand Prix and collided head-on with a recovery vehicle .

The vehicle was removing Adrian Sutil 's Sauber which had left the track on the preceding lap , prompting double yellow flags to be waved to warn drivers to slow down and be prepared to stop .

`` At a time when its driver is critically ill in hospital , and the team has made clear that its highest priority is consideration for Jules and his family , it is distressed to have to respond to deeply upsetting rumors and inaccuracies in respect of the circumstances of Jules ' accident .

`` However , given that these allegations are entirely false , the team has no alternative but to address these .

`` Regarding point 1 , Jules did slow down under the double waved yellow flags . That is an irrefutable fact , as proven by the telemetry data , which the team has provided to the FIA -LRB- world motorsport 's governing body . -RRB-

`` Regarding point 2 , an audio copy of the full radio transmission between Jules and the team , and a written transcript , were provided to the FIA .

He also indicated that Bianchi had slowed down prior to his accident .

Bianchi 's family issued an update on the 25-year-old 's condition Tuesday , nine days after his accident at Suzuka .

`` The situation remains challenging due to the diffuse axonal traumatic brain injury Jules has sustained .

`` The Bianchi family continue to be comforted by the thoughts and prayers of Jules ' man fans and the motor sport community . ''

The Frenchman 's 21 fellow Formula One racers gathered together at the front of the grid in Sochi for a minute 's silence .

Earlier , Bianchi 's Marussia team made its own tribute with its sole driver in the Russian race , Max Chilton , holding a pit board which read , `` Racing for Jules . ''
