-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- -LSB- The following contains spoilers for the December 1 , 2013 , episode of `` The Walking Dead . '' -RSB-

The promos all promised a deadly fall finale for `` The Walking Dead '' -- and boy , did it deliver , in one of the most shocking episodes of the series on Sunday night .

Midway through the episode -- despite Rick 's pleas to the Governor -LRB- who has recently been going by the name Brian , though his real name is Philip -RRB- to let go of his hostages , Hershel and Michonne , so his group and theirs can learn to coexist in the prison -- Hershel , the wise old doctor , was brutally beheaded by the Governor .

Thus began the biggest action sequence since the end of season two , with Rick 's group of survivors -LRB- including Maggie and Beth , who just saw their own father murdered -RRB- in a shootout with the camp the Governor recently took over .

As this was happening , the Governor learned that the little girl he swore to protect , Meghan , had recently been killed by a walker , and he shot her in the head without even flinching , to keep her from turning .

If that was n't enough , we saw Tyreese -LRB- who was killed at this point in the comic books -RRB- saved by two young girls who had been trained in using firearms by Carol .

Celebrities weighed in as well , with `` Modern Family 's '' Sarah Hyland saying , `` I blame @WalkingDead_AMC for Haley crying on #ModernFamily till February because the tears will not stop . Really . I 'm ruined . ''

`` Speechless , '' tweeted Yvette Nicole Brown of `` Community , '' also a regular on the `` Talking Dead '' post-show .

Where indeed ? The episode ended with Rick and Carl coming upon an empty baby car seat , devastated to see that little Judith Grimes was nowhere to be found . This raised the possibility that she had been killed or somehow , someone -LRB- Beth ? -RRB- was able to rescue her in the melee .

`` It 's a very important part of the story that Hershel died ; it is n't just shock death , '' executive producer Scott Gimple explained to The Hollywood Reporter .

`` We 're going to see now with all these things taken away from Rick if he can come back from this . Moving into the next season and a half , the loss of Hershel will be felt and will be this driving element toward Rick 's character . ''
