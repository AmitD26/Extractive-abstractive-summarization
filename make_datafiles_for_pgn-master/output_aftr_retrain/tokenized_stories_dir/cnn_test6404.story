-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A new global racing series is launching with hopes of rivaling Formula One , but there is one major difference -- the cars will all have electric engines .

The Formula E series has been backed by Jean Todt , president of motorsport 's world governing body the Federation Internationale del ` Automobile -LRB- FIA -RRB- .

The investors , who already have Rio de Janeiro signed up as a host city , plan to have 10 teams and 20 drivers ready to race in 2014 , following a year of testing .

The chairman of the new series will be Alejandro Agag , who already supports teams in the FIA 's GP2 and GP3 series .

`` We expect this championship to become the framework for research and development around the electric car , a key element for the future of our cities . ''

The FIA has been eager to encourage motorsport to lead the motor industry in harnessing the potential of electric engines , with innovations such as the KERS system -- which harnesses braking energy to provide an engine boost every lap -- already being adapted to mass production cars . From 2014 , Formula One pit lanes will have to be electric only .
