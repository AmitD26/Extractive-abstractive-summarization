For one , the elite society only takes individuals with IQ scores in the 98th percentile , meaning just 1 in 50 Americans is eligible .

In short , you do n't always join Mensa because you think you 're smart . You join to be set apart from most people , who are , as one member put it : `` mundane . ''

Anne Sereg is one of those geniuses .

`` It 's been a long time , '' she said about her dating life . `` I went hermit-y for a quite a few years . I just did n't find anyone who 's been interesting enough . ''

Sereg found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts , for example .

`` I 'm looking for people who are intellectually curious . And when all you 're talking about is sports teams and barbeques ... when you 're talking about physical traits and not existential philosophy , I 'm not going to get the vibe . ''

Sereg admits this attitude can limit her relationship options . But one expert thinks the results could be much worse .

A Harvard graduate , Binazir said highly intellectual people can frequently feel `` entitled '' to love . And sometimes this means unwilling to make the compromises for a successful relationship .

`` You need to remove the barriers to love . And when you exclude those people , as smart people tend to do , that 's when you become lonely . ''

According to Match 's data , 80 % of singles say they `` must have '' or find it `` very important '' to be with someone of the same intelligence level .

Sereg has decided a college education -- not a Mensa IQ -- is her basic requirement for a future mate .

`` I just want someone who can keep up with me , '' she said .

New possibilities

The new Mensa partnership will give Match.com users a new way to find common ground , said Helen Fisher , a professor at the University of Indiana and Match.com 's chief scientific adviser .

In their announcement of the partnership , Mensa and Match.com included a heat map of the U.S. , listing where the `` smartest singles '' live , based on the cities with the highest percentage of Ivy League graduates on the dating site . The top 10 is dominated by college towns such as Durham , North Carolina ; Ithaca , New York ; Ann Arbor , Michigan ; Boulder , Colorado ; and Charlottesville , Virginia .

Fisher cites numerous studies that suggest relationships with a brainy mate could come with great perks .

`` One of the most recent marriages in our Mensa group came through finding each other on Match.com , and that was before the partnership , '' she said .

`` I 'm hoping that it -LRB- works -RRB- . I do n't know if it will . But you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't have hope . ''
