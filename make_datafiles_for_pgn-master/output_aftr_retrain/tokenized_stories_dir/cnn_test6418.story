-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Alabama legislators passed several restrictive abortion bills this week , including one that could mean felony charge against any doctor performing such a procedure on a woman who 'd been pregnant as little as six weeks .

The four measures easily passed the state 's House of Representatives on Tuesday , and they still need to go through the Senate and be signed by Gov. Robert J. Bentley to become law . Both of those steps are real possibilities , given Alabama 's conservative bent and the fact the Senate , like the House , is Republican dominated and Bentley belongs to that party .

But a federal judge , Daniel Hovland , subsequently granted a temporary injunction blocking the law 's enforcement because its pre-viability provisions were `` invalid and unconstitutional . ''

In his decision , the judge said `` there is no question '' that the law known as HB 1456 directly contradicts a `` litany '' of Supreme Court cases that address restraints on abortion , including Roe v. Wade .

Doctors would be required to check for a fetal heartbeat . If they do n't , they 'd be charged with a Class C felony . They would be similarly charged if they check and find a heartbeat , then perform an abortion . -LRB- The pregnant woman would not face charges . -RRB-

`` In almost every medical situation , the litmus test to determine the need for continued medical treatment is the existence of a pulse , '' state Rep. Mary Sue McClurkin , a sponsor of the bill , said in a statement . `` We owe the same respect and reverence to the life of an unborn child that we would pay to any person facing a medical emergency . ''

As the National Institutes of Health and other experts and groups note , a fetus ' heartbeat typically can not be detected until at least 6 weeks into a woman 's pregnancy . The Alabama and North Dakota laws , then , would effectively ban abortions beyond that point -- making them the most restrictive such laws in the country .

A number of states have passed abortion bans after 20 weeks , such as Texas , Nebraska , Kansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Indiana and Alabama . Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 12 weeks .

In addition to McClurkin 's bill -- which is dubbed the Fetal Heartbeat Act -- the Alabama state representatives chamber also passed a measure increasing the required wait time before an abortion is performed from 24 to 48 hours .

Another bill states that a woman must be informed about perinatal hospital services as alternatives to abortion when a fetus is found to have a condition that will likely result in death within three months of birth . The pregnant woman must then state , in writing , that she is declining such hospice services .

`` In Alabama , we will fight tooth and nail to preserve and protect the life of the unborn until the liberal , activist Supreme Court decision making abortion legal in the United States is overturned , '' Hubbard said . `` Republicans in the Alabama House believe that life begins at conception and that a heartbeat is evidence of a viable life that deserves to be defended . ''

This is n't the first time Alabama legislators have passed a restrictive abortion law that 's brought opposition and possible interference from the courts .

The state had argued the measure is designed to protect the health of a patient . The plaintiffs call it medically unnecessary due to the safety of abortion procedures and said enforcement of the section will force them to shut down .
