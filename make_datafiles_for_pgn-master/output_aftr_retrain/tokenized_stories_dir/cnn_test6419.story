-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- How big a threat do foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq pose to the West ? It 's a question that has been much on the mind of policymakers and commentators , especially since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the United States was ramping up its military role in the region . Will such fighters return with dangerous new skills and experience that they are determined to use against their home country ? Or is the potential threat by these fighters overhyped ?

Yet there is no reason to expect all -- or even a majority -- of these people to try to attack us in the future . During my research , I have found that of all Western Muslims who joined conflict zones before 2011 , no more than one in nine moved on to terrorism in the West . In fact , this estimate is probably at the high end -- the real historical average may be closer to one in 15 or 20 .

Can we not simply assume that somewhere between one in nine or one in 20 of the fighters in Syria will become terrorists , and try to plan accordingly ? Unfortunately , it 's not that simple because the `` blowback rate '' -- the proportion of outgoing fighters who later return to attack -- varies significantly between destinations .

So , how can we determine whether Syria will produce foreign fighters that are more like Somalia or more like Afghanistan and Pakistan in terms of blowback ?

It largely depends on whether you have a group in the theater of conflict that strategically targets the West . For example , the Afghanistan-Pakistan area has a high blowback rate because it is home to the so-called al Qaeda Central , a group whose sole preoccupation is to mount attacks in the West . Al Qaeda excelled at taking foreign fighters who had come to fight with the Taliban and persuading them to undertake attacks in Europe or the United States instead .

Most other jihadi groups , even al Qaeda 's own affiliates , are not equally invested in this strategy . True , they all spout anti-American rhetoric and may even dabble in anti-Western extremist actions . But they invest the bulk of their resources in local operations .

And so far , that has been true of ISIS , too . Of course , if you look for anti-Western statements and links to potential international plots , you will find them . But these indications actually make up a small proportion of the group 's overall ideological production and military operations . The fact is that there is little to suggest that ISIS has had a sustained and centrally directed global operations program .

This is one of the reasons why the blowback rate from Syria has so far been low , several plots notwithstanding . Six plots involving a total of , say , 10 or 20 Syria veterans make for a blowback rate of one in 150 or one in 300 . Yes , it is still early in the conflict , and several plots may have gone unreported . But Syria is still looking like a low blowback foreign fighter destination .

There is , however , the question of whether Western intervention in Iraq and Syria will cause ISIS to go global . Certainly , the group has taken a more anti-Western posture over the past few months . It has repeatedly threatened to attack the United States , and it has beheaded American hostages in Syria .

In a noteworthy statement , for example , ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani recently called on supporters worldwide to attack members of the coalition in any way possible . So we should not be surprised if ISIS embarks on a limited but sustained external operations effort , along the lines of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen , which combines a primarily local agenda with a small global side operation .

Likelihood of foreign fighters planning attacks in West varies by where they were , writer says

ISIS less interested in planning attacks overseas than al Qaeda , Thomas Hegghammer says

ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda has , he says
