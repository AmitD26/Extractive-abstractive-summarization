`` The call was recorded and transferred to the police 's CAD -LRB- computer-aided dispatch -RRB- system , '' the statement said . `` A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . This investigation is being carried out locally .

The theft was so big that police have n't come up with a value for what was stolen .

Over the four-day Easter holiday , thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes .

A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to Â£ 200 million , or $ 300 million , in a remark widely reported by news media . Numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds .

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost .

The British tabloid The Daily Mirror claimed Friday to have obtained closed-circuit TV footage that captured the robbery being carried out . The video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered . They carried large bags , what looked like drill equipment and other tools , then exited with trash bins .

Toward the end of the video , a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins .

British police told CNN they have not released any video of the heist . When asked about the video published by the Daily Mirror , police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the Hatton Garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video .

The Daily Mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days .

At 9:27 p.m. , a street camera shows a white Ford Transit van pulling up to an alley beside the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building . Men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away , leaving the men behind .

A minute later , `` Mr. Strong '' appears , wearing a builder 's hat and carrying steel supports , which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault .

The white van returns , is loaded in two minutes , and drives off again .

On Saturday evening , Mr. Ginger returns , two days after he was first seen . The newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack . He goes downstairs toward the vault .

Saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the Tall Man , who helped carry some of the loot out of the building .

The heist would not be reported to police for two more days , on Tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work .

The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement , he said .

Once there , he said , they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were .

Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building , the detective said , `` whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation . ''

`` History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business , '' the website says . `` The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London 's jewellery trade since medieval times .

`` Today , it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London 's diamond trade . It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world . ''
