Weiland said Thursday during a televised debate that he would vote against prolonging Sen. Harry Reid 's tenure as the Democratic Leader , and challenged his Republican opponent Gov. Mike Rounds to pledge to oppose Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as the Republican leader .

Weiland 's pledge to oppose his party 's leader in the Senate does n't come as much of a surprise to those following the race .

How South Dakota became the Senate fight surprise

But Weiland framed his opposition in anti-Washington terms , calling Washington `` broken '' and both parties `` beholden to big money . ''

`` Our Congress has been bought off and nothing is going to change until we get the money out of our politics , '' Weiland said . `` The people of South Dakota deserve more than business as usual . ''

Weiland has gained a reputation for his folksy campaign style , even writing and performing modified renditions of popular songs -- turning `` Wagon Wheel '' into a song about his low-budget campaign .

And despite the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee 's $ 1 million investment in South Dakota , the support did n't flow directly to Weiland -- instead funding attack ads against Rounds .

Could Independents tip the balance of the Senate ?
