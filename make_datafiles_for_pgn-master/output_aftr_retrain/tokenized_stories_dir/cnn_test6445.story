-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Last week , after the Senate defeated a measure to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline by a single vote , a Native American sitting in the gallery broke into a traditional victory song . Greg Grey Cloud , of Lakota and Dakota heritage , was quickly detained and hauled out of the Capitol .

Here 's the thing : November is Native American Heritage Month , as it has been since 1990 following a decree by then-President George H.W. Bush . So this should be the time of the year when people learn about Native Americans , our significant contributions to this country , and maybe even the appropriate language to use in the 21st century . -LRB- Squaw is a bad word , and so is -- you guessed it -- redskin -RRB- .

Opinion : What you do n't know about Thanksgiving

Mankiller was brave and brazen and is now the subject of the new film , `` The Cherokee Word for Water . '' I recently chatted about her with Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt , who donated a song to the film and is an admirer of the late chief .

`` Wilma 's just one of my heroes , '' Raitt said .

Gloria Steinem , the revered feminist and journalist , echoed these warm words . `` From my perspective , '' she said , '' -LSB- Wilma -RSB- should 've been president of the United States . ''

`` We 're first nations people , '' he said . `` They do n't value us as much . ''

If Native American Heritage Day fell on November 5 , for example , then students would be in the classroom and teachers could offer lessons about the Native American today . But no , instead streams of bundled up shoppers are standing in line to make their purchases , with the class the last thing on any kids ' mind as they sit watching TV .

If we 're going to choose a day for Native American Heritage Day when school is out , then how about Thanksgiving Day itself ? Why not ? That way we could learn about the real history of the holiday , and not the romanticized version we all hear about .

Too gruesome ? Maybe that 's a good thing . Facts are facts , and rejecting them bodes ill for everyone .

So , this Native American Heritage Month , tell a family member or friend that Native Americans sing , they do n't chant . Let them know that the pilgrims were themselves illegal immigrants who documented themselves . Talk a bit about how Wilma Mankiller was a warrior and dedicated environmentalist . And remind someone that Native Americans have contributed to this country since the first white man stepped off the boat and refused to learn our languages .

Happy Native American Heritage Month , folks .
