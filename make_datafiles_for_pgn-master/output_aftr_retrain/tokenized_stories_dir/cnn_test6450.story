`` It 's anybody 's guess how Republicans are thinking about this , '' Obama said during a town hall event in Santa Monica , California . `` If they were thinking long-term politically , it is suicide for them not to do this . ''

`` Because the demographics of the country are such that you will lose a generation of immigrants which says , ` That party does n't seem to care about me , ' '' he said . `` In the short term , they have a problem with the tea party and others who often express virulently anti-immigrant sentiment . ''

Obama said he will make visa changes to allow more technically skilled workers to enter the United States , and noted that naturalized Americans have won 25 % of the country 's Nobel Prizes in the sciences .

Obama had planned to sign an immigration-related executive order by now as part of his `` pen and phone '' strategy to bypass a gridlocked Congress . But a flood of unaccompanied children over the U.S.-Mexico border over the summer led the White House to delay that move until after the midterm elections .

The Ohio Republican issued a joint statement with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte , a Virginia Republican .

`` It 's shocking that the White House now openly admits that President Obama is delaying his unilateral actions on immigration until after the November elections simply because of raw politics , '' the two said .

Boehner and Goodlatte said no matter the timing , it 's `` never acceptable '' for presidents to issue executive decrees that rewrite laws .
