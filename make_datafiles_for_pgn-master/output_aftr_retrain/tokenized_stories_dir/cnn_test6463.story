Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The harshest critics labeled them `` virtual strip searches . '' Airport passenger screening that produced particularly realistic full-body images using backscatter technology .

Others also expressed health concerns about low doses of radiation from the X-rays underpinning those scans .

Travelers will still go through other full-body scans that rely on a system that uses radio waves and produces less detailed body imaging . The millimeter wave machines raise fewer privacy and virtually no health concerns .

`` I think from the privacy perspective , that -LRB- the elimination of backscatter machines -RRB- has to be considered a victory , '' said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center .

The agency had developed protocols to assure that screeners who saw imagery of passengers never saw the passengers themselves .

But Congress voted to require all body scanners to have privacy-protecting software , and the TSA announced in February it was phasing out backscatter systems because they could not meet the new standard .

Rotenberg said he still has privacy concerns about millimeter wave machines , including what information is captured by the machine -- even if unseen by screeners -- and how long that information is retained .

`` We 'd like to see clearer rules about the collection of the images , '' Rotenberg said . `` Are they deleted ? Are they saved ? Is some analysis being done and can they be linked to passengers ? ''
