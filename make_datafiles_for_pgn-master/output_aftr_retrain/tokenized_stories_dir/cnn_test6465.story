The superintendent of the Santa Monica-Malibu school district said Zawahri attended a high school for students behind in academic credits in 2006 .

`` We are shocked and deeply saddened by the tragedy that ... once again , shatters our nation 's confidence , '' Superintendent Sandra Lyon said .

A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that the gunman had suffered from mental health issues . A few years ago , he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone , according to the official .
