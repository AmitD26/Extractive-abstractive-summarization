-LRB- CNN -RRB- A tenacious Tunisia broke the deadlock in Group B to put one foot in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations .

The 2004 champions were the first team to win a match in the so-called `` Group of Draw '' with a 2-1 victory over Zambia .

That result will cheer the free-flowing Zambians , who had created the best chances as dusk began to settle around the tree-fringed Estadio De Ebebiyin .

Captain Rainford Kalaba and Emmanuel Mayuka fed off one another up front but shot after shot failed to find its target .

As he stretched to reach another cross from Kalaba , his legs split wide and he was eventually carried off the field .

The untimely injury to the talismanic striker , who is on the books of English Premier League side Southampton , was the turning point of the match .

While he was being treated on the sidelines , Tunisia spied a chance to take a run at 10-man Zambia .

The equalizer , a tap in by Ahmed Akaichi , came all too easily .

As darkness fell on the town of Ebebiyin , in the north east corner of host nation Equatorial Guinea , the crowd raised its voice , urging on a winner .

The second match at the lively Estadio De Ebebiyin saw Cape Verde and DR Congo play out a physical , often scrappy , draw .

Cape Verde represent the smallest country at AFCON -- the island territory stretches to just 1.5 square miles -- but the ` Blue Sharks ' have big ambitions .

At its tournament debut in the 2013 edition of AFCON , the islanders reached the quarter finals and Rui Aguas ' men came close to joining Tunisia on the cusp of the last eight again , Thursday .

The Congo DR keeper then stooped low to brilliantly deny Heldon Ramos when he had wriggled his way clear on goal .

The Leopards ' threat was blunted early in the match when West Bromwich Albion midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu limped off .
