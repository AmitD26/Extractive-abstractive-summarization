Passengers thwarted his plan , and the plane landed safely in Boston , Massachusetts .

FBI bomb technicians and explosives experts found explosives in Reid 's shoes .

Reid , a British citizen and convert to Islam , pleaded guilty to all eight counts against him -- including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction , attempted homicide and placing an explosive device on an aircraft .

`` At the end of the day , I know I did the actions , '' Reid said when entering his plea . `` Basically I got on a plane with a bomb . Basically I tried to ignite it . ''

Previously , Reid had called himself a disciple of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and an enemy of the United States . He also said he did not recognize the U.S. legal system .
