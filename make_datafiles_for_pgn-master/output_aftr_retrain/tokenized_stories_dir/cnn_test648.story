LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation .

Raymond Soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will .

One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol , which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses . Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered .

Two immigrants , Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa , told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will .

`` That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world . ''

The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers .

`` The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards , '' Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail .

ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham , who is representing Soeoth and Diouf , said , `` It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill . ... But here , it 's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport . ''

Responding to Lieberman 's written questions , Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had `` medical escorts '' for deportation since 2003 .

From October last year to the end of April this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process . Of those , 33 detainees received medication `` because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self , '' she said .

She added no detainee should be `` involuntarily medicated without court order , '' except in emergency situations .

But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior .

He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles . Terminal Island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation .

Soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness .

`` Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees , '' the ICE statement said . `` Only trained and qualified medical professionals , including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service , may prescribe or administer medication . ''

In both cases , Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case . If they lose , they may land back in the hands of ICE , once again facing deportation .

Soeoth says he 's traumatized by what happened . `` I know this country -LSB- is -RSB- very generous to immigrants , '' he says . `` What they did to me was very , very bad . '' E-mail to a friend
