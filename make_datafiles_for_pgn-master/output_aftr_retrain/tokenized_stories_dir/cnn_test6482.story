-LRB- CNN -RRB- Uruguay 's politicians who led the charge to legalize marijuana and same-sex marriage appeared to win another ringing endorsement from voters in the South American country Sunday .

President Jose `` Pepe '' Mujica -- a former Marxist guerrilla who donates the majority of his salary , drives a 1987 Volkswagen Beetle and sells flowers with his wife at their home -- leaves office next year .

Under Mujica 's leadership , the Broad Front has pushed through reforms legalizing abortion , same-sex marriage and marijuana -- major policy shifts in a region once defined by conservative policies influenced by the Roman Catholic Church .

And that approach is n't likely to change , if Vazquez 's `` Uruguay does n't stop '' campaign slogan is any indication .

This year the South American nation became the first in the world to have a system regulating the legal production , sale and consumption of marijuana .

Lacalle had vowed to repeal some parts of the new law if he were elected .

`` There will be a strict and very close evaluation about the impact that this law has on society . We are going to analyze it very carefully . And if at any moment we see that it does not work , we will not hesitate for a moment in making the necessary corrections , '' he said , according to El Pais .

CNN en Español 's Jose Manuel Rodriguez and Dario Klein contributed to this report .
