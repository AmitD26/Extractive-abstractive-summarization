Tendani Baloyi , 4 , gets treated for cholera in Musina , on the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa .

In December , WHO spokesman Paul Garwood told CNN the organization an estimated 60,000 people would be infected with cholera in the `` worst case scenario . ''

The UN agency called for `` political differences to be put aside '' and for international intervention to deal with the crisis .

`` We are dealing with an extraordinary public health crisis that requires from us all an extraordinary public health emergency response , and this must happen now before the outbreak causes more needless suffering and death , '' the WHO 's Dr Eric Laroche said on its Web site .

Cholera is an intestinal disease caused by bacteria in contaminated water .

In early December , President Robert Mugabe 's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency , paving the way for aid from international groups such as Oxfam , Doctors Without Borders , W.H.O. , the U.N. Children 's Fund and USAID .

But that assistance has not yet improved the situation , and the disease has spread to new areas since then .

`` The problem in Zimbabwe is that the infrastructure is obsolete , especially when it comes to water sanitation . People are going for months without tap water in towns , '' said Peter Hinn , the director of a German group called Welt Hunger Hilfe -LRB- World Hunger Help -RRB- , which is helping to fight cholera in Zimbabwe .

`` In rural areas , 60 to 70 percent of boreholes -LRB- wells -RRB- are not working . So the international community might have come in but they have to address this infrastructure . ''

Zimbabwe was already suffering an enormous economic crisis , with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food , fuel , cash , foreign currency and electricity .

The country 's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March , and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during that time as runoff from the rains spreads the bacteria to other rivers , streams and wells .

Mugabe declared in mid-December that the cholera epidemic had slowed , but health experts differed with him and the latest figures seem to contradict his statement .
