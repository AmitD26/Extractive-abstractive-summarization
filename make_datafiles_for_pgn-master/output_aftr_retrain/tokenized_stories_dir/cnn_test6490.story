James Allocca , Davison 's uncle , told CNN that the family `` wants justice before someone else gets hurt . ''

The victim 's father , Timothy Davison Sr. , told CNN that he learned about his son 's death when police arrived at his door on Saturday .

He went to Pennsylvania Tuesday to collect his son 's personal belongings .

`` He cared for everyone around him , '' he said . `` He was a rugged kid , extremely sensitive . ''

Davison worked at his father 's construction business .

A task force that includes the Pennsylvania and Maryland state police as well as the FBI was investigating the two shootings over the weekend .

`` While there are many similarities between the two ; conclusive evidence definitively connecting the two has yet to be established , '' the state police statement said . `` Both investigations will be treated as being related until conclusive evidence proves otherwise . ''

Police said the shooter was driving a small truck similar to a Ford Ranger , and the vehicle would have panel damage from ramming Davison 's vehicle .

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-472-8477 .

`` There are different levels of loss , '' Allocca said . `` This has to be the worst . ''
