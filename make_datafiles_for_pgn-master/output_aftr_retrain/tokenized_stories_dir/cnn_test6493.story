`` People are personally invested , '' said Christine Reinolds Kozelle , director of news and editorial services at Berry College . `` You have this ` Truman Show ' - like experience . People want to be part of it and say they saw it happen . Plus , they are so beautiful . ''

`` When it was discovered , we were really excited about it , '' Kozelle said . `` Animal science is one of our most popular majors , so there were a lot of very curious people . We figured we 'd put up the camera and we 'd be able to sell our story as well . We had no idea it would be this popular . No idea . The first year we put it up , we had to move it because we could n't handle the traffic ; it almost crashed our server . ''

However , the livestream has revealed aspects of life in the wild that are uncomfortable for some viewers . The winter storm that just moved through the region prompted a flurry of worried posts . Even more distressing for some has been the behavior of the larger hatchling . It will peck at its smaller sibling and prevent it from eating -- behavior that has generated a huge amount of commentary online .

But school officials point out that this natural behavior for eaglets . `` It 's very common when there is more than one sibling for one to dominate , '' Kozelle said . `` This is natural , and we do n't interfere . This is a way to educate people about the natural world . ''

Still , Kozelle understands why it can be difficult to watch this behavior . `` The struggle with the nest and the temperatures , humans identify with that , '' she said . `` We take care of our children and our homes . It 's easy to get attached . ''

The eagles bring thousands of visitors to the campus of Berry College . Kozelle said exact numbers are hard to come by , but she estimates that 5,000 people come for a glimpse of the eagles every year .
