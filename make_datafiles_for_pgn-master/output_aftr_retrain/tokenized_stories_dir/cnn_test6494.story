In terms of online entertainment , the World Cup seemed to have it all .

Oh , yeah ... and the actual matches , which saw the U.S. team make an inspiring run , the powerhouse Brazilians unravel in shocking fashion and the Germans ultimately capture first prize on Sunday .

The month-long spectacle also captured another prize : It 's now the biggest social event in Web history .

On Facebook , Sunday 's final between Germany and Argentina alone spurred 280 million interactions by 88 million people , according to the company . That easily surpassed the former champ , last year 's Super Bowl , with its 245 million interactions .

Things were similarly fast and furious on Twitter , where the match was inspiring more than 618,000 tweets per minute , a new record for the site . There were a total of 32.1 million tweets about the match .

In just its first week , from June 12-18 , the tournament inspired 459 million Facebook interactions -- more than this year 's Super Bowl , the Academy Awards in March and the Sochi Winter Olympics combined .

`` This has been the first truly mobile and social World Cup , '' FIFA President Sepp Blatter said . `` The 1 billion attendance in the global stadium created the sense of togetherness the World Cup brings and the shared excitement that digital platforms offer . ''

During Sunday 's final , 10.5 million of the people engaged on Facebook were from the United States . Compare that to the 7 million people in Argentina and 5 million in Germany , the match 's actual participants , and you can see that U.S. interest in the tourney did n't disappear when the American side bowed out .

In all , 42 million U.S. fans visited FIFA Web and mobile tools during the entire tournament .

As the U.S. men 's team played its way out of a tough opening-round group that included Germany , Portugal and Ghana , U.S. Web users spent a total of 847 years and 143 days engaged with FIFA content . That 's more than soccer-crazy rivals Brazil , Germany , England and France combined .

`` The carnival atmosphere experienced at the World Cup viewing parties , where fans filled whole city blocks across the U.S. , shows the passion that JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann 's side has instilled in U.S. sports fans . ''
