-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Florida judge Friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival , ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial .

Ninth Judicial Circuit Judge Marc Lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained .

He said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors , most concerning police tactics in their interview of Lisa Nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car .

`` In each and every case , this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored , '' Lubet wrote in his opinion .

`` Unfortunately , in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands . ''

She pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm , battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon .

On the audiotape of the interview , there was no audible response from Nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court , and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police , Lubet wrote .

`` Thus , there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them . ''

Nowak testified at the August hearing she did not respond to Becton 's questions because she was confused , Lubet wrote .

In addition , he said , Becton used `` legally impermissible '' statements and techniques , including threats , to get Nowak 's statements and consent .

In a written statement , an Orlando Police Department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court , and referred questions to prosecutors .

Lubet noted that , although Nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat , she was `` subjected to a barrage of questions '' beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call .

`` Defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours , '' the judge said .

Nowak 's consent to search her car , Lubet wrote , `` followed illegal police activity , such as a prolonged detention , threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent . ''

Prosecutors accuse Nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando -- wearing NASA diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following Shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot .

Her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers .

When Shipman cracked it to talk to her , Nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray , Shipman said .

Police said Nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin .

At the August hearing , Becton testified that when he searched Nowak 's car , he found maps showing how to reach the airport , maps of the airport 's layout , a buck knife and papers including a letter Nowak appeared to have written to Oefelein 's mother .

On August 30 , Lubet granted Nowak 's attorneys ' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed . E-mail to a friend
