Shweyga Mullah 's face lights up with a smile that spreads like a sunrise across her face .

It 's heart-warming to see her finally enjoying herself . All her Ethiopian friends here had been lured to Libya by promises of lucrative work . But no one we know of has suffered quite like Shweyga .

Shweyga 's unbelievably awful story of torture at the hands of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi 's daughter-in-law Aline has touched people around the world and resulted in some $ 40,000 being donated to a special fund for her recovery .

Lying alone on a mattress on the floor , she told me how Aline Gadhafi and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body , simply because she 'd been unable to stop one of the Gadhafi children from crying .

Offers of help poured into CNN Center and resulted in her evacuation to the tiny Mediterranean nation of Malta .

She arrived here in September and has undergone surgery and skin grafts since then .

Now though , surgeons are satisfied enough with her progress to allow her to become an outpatient .

Shweyga 's life here is not ideal though . She yearns to see her family , but red-tape has slowed down efforts to bring her relatives to Malta .

Shweyga says she does n't feel ready physically or emotionally to return to Ethiopia and be subjected to the scrutiny of people in her hometown . She remains profoundly self-conscious of her appearance .

But the doctors and nurses treating her at the Mater Dei hospital are pleased with her recovery .

Nurse Bonnici says : `` She is making very good progress . It was discharging before now it 's getting drier and drier . But now it 's good , very good , she feels it 's good anyway . ''

The consultant in charge of her case , Francis Xavier Dermanin , says : `` Ms. Mullah had regular physiotherapy for mobilization of her limbs especially the right shoulder which showed signs of early contractures due to immobility from the burns that she had sustained .

`` She also had the support of our psychologists in helping her to get over the horrific trauma that she had sustained . In both aspects she did very well .

The doctors hope there are enough towards the back to enable her to grow her hair out and disguise the scars .
