-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Yahoo misled Congress regarding information the Internet company gave to Chinese authorities about the journalist Shi Tao , Democratic Rep. Tom Lantos said Tuesday .

Lantos , a California representative and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , asked Yahoo Inc. officials to testify about the company 's role in a case that sent Chinese newspaper writer and editor Shi to prison on a 10-year sentence .

Lantos said a Yahoo official testified last year that the company knew nothing `` about the nature of the investigation '' of Shi , a pro-democracy activist now serving time on what Lantos called `` trumped-up charges . ''

`` U.S. companies must hold the line and not work hand in glove with the secret police . ''

In a written statement , Yahoo spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler said Yahoo representatives have been truthful with Congress . He called the House committee 's accusation `` grossly unfair '' and said it `` mischaracterizes the nature and intent of our past testimony . ''

Callahan testified to the subcommittee that Yahoo handed over the information to Chinese authorities at a time when it knew nothing about the investigation , Lantos said .

But the San Francisco , California-based human-rights group The Dui Hua Foundation released documents in July indicating police in China had written to Yahoo saying they were seeking evidence about Shi for illegally `` providing state secrets to foreign entities , '' a charge frequently levied against political dissidents in China .

`` This new documentation suggests that Yahoo 's Beijing office was at least aware of the general nature of the crime being investigated in the Shi Tao case , '' said Joshua Rosenzweig , manager of research and publications for The Dui Hua Foundation .

Shi has appealed his 10-year sentence for divulging state secrets , saying he did not know the information he shared was classified . He accused the police of using improper procedures in the investigation and arrest .

In addition , he has filed suit in U.S. federal court against Yahoo and its Hong Kong-based subsidiary .

Yahoo 's spokeswoman said the company is working with other companies and the human rights community `` to develop a global code of conduct for operating in countries around the world , including China . '' E-mail to a friend
