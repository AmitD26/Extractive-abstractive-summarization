The counterfeits included everyday health and beauty items such as ChapStick , Johnson 's Baby Oil , Vaseline and Always sanitary pads .

Brothers Pardeep Malik , 59 , and Hamant Mullick , 60 , are accused of running an enterprise whose products also turned up in Pennsylvania and Florida , according to the Nassau County District Attorney 's Office . Authorities seized more than $ 2 million worth of products and were looking at bank accounts to determine the size of the enterprise .

A manufacturer described the operation as the biggest known counterfeit enterprise in the United States , while another company called it the only known such manufacturing operation in the country for its products , prosecutors said .

Mullick 's attorney , Michael Brown , did not return calls seeking comment .

`` We encourage consumers to be cautious about buying branded goods that look suspicious , or from outlets that are unfamiliar , '' Chris Vuturo , a spokesman for Procter & Gamble , said in a statement .

The case came to light when Valley Stream Fire Department officials in January conducted a building inspection at the site of a fire a year earlier . Nassau County Fire Marshall officials took samples of products they found and sent them to the manufacturers , who verified the counterfeits .

Fire department officials said they found manufacturing supplies but no material safety data sheets , which normally accompany these supplies .

The brothers are accused of selling the products to distributors who , in turn , delivered them to retailers in New York , Pennsylvania and Florida . An investigation is underway to determine if there are more locations .

The prosecutor 's office is trying to determine the chemical makeup of the products and the health risks , if any , associated with them .

Authorities gave the following tips to identify fakes : Look for signs such as strange pictures on the package or strange colors or typeface . Some sophisticated knockoffs may be hard to detect , but the price may be atypically low . Counterfeits will not have the same quality or consistency of real products . Shop at established and trusted stores , which are likely to be connected to legitimate supply chains .
