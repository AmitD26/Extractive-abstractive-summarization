The NYPD 's Demographics Unit -- or Zone Assessment Unit -- was developed with the CIA 's help after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . The unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included Muslim-owned business and mosques across the New York region and has been the target of controversy and civil lawsuits .

The statement continued : `` Understanding certain local demographics can be a useful factor when assessing information regarding potential threats coming to the attention of the New York City Police Department , it has been determined that much of the same information previously gathered by the Zone Assessment Unit may be obtained through direct outreach by the NYPD to the communities concerned . ''

Two advocacy groups that filed a lawsuit challenging the unit and its activities said they were pleased it had been disbanded but want to ensure the surveillance stops .

`` While we welcome the dismantling of the Demographics Unit as a long overdue step towards reining in the unconstitutional excesses of the NYPD , what has to stop is the practice of suspicion-less surveillance of Muslim communities , not just the unit assigned to do it , '' said a joint statement by Muslim Advocates and the Center for Constitutional Rights , which filed the lawsuit in 2012 . `` We will continue to work , through litigation and advocacy , to ensure the NYPD is fully and finally respecting the rights of the Muslim community . ''

`` This is an important first step . However , the damage of unconstitutional mass spying on people solely on the basis of their religion has already been carried out and must be addressed , '' said Board President Ryan Mahoney .

`` Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe , but that is also respectful and fair . This reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve , so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys , '' de Blasio said in a statement Tuesday .

Bratton , who was police commissioner in the 1990s , once again took the helm of the nation 's largest police department in December at a time of low crime rates but heightened tension with the public over his predecessor 's controversial policies .

When Bratton was introduced as New York City police commissioner , he talked about bringing the police and the public `` together in a collaboration of mutual respect and mutual trust . ''
