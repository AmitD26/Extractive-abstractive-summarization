Retired Gen. Eric Shinseki Sunday promised to work for veterans `` each and every day . ''

`` There is no one more distinguished , more determined , or more qualified to build this VA than the leader I am announcing as our next secretary of Veterans Affairs -- Gen. Eric Shinseki , '' Obama said at a press conference .

`` No one will ever doubt that this former Army chief of staff has the courage to stand up for our troops and our veterans . No one will ever question whether he will fight hard enough to make sure they have the support they need , '' Obama added .

Obama said the nation must focus on helping troops who have served their country especially during bad economic times .

Obama said Shinseki , who served two combat tours in Vietnam and lost part of his foot , `` understands the changing needs of our troops and their families . And he will be a VA secretary who finally modernizes our VA to meet the challenges of our time . ''

Shinseki , who spoke after Obama , made a vow to his fellow veterans . If confirmed , he said , he will `` work each and every day '' to ensure the nation is serving them `` as well as you have served us . ''

The official announcement took place in Chicago , Illinois , on Sunday , the anniversary of Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 .

`` He was right , '' Obama replied .

Veterans groups appeared to support the selection .

For years , Shinseki , a highly decorated Vietnam veteran , has been cited as an example by Pentagon critics who say the former Army chief 's sage advice was ignored in 2003 , resulting in too few U.S. troops being sent to Iraq after the invasion .

Shinseki testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2003 that `` something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers would be required '' to pacify the country . The comment infuriated some Bush administration officials , and he retired just a few months later .

Still , Rieckhoff said , `` Shinseki is a guy who had a career putting patriotism above politics . He is a wounded veteran so he understands the plight of veterans . '' iReport.com : What do you think of Obama 's cabinet picks so far ?

John Rowan , president of Vietnam Veterans of America , called the reported pick an `` interesting choice . ''

`` I am satisfied with it , '' Rowan told CNN on Saturday , adding that the choice seems to be in the Obama transition team 's pattern of `` bringing in strong personalities into all the positions who are n't going to ` yes ' him to death . ''

`` In February 2003 , Gen. Shinseki honestly and correctly assessed our nation 's military needs before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , '' the statement said . `` This same level of candor and honesty will serve President-elect Obama well so he can quickly and accurately identify VA 's many challenges and then implement responsible solutions that take into consideration our veterans ' needs and concerns .
