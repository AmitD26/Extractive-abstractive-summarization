Massachusetts ' highest court ruled Friday that the Pledge of Allegiance does not discriminate against atheists , saying that the words `` under God '' represent a patriotic , not a religious , exercise .

All previous attempts to eliminate the mention of God in the pledge recited in classrooms across the country have failed , but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered arguments seeking removal of the reference based on discrimination .

The decision said the plaintiffs failed to prove that reciting the pledge resulted in negative treatment .

`` The plaintiffs here did not successfully allege that their children receive negative treatment because they opt not to recite the words ` under God , ' or that the inclusion of that phrase in the pledge has occasioned ` the creation of second-class citizens , ' '' the decision said .

Speckhardt said that the recitation of the pledge resulted in some children being `` ostracized '' for being atheists and that the government was complicit in bullying and prejudice against those children .

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has high-profile and precedent-setting experience deciding cases hinging on the Equal Rights Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution . In 2003 , Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage with the Supreme Judicial Court 's landmark Goodridge decision .
