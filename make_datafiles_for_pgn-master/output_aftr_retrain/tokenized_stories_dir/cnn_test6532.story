Can complaining too much get you booted from a frequent flier program ?

It 's one of the questions at the heart of a lawsuit filed against Northwest -- now owned by Delta Air Lines -- by S. Binyomin Ginsberg , a rabbi who lives in Minneapolis , Minnesota , and frequently travels to lecture and teach .

But in June of 2008 , Ginsberg said a Northwest representative called him and told him his status was being revoked `` on the ground that he had ` abused ' the program , '' according to court papers .

`` It did n't make sense . Initially , when they contacted me on the phone I thought it was a prank call , '' Ginsberg said .

`` When I pushed for a reason and clarification , they told me it was because I was complaining too much . ''

In July 2008 , Northwest sent the rabbi a letter noting that he had made 24 complaints in the past eight months , including nine incidents of his bag arriving late at the luggage carousel , according to court papers .

`` You have continually asked for compensation over and above our guidelines . We have awarded you $ 1,925.00 in travel credit vouchers , 78,500 WorldPerks bonus miles , a voucher extension for your son , and $ 491.00 in cash reimbursements , '' the letter states , according to court papers .

Ginsberg 's lawyers countered that the rabbi and his wife had been averaging about 75 flights on Northwest each year , and that Ginsberg estimated that only about 10 % of the trips had resulted in a call to Northwest 's customer care .

It stated that Northwest could determine `` in its sole judgment '' whether a passenger has abused the program , and that abuse `` may result in cancellation of the member 's account and future disqualification from program participation , forfeiture of all mileage accrued and cancellation of previously issued but unused awards . ''

Ginsberg sued for breach of contract in January of 2009 , but a California district court dismissed the class action suit , agreeing with Northwest that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted his claim . The act prohibits parties from bringing state law claims against airlines that relate to a `` price , route , or service '' of the carrier , according to court documents .

Delta did not respond to a request for comment , but the airline has requested a re-hearing in the case .

Ginsberg -- who is still a frequent flier , but is no longer loyal to any one airline -- said he is hoping to get his miles back , have his status reinstated and get fair compensation for what he 's gone through .

`` We live in a country that was built on freedom and this to me is a tremendous abuse of freedom . ''
