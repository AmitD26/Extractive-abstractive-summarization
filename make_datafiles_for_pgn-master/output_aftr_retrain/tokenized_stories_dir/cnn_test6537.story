The last contact with the ship was late last week , and it was unclear exactly when the hijacking took place , said Andrew Mwangura , the head of Kenya Seafarers Association .

No further details about the ship , its crew or cargo were immediately available , said Mwangura , whose organization keeps tabs on the welfare of sailors captured by the pirates .

Dozens of ships have been attacked in the Gulf of Aden by pirates based in largely lawless Somalia in recent months .

This has led to calls from commercial ship owners for a military blockade along the coast of Somalia to intercept pirate vessels heading out to sea .

At present , warships from a number of countries patrol an international maritime corridor , escorting some merchant ships and responding to distress calls in the area . But the navies involved say it is virtually impossible to patrol the vast sea around the gulf .

The pirate identified himself using only one name , Daybad , when he spoke late Monday to the BBC .

Pirates seized the Sirius Star on November 15 in their most audacious hijacking to date . The vessel is carrying two million barrels of crude oil worth about $ 100 million .

Elsewhere , the head of U.S. military operations in Africa has said he does not have any evidence that Somali pirates are connected to al Qaeda .

The Africom chief , Army Gen. William `` Kip '' Ward , told The Associated Press Tuesday that the chaos off Somalia 's high seas is a reflection of the country 's political chaos .
