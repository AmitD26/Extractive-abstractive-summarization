Violent protests left at least five dead and others wounded Wednesday as demonstrations over Quran burning intensified in Afghanistan .

Police killed four people and wounded 10 others during protests in Parwan province , said Abdul Wassi Sayedkhili , a provincial council official .

Karzai noted an investigation will begin Thursday over the killings .

The Qurans were among religious materials removed from a detainee facility at Bagram Airfield . The materials were gathered for disposal and were inadvertently given to troops for burning , Gen. John Allen , commander of NATO 's International Security Assistance Force , said Tuesday .

`` This was not a decision that was made because they were religious materials , '' he said . `` It was not a decision that was made with respect to the faith of Islam . It was a mistake . It was an error . The moment we found out about it , we immediately stopped and we intervened . ''

A military official said the materials were removed from the detainee center 's library because they had `` extremist inscriptions '' on them and there was `` an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications . ''

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul went into lockdown as the protests entered a second day Wednesday .

On Tuesday , thousands of demonstrators gathered outside a detention facility in Parwan , according to Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson , a coalition spokesman .

A day later in Kabul , about 400 to 500 people rallied , including university students who marched toward the Parliament building , police said .

In Jalalabad , the capital of Nangarhar province , hundreds chanted `` Down with America '' as crowds gathered near the local airport .

A U.S. warden message said more protests are possible in `` coming days , '' adding that `` past demonstrations in Afghanistan have escalated into violent attacks on Western targets of opportunity . ''

Allen , the coalition commander , offered his apologies Tuesday and issued a directive that all coalition forces in Afghanistan will undergo training no later than March 3 so they can identify religious materials and handle them correctly .

But Allen 's words were not enough to appease angry Afghans who massed outside the Bagram base Tuesday , chanting `` Death to America ! Death to the Afghan government ! Long live Islam ! ''

He said the burnings were `` completely unintentional . ''

Muslims regard the Quran as the absolute word of God . It is so highly revered that many Muslims will not pick up the holy book without ablution , a ritual washing of the hands .

American officials vociferously condemned the pastor 's act .

In 2010 , Afghans protested outside the Forward Operating Base Mirwais in response to an alleged Quran burning inside the base . But coalition forces said the suspected burning was a routine burn-pit session in which military documents are destroyed .

On Tuesday , a leading Islamic scholar urged Muslims not to react violently to desecration .

`` What is captured on the pages can be printed again . If they burn 1,000 , we can print 10,000 . What 's the big deal ? '' said Sheikh Ibrahim Mogra , who chairs the mosques and community affairs committee of the Muslim Council of Britain . `` A NATO soldier killing innocent people is far more painful than the burning of a Quran . I would rather they burn 100 Qurans than to hurt one woman or man or child . ''
