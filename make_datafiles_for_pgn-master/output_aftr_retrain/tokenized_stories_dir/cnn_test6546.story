It 's something you do n't often hear from the leaders of a terrorist group known for violence : We 're sorry .

But that 's just what the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said in a video message Sunday , apologizing for a hospital attack in Sanaa earlier this month that left dozens of people dead .

The attackers were directed not to assault the hospital or mosque in an attack against a Yemeni Ministry of Defense compound on December 5 , but one fighter made a mistake and attacked the hospital , leader Qassim Al-Raimi says in the video .

The apology comes after Yemeni government officials released surveillance video showing the hospital under attack .

The surveillance footage showed patients nervously looking out of the hospital windows , then running after an explosion .

In another clip , patients and staff huddle in a hallway . They watch as an attacker walks calmly toward them , activates an explosive and lobs it in their direction .

`` We saw what the Yemeni channel broadcast : a gunman entering a hospital . ... We did not order him to do so , and we are not pleased with what he did , '' Raimi said . `` Moreover , it wronged us and pained us , because we do not fight in this manner . ''

In November , Syrian rebels with al Qaeda ties apologized for mistakenly beheading a wounded rebel fighter after assuming he supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .

In 2009 , an al Qaeda spokesman released a video message offering condolences to `` unintended Muslim victims '' killed in attacks .

Behind the scenes , Bergen said , leaders of the group have expressed concerns about the impact such attacks would have on the group 's reputation .

`` We know from the documents recovered at the bin Laden compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Navy SEALS in May 2011 , al Qaeda 's leaders were often writing to each other privately and also to groups they are associated with about the need to minimize civilian -LRB- Muslim -RRB- casualties and often wrote about the damage to the al Qaeda brand that killing civilians had achieved by al Qaeda operations in Iraq , '' Bergen said . `` But the straightforward public apology ... is a new development . ''

In Sunday 's message , Raimi said the group would financially compensate families of victims in the hospital attack .

Since the attack , Yemeni government officials have repeatedly stated there are no drone operations based at the compound .
