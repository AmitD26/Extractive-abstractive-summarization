`` I do n't even know if he ever saw pictures of me , '' said Malone , now 70 .

But eight years ago , she made her first-ever trip to visit his gravesite -- in Belgium , his final resting place after battles throughout Europe , including the liberation of Paris .

`` It brought me some peace in my soul . Up until then , I only heard ` You were young then . Your father never came home , ' '' Malone said . `` But I do n't think I understood until now , at my age now , that he was someone who fought and died .

`` When I stood next to his grave , that was the closest I ever was to him , and it was just great . ''

The battle monuments commission was created by Congress in 1923 . Foreign cemeteries for American military members existed earlier , but most conflicts before then were fought at home or incurred fewer casualties .

Veterans in Focus : Celebrating service

World War I changed everything .

`` Given the number of those killed on all sides , the U.S. did not know what do to . How can you bring this many over ? But they also had to figure out a way to commemorate why these men died , their sacrifice , '' said Tim Nosal , the commission 's director of public affairs .

Among the first cemeteries was Meuse-Argonne in France , containing more than 14,000 American military dead , the largest number interred in a single place in Europe .

Families of deceased World War I soldiers were given choices regarding their loved ones ' remains . Among them were burial in these overseas cemeteries with perpetual care ; return to the United States to a national cemetery or to a family grave site ; or sending the remains anywhere in the world , with the family responsible for funeral costs . About 20 % of families chose overseas cemeteries .

`` They took so many casualties , we decided it was hallowed ground , '' Nosal said , referring to Meuse-Argonne , adding , `` when you leave the cemetery you are literally walking in trenches of the war . ''

The military repeated the program for World War II , leading to the creation of the battle monument commission 's best-known cemetery , Normandy , which appeared in the closing scene of the movie `` Saving Private Ryan . '' Legislation in 1947 put World War II cemeteries in the commission 's care , as well .

France has 11 American cemeteries , the most of any other country . Belgium has three , the United Kingdom and Italy , two , Luxembourg and the Netherlands , one .

Various travel companies bring Americans to these cemeteries and other war sites .

`` World War II vets are literally dying out , unfortunately , '' Sincock said , `` but some of their adult children are taking interest . ''

Bruce Malone first learned at age 12 that his grandfather was buried in Belgium after he was killed in 1944 . The knowledge `` sparked a love of military history ever since . I can understand what it means to the family to have a relative who never came home . ''

`` One thing I will never forget , the hundreds of people at the memorial , '' she said . `` The Belgian people are so thankful now . There is a group that has adopted my father 's grave .

They put out flowers and visit my father 's grave . ''

Young Americans might benefit most from a visit , Carol Malone said .
