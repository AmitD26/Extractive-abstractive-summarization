-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's reading matter not for the faint of heart .

Experts at Harvard said this week that they have confirmed that a 19th-century book housed in one of the university 's libraries is bound in human skin .

Bouland left a note in the volume explaining what he had done .

`` A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering , '' he wrote .

Although binding a book in another person 's skin may seem creepy nowadays , the library says it was n't always so unusual and reviled .

Bouland refers in his note to another book in his collection , SÃ © verin Pineau 's `` De integritatis & corruptionis virginum notis , '' that was also covered in human hide .

The macabre version of `` Des destinees de l'ame '' was deposited at Houghton Library in 1934 by a book collector and given to the library permanently 20 years later by the collector 's widow .

The Crimson , Harvard 's college newspaper , reported in 2006 that there were at least three books in the university 's vast collection that were bound in human skin .

But Houghton Library said that testing of the other two volumes , at the Harvard Law School Library and the Harvard Medical School 's Countway Library , established that they were actually wrapped in sheepskin .

Tests to rule out apes

The tests , taking microscopic samples from various parts of the binding , allowed analysts to identify the source of the material through its proteins .

The analysis of `` Des destinees de l'ame '' matched `` the human reference , and clearly eliminated other common parchment sources , such as sheep , cattle and goat , '' said Bill Lane , the director of the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource Laboratory .

But the scientists had to do further tests to make them confident that the binding did n't come from another primate closely related to humans , like the great apes and gibbons .
