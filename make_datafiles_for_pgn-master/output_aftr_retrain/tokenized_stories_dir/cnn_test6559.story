Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres committed themselves to the quest for peace Sunday during a meeting of key figures in the Middle East peace process .

But unlike previous attempts to achieve a resolution to the region 's turmoil through traditional means , there would be no negotiating nor any political talks at Sunday 's summit . This appeal would be made to a higher calling : Abbas and Peres prayed for peace together Sunday at the Vatican home of Pope Francis .

`` In this , the birthplace of the Prince of Peace '' the Pope said in Bethlehem 's Manger Square following a May 25 Mass , '' I wish to invite you , President Mahmoud Abbas , together with President Shimon Peres , to join me in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace . ''

Sunday 's meeting was a first for the Vatican , which had never hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict .

`` Without peace , we are not complete . We have yet to achieve this mission of humanity , '' Peres said . `` Even when peace seems distant , we must pursue it to bring it closer . ''

The Pope said the meeting is the response to people who want to live as brothers and sisters and not as enemies .

`` I hope that this meeting will be a journey toward what joins us , to overcome what divides us , '' Francis said .

Only time will tell if today 's prayers will go answered .
