A bias against liberals existed in a Justice program meant to hire young lawyers , an investigation found .

The report , the first official investigation to document politicization of the Justice Department during the Bush administration , is an offshoot of the larger investigation of Justice Department politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine U.S. attorneys .

The report found that McDonald and Michael Elston , the chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty , engaged in misconduct , an administrative violation . The third member of the screening committee , career lawyer Dan Fridman , was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process .

Goodling directed Elston to lead the selection committee in 2006 . She and Elston have both left the Justice Department . She refused to be interviewed for the inspector general 's report .

As a result of the controversy , the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations .

Both Justice Department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations .

The report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account . It says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates , but there were no complaints about the committee 's work from 2003 to 2006 , when Goodling put Elston in charge of the process .

The report Tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad-ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the Justice Department during the Bush administration .

CNN 's Terry Frieden contributed to this report .
