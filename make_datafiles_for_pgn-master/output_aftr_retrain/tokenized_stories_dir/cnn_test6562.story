No matter who did it , shooting down a commercial airliner with almost 300 people aboard gravely escalated an already dangerous conflict in eastern Ukraine .

More than that , the tragedy appeared certain to worsen a so-far diplomatic showdown regarding Ukraine with Russia on one side and the United States and the European Union on the other .

Already , hawkish Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for a bigger U.S. role if Russia was involved .

What happened ?

Ukraine blamed Russian-backed separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region where the plane went down . The separatists said they lacked the firepower to hit a plane flying at more than 30,000 feet and accused Ukraine of doing it .

They pointed out that separatist forces recently shot down a Ukrainian transport plane at 21,000 feet , which was out of range of known separatist weaponry .

After a classified briefing later Thursday , McCain told reporters that `` the separatists could have only gotten that capability from Russia . ''

Does it matter who did it ? Yes and no .

The repercussions are huge in any case , but will differ depending on what happened .

Regardless of who fired the missile , the impact of such an air disaster means investigations , reports , lawsuits and other bureaucratic responses that continue for years .

The international component of passengers potentially hailing from multiple countries adds further complexity , along with the location in a region of low-level warfare in recent months .

If separatists using Russian firepower or Russian forces did it , the United States and European Union would come under pressure to take tougher steps against Moscow .

So far , they have imposed sanctions on Russia and provided economic help and other aid to Ukraine . On Wednesday , Obama announced further sanctions due to Russia 's failure to take steps to end the Ukraine conflict .

`` This would have the most profound repercussions , '' McCain told CNN of possible Russian responsibility . Later , he told reporters the United States should `` arm the Ukrainian military , which we have shamefully not done , increase sanctions to a dramatic degree '' and treat President Vladimir Putin and Russia `` as a pariah nation , which if , they are responsible for this , they deserve . ''
