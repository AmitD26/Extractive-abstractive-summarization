-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure , under a law that takes effect September 1 .

There are some exceptions , including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault , incest or other violations of law .

`` Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation , which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision , '' said his deputy press secretary , Lucy Nashed .

Critics say the new law is unnecessary .

Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period , and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions , she said .

`` It 's going to make it more difficult for women to get an abortion , '' Gutierrez said , calling it the most stringent sonogram law in the country .

But Elizabeth Graham , director of Texas Right to Life , said , `` As long as they are following the law , they have nothing to worry about . ''

The law , she says , `` will strengthen informed consent and bring abortion closer to standards that are set for other surgical procedures . ''

`` The sonogram law is an enormous step forward toward protecting women 's health in Texas , '' she said .
