With all Democratic precincts reporting , Obama had the support of 38 percent of voters , compared to 30 percent for John Edwards and 29 percent for Hillary Clinton .

`` The numbers tell us this was a debate between change and experience , and change won , '' said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider .

Iowa delivered fatal blows to the campaigns of Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware . Both have decided to abandon their White House runs .

On the GOP side , Sen. John McCain of Arizona , whose campaign was languishing six months ago , and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney are now tied for first place in New Hampshire , according to the poll , which was released Wednesday .

For the winners of both party 's caucuses in Iowa , it 's an age revolt for Democrats versus a religious revolt for Republicans , Schneider said .

Speaking to supporters , Obama called the night a `` defining moment in history . ''

`` You came together as Democrats , Republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation , we are one people and our time for change has come . '' Watch an audio slideshow of the candidates ' speeches ''

Huckabee 's victory can be attributed to his overwhelming support among evangelical voters and women , the polls indicate .

Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who has turned the focus of his campaign to the February 5 `` Super Tuesday '' primaries , trailed with 4 percent .

For most of 2007 , Huckabee languished in the single digits in the polls and had very little success raising money . But his momentum picked up in the final six weeks of the year when social conservatives -- an important voting bloc in Iowa -- began to move his way .

Clinton , speaking with 96 percent of the vote in , portrayed herself as the candidate who could bring about the change the voters want .

`` I am so ready for the rest of this campaign , and I am so ready to lead , '' she said .

Edwards , in a tight race for second , said Iowa 's results show that `` the status quo lost and change won . '' Watch Edwards describe his next move ''

`` Now we move on ... to determine who is best suited to bring about the changes this country so desperately needs , '' he said .

McCain , who had largely abandoned Iowa to focus on the New Hampshire primary , said , `` The lessons of tonight 's election in Iowa are that one , you ca n't buy an election in Iowa ; and two , that negative campaigns do n't work . '' Watch what McCain says about the results ''

The Iowa Democratic Party said 124,000 people participated in the 2004 caucuses , while the Republican Party of Iowa estimated that 87,000 people took part in the 2000 caucuses . -LRB- President Bush ran unchallenged for a second term in 2004 . -RRB-

Caucus-goer Kathy Barger , inside a Democratic caucus site in Walnut , Iowa , said the room she was in was packed to the brim with a line out the door . Watch what it was like inside the caucus ''

`` I do n't know how they are going to be able to fit everybody in the room , much less count the votes , '' she said . `` There are bodies in every available space in the room . ''

Iowa Democrats , unlike Republicans , use a more complicated system to determine a candidate 's viability . Republican caucus-goers are asked for their support for a candidate only one time during the event . Democrats are asked twice : an initial question of support , and a second if their first-choice candidate does not reach a 15 percent threshold to achieve viability .

Among Republican candidates , Thompson , a former senator from Tennessee , and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California needed strong showings in Iowa to keep their campaigns going , while Paul , a representative from Texas , is likely to ride his surge of popularity through February 5 -- `` Super Tuesday , '' when 24 states hold their primaries -- no matter where he places in the early contests .
