During the Venice Biennale in 2007 the Ghanaian sculptor transformed the facade of a museum by draping one of his exquisite metal tapestries over the top of it , causing a sensation in the art world .

`` Broken Bridge II '' will be his largest installation yet -- a 37-foot-high sculpture made of recycled pressed tin and mirrors woven together with copper wire .

`` When you 're living in a Mission House , you have everything there , you do n't need to go out and therefore you do n't know too much about indigenous society ... I was kind of isolated from it , '' he said .

Even as a boy , he knew he wanted to be an artist : `` I had a kind of calling . '' He went on to study Fine Arts at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi , then an `` unimaginable '' thing to do .

He felt strongly that he wanted to know something about his own indigenous culture .

`` Having been estranged from it and exposed to art being produced in Europe and Asia , I was wondering why we did n't have art as well , '' he said .

The similarity gave him `` quite a shock , '' and was the catalyst for his exploration of his native culture -- and his attempts to , as he puts it , `` indigenize my consciousness . ''

He started using materials from his local environment , recyclables like the bottle caps . `` A lot of people call them waste , but to me they are not waste ... There are people who collect these things , smash them and make them into utensils like big cooking pots , '' he said .

The bottle tops in his flowing , shimmering installations also have a deeper meaning .

Despite the deep affinity El Anatsui has for homegrown African culture , he resists being called an African artist .

`` I do n't know any -LRB- artist -RRB- who wants to be geographically categorized only . Artists want to be known only as artists , '' he says .

He says that when the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York first acquired his art , it was for their African Galleries and only later for their Modern and Contemporary Art Galleries .

This `` raises so many questions as to what precisely I am -- am I an African artist or an artist ? '' he asks , adding it is high time museums `` revisited their categorizations . '' He adds : `` An artist in India is the same as an artist in Africa , Ghana , Japan or America . ''

`` It 's a versatile form . I think an art form should be a replica of life itself -- life is not something which is cut and fixed -- it is constantly changing . ''
