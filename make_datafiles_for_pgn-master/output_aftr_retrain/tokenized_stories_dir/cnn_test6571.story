A federal judge on Friday ruled that Michigan 's prohibition on same-sex marriage violates the U.S. Constitution , ordering the state to stop enforcing the ban .

Similar rulings recently have been issued in Texas , Virginia , Kentucky , Oklahoma and Utah , though in those cases judges have put off enforcement of the decisions until higher courts can weigh in .

`` This is a wonderful decision , '' Byrum said . `` Many Michiganders have been waiting for equality in our great state , and I look forward to the opportunity to issue marriage licenses to all loving couples . ''

That day may not come so fast . Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette , a Republican whose term expires later this year , announced Friday evening he 's filed an emergency request for Friedman 's order to be stayed and appealed .

`` In 2004 , the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable , '' Schuette said . `` Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution , and their will should stand and be respected . ''

He was referring to the year that voters in Michigan , along with those in 10 other states , passed state constitutional amendments restricting `` marriage or -LRB- a -RRB- similar union '' to between one man and one woman .

But public opinion shifted over time . An ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this month found that 59 % of Americans favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. .

Friedman -- like federal judges in other recent , similar cases -- ruled Michigan 's ban violates the Equal Protection Clause in the U.S. Constitution 's 14th Amendment .

Friday 's ruling , then , would seem to open the door to same-sex couples jointly adopting children , since now they could be legally married .

In the ruling , Friedman cited the Supreme Court 's landmark decisions last June rejecting parts of the Defense of Marriage Act while ruling same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits .

In addition to United States v. Windsor , Friedman also pointed to Loving v. Virginia -- in which the Supreme Court ruled that Virginia 's ban on interracial marriages was unconstitutional .

`` Both the Windsor and Loving decisions stand for the proposition that , without some overriding legitimate interest , the state can not use its domestic relations authority to legislate families out of existence , '' the judge wrote .

`` Jayne and I do want to get married , but this case is about the protection of our children , '' a joyful DeBoer said . `` It is not about individuals , it is not about her or my relationship . It is about ensuring that our children will remain together no matter what happens to her and I. ''
