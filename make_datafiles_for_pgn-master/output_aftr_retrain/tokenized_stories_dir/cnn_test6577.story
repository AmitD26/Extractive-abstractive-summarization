Steve Garban resigned Thursday from the Penn State Board of Trustees , becoming the first board member to step down following the release of a scathing report that found it was part of the failure that allowed a longtime sexual predator to prey on boys at the school .

In a letter posted on the university 's website , Peetz said she accepted the resignation .

Garban worked at the university for 33 years . He was re-elected to his fifth term on the board in 2010 , according to a biography posted online .

Freeh 's report cast a wide net of blame , from the late famed football coach Joe Paterno to the university trustees , in the scandal .

Garban 's resignation is the latest fallout for the university , which is still under scrutiny by the Department of Education and the National Collegiate Athletic Association -LRB- NCAA -RRB- , inquiries that could further tarnish its reputation and that of its storied football program .

Two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal , and more charges are possible as the state 's Attorney General 's Office investigates what Penn State may have known about Sandusky 's behavior .

Sandusky 's legal team has said it will appeal the convictions .
