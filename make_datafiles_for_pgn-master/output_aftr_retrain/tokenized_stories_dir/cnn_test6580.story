An alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania pleaded not guilty Tuesday to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York .

Wearing gray sweatpants , a black , long-sleeved shirt and black flip-flops with beige socks , al Libi walked from the holding area into the stately wood-paneled courtroom .

In response to a question from Kaplan , al Libi said he preferred to be addressed by his proper name , Nazih Abdul Hamed al Ruqai .

Abu Anas al Libi is the name he was known by within al Qaeda . Al Libi means `` from Libya . ''

He will be appointed a Criminal Justice Act attorney trained in handling federal terrorism cases . He is being held without bail , since Kaplan agreed with prosecutors that he poses a flight risk and is a danger the community .

That lawyer , David Patton , issued a statement Tuesday stressing that `` the presumption of innocence is not a small technicality here . ''

Patton notes his client is mentioned in the 150-page indictment `` in a mere three paragraphs relating to conduct in 1993 and 1994 and nothing since . '' In those paragraphs , authorities allege al Libi met with al Qaeda members about bombing the U.S. Embassy in Kenya , which ended up happening five years later in 1998 .

U.S. officials say he was taken initially to a Navy ship for questioning before he was brought to the United States over the weekend .

`` It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try in the U.S. , because once you arrive on U.S. soil , that ends the interrogation of these high-value detainees , '' King said . He added that that would n't have happened had al Libi been sent to Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and faced a military commission there .

President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try people such as al Libi in American courts .

Holder then reversed course , announcing that accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others would be tried by a military commission at Guantanamo .

Al Libi was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia , Yemen and Somalia .

State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week that there was no chance that al Libi would end up at Guantanamo .

`` The administration 's position on Guantanamo is clear : Our goal is not to add to the population , it 's to reduce it , which we 've done , '' she said . `` Our policy is not to send any new detainees to Guantanamo . ''

Family wants a lawyer

`` We do n't want him talking to just anyone , '' Abdullah said . `` We do n't want just any lawyer asking him questions . ''

Some terrorism experts have questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide . A former jihadist associate told CNN last week that it was unlikely that he still had an active role with the terrorist network .

The Libyan government has protested that it has n't been able to see al Libi yet , in accordance with international law that allows countries to stay in contact with their citizens who are accused of a crime in a foreign nation . A senior Obama administration official said it was n't possible to give Libya consular access to al Libi until he had arrived in the United States .

`` We have every intention of allowing this ; it just has n't happened yet , '' the official said .

Al Libi is set to return to court on October 22 at 4:30 p.m.
