America 's contentious and costly war in Iraq officially ended Thursday with an understated ceremony in Baghdad that contrasted sharply with its thundering start almost nine years ago .

U.S. troops lowered the flag of command that flew over the Iraqi capital , carefully rolled it and cased it in camouflage in accordance with Army tradition .

The quiet ceremony , under a bright Iraqi sun , was the opposite of the nighttime `` shock and awe '' bombardment of Baghdad that launched the war against Saddam Hussein in March 2003 .

Hussein 's regime proved easy to topple , but no weapons of mass destruction were found , and the United States and its allies were left occupying a country where they were not greeted as liberators , despite the prediction of Bush 's vice president , Dick Cheney .

Iraq erupted into sectarian violence , leaving U.S. troops to try to contain what threatened to become a civil war . Improvised explosive device became a household term , traumatic brain injuries a signature wound of the war .

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , who flew into Baghdad for Thursday 's flag-lowering ceremony , recalled that when he visited in 2006 as a member of Bush 's Iraq Study Group , `` sectarian violence was skyrocketing , and it seemed as if nothing was working . ''

But , he said , `` After a lot of blood spilled by Iraqis and Americans , the mission of an Iraq that could govern and secure itself has become real . ''

In all , the United States spent more than $ 800 billion in Iraq .

He said the United States was `` deeply indebted '' to all Americans in uniform . Nearly 4,500 of them were killed in this war , more than 30,000 wounded .

In their own words : Eight lives changed by the Iraq war

`` This is a time for Iraq to look forward , '' he said . `` This is an opportunity for Iraq to forge ahead on a path to security and prosperity . We owe it to all of the lives that were sacrificed in this war not to fail . ''

`` As long as there are assassinations and explosions from time to time in this country , then of course I have fears , '' said ministry of transportation employee Abu Hadeel . `` When I walk in a crowded street , I have concern of any sudden explosion . There are no guarantees . ''

Student Moutazz Sami said Iraq was not prepared militarily or politically to handle challenges . But businessman Ethar Mohammed said `` every beginning has an end . ''

`` The political divisions are huge and no one knows what will happen after December 31 , '' the date by which American troops must leave , said Iraqi journalist Mina al-Oraibi , assistant editor-in-chief of Asharq Alawsat newspaper in London .

All U.S. troops must be out of Iraq by the end of this month after Washington and Baghdad failed to agree on terms under which they could remain .

As of Tuesday , only 5,500 American troops remained . A senior defense official traveling with Panetta said that some troops -- perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 -- will remain in Kuwait for a certain period of time but said the details have not been worked out with the Kuwaitis .

Opinion : I 'm grateful my husband served in Afghanistan , not Iraq

Iraqis , on the other hand , are worried that the United States wants to disengage from their country entirely , al-Oraibi said , pointing out that Obama came to office partly on the strength of his opposition to the war and sent Vice President Joe Biden to visit recently rather than coming himself .

But Brett McGurk , a former adviser to three U.S. ambassadors , pointed out that U.S. disengagement has been a process , rather than a sudden action . Iraq , he said , has been in charge of its own security since 2009 .

Gen. Martin Dempsey , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , explained in practical terms what the end of the U.S. military mission meant .

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States will help the people `` realize their own ambitions for a free and sovereign Iraq . '' It also will work closely with the Iraqi government to ensure the safety of U.S. civilians staying in the country , she said .

`` I think it 's understood this is one of the most challenging missions that the State Department has ever led , but we 've had a great deal of thought given to what needs to be accomplished , '' Clinton said in Washington .

But if Iraq can emerge as a free and democratic nation , every American soldier should feel proud , said retired Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt .

`` Because of you , because you sacrificed so much for a people that you had never met , Iraqis have a chance to forge their own destiny , '' Obama said . `` That 's part of what makes us special as Americans . Unlike the empires of old , we did so not for territory or for resources . We do it because it 's right .
