The U.N. General Assembly on Thursday approved a resolution calling the Crimean referendum to secede from Ukraine invalid .

Moscow formally annexed Ukraine 's southern Crimea region last week , days after the controversial referendum in which a majority of Crimeans voted to leave Ukraine for Russia .

Adding to tensions , Russia now may have as many as 40,000 troops near its border with Ukraine , two U.S. officials told CNN on Thursday . The officials said that this estimate was largely based on satellite imagery and that a firm number is difficult to assess .

However , a spokesman for Ukraine 's Council of National Security and Defense told CNN his government estimates 88,000 Russian troops are at the Ukrainian border .

She has already been Prime Minister twice before and ran for President in 2010 .

`` Yes , I am planning to run , '' she said at a news conference at her Kiev office .

Tymoshenko said she intended to ask delegates at her Batkivshchyna Party congress on Saturday to nominate her as a presidential candidate .

Ukraine 's elections are taking place against a backdrop of poor economic conditions , Moscow 's annexation of Crimea and rumblings of discontent in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern regions .

U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday praised the loan agreement between the IMF and Ukraine , and said the United States will do its part to help , too .

The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved $ 1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine , along with sanctions against Russia for its intervention in Ukraine .

Earlier this month the House of Representatives approved Ukraine loan guarantees and is now voting on sanctions .

A rerun of the election handed the presidency to her political ally , Viktor Yushchenko , under whom she was Prime Minister . Amid broad disappointment with that government 's performance , Yanukovych was again elected in 2010 .

Tymoshenko was imprisoned in 2011 in a corruption case linked to a gas deal she brokered with Russia in 2009 . She served two years of a seven-year term , mainly under prison guard in a hospital in Kharkiv .

Many demonstrators carried her picture during mass anti-government protests that began in November and eventually ousted Yanukovych .

Early presidential elections in Ukraine are scheduled for May 25 . Former boxer Vitaliy Klitschko and billionaire businessman Petro Poroshenko are also expected to take part in the elections .
