-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- All eyes shifted toward the beginning of the runway when a dark-haired model strutted out in a star-spangled red bikini to a fusillade of flashbulbs at Tommy Hilfiger 's New York Fashion Week show on Monday .

She fit right in at nearly 5 ' 11 '' tall with a svelte frame . But despite adhering to the anonymous runway model aesthetic , Kendall Jenner tends to stand out .

The teen , who appears alongside her paparazzi-favorite family in `` Keeping Up with Kardashians , '' is trying to find her own footing in the high-fashion world without her polarizing siblings and parents .

`` You just do n't know how -LRB- casting directors -RRB- are going to react to it . It could be like ` Oh , just another reality TV star coming in , trying to be something , ' '' Jenner said . `` This is what I want to do . ... This is my career . This is what I wanted to be . ''

The 18-year-old is on the cover of the September issue of Teen Vogue and appears in the fashion-heavy September issue of its high-end counterpart , Vogue .

This year , she walked for high-fashion brands overseas like Chanel , Giles and Givenchy .

Before Fashion Week started , she decided to omit her last name from her casting card , which is sent out to runway suitors from her agency , The Society Management .

`` Whether it was a big TV camera or a little picture camera , I feel like I 've always been in front of a camera , '' Jenner said .

In her Fashion Week debut in February , she made a splash with a chest-baring look for Marc Jacobs , which Jenner describes as a '' ` hello world ' kind of moment . ''

It 's a far cry from the shy child she used to be .

Given her exposure , it 's easy to forget she 's a California girl , straight out of high school .

`` I was so terrified to get in a cab the first time I was here , '' Jenner admitted .

As for what 's coming up for the ingenue , Jenner shares two words familiar to any TV watcher : `` Stay tuned . ''
