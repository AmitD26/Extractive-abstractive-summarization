Underwater explorer Barry Clifford , who led a team that found and investigated the wreck , says he 's confident it is .

`` Every single piece fits . Now , of course , we have to go through the whole archeological process , and we plan to do that within the next few months , but I feel very confident that we 've discovered the site , '' he told CNN .

`` This is the ship that changed the course of human history , '' Clifford said .

`` It is the Mount Everest of shipwrecks for me , '' said Clifford , 68 .

But it is n't a new find for him . Clifford 's announcement involves a wreck he and his team investigated in 2003 . A cannon was found as part of the wreck . But , Clifford told CNN , archaeologists at the time `` misdiagnosed '' the cannon .

Two years ago , after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus ' time , `` I woke up in the middle of the night and said , ` Oh my God , ' '' Clifford told CNN . He realized the 2003 find might have been the one .

A couple of weeks ago , he returned to the wreck with a group of experts . The team measured and photographed the ship . But some items , including the cannon , had been looted from the ship in the intervening years , Clifford said .

The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago , Clifford said . The wreck is stuck on a reef off Haiti 's northern coast , 10 to 15 feet beneath the water 's surface .

It was the flagship of Columbus ' small fleet that set sail from Spain in August 1492 under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I .

The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China , India and the gold and spice islands of the East . But the land the sailors set eyes on in October 1492 was an island in the Caribbean .

Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola , which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic . Columbus established a fort in Haiti .

That December , the Santa Maria accidentally ran aground off the island 's coast . Some planks and provisions from the wrecked ship , which was about 117 feet -LRB- 36 meters -RRB- long , were used by the garrison at the fort , according to Encyclopaedia Britannica .

Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships , the Nina and the Pinta , in January 1493 .

Archaeological study needed

Most of the ship is in shape and will be possible to excavate with the help of the Haitian government , said Clifford , who made a name for himself salvaging pirate ships off the coasts of Cape Cod and Madagascar .

`` I do n't think any of us should take for granted what has been written , '' Clifford said . `` This is a tremendous touchstone to that period in time . We do n't know what secrets are going to be held on the ship . ''
