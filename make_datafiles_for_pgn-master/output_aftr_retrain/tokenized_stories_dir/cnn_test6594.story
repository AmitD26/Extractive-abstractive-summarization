It must also be a discussion based on the constitutional framework that provides for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -LRB- HKSAR -RRB- within China .

Much discussion has centered around the recent decision of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress -LRB- NPCSC -RRB- of China on the parameters for electing the chief executive -LRB- CE -RRB- by one-person , one-vote in 2017 .

Critics say the nominating framework is too restrictive and that only candidates favored by Beijing will eventually appear on the ballot .

Such claims are unfounded as we have not even started to discuss the detailed but crucial aspects of the nominating process for potential chief executive candidates .

Election method

On the question of electing the chief executive , the Basic Law , Hong Kong 's `` mini-constitution , '' provides that `` the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures . ''

To change over to this new election method , the Basic Law requires the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all -LRB- currently 70 -RRB- members of the Legislative Council , the consent of the CE , and be reported to the NPCSC of China for approval .

I sincerely hope that legislators will take the historic step forward to achieve universal suffrage for the election in 2017 as scheduled .

So far the debate has focused on the system per se . But the chief executive 's unique constitutional position within China also needs to be understood more clearly in order to fully appreciate the basis for the electoral process .

All these are enshrined in our Basic Law . These additional powers are devolved from the Central People 's Government . This is why the central government has the power to appoint the chief executive as well as principal officials .
