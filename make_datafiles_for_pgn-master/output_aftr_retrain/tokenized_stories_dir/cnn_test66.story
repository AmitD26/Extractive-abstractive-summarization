Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The `` Sons of Anarchy '' actor suspected of killing his landlord before falling to his death on Wednesday had drug issues , mental health problems and was a threat , his probation report said last spring .

The May 17 report says that Johnny Lewis , 28 , `` suffers from some form of chemical dependency , mental health issue and a lack of permanent housing . Given this , -LRB- Lewis -RRB- will continue to be a threat to any community he may reside . ''

Police are seeking to understand what may have sparked the rampage that led to the death of Katherine Davis , 81 .

She died from `` blunt head trauma and strangulation , '' according to preliminary findings from the autopsy conducted Thursday , the Los Angeles County Coroner 's office said .

Lewis was arrested twice in February on burglary and battery charges in Santa Monica , according to records obtained by CNN .

Mandel , who first represented Lewis in April , said he never would have predicted Lewis ' involvement in a killing and had not suspected he was taking drugs .

`` From April until August or September , he was probably using no drugs at all , '' he said . `` He was incarcerated for a couple of months and then he went to a treatment facility . ''

Police suspect drugs may have been involved , but `` we do n't have any hard evidence that says he was on anything right now , '' LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said Thursday .

Other neighbors told police they heard a woman 's screams and glass breaking , Smith said .

An officer responding to a neighbor 's 911 call found Lewis dead in the driveway , Smith said Thursday .

The house `` appeared to have been ransacked , '' he said . Davis ' body was found on the second floor of the three-level house , with her dead cat nearby , police said .

Lewis had lived in the home , located on a winding , narrow residential street on the eastern edge of Hollywood , for about two weeks , Smith said .

He played Kip `` Half Sack '' Epps in 26 episodes during the first two seasons of `` Sons of Anarchy '' on the FX Network , according to the Internet Movie Database . His character was killed in the finale of season two .

Sutter told TV writer Alan Sepinwall in an interview published in December 2009 that `` Johnny was n't happy on the show . ''

Lewis played Dennis `` Chili '' Childress in nine episodes of `` The O.C. '' in 2005 and 2006 , according to IMDb.com .

Lewis , whose full name is Jonathan Kendrick Lewis , was born and raised in Los Angeles . He held dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship , according to his IMDb biography .
