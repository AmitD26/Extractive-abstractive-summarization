`` On several diplomatic occasions when Bob Levinson 's name has been brought up to Iranian officials , the standard answer is , ` We do n't know anything about that . ' But the next thing out of the Iranian officials ' mouths are to discuss the matter of the Iranians held by the Americans in Irbil , Iraq , '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , told reporters . `` You can draw your own conclusions . ''

U.S. troops arrested five Iranians accused of being members of an elite Iranian military unit during a January 2007 raid in the Kurdish city of Irbil . They were accused of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq , but Iran said they were diplomats and accused the United States of violating international law by raiding a consulate .

Nelson and Florida Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler , whose district includes Levinson 's Coral Springs home , are trying to jump-start efforts to find the missing man . Wexler said Iranian authorities have not assisted the Levinsons , saying they have `` zero knowledge '' of his whereabouts and are stonewalling `` any effort to gain pertinent information . ''

Levinson 's wife , Christine , said her husband was working as a private investigator on a cigarette smuggling case when he disappeared .

`` It 's been extremely difficult for my family , '' she said . `` We hope to resolve this as soon as possible . ''

In a January 22 letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Wexler asked that the case be raised `` at the highest levels . '' Nelson raised Levinson 's status during Clinton 's confirmation hearing .

Nelson said the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations has discussed Levinson 's case with him under the `` fiction '' that he represents the people of Florida , not the U.S. government . But he said the Iranians have never acknowledged holding the former federal agent .

Levinson family members have met with local Iranian officials and have traveled to Iran to retrace his steps . Christine Levinson also flew to the United Nations in September to ask questions about her husband , whom she says suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure . The family has offered a $ 5,000 reward for information leading to his safe return .

The State Department and FBI have consistently denied Levinson was working for the government and have demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him . State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the U.S. government has called on Iran to provide more information about the matter `` for some time . ''

`` His family 's extremely concerned , as you can understand , that no information has been forthcoming , '' Wood said . `` So , again , we call on the Iranians to provide whatever information they have on Mr. Levinson so that we can hopefully return this gentleman to his family . ''
