-LRB- CNN -RRB- News that a jury has ordered Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams to fork out $ 7.4 million in damages and profits for allegedly drawing on Marvin Gaye 's 1977 hit `` Got to Give It Up '' in their song `` Blurred Lines '' has thrust the issue of music copyright into the headlines . But it 's by no means the first time .

It makes this old-timer think : Wait , how did anyone release that song and not think it sounded like Petty 's `` Wo n't Back Down '' ? I assumed it was a collaboration ! The only plausible explanation is that every executive , every studio employee and every human involved in that decision was under 30 and had never heard of Tom Petty . Or MTV . Or iTunes . Or the music industry .

But , it turns out music -- and music similarity -- is almost entirely in the eye of the beholder -LRB- or `` be-hearer '' -RRB- .

In a music plagiarism case , one musician claims that another composer has `` stolen '' his pre-existing song . The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the challenged composition -LRB- 1 -RRB- is substantially similar , and , further , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that this similarity is due to copying . The challenge is that even if the plaintiff can prove song similarity , the plaintiff usually has no evidence that the accused composer actually heard the song in advance .

If a composer and his work are not famous , naturally it 's harder to prove access to a musical composition that has largely been distributed no further than a dog-eared notebook in mom 's basement . It 's hard to hold a defendant liable for infringement solely because the piece is similar , and courts are reluctant to do so .

At the same time , `` access '' today is much easier to prove than it was before the Internet . If someone has five fans on his aspiring-rapper Facebook page , and he posts songs recorded right onto his MacBook , can it be said that a Sam Smith had `` access '' to that music when he records a nearly identical tune ? After all , technically , it was only a click away on the Internet , just not a click that anyone was likely to make . The advent of the Internet means artists now have `` access '' to everything , at any time .

Surprisingly , courts have held that in cases of the unknown , un-famous plaintiff , the `` access '' may be inferred where the plaintiff proves the similarity between the songs is both substantial and striking , and also that the similarities could only have come from copying , and not coincidence .

So , in an era where every song ever composed is online , at our fingertips , it all boils down to a collective smell test . And if you have ever seen Vanilla Ice defend his accused theft in `` Ice Ice Baby '' of David Bowie and Queen 's classic sound in `` Pressure , '' you know that there really is not much difference between `` Da-Da-Da Da-Da Da-Da '' and `` Da-DA Da-Da Da-Da-Da Da . '' -LRB- Here 's the link to that piece of tape , for no other reason than it 's a fantastic example of self-delusion . -RRB-

The fascinating thing is that the music business is full of these alleged song robberies . Since music is so personal , whether the listener hears the old song in the new depends heavily on the individual 's music preferences and knowledge . If you are proficient in the art of blues or rock chord progression , for example , you may recognize that the famous Baroque canon by Pachelbel , is almost identical chord-wise to Blues Traveler 's '90s hit `` Hook . '' This , even though no one would confuse the feel or genre of `` Hook '' with Pachelbel 's wedding classic .

On the other hand , if -LRB- like my Grandpa Vito -RRB- you think all rap music sounds like `` pots and pans clanging together , '' then you may not have the palate for differentiating between rap , hip-hop , house or trance . The point is , music theory may be a hard science , but music appreciation is anything but . As a result , music comparison is all over the map .

For example , in 1971 , former Beatle George Harrison was sued for supposedly pilfering the Chiffons song `` He 's So Fine '' for his hit song `` My Sweet Lord . '' YouTube `` He 's So Fine '' right now and listen . Now YouTube `` My Sweet Lord . '' Identical or different ? The chords are substantially similar in both verse and chorus . The fact that the songs are from different `` eras '' is either a minor distinction to you , or dispositive of any claims .

Sure , each side can call experts in music theory at trial to testify about the circle of fifths , and tonal harmony this and arpeggio that . But those experts would still be explaining it to a lay judge , jury and even lawyers . These laypeople are all individuals , all experiencing music differently .

And in the case of the Chiffons ' song and Harrison 's `` My Sweet Lord '' ? The court ultimately determined that Harrison 's use of parts of the Chiffons ' song , in the same order , sequence and harmonies , meant Harrison subconsciously misappropriated `` He 's So Fine . '' Is that how you would have called it ? Play it for your spouse or kids and see what they say . You may find they disagree with you .

Of course , for me , the key lesson in all this is that knowing Petty 's music now seems to mean that I am officially old . Which means it 's time to retire my acid-wash jean jacket with the Whitesnake patch . Even worse , though -- if potential litigants such as Smith and Petty are going to start resolving disputes without hiring us lawyers , then I might have to retire my law license along with the denim jackets .
