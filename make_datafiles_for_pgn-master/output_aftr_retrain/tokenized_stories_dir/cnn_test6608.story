-LRB- CNN -RRB- Kayla Mueller , an American aid worker and ISIS hostage whose death was confirmed by her family this week , might have been paired with a male ISIS fighter during her captivity , U.S. intelligence and government officials said Wednesday .

The officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , cited unspecified intelligence gleaned about the case . A U.S. intelligence official said it was unclear whether Mueller was coerced , sold or forced into the pairing .

The National Security Council said it was breaking with protocol to make a statement about an American hostage .

Mueller 's parents announced Tuesday that it had received confirmation that their daughter , who was captured in northern Syria in 2013 , had died .

ISIS sent the family a private message over the weekend with information about her death , Meehan said Tuesday .

The message included photos . One picture showed her wrapped in a burial shroud , but there was enough showing for the family and forensics examiners to identify her , a U.S. official briefed on the matter told CNN .

On Friday , ISIS said that Mueller , 26 , of Arizona , had been killed in a building hit during a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa , the militants ' de facto capital in Syria . At the time , ISIS offered no proof to back up its claim , other than an image of a building in rubble .

The photos in the private weekend message showed bruises on the face , The New York Times reported , but it was unclear whether her injuries were consistent with being killed in the rubble of a flattened building , as ISIS claimed .

Mueller made it her life 's work to help others . She was a 2009 graduate of Northern Arizona University and worked with humanitarian groups in northern India , Israel and Palestinian territories , a family spokeswoman said .

`` She had a quiet , calming presence . She was a free spirit , always standing up for those who were suffering and wanting to be their voice . ... Kayla 's calling was to help those who were suffering , whether in her home in Prescott , or on the other side of the world , '' her aunts , Lori Lyon and Terri Crippes , said Tuesday .

In August 2013 , Mueller fell into the hands of hostage-takers in Aleppo , Syria , her family said , after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital she was visiting .

Mueller 's letter gives glimpse into time in captivity

Her family said ISIS contacted them in May with proof that she was alive . The militants eventually said they would kill her if the family did n't pay nearly $ 7 million by August 13 , according to a source close to the family .

The Mueller family reached out to the White House last summer when ISIS issued a deadline to execute Kayla and asked if the government would be willing to trade Siddiqui , known as `` Lady Al Qaeda , '' in exchange for Mueller , a spokeswoman for the family said . ISIS has repeatedly made public calls for Siddiqui 's release .

`` The family was doing everything it could to bring their daughter home , '' the spokeswoman said . It asked the White House if it could have Siddiqui 's sentence commuted . The White House responded , but the spokeswoman would not say what the answer was .

`` She begged for help . ` Please try to help me , get me out -LRB- of -RRB- here . I 'm so sick , I 'm dying , ' '' she said , recalling the audio .

Barakat , a Syrian journalist who met Mueller while in Turkey , said she heard the 10 - to 15-second recording about three months after Mueller was abducted . She tried contacting Mueller by Skype and by email , but never heard back from the hostage .

U.S. President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the government had worked to free Mueller and other hostages .
