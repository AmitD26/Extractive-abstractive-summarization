-LRB- CNN -RRB- Many have been asking whether Tuesday 's horrific execution-style killing of three Muslim students in North Carolina was due to a dispute over a parking spot .

Let 's be real . People do n't die over parking spots .

On his Facebook page , Hicks reportedly showed his support for `` anti-theism , '' the active opposition of religious belief . As Reza Aslan explained in a recent essay , anti-theists often view `` religion as an insidious force that must be rooted from society -- forcibly if necessary . '' The lead photo on Hicks ' page talked about how he wanted `` religion to go away , '' and in a 2012 post , he quoted heavily from biologist and so-called `` New Atheist '' Richard Dawkins .

Dawkins himself said he considers this religion of some 1.6 billion people `` as one of the great evils in the world . '' For his part , Hicks allegedly wrote , `` When it comes to insults , your religion started this , not me . If your religion kept its big mouth shut , so would I. ''

Anti-Muslim hate crimes are five times more common today than they were before 9/11 . And just a couple weeks ago , a Texas state senator effectively questioned the loyalties of Muslim-Americans , reportedly posting on her Facebook page that she had left instructions with her office that Muslim visitors `` publicly announce allegiance to America and our laws . ''

Neighbors have said that Hicks was prone to outbursts and that he made everyone feel unsafe , Muslim or otherwise . But that in and of itself does n't make Hicks an equal opportunist when it comes to his choice of alleged victims . Being mentally unstable or a generally angry person and being motivated by religious hate are not mutually exclusive .

Still , although the killings of these three young Muslims should not be attributed to a lack of belief in God , they were allegedly committed by a man with an active contempt for belief in God . Regardless of whether law enforcement deems these killings officially a hate crime , we as a society need to acknowledge that violent extremists come in all creeds -- and they can be inspired and their anger nourished by any religion , or animosity towards one .

With this in mind , the mainstream majority -- hailing from whatever faith or ideology -- needs to stand united against these kinds of acts of violence , regardless of the source . In practical terms , this means going beyond condemnation , by following the examples of people like Deah , Yusor , and Razan who lived out their faith values through service to others . We should also follow the example of organizations like Found Beyond Belief , which launched an atheist and humanist community drive to honor the victims .

Ultimately , our nation 's diversity is its strength . As citizens , we must do whatever we can to protect it .
