London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With competition still fierce in the jobs market , some people might be tempted to beef up their resume by buying a fake degree .

The problem of fake degrees is nothing new , but the Internet has made it easier than ever to obtain a bogus qualification .

George Gollin , a board member of the U.S.-based Council for Higher Education Accreditation , told CNN he estimates that more than 100,000 fake degrees are sold each year in the U.S. alone . Of those , around one third are postgraduate degrees . He added that a bogus degree will typically cost $ 1,000 .

By trade , Gollin is a physics professor at the University of Illinois . He first became interested in degree mills after being spammed with offers of fake college degrees .

The institutions that sell these fake qualifications are known as either diploma mills or degree mills . Diploma mills issue fraudulent diplomas supposedly granted by real universities , while degree mills pose as real universities .

According to Gollin , setting up a degree mill is simply a matter of creating a Web site that looks like it belongs to a genuine university . The Web site includes a way for customers to pay for their qualifications online and a place for prospective employers to contact to verify the degree is genuine .

Some degree mills award degrees on the basis of the buyer 's supposed `` life experience , '' while others require a small amount of coursework . One degree mill required about a week 's worth of coursework to earn a masters degree .

Gollin said this token coursework is largely for the customers ' benefit -- to help them convince themselves they have earned their qualification .

`` Anyone who 's had any contact with a real college curriculum knows how hard you have to work , '' Gollin told CNN . `` If you can get a whole PhD over the course of one week and you do n't know that 's not legitimate , then you 're just dumb . ''

But for some , knowingly buying a fake degree is an easy way of improving their job prospects .

Those people come from all walks of life . Gollin gave the example of one American who bought a Bachelor 's degree in nuclear engineering , and who 's now working in the control room of a nuclear power plant .

He also cited a U.S. degree mill that sells fake PhDs to real medical doctors for $ 10,000 , and added that unqualified doctors have been jailed in the U.S. after attempting to practice medicine with a medical degree bought online .

Gollin warned that degree mills are becoming increasingly sophisticated , often carrying official-seeming accreditation that makes them appear to be genuine universities . The catch is that the accreditation is supplied by bogus organizations -- `` accreditation mills . ''

Many countries have government-run web sites where you can easily check if a university is officially accredited . But because diploma mills offer fake degrees from real universities , it is essential that employers also check with someone at the university that the degree was actually issued .
