Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stood side by side in Geneva as they set out a series of steps the Syrian government must follow .

Syria must submit a comprehensive list of its chemical weapons stockpile within one week , Kerry said , and international inspectors must be on the ground no later than November .

President Barack Obama said in a statement that the framework `` represents an important concrete step toward the goal of moving Syria 's chemical weapons under international control so that they may ultimately be destroyed . ''

He added , `` There are consequences should the Assad regime not comply with the framework agreed today . And , if diplomacy fails , the United States remains prepared to act . ''

Senior U.S. State Department officials said that according to the timeline , initial inspections of declared chemical weapons sites must be completed by November ; all production and mixing and filling equipment must be destroyed by November ; and all chemical weapons material must be eliminated by mid-2014 .

Kerry said the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must allow `` immediate and unfettered '' access to international inspectors .

He said the inspectors should be able to get to Syria 's chemical weapons sites despite the ongoing civil war , provided the al-Assad regime cooperates , since Syria has moved its chemical weapons into areas where it has tight control .

The United States and Russia reached a shared assessment on the amount and type of chemical weapons possessed by the al-Assad regime , Kerry said .

Syrian crisis : Keep up with key developments

The United States and Russia `` agree that Syria has a stockpile that includes chemical warfare agents as well as the precursors for those agents , '' judged to be about 1,000 tons in total , the officials said .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday his team is preparing a report for the Security Council that he believes will be an `` overwhelming report that chemical weapons were used . '' The report is expected to be delivered Monday morning , according to three diplomatic sources .

Syrian opposition fears

The Syrian opposition struck a note of skepticism .

Gen. Salim Idriss , head of the rebel Free Syrian Army , told reporters in Istanbul he has information that Syria already started to move chemical materials and weapons out of the country , into Lebanon and Iraq .

In Turkey , U.S. soldiers guard against Syrian missile threat

The Syrian government refers to the opposition fighters as terrorists and has previously accused them of chemical weapons use .

Some inside Syria criticized the focus on chemical weapons . Protesters in one town held up a banner in Arabic saying they are `` worried that the international community is giving Assad a license to kill with all kinds of weapons except the use of chemical weapons . ''

Hopes for peace

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the U.S.-Russian agreement `` constitutes an important step forward , '' a sentiment echoed by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague .

The two plan to meet Kerry on Monday in Paris to discuss the framework and its implementation .

Ban pledged U.N. support for the plan , his spokesman said , and expressed hope that it would both prevent any future use of chemical weapons and pave the way for a political solution in Syria .

Opinion : Is diplomacy the harder solution in Syria ?

The U.N. estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed since the civil war began in 2011 , in addition to more than 2 million becoming refugees and over 4 million being displaced within Syria .
