-LRB- CNN -RRB- A U.S. court has ruled that the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian Liberation Organization must pay more than $ 650 million to American citizens and their loved ones for attacks in Israel in the early 2000s .

That said , the decision is n't final . And even if it does hold up , there 's no guarantee the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian Liberation Organization will pay up .

Both groups are `` deeply disappointed '' by Monday 's ruling , which Palestinian Authority spokesman Mahmoud Khalifa said stemmed from `` baseless '' charges and `` ignored the legal precedent set time and again by other U.S. courts ... that established U.S. courts are not the proper jurisdiction for such a hearing . ''

Khalifa expressed confidence that the PLO and Palestinian Authority will prevail in American courts during its coming appeal .

Palestinian leaders are combating `` extremism and violence and maintain a strong commitment to nonviolent resistance and international legal , political and moral redress , '' the spokesman added , claiming that this case does n't help in this regard .

`` This case is just the latest attempt by hardline anti-peace factions in Israel to use and abuse the U.S. legal system to advance their narrow political agenda , '' Khalifa said . `` The decision is a tragic disservice to the millions of Palestinians who have invested in the democratic process and the rule of law in order to seek justice and redress their grievances , and to the international community which has invested so much in financial and political capital in a two-state solution . ''

The U.S. case dates back to the Second Intifada , or armed uprising , in which Palestinians staged a series of deadly attacks inside Israel . According to figures from Israel 's internal security agency , known as the Shin Bet , some 488 Israelis died in suicide attacks between 2001 and 2004 .

On 9/11 , the lawyer from New York escaped the World Trade Center before its twin towers collapsed . Then , four months later , he was walking through West Jerusalem when a bomb went off , killing one man and wounding more than 110 people .

Sokolow afterward told CNN that he suffered mostly superficial injuries , though his wife 's condition was `` a little bit more serious . ''

`` I feel very fortunate that someone , God , is looking over us to make sure that we 're OK , '' he said then .
