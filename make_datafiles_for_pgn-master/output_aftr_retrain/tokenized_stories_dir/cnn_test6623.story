-LRB- CNN -RRB- The attack Wednesday on the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris touched off three days of terror in France as authorities staged an intensive hunt for the suspects . On Friday , security forces killed two suspects in the magazine attack who were holed up in a building north of Paris . At the same time , security forces stormed a kosher grocery store in Paris where a man suspected of killing a police officer had taken hostages . The suspect was killed and four hostages were found dead while others fled safely .

They then headed to the correct building , where they killed an officer on security detail , officials said . They later encountered a Charlie Hebdo cartoonist who was on her way out of the building and demanded she lead them to the offices . Once there , she was told to enter a security code to open its fortified door , according to the newspaper .

The gunmen barged in during a lunchtime editorial meeting , separating men and women and calling out the names of employees they intended to kill , said Dr. Gerald Kierzek , a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors .

He described the gunfire as a precision execution .

The gunmen said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted `` Allahu akbar , '' which translates to `` God is great , '' Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said .

Some workers managed to flee to the rooftop and record video as the attackers left and fired on police .

In all , 12 people died the attack .

Wednesday night

Thousands of Parisians took to the streets Wednesday night and held a defiant vigil for the victims .

Social media responded to the terrorist attack with `` Je suis Charlie , '' or `` I am Charlie . '' The show of solidarity with Paris and the satirical newspaper went viral in a multitude of languages .

Heavily armed police fanned out across the country overnight searching for the two other suspects in the attack , who would be later identified as Cherif Kouachi and Said Kouachi , brothers known to French and international intelligence .

Thursday morning

As that search was ongoing , people dressed similarly to those in the Charlie Hebdo attack -- all in black and wearing bulletproof vests -- shot a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge . She later died .

Armed officers , some in helmets and carrying shields , searched fields and forests as helicopters with night-vision optics buzzed overhead .

Thursday afternoon

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls raised the terror alert level in the Picardy region to the highest level as it became the focal point in the search .

Police and French special forces troops surrounded a building in Dammartin-en-Goele , about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- from Villers-Cotterets , believing the Kouachi brothers were inside .

A member of France 's parliament told French channel ITele the two suspects told police they wanted to die as martyrs .

In Dammartin-en-Goele , the move by security forces on the building where the Kouachi brothers were hiding ended with both men dead , according to district Mayor Bernard Corneille .

Friday night

Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for orchestrating the attack on Charlie Hebdo , the founder of the magazine The Intercept , Jeremy Scahill , told CNN . CNN has not independently confirmed this claim .
