-LRB- CNN -RRB- An ancient ring has shed new light on the ties between Vikings and the Islamic world , more than a century after its discovery .

The finger ring found in a 9th century Swedish grave is inscribed with Arabic Kufic writing . The letters appear to read `` AL _ LLH , researchers say , which they interpret as meaning `` for/to -LRB- the approval of -RRB- Allah . ''

The ring is part of the Swedish History Museum 's collection , originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst , bearing the inscription `` Allah . ''

`` Together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken : if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away , also the file markings would be gone . But the metal surface displays no wear , and as the original file marks are still in place , this ring has never been much used . ''

The team , therefore , believes the ring was passed from an Arabic silversmith to the woman , with few or any other owners in between .

The owner of the ring was found wearing traditional Scandinavian clothing , but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave .

`` It is not impossible that the woman herself , or someone close to her , might have visited -- or even originate from -- the Caliphate -LRB- which then stretched from Tunisia to the borders of India -RRB- or its surrounding regions , '' they said .

While travel between the Islamic caliphate and the Viking world was recorded in ancient texts , tales of such journeys often included references to `` giants and dragons '' making it hard to tell fact from fiction , the researchers said .

`` The importance of the studied Birka ring is that it most eloquently corroborates ancient tales about direct contacts between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world . Such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods , culture , ideas , and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in-between , '' they concluded .

Modern relationship

This new evidence of ancient ties between the Vikings and the caliphate comes at a time when Sweden 's relationship with the modern Islamic world seems to be problematic .

Saudi Arabia blocked Wallstrom from giving a speech to the Arab League in Cairo on March 9 , in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women .

The United Arab Emirates said it had summoned Sweden 's ambassador to protest `` the abusive remarks by the Foreign Minister of Sweden , Margot Wallstrom , against Saudi Arabia . ''
