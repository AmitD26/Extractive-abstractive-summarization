-LRB- CNN -RRB- A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union , university officials said Thursday .

The prestigious private school did n't identify the student , citing federal privacy laws . In a news release , it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review .

The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday , the university said .
