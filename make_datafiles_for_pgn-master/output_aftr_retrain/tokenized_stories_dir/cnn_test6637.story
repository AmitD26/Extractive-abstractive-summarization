-LRB- CNN -RRB- This is the end . Beautiful friend , the end .

Over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit . Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been `` Mad Men '' cocktails and `` Mad Men '' museum exhibits and even `` Mad Men '' presidential references .

Don Draper , the creative director played by Jon Hamm , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours .

Its subjects have taken the show to heart . In March , a `` Mad Men '' bench was unveiled in front of New York 's Time & Life Building , where the fictional firm of Sterling Cooper & Partners has its headquarters .

The end of a TV series brings with it some risk . `` The Sopranos , '' `` Mad Men '' creator Matthew Weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale . On the other hand , `` Mad Men 's '' former AMC stablemate , `` Breaking Bad , '' was saluted for an almost perfect landing .

Speaking of landings : The last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969 . Though Weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- Weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward .

What 's going to happen ? Here are some educated guesses .

`` Mad Men '' is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the '60s themselves . The old orders are falling apart : white-shoe WASP firms like Sterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach ; grimy New York replaced by sunny Los Angeles ; the `` Good War '' generation butting heads with the `` Make Love , Not War '' cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid-state IBM world .

It 's all an ad agency can do to keep up .

On the other hand , Peggy Olson 's star has continued to rise -LRB- much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind Mary Wells Lawrence -RRB- . She left Sterling Cooper once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one . If Olson , played by Elisabeth Moss , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married . That is , if she 's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition .

And Sally , Don 's daughter -LRB- Kiernan Shipka -RRB- , is proving to be a handful . On the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel . In recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother . You could see her hitchhiking to Woodstock , or at least dropping out of school .

Anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late-night rides with Glen Bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ?

Instead , try this : It 's April 1 , 1970 . Richard Nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding Don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the Lucky Strike campaign that began the series . No fool , he had seen this day coming years before .
