China has now updated the practice for the digital age -- launching a smartphone app starring its current leader , President Xi Jinping , and featuring his latest speeches , statements and publications .

Designed by the Central Party School , which trains Chinese Communist Party leaders , the app aims to `` arouse enthusiasm '' for socialist ideologies .

The app features the latest news about Xi and allows users to access the traditional texts that Xi quotes from . It even has an interactive map that allows you to pinpoint exactly where he made the speeches .

It 's unclear how many people have downloaded the app , which is available on Apple 's App Store .

Willy Lam , a China politics scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong told CNN the app forms part of Xi 's efforts to cultivate a very different image to his predecessors .

`` He wants to be the supreme authority and build his prestige . The personality cult campaign will only grow . ''

The app drew mixed reviews online and on social media . One headline on a technology news site read `` How can you call yourself Chinese if you do n't download it ? ''

Some said the app , called Xuexi Zhongguo , which translates to `` study China , '' would be a handy study tool .

But others said they would boycott it .
