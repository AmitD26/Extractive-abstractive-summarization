WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some of the security officials at this weekend 's Super Bowl will be scrutinizing the body language and demeanor of fans as part of the effort to spot suspicious and possibly dangerous people in the crowd .

`` Unlike technology , the human detection officers can be anywhere , '' White said . `` They can be completely unobtrusive . ''

The TSA officers will be wearing their uniforms and working in teams with police along the stadium 's security perimeter but wo n't work inside the stadium as fans watch the game . They 'll also be around key hotels associated with the Super Bowl , the airport and other transportation centers in Tampa . Watch what goes on at Super Bowl media day ''

According to White , if a TSA officer observes someone displaying unusual behavior , a local police officer will follow up by questioning the person .

Barry Steinhardt of the American Civil Liberties Union said such behavior screening is a bad idea .

The TSA uses behavior screening daily at airports . White said officers also have helped out at such high-profile events as last week 's presidential inauguration and the Republican and Democratic national conventions .
