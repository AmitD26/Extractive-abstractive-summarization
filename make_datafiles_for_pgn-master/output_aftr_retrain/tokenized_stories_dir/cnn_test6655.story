-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Paul O'Neill , who was appointed treasury secretary in 2001 by President Bush , says the federal government is not doing enough to fix the U.S. financial system .

O'Neill appeared on CNN 's `` Fareed Zakaria GPS '' on Sunday to talk about his outlook on the recession and what the Treasury Department should demand of major financial institutions in order to get the U.S. economy back on track .

Fareed Zakaria : Looking at the current economic crisis , do you think there is any prospect of what people call a `` V-shaped recession , '' that is , a quick recovery ? Or are we in for a long , perhaps years of sluggish growth , what economists call an `` L-shaped recession '' ?

Paul O'Neill : You know , I 've got to tell you , I 'm praying for a V - shape . But I 'm one who does n't believe we 're going to start moving back up until there is a credible fix for our financial system . And I think , in spite of all of the things that have been done now by the federal government , we 're not quite there .

And for those parts of their asset holdings that ca n't be rated investment grade -- or , in fact , as they say , ca n't be valued or ca n't be fairly valued -- I would create a new device which I call a `` quarantine account . ''

One could make a judgment about the value of these institutions , and the institutions could make a self-judgment , about how much more lending capacity they had , if the quarantined assets are set aside . Watch O'Neill offer his advice to Obama administration ''

Zakaria : The basic idea -- the basic proposal you 're making is transparency . Let everyone understand what 's on the banks ' books .

O'Neill : Right .

Zakaria : Is n't that a lot like Tim Geithner 's stress test ?

Here 's another plea I have : If you ca n't value the assets , please do n't buy them with my money .

O'Neill : Well , you know , excuse me , but I 'm not one who cares much for the notion of separating the idea of the government as some disembodied entity that has a life independent of me .

Why would I want to do that , Fareed ? Why should we want them to do that ?

O'Neill : Well , you know , I do n't mean to be offensive to this administration or the last one , but it seems to me , if you 're an intelligent investor , you invest in things where there is truth and transparency . And you have a shot , if you 're a good leader , at earning the cost of capital and maybe even something more .

And I think that basic principle ought to apply to how our government thinks about what it 's doing in the name of `` we , the people . ''

You know , I really do n't like this idea that somehow the government can do things that intelligent people would n't do , and we do n't notice .

Zakaria : One of the other things the government is doing is running up large deficits . There 's this large fiscal expansion .

Now , you were opposed to the Bush tax cuts , because of your concern about what they would do to the deficit . At that time , the deficit projection was $ 500 billion , and to you that seemed just too much . The deficit projections now are going to be in the $ 1.75 trillion range .

There are many people who say , you know what , this is that once-in-a-75-year moment where the government has to spend money because nobody else is spending money . Do you buy that ?

O'Neill : I think , honestly , I 'm not so much worried about the stimulus and its components as I am about what I consider to be an essential job -- to get a floor under the financial system , so that we can go back to economic growth in this country and around the world , because there is no hope until we do that .

Zakaria : When you were treasury secretary , you were famously suspicious of the financial sector . I mean , you thought there was a little too much attention being paid to it . You looked around at all those Bloomberg screens in the Treasury Department and said , you know , what do these guys make ? In a way , reflecting your background in Alcoa .

O'Neill : You know , show us the money . Let us see for ourselves .

I 've said this to some people , and they 've said -- some of them have said , `` We 'd be happy to do that , and we would be OK with that . '' Some other major financial institutions have said , `` Oh , my God , if we did that , people would see how bad it really is . ''
