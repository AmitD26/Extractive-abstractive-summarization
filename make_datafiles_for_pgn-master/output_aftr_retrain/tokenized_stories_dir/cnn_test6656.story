Jason Aldean has had six Top 10 country singles . His new album , `` Wide Open , '' is just out .

But not Jason Aldean . He has a full head of hair , and wears a cowboy hat to signify his commitment to country music .

It 's a formula that seems to be working . The 32-year-old rising star has just notched his sixth Top 10 country single with `` She 's Country , '' the lead track off his third CD , `` Wide Open '' -LRB- Broken Bow -RRB- .

Jason Aldean : Definitely a cowboy hat in L.A. makes you stand out a little bit .

Aldean : It is ! You 've got to wear it with confidence , too . Watch Aldean talk about his new album ''

Aldean : I would n't say I 'm nervous . If you have an album that you 're kind of on the fence about , then yeah , you would be kind of a little nervous .

Aldean : When we went in to record the second album -LRB- 2007 's `` Relentless , '' which went gold -RRB- , I think it was a good album , but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure recording that album -- more than the other two . You hear people talking about the sophomore slump and all that stuff , and so I think all that stuff sort of got to me after a while .

Combined with being on the road 200 to 250 days -LSB- a year -RSB- , I just did n't have that much fun recording it . I was exhausted . And so going into this third album , I just feel like mentally , I was back in the right place .

CNN : As an artist , do you ever really think you got it right ?

CNN : Were you a Michael Jackson fan growing up ? Did you moonwalk as a kid ?

Aldean : Of course ! I had my glove and everything . Used to wet my hair so it looked like a Jheri curl . -LRB- Cracks up -RRB-

CNN : Who else did you listen to as a kid ?

CNN : Are you finding that the economy has affected ticket sales ? Is it harder to sell out shows these days ?

Aldean : I think everybody has kind of seen a little bit of a hit . We 're no different . We 've tried to make it more affordable for people to come to a show with lower ticket prices -LSB- most of the time in the $ 20-40 range -RSB- . Maybe go in and play a show for less money than we would normally go in to play a show for , just so people can afford to come out and buy a ticket .

I mean , you 're looking at 200 bucks if you 've got a wife and two kids -- and then by the time you come there and buy a couple of T-shirts , or some drinks or whatever , you 're spending three , four hundred dollars , and right now , people are a little hesitant to do that .

CNN : From a financial standpoint , touring is more important to an artist than selling records these days .

Aldean : The music industry is so different now than it was even when I hit the scene in 2005 . If you go to Wal-Mart and you want a song , you 've got to buy the whole album for ten bucks -- or you can go to iTunes , and if you want a song , you can pay a dollar to get it . So in return , the record label is going to make less money , which is us making less money to pay them back .

Bad thing about purchasing singles -- if you have an artist you like and you keep doing that , there 's not going to be music enough for you to go and get , because they 're not going to have a deal anymore . But who knows ? Record labels may one day be out all together , and people may be making their own music and selling it on their Web sites .

Aldean : Radio 's really accepted us , and proven that they 're really going to play my stuff as long as I give them something good to play . Fans are coming out to the show , so I mean what more could I ask for ? My original plan when I got started in this deal was just to be able to make a good living for my family and play music . I 've been able to do that , which is all I 've ever wanted .
