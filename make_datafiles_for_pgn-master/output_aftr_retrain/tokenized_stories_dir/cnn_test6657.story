An investigator works the scene of the plane crash Friday outside Buffalo , New York .

Those are the reasons two would-be passengers did not fly on Continental Connection Flight 3407 , which crashed Thursday outside Buffalo , killing all 49 people aboard and one on the ground .

`` It could have been me , '' David Becony said from his home in Springville , New York , as he watched television reports on the crash and its fiery aftermath . `` My wife would have been with all those families '' who had loved ones on the plane .

Becony missed the flight from Newark-Liberty International Airport to Buffalo Niagara International Airport because bad weather had delayed his earlier flight from New Orleans , Louisiana , to Newark .

Unable to get another flight and unable to find a hotel room near the airport , the supervisor for a demolition company decided to camp out on a seat in the terminal . Watch how airlines have reacted to crash ''

When he found out the plane he was to have taken had crashed , he called his wife , Marti , at their home outside Buffalo . `` He broke down , and I broke down , '' she said . `` We just could n't believe it . ''

It was n't a smooth ride , Becony said of his Friday flight . `` It was weird , shaky , knowing it was the same type of aircraft . ''

That type of aircraft was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 aircraft , operated by Colgan Air for Continental Connection 's regional service .

`` I 'm still in shock , really , '' said 49-year-old Becony , a Catholic . `` God was looking over me . ''

`` It is wow , '' she said . `` It 's been unbelievable . We 're happy . We 're sad for everybody else . ''

But that line `` was a gazillion deep because of all the delays , '' enough to dissuade her from making the switch . `` I said , ehhh . ''

When she heard about the crash , Reinhardt was happy for her good fortune but shaken nevertheless . `` The heart-wrenching piece for me was , I was at the gate talking to this gate agent , and a young woman came up and she wanted to know : Should she stay on the 7 o'clock flight because of all the delays ? Did the gate agent think the 4:30 was going to get out before the 7 ?

For a while , the two women stood together at the gate , both of them using their Blackberries to study the flight information . Then , they went their separate ways . `` I said , ` Good for you . Have a nice trip . ' That 's the killer for me . ''

`` I walked out , and I saw all these people standing there , and I 'm thinking , ` It 's Thursday at 11 at night . Why are all these people in Buffalo ? Who are they waiting for ? ' Watch witnesses describe fiery crash ''

`` They were waiting for that plane that did n't come in . Of course , I did n't know that until I got to my car , and then my phone starts ringing . ''

Reinhardt said she plans to go to one of the memorial services . `` I think I need to do that for some kind of closure . ''
