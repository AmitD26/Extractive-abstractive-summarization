BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A female suicide bomber Friday detonated in a crowd of mostly women and children on their way to a religious festival , killing at least 38 people and wounding 50 others , an Interior Ministry official said .

Ten of those injured are in critical condition .

The suicide attack comes on the heels of other bombings targeting Shiite pilgrims earlier in the week and are signs that the sectarian conflicts that devastated Iraq in recent years are not over .

An explosion in Karbala on Thursday killed at least five Shiite pilgrims and wounded 50 near a shrine .

On Wednesday , a double car bombing struck a Baghdad bus station where Shiite pilgrims gathered for the holy day . Sixteen people were killed and 43 were wounded . Also , two pilgrims were killed and 16 were wounded Wednesday in roadside bombings in Baghdad .

Last year , a flurry of attacks on pilgrims killed at least 48 people . In 2007 , more than 180 pilgrims were killed in a series of attacks , most from suicide bombings in Babil province , through which the pilgrims pass .
