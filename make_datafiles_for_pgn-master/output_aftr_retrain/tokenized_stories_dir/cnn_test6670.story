The statement by coordinator John Holmes comes after a joint U.N.-Sudanese assessment of the situation .

A full report of the assessment will be released soon , according to the U.N. , but an executive summary and recommendations were made available on Tuesday .

`` While a significant effort is being made by the government , by the U.N. , by the NGOs -LSB- nongovernmental organizations -RSB- which are left , to plug some of the immediate gaps in these areas , these are at the same time , ` Band-Aid ' solutions , not long term solutions , '' Holmes said .

The summary released Tuesday said the World Food Programme , which is still allowed to operate in Sudan , is carrying out a one-time-only distribution program in March and April , but that new partners will be needed to continue delivering food after April .

After the International Criminal Court charged Bashir with war crimes and crimes against humanity on March 4 , Khartoum expelled 13 international aid agencies and revoked the permits of three organizations in the country .

Holmes said that 13,000 to 14,000 aid workers in the region already were Sudanese nationals .

Holmes said the cooperation and technical help from the Sudanese government on the assessment was a good step forward . But he called it `` only the first of many steps if the people in Darfur are not going to suffer major consequences from these expulsions . ''

One claim is that some organizations acted as spies for the International Criminal Court .

The British aid organization , Oxfam , one of the agencies expelled from Sudan , released a statement in response to Tuesday 's findings .

`` Current stop-gap measures will only be effective for a short time , '' the statement said . `` As the rainy season arrives within the next two months , people living in weak temporary shelters , in flood-prone locations where latrines can fill and overflow , will become at extreme risk of disease and death .

`` With the humanitarian capacity reduced by nearly 50 percent , responding to such emergency scenarios will be an enormous challenge for others to tackle , '' Oxfam said .
