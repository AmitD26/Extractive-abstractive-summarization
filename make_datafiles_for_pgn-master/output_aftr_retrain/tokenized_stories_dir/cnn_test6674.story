-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose , cheeks , upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States , the woman 's surgeon said Wednesday .

Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman 's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery .

Dr. Maria Siemionow , the head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland , Ohio , hospital , said many people are `` hiding from society because they 're afraid to walk to the grocery stores ; they 're afraid to go to streets because they 're called names and humiliated . ''

The patient is doing well , the doctors said . Interactive : More details of the surgery ''

Details about the recipient , including her name and age , were withheld at her request .

In the surgery , 80 percent of the woman 's face was transplanted . The forehead and chin were left intact .

In this transplant , tissue from the donor 's face was shaped and fitted into position . Multiple layers of tissue , bone , muscles and blood vessels , nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected . Watch an explanation about face transplants ''

Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said , `` the donor never looks like the recipient . The recipient never looks like the donor . ''

Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004 . She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved .

Dr. Eric Kodish , the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic 's Department of Bioethics , said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery .

`` This patient had very robust decision-making capacity , '' he said .

Like with all transplants , there is a risk that the recipient 's body could reject the graft . The doctors say they have n't seen any such signs .

In the past three years , facial transplants have been completed in France and China , but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions . Read about the first facial transplant

The recipient in France , Isabelle Dinoire , had been mauled by a dog , and the Chinese man , Li Guoxing , was attacked by a bear . Both received major facial disfigurements .

The doctor told CNN that Li had a checkup in a small hospital in his hometown three weeks before his death but that no health problems had been found . Watch an ITN report about the Li 's case

The facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks . Those procedures have been `` under an ethical cloud , '' said David Young , a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California , San Francisco .

The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants , doctors said .

Critics such as Peter A. Clark , director of the Institute of Catholic Bioethics at St. Joseph 's University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , said a facial transplant introduces unnecessary risks for a procedure that is not a matter of life and death .

Bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan , chairman of the University of Pennsylvania 's Medical Ethics Department , said Wednesday on CNN 's `` American Morning '' that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant , which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it , but was gradually convinced .

At the news conference Wednesday , Kodish said the transplant had `` abundant moral justification '' : the face as a personal embodiment as self .

Patient 's reaction

After the surgery , the patient was heavily sedated from being on the breathing machine .

As she was slowly awakening , medical staff members asked her how she was feeling and whether she was comfortable .

Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration .
