LONDON , England -- A yellow smiley-face badge , smeared with blood , has become the trademark for `` Watchmen , '' the most critically revered of all comic-books -- but it could also represent its troubled journey from page to big screen .

The subject of fervent debate in the geekosphere for more than two decades , `` Watchmen , '' finally rolls out in the U.S. and other territories from the first week of March onward .

`` Watchmen , '' created by the UK comic-book team of writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons , surfaced in 1986 as a monthly 12-issue series published by DC Comics -LRB- part of Time-Warner , which owns CNN parent company Turner Broadcasting -RRB- .

`` Watchmen , '' set in 1985 , sets up a parallel world in which America never lost Vietnam , Russia is about to invade Afghanistan and Nixon still holds power -LRB- Bernstein and Woodward were murdered -RRB- . Meanwhile a superhero team -- only one of whom has special powers -- reforms after a fellow operative is mysteriously slain .

So far , so what . But what lifts `` Watchmen '' is a complex , multi-layered narrative and depth of characterization that ensured it was the only comic-book to make Time 's 100 best novels since 1923 .

Directors set to shoot have included Terry Gilliam , Darren Aronofsky , Paul Greengrass and David Hayter -LRB- whose script has been retained for much of the final film -RRB- . Several planned shoots failed to materialize due to studio fears about the budget -LRB- locations include Antarctica and Mars as well as New York -RRB- and how the ending might be perceived in a post-9 / 11 world . But film-makers such as Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro also believed that the complex material would be better treated as a TV mini-series -LRB- as the `` Pan 's Labyrinth '' film-maker told IGN : `` I just could n't get my head around ` Watchmen ' being two or three hours long . '' -RRB-

Whoever made `` Watchmen '' would also do so without Moore 's blessing .

Still resident in his hometown of Northampton , central England , Moore cuts an imposing figure . At least six-and-a-half feet tall , with chest-length beard and hair , talon-like rings on his fingers and the skull of a centuries-old Buddhist monk in his study , he resembles Doctor Who as reimagined by Edgar Allan Poe . -LRB- In person he 's gracious and affable , as this writer will attest from a few years back -RRB- .

Enter Zack Snyder .

But wary of over-tweaking , Snyder told Entertainment Weekly last year : `` You ca n't make it into something else , you really ca n't . It 's not ` Fantastic Four , ' it 's got to be hard R -LSB- cinema rating -RSB- , it 's got to challenge everyone 's ideas . ''

Meanwhile Moore , who sometimes mentions that he worships a Roman snake-god , hinted in the LA Times that he had cursed the feature . `` I can tell you that I will also be spitting venom all over it for months to come , '' he added .

So was it Moore who saw `` Watchmen '' end up in the courts for a case that risked scuppering its release ? Last year Twentieth Century Fox claimed it still retained rights through an earlier deal with producer Lawrence Gordon in the 1980s ; Warners Bros disagreed but a judge decided there was a case to answer . A settlement was eventually thrashed out last month , only weeks ahead of release .

And so `` Watchmen '' ticks toward early March and a rollout in spring , the now-traditional season for edgier comic-book adaptations like `` 300 '' and `` Sin City . '' Trailers and early footage have drawn praise , with several scenes playing like detailed frames from the original artwork .

But key will be whether Snyder can match `` Watchmen 's '' dramatic beats against its green-screen chicanery for more than two hours -LRB- IMDB lists the running time at 163 minutes -RRB- . After all , successfully mixing pyrotechnics and narrative is how the most satisfying genre features of recent years -- such as Peter Jackson 's `` Lord Of The Rings '' trilogy and Christopher Nolan 's `` The Dark Knight '' -- have found artistic , as well as commercial , favor .

What Alan Moore might think is another issue .
