NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sean Kingston was talking about his hit song `` Fire Burning '' when his cell phone suddenly started to ring . The device blasted a familiar tune .

Sean Kingston has one of the summer 's hottest hits with `` Fire Burning . ''

She 's fire burning , fire burning on the dance floor .

`` I 've got to support it , man , '' said Kingston , 19 , with a cheeky smile . `` It goes right back in my pocket , but hey . ''

There had better be plenty of room in those pockets . `` Fire Burning '' is shaping up to be one of the summer 's hottest tracks , with more than a million downloads sold , and is the second best-selling song on iTunes this week . For mainstream radio listeners and nightclub goers , the reggae-trance track is inescapable .

`` Three days ago I was in an elevator , '' he said . `` A lady came in and she had her iPod and she was playing my song . She did n't know who she was standing next to . That was kind of funny . ''

His sophomore album , called `` Tomorrow , '' comes out September 22 . Kingston just wrapped filming in Los Angeles for the music video for its second single , `` Face Drop . ''

CNN : How much time do you actually spend on the dance floor ?

Sean Kingston : I spend a lot of time on the dance floor , -LSB- though -RSB- ... I 'm more the type of dude to sit back and pose and act cool . But I had to make a song for it because there 's a lot of stuff that 's going on in the world today ... people want to dance . People want to let loose and `` Fire Burning '' is a song that you can do that to .

CNN : Why call your sophomore album `` Tomorrow '' ?

Kingston : We never sent it to radio . That record got leaked . It got leaked from the Internet and we just kept it going . But it never really got that push from the label .

But I mean it did good . I mean 4 million plays on YouTube , 3 million on MySpace . Sometimes you 've got to give free music to get people to pay attention and to build a buzz . So I basically gave my fans free music .

CNN : You collaborate with punk-pop band Good Charlotte on the album .

Kingston : Yeah . Benji and Joel -LSB- Madden -RSB- , man ! Those guys are hilarious . They 're talented and geniuses . ...

CNN : Is it fair to say that `` Beautiful Girls '' brought massive change to your life ?

Kingston : It did . It changed my life like that ! No other song did it but that song . I 'm blessed .

Kingston : It did n't really quite take me one . It took me one to get in the door . And then it took having a Top Five record . But you 've got to understand ... in this music business , there are so many one-hit wonders . You could have a hit , but it 's like `` OK , could you follow up ? '' So it 's not about what your past is , it 's about longevity .

CNN : You 've been the opening act for Gwen Stefani and Beyonce . Who are some other female musicians you admire ?

Kingston : Man , those two are amazing . Gwen Stefani ! That 's what you call a star right there . Just to be in her presence ... I learned a lot from her . She 's just amazing . Beyonce too . I like Mary J. Blige . Rhianna ! I met her a lot of times and she 's down to earth . She 's so cool . And she 's an island girl . And I 'm an island dude , and we got ta hold down for other people .
