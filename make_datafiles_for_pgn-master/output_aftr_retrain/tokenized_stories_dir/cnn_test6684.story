-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Saturday called on the state bar to overlook a technical error and allow a paralyzed law school graduate to take the bar exam next week .

`` Government should work for the people , not against them , and I 'm calling on the state bar to allow Sara Granda to take next week 's test . Sara is a fighter , and I am with her all the way . ''

Granda , 29 , a University of California-Davis Law School graduate , has petitioned the California Supreme Court to allow her to take Tuesday 's test .

She said she was `` surprised '' to hear about Schwarzenegger 's statement in her defense .

`` So I knew there was no way that the governor was going to get involved , '' she said .

Granda , who has been studying 11 hours a day for the bar exam with the help of assistants , said she wants the state of California to resolve the matter because it spent about $ 100,000 for her education .

`` I worked very , very hard for every cent , '' she told KCRA . `` So for everything to come together in the end and for it to just kind of fall through on such a minor , minor detail . ''
