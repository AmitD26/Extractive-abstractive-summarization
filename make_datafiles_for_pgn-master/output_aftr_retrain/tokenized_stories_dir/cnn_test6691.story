Hillary Clinton meets with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung-hwan on Friday to discuss North Korea .

Speaking to ABC 's `` This Week , '' Clinton also said the president has answered the central question she raised about him when she was his chief rival for the Democratic nomination last year .

`` Has the president answered it for you ? '' host George Stephanopoulos asked .

`` Absolutely , '' Clinton replied . `` And , you know , the president , in his public actions and demeanor , and certainly in private with me and with the national security team , has been strong , thoughtful , decisive , I think he is doing a terrific job . And it 's an honor to serve with him . ''

The former senator from New York and former first lady revealed details of how she came to accept the role . Watch analysts dissect the Clinton-Obama relationship ''

`` I never had any dream , let alone inkling , that I would end up in President Obama 's cabinet , '' she said . `` When I left the presidential race after getting some sleep and taking some deep breaths , I immediately went to work for him in the general election . ... And I was looking forward to going back to the Senate and , frankly , going back to my life and representing New York , which I love . And I had no idea that he had a different plan in mind . ''

`` And then when he called and asked me to come see him , and we had our first conversation , I said , ` You know , I really do n't think I 'm the person to do this , I want to go back to my life . I really feel like I owe it to the people of New York . ' And I gave him a bunch of other names of people who I thought would be great secretaries of state . ''

But Obama `` was quite persistent and very persuasive , '' Clinton said .

She added , `` Ultimately , it came down to my feeling that , number one , when your president asks you to do something for your country , you really need a good reason not to do it . Number two , if I had won and I had asked him to please help me serve our country , I would have hoped he would say yes . And finally , I looked around our world and I thought , you know , we are in just so many deep holes that everybody had better grab a shovel and start digging out . ''

But Clinton said she wanted the envoys appointed `` because we were inheriting so many hot spot problems that I knew you could never have one person possibly address all of that . ''

`` One of the positive developments , '' she said , is that `` it has actually brought the -LSB- other -RSB- members of -LSB- the -RSB- six-party process -- Japan , South Korea , China , Russia , the United States -- much closer together '' in how they view the challenge . She said there may be additional U.N. sanctions against North Korea .

She emphasized that North Korea 's detention of two U.S. journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , is separate from the political issues . `` It is a humanitarian issue and the girls should be let go , '' Clinton said .
