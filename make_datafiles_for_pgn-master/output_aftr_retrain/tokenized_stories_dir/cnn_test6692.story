Hollywood private eye Anthony Pellicano represented himself at his federal trial . The jury 's still out .

NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's a courthouse adage : A person who represents himself has a fool for a client .

When a defendant utters those tragic words , `` I 'm going to represent myself , '' judges blanch , attorneys snicker , and even the court reporters grimace . I 've been on the opposite side of those who have chosen to represent themselves . It was n't pleasant .

Since 1975 , when the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment `` grants to the accused personally the right to make his own defense , '' many defendants have decided to take the law literally into their own hands .

Pellicano 's jury has been out for a week , so it 's not yet clear whether the outcome of his case will follow the conventional wisdom .

The 64-year-old celebrity sleuth is accused of leading a criminal enterprise that raked in more than $ 2 million by illegally spying , allegedly using wiretaps and law enforcement databases , on Hollywood 's rich and famous . He then dished the dirt to their rivals .

Prosecutors have to prove that Pellicano and his co-defendants ran a corrupt enterprise that profited from information they obtained illegally .

U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer granted Pellicano 's request to represent himself , but she was n't too happy about it . `` If the U.S. Supreme Court did n't require me to let defendants represent themselves , I would n't do it , '' she said .

But unlike a seasoned attorney , he failed to address the evidence against him , including illegally taped conversations . Instead , he bragged about his career , while wearing an orange prison jumpsuit , saying of himself , again in the third person : `` Perhaps his business card should read , ` I deliver , ' because he did it over and over again . '' Courtroom observers said his `` cross-examination '' often consisted of little more than settling old scores .

We 're trained in the art of trial war . Let us do our jobs .
