Lexington , Missouri -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police arrested a sixth member of a Missouri family under investigation for allegations of child sexual abuse , police said .

Darrel Mohler has been charged with two counts of rape , Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said at a news conference . Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier .

On the request of Missouri officials , Marion County authorities went to Mohler 's home in Silver Springs , Florida , and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway , according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff 's Office . He was subsequently arrested .

Five members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County , Missouri , were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims , who are relatives of the five suspects , made accusations of sexual abuse . A sixth person , described as an `` associate '' of the family , was arrested Thursday but released Friday , police said .

More charges against the family members are expected next week , the sheriff said . Current charges for some of the arrested include rape , deviate sexual assault and use -LSB- of -RSB- child in sexual performance , according to Missouri State Courts online case management system .

Mohler Sr. , David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ , the Independence , Missouri-based organization said in a statement .

Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation , said the organization , and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children .

Mohler Sr. went through the group 's registered youth worker program , but `` his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs , '' the statement said .

The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s , and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints .

Investigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence , but there were no plans to continue the searches , Alumbaugh said Friday . He declined to comment on any evidence found .
