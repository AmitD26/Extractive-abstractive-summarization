-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iceland is losing its only three McDonald 's restaurants as a result of the poor economic situation in the country .

In January 2008 , it cost more than 95 Icelandic krona to buy one euro , according to the Central Bank of Iceland . Tuesday , that price had shot up to more than 186 krona .

McDonald 's said it had become financially prohibitive to continue operating in Iceland because of `` the unique operational complexity of doing business in Iceland combined with the very challenging economic climate in the country . ''

It said there are no plans to seek a new franchise partner in that country .

`` We believe we can be more successful with our own brand , '' Ogmundsson said .

A McDonald 's Big Mac hamburger currently sells for the equivalent of $ 5.29 , making Iceland one of the most expensive places in the world to buy the sandwich . Only Norway and Switzerland charge more , according to the countries listed on the Economist magazine 's Big Mac Index , published in February .

A Big Mac costs about $ 3.54 in the United States , $ 2.19 in Australia , $ 5.07 in Denmark , $ 1.66 in South Africa , and $ 1.52 in Malaysia .
