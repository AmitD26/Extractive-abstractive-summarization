Educated in Chile and at Harvard University in the United States , Pinera is an economist , investor , businessman and former senator .

Bachelet , a liberal , defeated Pinera in the presidential elections in 2005 . She endorsed Pinera 's opponent in a runoff election in January .

But Pinera said recently that responding to the earthquake requires the country to transcend partisan differences .

`` These are times when we have to act with a sense of national unity , '' he said . `` It is not the time for conflict between government and opposition . ''

The 8.8-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami February 27 killed more than 500 people and affected up to 2 million .

A 7.2-magnitude temblor struck Thursday as dignitaries were filing into the congressional hall in Valparaiso for the transfer of presidential power .

`` I leave sad because of the pain of our people but with my head held high , '' a teary-eyed Bachelet said in a brief farewell address from the La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago , Chile 's capital . `` I leave proud of what we have been able to build as a nation , of the role we have played .
