`` They turned a rather ordinary recall into a brand-threatening crisis , '' said Jeff Kingston , a professor of Asian studies at Temple University 's Japan campus in Tokyo .

`` Their decision-making process was painfully slow , but the international media and concerned customers do n't want to wait so long for answers , '' Kingston said . `` Anytime the public hears ` brake ' and ` problem ' in the same sentence , they want quick answers . ''

Toyoda 's long silence as the company deliberated what to do is a hallmark of the Japanese culture of consensus building .

`` The decision-making process is really the planning process in Japan -- you do n't see a lot of rapid response to a strategic issue , '' said Michael Alan Hamlin , president of Team Asia , which provides communications advice to multinational companies .

How the two audiences -- American and Japanese -- view Toyoda 's performance may be very different because of cultural differences in body language .

`` Japanese when in an apology mode -- especially before an authority like the U.S. Congress -- will be very humble . That means , you do n't necessarily look people in the eye , '' said Deborah Hayden , Tokyo managing partner of Kreab & Gavin Anderson Worldwide , a communications consultancy . `` From a Western perspective , that can be mistaken as weakness or perhaps trying to hide something . ''

`` He 's got to walk a very fine line of polite respect -- which Japanese have in bucket loads -- and the confidence of being head of one of the largest , most respected companies in the world , '' Hayden said .
