Smolensk , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When I found the first piece of fuselage , I was shocked . It was flimsy , the thin metal easily twisted back on itself .

Gray on one side , some yellow on the other , it sat in a small puddle of mud a few feet from the road . I was half a mile from the runway , the tall silver birch trees nearby broken like so many matchsticks .

What feels almost invincible as it powers through takeoff and thrusts upward through the skies at hundreds of miles an hour had been reduced to shreds of metal , little more than a discarded tin can .

But I have come to work , to tell the story of what happened , to piece together the small bits of information we 'll get , to make some sense of our corner of this huge tragedy . So that is what my team and I do .

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who is leading Russia 's investigation , was on course to lay blame at Poland 's door . He has a reputation as a tough autocrat , and it seemed to me that 's what we are seeing here .

But we got to see another face of Putin , too : The stony-faced solemn friend of Poland . There seemed little doubting his grief and seriousness as he stood at the foot of the Polish president 's casket during the long sombre repatriation ceremony we witnessed that afternoon .

Having stood among the wreckage and broken trees as he has , it is not hard to imagine that this iron man of Russian politics was moved by what he saw . For who among us , however familiar with tragedy , could fail to be touched by the scale and nature of Poland 's loss .
