-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Within the last month , our country has witnessed two senseless , high-profile acts of criminal violence that would have been labeled terrorism if brown-skinned Arab Muslim men with foreign-sounding names had committed them .

A few weeks ago , on February 18 , another white anti-government extremist named Joseph Stack flew his small airplane into an Internal Revenue Service building in Austin , Texas , killing two people and injuring 13 others .

According to media reports , Stack had left behind a disjointed suicide letter in which he expressed his hatred of our American government and outlined grievances with the IRS , chillingly stating that `` violence not only is the answer ; it is the only answer . ''

Both the Pentagon Metro and IRS attacks come at a time of `` explosive growth in -LSB- domestic -RSB- extremist-group activism across the United States , '' according to the Southern Poverty Law Center .

A recently released law center report showed so-called patriot groups -- steeped in anti-government conspiracy theories -- grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 -- a 244 percent increase that the Southern Poverty Law Center report judged to be an `` astonishing '' rise in the one-year period since President Obama took the oath of office . The number of these groups that are domestic extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009 , the report said .

Let us imagine that these Pentagon and IRS attacks had been committed by an olive-skinned Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad .

Instead , shortly after the IRS plane attack , some prominent media commentators immediately asked why people -- especially conservatives on the right -- were not calling the IRS attacker a terrorist .

`` If this had been done by a brownish-looking Muslim guy whose suicide note paralleled Islamist political themes , '' wrote media commentator Matthew Yglesias , then right-wingers would `` demand that anyone who refused to label the attack ` terrorism ' be put up on treason charges . ''

Because Theodore Kaczynski , the Unabomber ; Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ; Atlanta , Georgia , Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph ; the Pentagon shooter and IRS attacker were all white men motivated by their respective ideologies , surprisingly , the term `` terrorism '' has never seemed to stick to any of them . To prove my point even further , the recently indicted American woman Colleen LaRose , who called herself `` Jihad Jane , '' can rightfully be termed a wanna-be terrorist . But why does this not apply to other white extremists ?
