-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lawmakers in Ukraine scuffled with each other , throwing punches and eggs , as parliament met Tuesday to ratify a treaty with Russia that extends the latter 's navy presence in the Ukraine 's Crimean peninsula until 2042 .

During a rally attended by thousands on Saturday , opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- said the ratification must be prevented at all costs .

The deal was signed last week by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .

Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution , which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017 .

The deal extends Russia 's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol for an additional 25 years , in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine .

Throughout his time in office , Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia 's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol . The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017 .

Yanukovych said the new deal added a `` concrete and pragmatic dimension '' to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians .

Opposition groups in Ukraine , however , were quick to denounce the agreement . Yuschenko 's `` Our Ukraine '' party said the treaty would lead to the `` Russification '' of Ukraine .
