Your a.m. routine may involve downing a burst of liquid energy , boosting your performance for 22 hours at a stretch .

`` After 18 , 19 hours awake , your brain function starts to fail , '' says Dallas , Texas , sleep-medicine specialist Andrew O. Jamieson . Coffee might keep you up , `` but you 're not going to be focused . ''

This emerging breed of `` wakefulness '' pills promises to keep the workers of tomorrow not just awake , but alert , on-task and feeling fine through the night and well into the next day .

The drug 's maker , Cephalon in Frazer , Pennsylvania , is awaiting FDA approval for armodafinil , which promises even longer periods of wakefulness on a single dose , and Irvine , California-based Cortex is working on its own drug , code-named CX717 and developed with funding from the military .

Scientists understand how the drugs work only broadly . Unlike traditional stimulants , eugeroics do n't simply jazz up the whole body . Instead they tweak specific sleep-related mechanisms in the brain , so users do n't feel jittery or wired , just alert .

And in experiments with CX717 , sleep-deprived rhesus monkeys on the drug often outperformed their own well-rested but undrugged best efforts on mental-performance tests . Modafinil , too , `` is definitely a cognitive enhancer , '' says cognitive psychopharmacologist Barbara Sahakian of the University of Cambridge .

Yet the economic pressure to stay out of bed is intense . Cutting out four hours of sleep a night would free up almost 1,500 extra hours a year . That 's an additional nine months ' worth of standard 40-hour workweeks -- plenty of time to earn a promotion or start your own company on the side -LRB- or , worst case , slog away in obscurity -RRB- .

From Napoleon to Edison to Churchill , many of history 's most notable figures got by on only a few hours of sleep a night . Give an entire workforce the energy of a Thomas Edison , and you 've got a new Industrial Revolution .

Any worker could benefit , says University of Virginia bioethicist Jonathan Moreno , author of the recent book Mind Wars . `` But for consultants or contractors , people who are n't on a salary ? The incentives are ridiculous . '' E-mail to a friend
