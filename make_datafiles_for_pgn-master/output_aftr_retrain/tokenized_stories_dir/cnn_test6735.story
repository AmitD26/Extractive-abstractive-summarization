`` At first I could n't believe it had happened , '' 23-year-old Zhenya Iordanskaya said . `` I thought it was another rumor . My friend told me about it , and then I saw it on TV , on every channel . I was really in shock . And I still ca n't believe it . ''

Iordanskaya was standing in the rain Sunday with her friend Alexandra Belayeva , 20 , looking at the shrine Jackson 's fans have erected along the fence in front of the Embassy .

Iordanskaya says she was 8 when she first heard `` Black or White . ''

`` I did n't understand English , but the faces of all the different people really inspired me . And the fact that he dealt with all these issues , you really have to give him credit for that , '' Iordanskaya said .

Belayeva says she became a fan about three years ago .

Belayeva says she 's still in shock over Jackson 's death at his California home on June 25 . `` When I heard he had died , I really could n't believe it . He was so close to us . Not one of us , but so close . He was unbelievably kind .

`` It 's so sad to lose a person like him . It 's also so sad that he was so alone at the end of his life . People did n't understand him . But at least they recognized his genius during his life . Sometimes that does n't happen . ''

I ask the women to name their favorite Jackson songs . They roll their eyes . Where do you start ? Iordanskaya starts with `` Liberian Girl . '' `` Also ` Earth Song . ' ''

`` It 's really powerful , '' she said , `` the energy and the lyrics ! ''
