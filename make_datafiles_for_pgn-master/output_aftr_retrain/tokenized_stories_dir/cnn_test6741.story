Lu Stout makes her home in Hong Kong , China , a city as stunning by day as it is by night -- and memorable for its harbor , shiny skyscrapers and `` unique blends of Eastern and Western traditions , '' in the words of the Hong Kong Tourism Board .

About 7 million people live in Hong Kong and about four times as many visited the city last year .

Where can you get the best view of the city ?

On a clear day , the Peak Morning Trail . Just walk 15 minutes around the bend from the Peak Terminal .

Where is the best place to people watch ?

Ride the subway . Just take a seat on any MTR train -LRB- which is always clean and efficient -RRB- , plug in your earbuds , and watch Hong Kong commute away .

Wanchai . Yes , it 's Suzie Wong 's old ` hood . But step away from the red light district and toward the Ship Street area where to find a fabulous mix of old heritage buildings and new structures .

Want to blend in ? Lose the slow gait and stop staring at the skyscrapers . Walk quickly and look straight ahead .

Where do you go to relax ?

What essential thing should visitors see/experience if they only have a few hours ?

Have a walk around the interlinked Hong Kong Land buildings in Central to have an idea of just how convenient Hong Kong is . This is a place literally engineered for high productivity and maximum efficiency . -LRB- And you can pick up a few gifts while you 're at it -- a vintage print at Picture This in Prince 's Building and a Chinese tunic at Blanc de Chine in the Landmark . -RRB-

What 's the biggest tourist trap ?

Is there a `` tourist trap '' that 's actually worth seeing ?

Take the Star Ferry . Be sure to board the ferry from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central at night , that way you can enjoy the dramatic Hong Kong skyline in its full neon glory . It 's only a 10-minute journey , but it 's one the world 's greatest rides .

Where 's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town ?

Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try ?

What is a good local souvenir ?

For the ladies , get your cheong sam made . A slender , form-fitting gown with a high collar -- a silk cheong sam is classic Hong Kong haute couture . Shanghai Tang offers on-site tailoring .
