The blaze spread so quickly , it caught some locals off guard . Flagstaff city spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said the source of the fire was an abandoned campfire .

`` It 's something that unless you 've lived through it , I do n't think you can imagine , '' evacuee Patti Vorhees told CNN affiliate KTVK as she packed up her pets and left . `` You literally take your prescriptions , your animals and the clothes on your back . ''

The Coconino County website says the U.S. Forest Service and several fire departments responded with about 300 firefighters , eight air tankers and five helicopters to put out the blaze . A Type One Incident Management Team also was sent to the scene . The U.S. Fire Administration website says that 's a self-contained team of 35 to 50 highly trained personnel deployed to manage incidents of `` national significance . ''

Government fire spokesman Eric Neitzel told CNN affiliate KPHO that higher humidity and lower temperatures overnight allowed firefighters to `` make some good progress on the line '' and protect structures .

KTVK 's website , www.azfamily.com , says authorities shut down part of Highway 89 Sunday because of visibility issues , as the Schultz Fire was producing a huge plume of smoke that could be seen for miles . But by Monday morning , Neitzel told KPHO the cooperative overnight weather , including calmer winds , were making the smoke '' -LSB- lay -RSB- down ... so you do n't see the big tower of smoke . ''

The Flagstaff Fire Department initially had ordered evacuations of two neighborhoods and the Cococino Humane Society because of the Hardy Fire , but those evacuation orders have been rescinded , said the Coconino County website .
