-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The lawyer and companion for former Playboy playmate Anna Nicole Smith has filed a $ 60 million libel suit against the author and publisher of a new book on Smith 's life and death .

Howard K. Stern , shown in February , claims the book falsely accuses him of homosexual acts and cocaine use .

Stern claims in the suit against Rita Cosby and her publisher , Hachette Book Group USA , that Cosby `` intentionally published false and defamatory statements about Stern related to Ms. Smith 's death in a calculated effort to increase sales and increase profits '' in her book , `` Blonde Ambition : The Untold Story Behind Anna Nicole Smith 's Death . ''

Stern 's attorney , Lin Wood , told CNN the suit seeks $ 10 million for compensatory damages and $ 50 million for punitive damages .

`` Blonde Ambition purports to be a ` tell-all ' book , but it can only be accurately described as a ` tell-all-lies ' book , '' Wood said in a statement .

Attempts by CNN to reach Cosby , a former MSNBC anchor , and Hachette Book Group USA on Tuesday night were not immediately successful .

After DNA testing , a Bahamian court declared Birkhead the father of Dannielynn in April . At that point , Stern , who was listed as the girl 's father on her birth certificate , said he would not fight for custody .

Birkhead said he had instructed his attorney to sue Cosby , the publisher and `` any source that spits out some of that false , defamatory information that 's in there . If I were Rita Cosby , I 'd be very concerned . ''

He also denied another claim in the book , that he and Stern were working together behind the scenes during the custody battle for Dannielynn or to make money off Smith 's death .

Stern claims in the lawsuit , filed in federal court in New York , that `` defendants have exploited Ms. Smith 's life and death by publishing false and defamatory accusations against Howard K. Stern , who was Ms. Smith 's longtime lawyer , friend and companion . ''
