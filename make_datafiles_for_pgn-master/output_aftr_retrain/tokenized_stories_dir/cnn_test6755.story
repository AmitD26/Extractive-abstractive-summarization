Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The human cost of the Afghan conflict is escalating , with killings and attacks on children by the Taliban and other insurgent groups soaring , the United Nations said in a report released Tuesday .

`` Afghan children and women are increasingly bearing the brunt of this conflict , '' says Staffan de Mistura , special representative of the U.N. secretary-general .

According to the United Nations ' 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict , in the first six months of this year , 55 percent more children were killed or wounded by the Taliban and other anti-government groups than in the same period in 2009 .

The number of women killed or wounded by the Taliban and other insurgents increased by six percent .

The report says casualties caused by pro-government forces , including the International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- and Afghan security forces , fell 30 percent in the first six months of 2010 .

From January 1 to June 30 , 2010 , the UNAMA Human Rights Unit documented a total of 3,268 civilian casualties , including 1,271 deaths and 1,997 injuries .

Anti-government forces were responsible for 2,477 casualties . That is 76 percent of all casualties , up 53 percent from 2009 .

IEDs alone accounted for 29 percent of all civilian deaths in the period , including 74 children , a 155-percent surge from the same span last year .

Assassinations and executions , meanwhile , soared by more than 95 percent and included the public executions of children .

`` Every Afghan death diminishes our cause . While we have made progress in our efforts to reduce coalition-caused civilian casualties , we know the measure by which our mission will be judged is protecting the population from harm by either side . We will redouble our efforts to prevent insurgents from harming their neighbors . ''
