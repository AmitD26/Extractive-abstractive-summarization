Robbie Prepas , a nurse and midwife who struggles with car sickness , tried to stay focused . The babies were n't going to wait .

Five minutes into the ride , Prepas delivered the first twin with no problem . But then , she saw two feet beginning to emerge -- a breech baby .

`` It 's one of those events in America that we should never forget . ''

Prepas , now 58 , has traveled the world with organizations like Save the Children and UNICEF . She went to Ghana , Namibia and Zimbabwe in the 1990s to teach midwives in those African countries how best to deal with emergencies .

A year before Katrina , she traveled to Afghanistan with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to figure out why so many mothers and babies were dying at a hospital in Kabul .

As Hurricane Katrina spun toward the Gulf , the urge to help came natural . Based out of San Diego , Prepas was a member of California 's Disaster Medical Assistance Team , a group of about 30 physicians , general practitioners , nurses , nurse practitioners and other specialists .

`` I had never in my life seen such a disaster as I had in New Orleans , '' Prepas says . `` And , believe me , I 've seen the worst of everything . ''

At the airport , thousands of people milled about . Elderly patients from nursing homes had been dropped off , without medications or even adult diapers . Electricity was out , and there was no running water .

Prepas and the other 89 medical professionals swung into action . They set up three tents at the front of the airport -- green , for walking wounded and pregnant women ; yellow , for slightly more serious conditions ; red , for critical patients .

`` By the end of two weeks , we had screened and triaged more than 20,000 people . ''

Prepas was stationed in the green tent , and , at one point , was caring for 50 prenatal patients .

She was sleeping on a luggage carousel when the first woman in labor arrived .

`` His name was David , '' she says .

The woman 's husband and two sons were at the convention center with no idea she was in labor , or where she had gone .

All Prepas knew was : `` I had to get her out . ''

Frantically searching for an ambulance , Prepas found a group of paramedics who had driven more than 500 miles from Nashville , Tennessee .

The two baby boys had other plans . Both boys were delivered en route . The second child , who came out feet first , was discolored . He received oxygen for the next 30 minutes , until they arrived .

Two more weeks passed before that mother and her babies were reunited with the rest of their family .

A member of the White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood , Prepas has used the experience to bring attention to rising maternal mortality rates inside the United States , one of the worst in the industrialized world . In 1982 , eight women died per 100,000 live births in the U.S. ; now , the figure has jumped to 17 per 100,000 , largely due to lack of health care for the nation 's poorest women , according to the White Ribbon Alliance .

`` Women are going to have babies out of place , '' especially during disaster , she says . `` We have to be prepared for that . ''

One of the toughest things about her job in New Orleans was delivering the babies -- and then walking away .
