-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Republican candidate running for U.S. Congress says his past donning of a Nazi outfit was part of a historical lesson -- and defended his background in military re-enactments .

Iott participated in World War II re-enactments for several years in the past decade and created a German alter ego . He has said he started participating in the events as a way to bond with his son . Iott has also participated in Civil War and World War I re-enactments .

`` The whole purpose of historical re-enacting is to educate people one-on-one , '' Iott said . `` And that is done by going out and participating in re-enactments . ''

When asked whether he thought the men being impersonated were `` valiant men , '' Iott said , `` I do n't think we can sit here and judge that today . We were not there the time they made those decisions . Were there bad people ? Absolutely . Were there atrocities committed ? Absolutely there were . There are people that want to deny the Holocaust ever happened in this country and around the world . ''

According to Wiking 's website , it is a nonprofit group with a `` common interest in the German side of the war and want to tell the story of the average combat soldier of the German military . ''

But the website does not mention what historians have said about the division -- that the group was involved in war crimes and atrocities , including the death marches and massacres of Jews in the spring of 1945 .

Iott 's political opponents were quick to condemn him as a `` Nazi enthusiast . ''
