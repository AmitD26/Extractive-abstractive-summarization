LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Distinguished scientist Stephen Hawking was said to be in a `` comfortable '' condition Tuesday after spending the night in hospital , Cambridge University said in a statement .

Stephen Hawking in Pasadena , California , in March .

The 67-year-old , who suffers from a degenerative condition , was taken to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge by ambulance in a `` very ill '' condition on Monday .

`` He is comfortable and his family is looking forward to him making a full recovery , '' the university , where Hawking is a professor of mathematics , said in a short statement .

Hawking suffers from ALS -LRB- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -RRB- , commonly known as Lou Gehrig 's Disease . ALS is usually fatal within a few years , but Hawking has lived with the disease since he was diagnosed in 1963 .

The disease has left him wheelchair-bound and paralyzed -- he is able to move only a few fingers on one hand . He is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything , communicating through a speech synthesizer .

On his Web site , Hawking has written about living with ALS . `` I try to lead as normal a life as possible , and not think about my condition , or regret the things it prevents me from doing , which are not that many , '' he wrote .

He added , `` I have been lucky , that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case . But it shows that one need not lose hope . '' Watch Larry King 's interview with Hawking in 1999 ''

Sharon Matland , vice president of patient services for the ALS Association , told CNN Monday , `` He is living an amazing life . '' She said about 350,000 people worldwide have the disease .

Hawking has guest-starred , as himself , on `` Star Trek : The Next Generation '' and `` The Simpsons . '' He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe , his choice would be Marilyn .

In October , CNN 's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking .

`` The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now , rather than slowing down ... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds . Watch the CNN interview ''

`` I believe that the long-term future of the human race must be in space . It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster on planet Earth in the next hundred years , let alone next thousand , or million , '' he said .

`` I see great dangers for the human race ... but I 'm an optimist . If we can avoid disaster for the next two centuries , our species should be safe as we spread into space . ''
