-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Football icon David Beckham has told CNN that he believes the momentum is behind England as they battle to win the right to stage the 2018 World Cup when the decision is made in Zurich on Thursday .

`` I think when we arrived yesterday -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- obviously people were talking about the negative side about what had been said and how the members would be ; but I think that 's totally turned now , '' he told CNN .

`` Us being here , us sitting down with the delegates , us explaining why we want this World Cup in our country , I think has made us and our bid gain momentum that we need . ''

`` I think everybody knows how passionate I am about our country and about playing for my country , but to be able to bring the World Cup to England , it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it . ''

Beckham , who is now playing for Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS , believes England deserve to host their first World Cup since 1966 on the strength of their technical bid .

Whether Beckham can achieve his dream of taking his three sons to watch World Cup matches in England in 2018 will rest on the decision of 22 members of the FIFA executive committee .

They must decide between early frontrunners England , Russia , Spain and Portugal and Belgium and the Netherlands .
