U.S. Army troops get a safety briefing before departing Camp Liberty , Iraq , in December 2008 .

The shooting occurred at 2 p.m. at a stress clinic at Camp Liberty , near Baghdad International Airport , two senior defense officials said . Though initial reports indicated the attacker was killed in the incident , the U.S. command in Baghdad said late Monday a suspect in the killings was in custody .

`` Any time we lose one of our own , it affects us all , '' Col. John Robinson , a U.S. military spokesman , said in a written statement .

`` My heart goes out to the families and friends of all the service members involved , '' he said in a written statement . `` I will press to ensure that we fully understand what led to this tragedy , and that we are doing everything we can to ensure that our men and women in uniform are protected . ''

And Gates expressed his own `` horror and deep regret '' at a press briefing . Watch the defense secretary talk about the incident ''

Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , added the incident shows a need to `` redouble '' efforts regarding troop stress levels .

Camp Liberty is tightly guarded , and U.S. troops are required to clear their weapons of ammunition while on the base . The only service members who have loaded weapons are those guarding high-ranking officers and military police .

Camp Liberty is part of the Camp Victory Complex , one of the largest U.S. military bases in Iraq . It lies just northeast of Baghdad International Airport and is also near the massive al-Faw palace of executed former dictator Saddam Hussein .

The base resembles a giant trailer park , dotted with air-conditioned two - or three-person units that house thousands of service members . It boasts several dining facilities catered by a private company , fully equipped gymnasiums , recreation centers and a post exchange that rivals Wal-Mart .

In recent years , a number of fast food restaurants such as Burger King and Pizza Hut have opened , as well as private stores and a bazaar that sells local wares .

The military set up several chapels , and each unit operates stress-relief clinics -- such as the one at which the shootings occurred Monday -- where troops can request counseling .
