NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Flo Rida wants you to call him .

Flo Rida 's latest single , `` Right Round , '' was No. 1 on Billboard 's pop chart for 10 weeks .

In an attempt to reach his fan base on a more intimate level , the Floridian rapper has made his personal cell phone number public .

`` If they can go out and buy my albums , I can at least make the sacrifice to holler at the few people who call , '' he says . `` A lot of times I 'm busy so they 'll get my voice mail . And if I can speak to them and I have time , I always text back . Because I think that 's very important . ''

`` Yo this is your boy Flo Rida , '' he said to one caller . `` What 's your name ? What 's good ? ''

But it was too much for the person on the other end -- he or she hung up before uttering a response . Watch Flo Rida take a call ''

`` Most of them hang up , '' says Flo Rida -LRB- real name Tramar Dillard -RRB- . `` They do n't think it 's really me . ''

So how many calls and texts does a top-selling , in-demand rap star actually respond to ?

He 's also breaking his own records : His new single `` Right Round '' sold more than 636,000 downloads in the week after its release . It also hit No. 1 on Billboard 's Hot 100 pop chart .

`` Right Round '' features singer Kesha and borrows an infectious sample from the Dead or Alive hit `` You Spin me Round -LRB- Like a Record -RRB- . '' It can be found on Flo Rida 's sophomore album , `` R.O.O.T.S. '' -LRB- Atlantic -RRB- , which dropped last week , only a year after the release of his debut album , `` Mail on Sunday . ''

Flo Rida is also scheduled to be a guest on Wednesday night 's `` American Idol . ''

Flo Rida talked to CNN about having to record music while on the road , keeping in tune with his international fans , and being a shy guy -LRB- yeah , right ! -RRB- . The following is an edited version of the interview .

CNN : In `` Right Round '' you sample the '80s group Dead or Alive . Are you a fan of '80s music ? Or -LSB- do -RSB- you just like that song in particular ?

But my mom always instilled in me to keep the faith , dream big and that 's what I did . I was a great follower of my mom , very loyal and everything . And right now I 'm happy that the world looks at me as a great leader as far as me doing my music and coming with a positive approach .

Flo Rida : We had to hurry up with the album and put it out because we definitely want to keep the attention on the fact that we have a No. 1 record , and let that follow into having a No. 1 album . I 'm definitely happy that on this album versus the last , there 's more substance so at the same time the fans get a feel of me ... where I come from , how I got the success as well as me being the life of the party . They can continue to have a smile on their faces around the world . Hit the dance floor , shake it off , put your hands in the air and ... the hot ladies have my head spinning right round so I definitely had to get that album out .

CNN : It has barely been a year since you released your debut album , so you 're really striking while the iron 's hot . Are you putting this pressure on yourself or is it mainly coming from outside forces ?

Flo Rida : The most pressure came from traveling . I actually found myself in hotel rooms in the bathroom , whether I was in Japan or in Sweden , recording records , trying to get an acoustic sound . I definitely worked hard ... it was just a challenge as far as time goes , with me doing two -- sometimes three -- shows a night for two weeks straight .

CNN : You 've worked hard to build up your overseas fan base . Why is having a global audience important to you ?

Flo Rida : It 's very important ... the loyalty that they have overseas . You have a No. 1 record in almost 12 different countries : To me , that 's like having nine lives . Most people do n't even have an idea that you can really sell music overseas .

I always love the fact that I can do things internationally . When I was going to school I took the approach that I wanted to take international business versus just taking business classes . So I always had that approach prior to me doing music .

Flo Rida : People can have their own thoughts of what they think it is . But for the most part I 'm happy that they know it 's music .

Flo Rida : At this moment everybody wants to be a rock star , so it has that vibe in it . The way I ride a beat definitely gets everybody 's attention . And in using a Dead or Alive sample intertwined with what 's going on here in the new millennium is definitely what catches everyone 's attention .

Flo Rida : Andre 3000 . I 've always been a fan of OutKast . Every time they drop an album they step it up a notch . And there 's a lot of diversity between Andre and Big Boi .

CNN : What is the quirkiest thing about you ?

Flo Rida : Most people see me on stage and they think that I 'm this crazy dude , but for the most part I 'm a little shy and laid back .
