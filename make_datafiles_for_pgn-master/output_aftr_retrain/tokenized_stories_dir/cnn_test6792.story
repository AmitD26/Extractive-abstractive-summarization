-LRB- Mother Nature Network -RRB- -- Cobblestone streets , sidewalk cafes and public art have helped Quebec City earn the moniker , `` Paris without the jetlag . '' The thriving urban agriculture scene , local boutiques and restaurants , electric buses and green hotels should inspire a new nickname : `` Europe without the carbon footprint . ''

Quebec City is one of the oldest cities in North America . Situated on the banks of the St. Lawrence River , it was founded in 1608 as one of the first significant settlements in Canada . The Historic District of Old Quebec -- an area of cobblestone streets , picturesque churches and upscale shops -- was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985 .

Quebec City is a walkable destination and it 's possible to explore most of the major tourist sites on foot . For longer distances -- or to avoid the steep steps between Upper Town and Lower Town -- hop on one of the electric minibuses . Introduced in 2008 , the minibuses are smaller than conventional buses , making it easier to navigate the narrow roads in the historic districts .

The Chateau Frontenac has also earned accolades for its commitment to the environment . The Hotel Association of Canada awarded the hotel a four Green Key rating for green initiatives that include recycling kitchen grease and donating used household goods to local charities . Overnight guests driving hybrid vehicles can take advantage of free parking at the hotel .

Not a guest ? The hotel is still worth a visit . Sign up for a historic guided tour . Led by costumed interpreters , the tours offer a glimpse into the history and majesty of the historic property .

In honor of its commitment to the environment , L'Hôtel du Vieux Quebec became the first hotel in the province to earn the Award of Excellence for Energy and Environment from the Hotel Association of Canada . The 45-room hotel was built in 1774 and has served as a convent , tavern and apartment building before becoming the only carbon neutral hotel in Quebec City .

See green

Quebec City boasts an impressive number of parks and green spaces . The largest is the Plains of Abraham , a 235-acre park that 's home to an arboretum , formal garden , hiking/biking trails and exhibits that highlight the park 's history .

The Museum of Civilization offers a series of rotating exhibits that explore environmental issues . The permanent exhibit , Earth Unveiled , is an interactive look at the planet . The museum also has a green roof that 's open to the public .

Even the liquor store -- called Société des alcools du Québec or SAQ -- has jumped on the `` buy local '' bandwagon . The location adjacent to the Chateau Frontenac stocks more than 250 local brands from iced apple cider and maple syrup liqueur to caribou , a potent mix of brandy , vodka and sherry .

Quebec City is known for poutine , a combination of French fries , gravy and cheese curds . The local fast food chain , Chez AshTon , is a great place to indulge in the artery-clogging dish . AshTon uses locally made cheese curds and potatoes grown on Isle d'Orleans , giving their poutine local flair .

At Panache , the menu changes with the seasons . Chef François Blais creates upscale French-Canadian cuisine using local ingredients such as bison , rabbit , quail and clams that led to Panache being named Best New Restaurant . The restaurant is located in a former maritime warehouse that boasts exposed beams and stone walls that were original to the building in the 1800s .

Across the St. Lawrence River and less than 20 minutes from Quebec City , Ile d'Orléans is an agri-tourism haven . Nicknamed the `` Garden of Quebec , '' the island is just 20 miles long and boasts a dizzying array of food producers . Stop at Cidrerie Verger Bilodeau to sip iced cider , a regional favorite made from the juices of frozen apples ; see how maple syrup is made at Cabane à sucre l'En-Tailleur ; and taste the artisanal cheeses at Les Fromages de l'isle d'Orléans , which are made using techniques that date back to the 17th century .
