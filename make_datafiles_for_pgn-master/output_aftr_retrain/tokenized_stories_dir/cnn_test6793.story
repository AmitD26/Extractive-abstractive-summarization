Japan 's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors , with two under construction , at 17 power plants , according to figures from the International Atomic Energy , the U.N. nuclear watchdog . They produced more than 280,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2010 -- about 30 percent of Japan 's total electricity generation .

Most Japanese plants -- including the three facing emergencies since the earthquake -- use boiling-water reactors , in which water circulated through the reactor is converted to steam and used to drive a generator .

Most U.S. reactors and about 40 percent of Japan 's are pressurized-water reactors , in which reactor coolant is kept separate from the steam used to drive generators .

Both types are far different than the Soviet design involved in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster , a reactor model now considered unsafe by the international nuclear industry . In addition , the Chernobyl plant lacked the kind of reinforced steel-and-concrete containment structure that U.S. and Japanese regulators require .

An explosion caused by hydrogen buildup Saturday blew the roof off the No. 1 reactor 's containment structure and injured four workers , but the reactor was not reported to have sustained damage . Workers have been pouring a mixture of seawater and boron into the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in what experts have called a last-ditch attempt to prevent a meltdown -- a catastrophic failure of the reactor core , with a potential for widespread radiation release .

FUKUSHIMA DAINI

TEPCO reported one fatality at the plant . A crane operator who had been trapped at an operating console in the plant 's exhaust stack was pronounced dead Saturday , the company reported .

Fukushima Daini is about 80 km south of Sendai . The plant 's four reactors went online between 1981 and 1987 .

Japanese officials declared an emergency Sunday at the Onagawa nuclear plant after finding radiation levels above allowed levels in the surrounding area . However , radiation levels had dropped to normal levels by early Monday , and the `` current assumption '' of Japanese authorities is that the increased radiation levels may have been caused by material released from Fukushima Daiichi , according to the IAEA .

The plant reported smoke in a turbine house after Friday 's earthquake , but Japan has told the IAEA that the three reactors at Onagawa are under control .

Onagawa is about 70 km north of Sendai . It is owned by the Tohoku Electric Company , and its three reactors entered service between 1983 and 2001 .

Reactor No. 2 was shut down for a five-month inspection in November , according to the company .
