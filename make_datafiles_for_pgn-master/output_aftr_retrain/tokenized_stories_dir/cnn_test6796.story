O'Brien reached the magical three figures in just 50 balls , smashing the previous best mark of 66 deliveries set by Australia 's Matthew Hayden against South Africa in 2007 .

The 26-year-old O'Brien hit six sixes and 13 fours on his way to 113 , helping Ireland reach 329 for seven with five balls to spare , in reply to England 's total of 327 for eight from their 50 overs .

But O'Brien and Alex Cusack went on to score 162 in a superb six-wicket stand before Cusack was eventually run out for 47 .

However , O'Brien remained at the crease and when he was eventually dismissed with the score on 317 , also by run out , Ireland needed just 12 runs from two more overs to secure a famous success .

`` But we were n't reckoning on an outstanding innings from Kevin O'Brien . It was pretty brutal . ''

Earlier , England 's Jonathan Trott equalled the record for the fastest 1,000 runs in one-day internationals .

Trott 's score of 92 meant he joined team-mate Kevin Pietersen and West Indies legend Viv Richards in taking just 21 innings to achieve that feat .
