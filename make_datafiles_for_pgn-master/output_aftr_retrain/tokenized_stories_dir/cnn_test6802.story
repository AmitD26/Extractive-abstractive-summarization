Especially this year , `` we 've really tried to stay true to -LRB- Lucy 's -RRB- vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend , '' said Journey Gunderson , executive director of the Lucy Ball Desi Arnaz Center for Comedy .

Now in its 20th year , The Lucille Ball Festival of Comedy draws diehard Lucy fans and comedy enthusiasts from countries as far away as Australia , Britain , Canada and Japan to tour the Lucy-Desi museum and Desilu Playhouse , two of the attractions at the Center .

Instead of simply maintaining the grounds for idol worship , though , Gunderson said her goal is to create a festival that will offer `` new and contemporary comedy for years to come . ''

Gunderson 's vision for the festival is one that she hopes will reflect the successful , progressive and still-relevant career that Lucy created .

And in her comedy , `` she found a way to be clean , but still edgy . '' She remained `` independent of societal standards . ''

The increased presence will hopefully kick-start the `` programmatic expansion into truly being a center for comedy , '' she said .

The second pillar is developing educational programming for the comedic arts . Gunderson said they are in talks with colleges and universities about offering master classes and seminars in comedy .

Pillar three is a comedy film festival that would pay tribute to Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz 's work behind the camera as producers of comedy .

`` We want Jamestown to be the Cooperstown of comedy , '' Gunderson said , though she acknowledges pitching Jamestown as a host city for the hall of fame as opposed to some better-known , bigger cities like Chicago or New York will likely be met with some laughter . And that 's just fine with her .

`` Go ahead and laugh , '' she said . `` That 's the point . ''
