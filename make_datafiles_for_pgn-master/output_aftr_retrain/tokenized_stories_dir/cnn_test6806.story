-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The trial of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on charges of sex with an underage nightclub dancer and abuse of power opened Wednesday in Milan .

It lasted 10 minutes and was adjourned until May 31 .

The case is the latest in a long-running series of legal wrangles featuring the scandal-plagued politician and promises to be one of the most controversial trials ever to take place in Italy .

What is Berlusconi accused of ?

Prosecutors also say , in legal papers seen by CNN , that Berlusconi had sex 13 times with El Mahrough .

They claim he abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft .

Berlusconi says the allegations are politically motivated and are an attempt to smear him .

Berlusconi has said the dancer had been introduced as a 24-year-old .

Did he give her any money ?

El Mahrough said she did not know Berlusconi well but that she did receive 7,000 euros -LRB- about $ 9,300 -RRB- from him the first time they met , on Valentine 's Day 2010 , because a friend told Berlusconi she needed help .

Yes . Many times but on March 28 he made his first personal appearance in court in for eight years . It was a two-hour closed-door hearing in Milan on corruption charges . He and others - including his son - are accused of tax fraud and misappropriation of funds .

The 74-year-old Italian PM , currently serving his third term in office , also faces charges of bribing British lawyer David Mills to secure favorable testimony in legal cases .

Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since he was first elected prime minister in 1994 , but none of the cases have resulted in lasting convictions ; several were overturned on appeal .

He has always denied any wrongdoing , and had previously claimed immunity from prosecution , though a 2008 law granting him this was overturned the following year .

How has he reacted to the claims ?

But the young woman 's former roommate told investigators that El Mahrough confided to her that she did have a sexual relationship with the premier .

Berlusconi says he did call the police on El Mahrough 's behalf , but denies this was an abuse of power .

His lawyers have called the investigation `` absurd and groundless '' and a `` grave interference '' in Berlusconi 's private life .

So , will Berlusconi attend any or all of the trials ?

Yes , according to his attorney Niccolo Ghedini , who said : `` Absolutely yes , we have decided to blank his agenda for one day per week , every Monday , in order to allow him to participate to all the hearings . ''

Berlusconi 's lawyers have previously argued that courts in Milan do not have jurisdiction in the case -- because of where the alleged crimes were committed -- or the authority to try a prime minister .

Long-running scandals , a playboy lifestyle and a series of well-publicized gaffes have opened the Italian PM up to widespread ridicule .

Berlusconi has survived two votes of no confidence in recent months , and while his personal approval ratings have been dented , his party , the People of Freedom , still enjoys widespread support in Italy .

The Vatican has made no comment on ` Rubygate ' , which is in keeping with normal diplomatic relations between the Vatican City and the Italian state , says CNN 's Diana Magnay .

What has the public reaction been in Italy ?

Many Italians on the street were clear about their opinion .

`` It does n't really matter if he is found guilty or not . I find it deeply upsetting when I watch the TV news , when I read the paper and when I hear about Berlusconi and Ruby , I feel sick , '' said Rome resident Belinzone Gianlice .

And in Milan , one banner captured the sentiment felt by many Italian women and particularly feminists , `` Stop the merchandising of women . ''
