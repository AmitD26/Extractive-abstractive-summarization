-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When John Lennon remarked in 1966 that the Beatles were then `` more popular than Jesus '' his comments prompted outrage in the United States . But this weekend the Vatican 's newspaper paid tribute to the band on the 40th anniversary of the release of the `` White Album '' in an article interpreted by some as a papal pardon for Lennon .

Q : Was his apology sincere ? Watch as Vatican pardons Lennon ''

A : I do n't know that the Beatles had any particular concern about what the Vatican said . I know the Vatican did say something at the time . But by that time , everybody was pitching in with their opinion , and it just kind of gathered pace .

Q : If he were alive , what would he say about his `` rehabilitation ? ''

A : It 's very hard to say what John Lennon would say now if he knew that the pope had forgiven him or the Catholic Church had forgiven him because on the one hand he wrote to an American evangelist called Oral Roberts and said he had been very sorry . But in a book he said he was very glad that it had happened because it effectively ended the Beatles . Because that tour was so bad that it became the last tour the Beatles ever did . So he thought , `` Thank you Jesus for causing this to happen -- because you gave me a solo career . ''

Q : How spiritual were the Beatles ?

A : The Beatles started out as atheists and agnostics and I think as everybody knows they became more interested in spiritual things . They went out to India in 1968 and I think in a way the Beatles became a spiritual force themselves . And I think that John actually saw that . He saw Christianity and rock 'n' roll as competitors . Only three years later , after 1966 , you had the Woodstock festival and you get rock music almost performing a religious function . So I think in a way he was aware of what was happening . The Beatles were almost becoming a religion and exerting a spiritual force over people .
