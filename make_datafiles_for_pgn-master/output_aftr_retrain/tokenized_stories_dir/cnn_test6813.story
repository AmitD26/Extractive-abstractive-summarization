At a Capitol Hill news conference , Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks , which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty .

`` How do they train them ? They have to dominate the animal , '' Barker said . `` How do they dominate the animal ? They beat it , with clubs , fists , black jacks , ax handles , golf clubs . They shock it with all sorts of electric devices . They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks . ''

Rep. Jim Moran , D-Virginia , said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans , `` how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation 's moral character . ''

But the concerns are not confined to their housing . Jan Creamer , president of ADI , said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment .

Barker 's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of `` CSI '' and `` The West Wing , '' who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals , and taking them off the road .

A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities , and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas , have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals . Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation .

Similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries , including Bolivia , Peru , Portugal and India . And , according to the panel , more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit .
