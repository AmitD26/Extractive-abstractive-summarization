South Africa police commissioner Jackie Selebi , facing charges of corruption , has stepped down as boss of Interpol .

In the letter , Selebi said he was resigning because he did not wish the allegations against him `` to bring the good work of this august body into disrepute . ''

`` Based on my experience of working with Mr. Selebi in his capacity as delegate , vice president and ultimately president of the organization , he has always conducted himself and acted in a way to enhance global security and police co-operation worldwide , '' Noble said in a statement .

As to the charges Selebi faces , Noble said : `` Any such allegations should be prosecuted thoroughly , and the proper manner is for charges to be brought promptly before a court of law and not through media leaks and speculation . ''

The National Prosecuting Authority said it will charge the police chief with `` corruption and defeating the administration of justice , '' Tladi Tladi , a spokesman for the agency told CNN .

According to widespread media reports , the upcoming charges hinge on Selebi 's dealings with Glen Agliotti , a convicted drug smuggler .

Agliotti recently received a 10-year suspended prison sentence in a drug case after entering into a plea bargain . He is also accused of involvement in the 2005 killing of mining magnate Brett Kebble , according to South African media reports .

A court on Friday rejected an application to halt the prosecution by Selebi , who has been under investigation for around two years .

Mbeki denied that he had been too slow in dealing with the fallout from the charges .

`` I have said many times that if there was anyone who came to me with information indicating that the national commissioner had behaved improperly then I would act on such information . No one has come to me with such information , '' Mbeki said . E-mail to a friend
