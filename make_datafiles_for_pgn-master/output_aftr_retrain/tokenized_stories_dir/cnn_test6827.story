The display was the work of New York artist Tenzing Rigdol , 29 , who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from Tibet to Dharamsala to construct his installation . He did not want to disclose details of the soil 's journey , fearful of the repercussions of the act of smuggling . All he would say is that it was a `` complicated process that took 17 months . ''

Rigdol then spread the dirt over a stage the size of a basketball court and called it `` Our Land , Our People . ''

He invited Tibetans to walk on his dirt , write on it or pick up a microphone to express themselves . He knew it could never be the same as actually returning to Tibet , but perhaps , he thought , it would spark a sliver of that feeling .

He thought of his father on Wednesday when the installation opened and people lined up , many overwhelmed with emotion .

The only wish his father had was to see Tibet one more time . But he fell ill in 2007 and died .

A father 's unfulfilled wish drove his artist son to create something that would allow the displaced to be able to `` return '' home again . And others like him , who were born outside of Tibet , to finally feel native earth they have never had under their feet .

`` There are so many like my father who wanted to return , '' Rigdol said . `` And many more who have never been to Tibet . ''

Tenzin Dorjee , 31 , remembers receiving cell phone texts at 4:30 in the morning when his excited friend first came up with his idea . The message was so long that it got broken into three .

Known as the `` roof of the world , '' Tibet is a remote Buddhist region governed by Communist China . Beijing claims its sovereignty over Tibet goes back centuries and views the Tibetan spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama , as a separatist .

About 150,000 Tibetans live in exile , a majority of them in Dharamsala , according to their governing body . The Dalai Lama set up residence there after Chinese forces crushed a 1959 Tibetan uprising .

Meanwhile , monks in their flowing maroon and saffron robes queued up , as did parents holding babies .

`` It was very exciting , '' said Tenzing Geche , 22 , a monk who was a baby when his family left Tibet . He touched the dirt and felt a connection like no other .

`` I felt I was back in my own country , '' he said .

For Lhadon Tethong , 35 , a Canadian visiting family in Dharamsala , the installation was bittersweet . It was completely inspiring at one moment and in another , as she watched elderly Tibetans fall to the ground , sadness overcame her .

`` I am normally better with words than this , '' she said , unable to complete her sentence .

But no matter the consequences , Rigdol 's art will carry on .
