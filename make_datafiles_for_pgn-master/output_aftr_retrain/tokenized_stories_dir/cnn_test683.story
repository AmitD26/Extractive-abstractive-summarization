HOLLYWOOD , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Reality television featuring law enforcement officers on the beat is nothing new . A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects , however , is a new twist .

Maricopa Co. . Sheriff Joe Arpaio now has his own TV show , `` Smile : You 're Under Arrest . ''

Maricopa County , Arizona , Sheriff Joe Arpaio -- whose showy brand of justice has raised charges of discrimination and civil-rights abuses while making him a hero among fans of his tough-on-crime attitudes -- will star in `` Smile : You 're Under Arrest . ''

`` It 's kind of fun to show how stupid they are and , as I say , the looks on their face , '' Arpaio , 76 , said of the suspects wanted for DUIs , drug charges , missed court dates and other offenses . Watch Arpaio explain his methods ''

But Arpaio 's critics are n't amused .

They say they fear the show will give the controversial sheriff positive publicity , ignoring what they call a darker side to his 16-year tenure as top lawman in the county that includes Phoenix .

In a statement on the group 's Web site , Fabian calls Arpaio a `` modern day Bull Connor , '' comparing him to the public safety commissioner in 1960s Birmingham , Alabama , whose use of attack dogs and firehoses on civil rights demonstrators made him a symbol of racial intolerance .

Dubbed `` America 's Toughest Sheriff , '' Arpaio makes many of his county 's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents . He reinstituted chain gangs -- including crews for women and juveniles -- banned smoking , coffee and movies in his jails and , most recently , moved to require all inmates with money in their jail accounts to pay for their own meals .

Fabian said America 's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio 's show . Either way , the series offers another moment in the spotlight for a lawman who has never shied away from it .

`` I 'm not going to brag , '' Arpaio said , `` but there is n't anybody in the world who does n't know who this sheriff is . ''
