-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's possible no more exotic animals are on the loose after deputies killed 49 lions , tigers and other wild animals freed from a local farm by its suicidal owner , an Ohio sheriff told reporters Thursday .

Killed were two wolves ; six black bears ; two grizzly bears ; nine male lions ; eight lionesses ; one baboon ; three mountain lions ; and 18 Bengal tigers , Lutz said Thursday .

Six animals were taken to the Columbus Zoo . Lutz said he has been in contact with Jack Hanna , the zoo 's director emeritus , and `` the animals are doing well . They are eating , they are active and they are being evaluated . ''

Lutz said Thursday there was one monkey unaccounted for , and acknowledged it could be on the loose , but said there had been no reported sightings and it was believed one of the big cats may have eaten it . It was thought to be in the same area as another monkey which was killed by the cats , he said .

There is a concern the monkey could be carrying herpes B , Lutz said . He urged members of the public not to approach a monkey if they see it but to summon authorities .

Autopsy results confirmed the shot was self-inflicted , the sheriff said . Thompson also had a bite wound to his head consistent with a bite from a `` larger-type cat , '' Lutz said . The bite is believed to have occurred `` within seconds to a minute '' after the gunshot wound , he said .

The only animals left on the property as of Thursday were horses , the sheriff said . The killed animals were buried on Thompson 's property , at the request of his wife . The animals , he said , `` were like kids to her . ''

Lutz said he does not know who leaked a photo of the dead animals , but told reporters he hopes to serve multiple terms and `` I have a few years to find out . '' He said one person attempted to steal an animal 's body .

`` These were 300-pound animals and they were very dangerous , '' Lutz said Thursday .

Hanna , the zoo 's director emeritus , said he was upset by loss of `` precious '' animals , but defended the decision to use deadly force .

`` To have no one hurt or killed here with 40-something animals getting loose is unbelievable , '' he told CNN 's `` The Situation Room . ''

Hanna led a team of experts who arrived with four tranquilizer guns late Tuesday in an effort to corral the animals . He said the drugs take several minutes to subdue an animal even with a good shot , and one tiger had to be killed Wednesday afternoon when it turned on a veterinarian after being hit with a tranquilizer dart .

The Humane Society of the United States also said Wednesday it does not fault authorities for using deadly force in such a situation .

`` Yeah , there 's a lion on Mount Perry Road . ... I just drove by and it walked out in front of me and was standing there under the street light , '' one caller to 911 told deputies .

Thompson 's property is about 2 miles outside Zanesville . The 62-year-old had been released from a federal prison September 30 after pleading guilty earlier this year to possessing illegal firearms , including five fully automatic firearms . A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending , according to the U.S. attorney 's office in Ohio 's Southern District .

He also had been convicted of animal cruelty and was arrested several times for traffic violations .

Lutz told reporters Thursday he could not speculate on what prompted Thompson to take his life .

Sam Kopchak , Thompson 's neighbor , said he saw lions and bears running free Tuesday evening , with one tiger chasing horses . Kopchak managed to get himself and his horse into his barn and telephoned his mother .

`` It was like a war zone , '' Kopchak said when authorities descended on the property , set off the road named after Kopchak 's family .
