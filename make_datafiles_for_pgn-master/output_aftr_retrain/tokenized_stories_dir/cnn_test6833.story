-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joseph Maraachli , the infant who became the center of an international end-of-life debate , died peacefully in his sleep at his Windsor , Ontario , home , a spokesperson for the family said Wednesday .

Joseph 's family had refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy 's breathing tube and allow him to die . In March , the infant received a tracheotomy at a children 's hospital in St. Louis , Missouri .

He was able to go home April 21 .

Parents Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to accept the recommendation . The Maraachlis ' daughter , Zeina , had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications , and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son .

`` To go through it once is enough for a lifetime , to go through it twice , it 's just ... unbelievable , '' Fedor said .

The family was thankful for those who helped and prayed for Joseph , she added .

`` The heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents ' rights ... to be in comfort of -LRB- their -RRB- own home , to die on God 's time , '' said Fedor .

The family countered assertions that Joseph was nonresponsive , blind and deaf , she said . Instead , the boy could hear the parents ' voices and look for them , Fedor told CNN . The family believed that , after a tracheotomy , Joseph could be freed from machinery .

Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia . The group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case .

The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that `` there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation '' and that `` the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source . ''

Nurses helped the family provide 24-hour care for Joseph in his final months . `` There was always somebody by his side , '' Fedor said .

The child was on almost no medication and apparently was in no pain , Fedor said .

`` When he was in the arms of his parents , you could tell , '' she said . `` He was settled when he was in their arms . ''
