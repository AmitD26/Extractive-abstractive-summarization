Lonely Planet : The 10 ultimate Bahamas experiences

Those unaccustomed to seeing rays might not realize what a rare sight this is . Stingrays prefer to bury themselves under the sand , with only their bulbous eyes remaining above the ocean floor , keeping a watchful eye out for predators such as Caribbean reef sharks or hammerheads .

Should they be attacked , rays have one weapon in their arsenal -- a serrated , venomous-sheathed barb , four to eight inches long , that can be used to ward off enemies or someone settling on top of them . These can inflict a painful wound in humans which may quickly become infected , and if the barb breaks off , it must be surgically removed .

Stingray City 's famous diving is fun , shallow and located in a beautiful setting . A dive starts with a fascinating insight into the lives of these graceful creatures , and an on-board briefing about how to settle on the bottom and interact with them .

Upon descending , hungry rays will probably already be near the boat . If not , it is a thrilling sight to see a group of anywhere from four to 14 stingrays winding their way toward you across the snow white sand . Rays here have been measured at over 4 foot across and weighing over 125 pounds . There have even been reports of 6 foot rays , which far exceeds their normal adult size .

There are few places like this in the world to enjoy interaction with such an enigmatic sea creature . Many divers and snorkelers come back for second and third helpings ; so do n't forget to bring a waterproof camera .
