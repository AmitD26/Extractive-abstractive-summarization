-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Europe 's leaders warned 2012 was likely to be tougher than 2011 , when spiralling borrowing costs forced political change in Italy and Spain and threatened the survival of the euro .

The euro crisis in 2011 forced borrowing costs higher for Italy and Spain and led to the dismissal of Silvio Berlusconi 's centre-right government in Rome and the fall of the Socialist administration of JosÃ © Luis RodrÃguez Zapatero in Madrid .

It also undermined sentiment in the euro which had a second consecutive year of losses against the dollar and fell to its lowest level in a decade against the yen .

Speaking on national television on Saturday , Ms Merkel said Europe was experiencing its `` harshest test in decades '' but would ultimately be made stronger by the crisis .

Europe 's political leaders will begin talks later this month to amend the intergovernmental pact agreed by all 27 members of the European Union , except the UK , at a summit in Brussels last month .

The state of Italy 's public finances were at the centre of Giorgio Napolitano 's New Year address . The president of Europe 's third-largest economy urged Italians to make sacrifices to rescue the country 's public finances .

`` Sacrifices are necessary to ensure the future of young people , it 's our objective and a commitment we can not avoid , '' he said .

In Greece , Lucas Papademos , the new technocratic prime minister , also warned of a difficult year ahead .

`` We have to continue our efforts with determination , so that the sacrifices we have made up to now wo n't be in vain , '' he said in a televised address on Saturday .
