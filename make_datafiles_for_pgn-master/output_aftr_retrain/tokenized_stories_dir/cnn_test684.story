-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Researchers have discovered a previously unknown group of rare monkeys in the forests of Vietnam .

The Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys were so skittish , researchers captured a photo of only one : an adult male .

The monkeys were `` very sensitive to the presence of people , giving warning signs to one another and fleeing '' whenever biologists approached , the group said in a statement .

Hunters with a taste for bush meat and the loss of habitat have pushed the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey toward extinction , according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature .

Fauna & Flora said it is working with a variety of groups to improve the livelihoods and `` reduce human pressures on the forest ecosystem '' in an effort to safeguard the newly discovered group , which was spotted in a patch of forest in the Quan Ba district of Vietnam 's Ha Giang province .

The sighting thrilled conservation biologist Le Khac Quyet , described by Fauna & Flora as `` one of the few people in the world who can claim to be an expert on this mysterious species '' and as the person credited with discovering the new group of that species .

`` When I saw the Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys ... I was overjoyed , '' he said in the Fauna & Flora statement .
