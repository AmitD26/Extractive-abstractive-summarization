-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He was the soccer referee known as `` golden whistle '' who officiated in high-profile events such as the World Cup and the Olympics .

But a Chinese court has called fulltime on Lun Ju 's career by jailing him for match fixing .

China 's state news agency Xinhua reported on Thursday that Lu has been sentenced to five and a half years in prison by a court in Liaoning Province after accepting $ 128,000 to fix seven matches in China 's national league .

Three other officials -- Huang Junjie , Wan Daxue and Zhou Weixin -- were also jailed for seven , six , and three and a half years respectively .

But the court in the city of Dandong , near the border with North Korea , found that Lu had altered the outcome of seven games that involved four clubs including Shanghai Shenhua , who have just signed former France striker Nicolas Anelka from English club Chelsea .

Former CFA vice-president Yang Yimin and ex-CFA Referee Committee director Zhang Jianqiang are due to be sentenced on February 18 , Xinhua reported .

The fact that several of China 's top clubs were alluded to in the court cases also casts doubt on the new league season , due to begin in March , as they await to hear if they will be sanctioned .
