-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Eleven years ago , Danae Mines ignored her family 's objections and became one of the few female firefighters with the New York City Fire Department , better known as the FDNY .

And this week , with her trademark determination , she broke through a different traditionally all-male barrier : the FDNY Calendar of Heroes .

Mines is the first woman to be featured as eye candy in the calendar 's 11-year history , something that typifies her grit and will .

`` I was n't going to let anyone tell me I could n't do what I wanted to do , '' she said told the New York Daily News .

`` I wanted my picture in the calendar so that young girls and young women can see me and know that they can do this job . ''

Mines is a 14-year veteran of the FDNY and a member of Engine Co. 60 in the South Bronx , the department told CNN .

She joins 12 male colleagues on the calendar 's steamy pages and will be featured in March .

There are about 10,300 firefighters in all ranks of the FDNY and 46 of those are women , according to the department . That equals less than half of one percent .

A positive reaction

The consensus : Even a calendar with a reputation for showcasing traditional masculinity must catch up with the times .

This type of reaction is exactly what Angela Hughes wants to hear .

As a fire lieutenant in Baltimore County , Maryland , and a trustee at the IAWFES , she knows how difficult it can be for women to assimilate in a fire department .

`` It 's not easy to fit in , '' she told CNN . `` The stereotype is that you 're a fireman . But we 're firefighters and we 're trained to do the job . Not everyone needs to be a muscle-bound giant to do the job . It is about technique . ''

She listed several issues the IAWFES seeks to address for female firefighters , including the need for personal bathrooms , sleeping quarters and freedom from workplace harassment .

Still , Hughes felt that Mines ' inclusion in the FDNY calendar was a sign of slight progress .

`` This woman is helping more people understand . ''
