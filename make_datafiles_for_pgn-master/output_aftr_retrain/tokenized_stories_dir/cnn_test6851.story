Gillian Gibbons also faces deportation from Sudan after her prison term , her lawyer told CNN .

He said that he was `` very disappointed '' with the verdict and that Gibbons planned to appeal .

Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her -- inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs , her lawyer said .

Gibbons , 54 , was arrested Sunday after she asked her class of 7-year-olds in Khartoum to name the stuffed animal as part of a school project , the British Foreign Office said . She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudan 's constitution , the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred .

Appearing somber and dazed , Gibbons arrived at the central courthouse in Khartoum for her closed hearing early Thursday . A staff member from the British Embassy in Khartoum and defense lawyers attended the hearing with her .

The courthouse was heavily guarded by police , who kept journalists -- and , for a while , even one of her attorneys -- away .

Gibbons could have faced a sentence of 40 lashes , a fine , or a jail term of up to a year , according to the Foreign Office , which expressed Britain 's dissatisfaction with the verdict .

The Foreign Office said Gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest , meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence .

Earlier , Miliband had met with Siddig , who was summoned to the Foreign Office in London .

On Wednesday , Boulos said he was `` horrified '' when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent , as originally thought . Defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from Sarah Khawad , a secretary at the school .

Gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August , after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool , England , this summer , Boulos said .

He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot , which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats . E-mail to a friend
