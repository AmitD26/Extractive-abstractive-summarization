-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Those battling global warming by promoting biofuels may unintentionally be adding to skyrocketing world food prices , creating what one expert calls `` a silent tsunami '' in developing nations .

The rising prices are `` threatening to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger , '' Josette Sheeran , executive director of the United Nations ' World Food Program , said on the agency 's Web site Tuesday .

`` The drive for more biofuels means more investment is going into those crops , meaning less land and less investment going in for food crops , causing a massive conflict and resulting in rising prices , which is having a huge negative impact , especially on developing countries , '' said Clare Oxborrow , food campaigner for Friends of the Earth .

Critics also say that in Africa , Asia and South America , people are being driven from their land and forests are being cleared to make room for the booming biofuel industry .

Brown said in an article posted on the 10 Downing Street Web site , `` We now know that biofuels intended to promote energy independence and combat climate change are frequently energy-inefficient .

`` We must also do more to explore the links between climate change and food , and particularly their impact on the livelihoods and vulnerability of the very poorest , who are likely to be most affected by climate change . ''

The meeting he convened , Brown said , is a precursor to the G8 summit of industrial nations , to be held in July , and a special U.N. summit in September .

He urged prompt action .

`` With one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes , the time to act is now , '' Brown stressed .

The World Health Organization views hunger as the No. 1 threat to public health around the world , responsible for a third of child deaths and 10 percent of all disease .

Douglas Alexander , Britain 's International Development secretary , announced Tuesday that Britain has set aside a 455 million-pound -LSB- $ 900 million -RSB- aid package to address the food crisis . His agency manages Britain 's aid to poor countries with the goal of eliminating extreme poverty . E-mail to a friend
