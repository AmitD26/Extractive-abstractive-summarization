-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.N. gunships battled rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Monday , according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux .

U.N. helicopter gunships , supporting national army forces on the ground , fired on rebels from the Congress for the Defense of the People in an effort to halt their advance on the village of Kibumba .

The village of Kibumba is the location of a U.N.-administered internally displaced peoples camp , just 12 1/2 miles -LRB- 20 kilometers -RRB- north of the provincial capital , Goma , Bonnardeaux said .

Renewed fighting erupted Sunday when the CNDP seized a major military camp and gorilla park , according to U.N. and park officials . The U.N. brokered peace accord in the area in January .

On Monday , thousands fleeing Kibumba spurred violent demonstrations in front of the U.N. compound in Goma . The group was angry that a 17,000-person U.N. security force has been unable to protect them from renewed bouts of violence in the country , a U.N. spokesman told CNN .

The assault died down later in the day , a U.N. spokesman said , but people continued to pelt the building .

Thousands of civilians were reportedly fleeing the fighting . Pictures from the region showed long lines of people walking along roads carrying their belongings . Watch how refugees line roads to get away ''

Soldiers who abandoned the military camp were retreating in vehicles on a main road outside of Goma on Monday , angrily honking their horns at civilians who got in their way , The Associated Press reported .

Bertrand Bisimwa , a spokesman for the rebels , told the AP that rebel fighters had moved to within 7 miles -LRB- 11 kilometers -RRB- of Goma .

The latest fighting comes after the collapse on Sunday of a tenuous week-old U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces .

`` The situation in Goma is very volatile , '' he said . `` But MONUC is taking all available measures to stabilize the situation . '' Watch more about the fighting ''

The U.N. mission -- known by its French acronym , MONUC -- is in Goma , which is along Congo 's border with Rwanda .

Although the civil war in Congo -- once known as Zaire -- officially ended in 2003 , recent fighting in eastern Congo between government forces and CNDP rebels under has caused tens of thousands to flee their homes , according to U.N. spokesman Michele Bonnardeaux . Watch ranger describe the violence ''

The conflict and humanitarian crisis in Congo have taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998 , and 45,000 people die there every month , according to an International Rescue Committee report in January .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement Monday calling on all parties `` to make every effort to restore calm among the affected populations . ''

The attacks also coincided with the resignation of the U.N. military commander in Congo , Lt. Gen. Vicente Diaz de Villegas y Herreria . A U.N. statement on Monday indicated he stepped down for `` personal reasons . ''
