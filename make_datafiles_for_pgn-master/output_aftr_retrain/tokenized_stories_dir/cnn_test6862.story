Could this be the start of another Great Depression ? Could `` it '' possibly happen again ? My stock answer has always been no .

We can be confident , I always answered , that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine . At least that was my line until recently . Now I have stopped taking reporters ' calls .

The first thing that made the Great Depression great , of course , was the Fed 's failure to act . It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it . This time , in contrast , the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction . Not only has it cut rates , but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another .

Unfortunately , it has reacted more than acted . First , it provided funds to the commercial banks . Then , it targeted broker-dealers . Now , it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market . All the while however , the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system .

One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash . The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom .

There was a solution : coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe . Unfortunately , central bankers could n't agree on what was needed . The result was further instability .

U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero , and the Fed 's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level . Central banks are out of ammunition . This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves .

When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system , its banking crisis only shifted to Germany . When Germany did the same , the crisis spread to the United States .

This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst . We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks , as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system .

My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $ 700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization . Although the Great Depression started in 1929 , it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks . We ca n't afford to wait for years this time around .

A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election . There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge .

The outgoing president , Hoover , asked his successor designate , Franklin Roosevelt , to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies , but FDR refused to do so . Meanwhile , the banking crisis deepened . Corporations failed .

The economy was allowed to spiral downward . It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2 1/2 months .

The implication is clear . The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now . Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5 . This problem can not wait until Inauguration Day .
