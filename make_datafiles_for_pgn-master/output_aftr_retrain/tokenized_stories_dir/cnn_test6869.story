LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coca-Cola , the world 's largest soft drinks group , has bought a minority stake in Innocent , the British fruit drink and `` smoothie '' maker that boasts of its ethical stance .

Coca-Cola faces allegations about labor abuses as well as health and environmental concerns .

Innocent employs 275 people , has a turnover of more than £ 100 million and sells about two million smoothies each week .

`` We 'll just get to do them even more . ''

James Quincey , group business unit president for Coca-Cola Europe , said : `` We are delighted to have the opportunity to invest in Innocent 's future . We have long admired their brand , their products and their unique approach to business . ''

But the investment is sure to open up Innocent to charges that its ideals are being diluted .

Sales of Coke are holding up well amid the global economic crisis thanks to strong growth in China and India . In February the company reported a 4 percent rise in sales volumes in the last three months of 2008 and a 10 percent increase in comparable earnings .
