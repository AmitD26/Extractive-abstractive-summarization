`` We are kind of in a state of emergency . It 's pretty bad , '' said iReporter Dwight Stanley of Louisville , Kentucky .

Andrew Melnykovych , spokesman for Kentucky 's Public Service Commission , said it is `` an indescribable mess everywhere . ''

Ice storms covered parts of the state Friday , with moderate snowstorms expected to continue into Saturday morning , the National Weather Service said .

Larry Holeman , deputy emergency management director of rural Grayson County , called his hard-hit community `` a war zone . ''

The emergency reflects the challenges faced in states such as Kentucky , where many rural and remote regions struggle to keep warm and dry under dire weather conditions .

The deaths prompted authorities to issue a stern warning about the dangers of carbon monoxide .

`` We 've lost three citizens because people were n't listening to the fire department when they look into the cameras and talk on the radios and say , ` listen up , carbon monoxide kills , ' '' Abramson said in a press conference Friday afternoon . `` We ca n't talk enough about it . ''

But Melnykovych said that while the state is saying 607,000 customers have lost power , he thinks the number is closer to 650,000 because the state figure comes only from utilities it regulates .

`` Hurricane Ike did n't have this kind of impact , '' he said .

Of the state 's 120 counties , 78 have declared emergencies . So have 47 cities , the governor 's office said .

At least 113 emergency shelters have been opened .

Jewel Tomes , who lives in Leitchfield , took shelter at a high school after a complex for the elderly lost power and was `` thrilled to have a place to come to . ''

Crews across the state were working to clear roads of snow , ice and trees .

A key concern is getting generators to water treatment facilities because of the large number of people without water .

The Kentucky National Guard , which has had 620 soldiers on duty , is bolstering to 1,000 the number of soldiers aiding recovery efforts .

Beshear praised the Obama administration 's prompt reaction to the storm .

`` Western Kentucky has obviously been hit very badly by this storm , '' Beshear said Friday .

It 's the first ice storm for Debbie Pelissero , who moved to Lexington from San Diego in May . She took pictures of the `` peaceful and surreal '' scenes for her California family .

The newcomer is learning a basic principle about her new Kentucky home , uttered by the governor .
