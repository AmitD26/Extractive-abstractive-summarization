How about singing every day , making lists of things that made her happy , and getting a `` joy buddy '' ?

Those are among the suggestions given in Awakening Joy , a class taught by James Baraz , a meditation instructor and founding teacher of Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre , California . A series of exercises , lectures , and meditations stretched over 10 months , Awakening Joy is designed to bring more happiness to people 's lives .

`` The course uses practices that lead the mind toward states of happiness and well-being , '' says Baraz . `` In other words , it teaches you to focus on how it feels to feel good . '' The first and most important step , he says , is intention : making the decision to be happy .

• Writing what the word joy means to you

`` That 's important , '' says Holden . `` One of the major blocks to happiness is a sense of isolation . If you 're alive , you need help . ''

There are also guided meditations , including instructions on how to be mindful -- being present for whatever you 're doing and , as Baraz says , `` simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different . ''

For Joan , that turned out to be a bigger challenge than singing -- especially when her husband suggested that they begin the separation process .

`` Awakening Joy is n't about being a happy little do bee , '' she says . `` You 're taught that when feelings arise , no matter what they are , you stay with them . When my husband said we should contact a mediator , I cried years of tears . But by accepting those painful feelings , I had a watershed moment : I realized that I really wanted this marriage . ''

Rather than assuming divorce was inevitable , Joan started to see other possibilities . `` From that day to this , it 's been a whole different experience , '' she says . `` My husband and I are still together , and in a way that I honestly did n't think was possible . ''

For Baraz , the best testimonials come from former skeptics ; he admits that he himself would n't be the best case study . `` I 've always been a relatively joyful , celebratory kind of person , '' he says . He found his spiritual path in Buddhism , but when his studies became very serious , so did he .

`` Then I realized that the Buddha was called the Happy One , and he said , ` Go for the highest happiness . ' That became the focus of my teaching . '' -LRB- Baraz points out that one need n't be a Buddhist , or of any particular faith , to reap the benefits of Awakening Joy . `` Ministers , rabbis , and secular experts have successfully used these basic principles , '' he says . -RRB-

The idea for the course began eight years ago , when Baraz 's wife , Jane , gave him a book called `` How We Choose to Be Happy , '' by Rick Foster and Greg Hicks . `` The instructions made a lot of sense , but they did n't have a spiritual dimension , '' Baraz says . `` So I added that and presented it as a series of talks with my weekly meditation group for about three months to see what would happen . '' The results : `` We got happier and happier ! ''

Baraz then turned Awakening Joy into a six-month class and found that participants maintained a positive attitude even after it ended -LRB- as long as they practiced the exercises ; as with diets or working out , continuity is essential -RRB- .

Writing lists of things she 's grateful for was also a big help . `` A lot of my seriousness has lifted , '' she says . `` I have a lighter heart . I still have chronic pain , but I know there 's a lot to feel good about . ''

Baraz is writing a book about Awakening Joy and the people who now routinely roll up the windows in their cars so they can sing as loudly as they want to . `` More than 2,000 people have tested it , so it 's not some airy-fairy idea , '' he says . `` I 've learned that it 's possible to change , no matter what your history or the limiting beliefs you 've held on to . If you have the intention to be happy and you do the practices , if you give it your best shot and are very patient , it works . ''

We 're all so used to thinking that we 'll finally be content when we find the perfect partner , lose weight , or get our dream job . Is it really possible to become happier just by deciding you can ?

`` We use the language of having , getting , and chasing to describe happiness , rather than being , '' says Holden . `` What we 've learned about happiness is that it is n't an it or a thing . Research has proven that there is no one set of circumstances that makes someone happy ; it 's more about having a healthy mental attitude toward whatever you 're experiencing . So , you can either chase happiness or you can choose to be happy . It really is that simple . ''
