-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- My eyes stung , I was coughing , my nose was running . Along with cameraman David Hawley and freelance producer Kareem Khadder , I had just been tear-gassed -- not for the first time last Friday -- during a day-long clash between Palestinian kids and Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Na'alin , on the West Bank .

We had gone there to gauge the Palestinian view of Tuesday 's Israeli elections . Na'alin , and many other towns and villages like it in the West Bank , are in the forefront of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians . Here , it all comes down to the most basic element in the century-old conflict : control of the land .

As we sheltered from the tear gas behind a house , Na'alin resident Hani Khawaja told me , `` I do n't expect anything to come out of the elections that will please the Palestinians . Just killings , expulsions and land confiscations . ''

Another man , Ayub Srour , had a slightly different approach . He prefers Israeli leaders to be honest about their intentions , and not raise hopes only to dash them later . He wants Likud leader and long-time hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu to win . `` At least he 's honest . He says he 'll expel us , and he will expel us . He says he 's slaughter us , and he will slaughter us . ''

They 've also seen a series of Israeli incursions into Gaza , culminating recently in the 22-day Israeli offensive that left large parts of the strip in ruins .

Meanwhile many Palestinians say their leadership -- often described as moderate and pro-western -- in Ramallah is incapable of reversing the trend of settlement expansion .

The same leadership has been unable to convince Israel to remove few of the hundreds of roadblocks and checkpoints that make travelling around the West Bank a test of patience and endurance .

In short , when Palestinians look back over the last 15 years since the Oslo Accords were signed , they 've seen their lot only go from bad to worse .

As a result , more and more Palestinians are convinced the only way to beat the Israelis is to join them , to discard failed attempts at creating a Palestinian state in an ever smaller , ever more economically unviable territory , and go for what is known as the one-state solution .

The one-state solution is an anathema to many Israelis , who are well aware that , with their higher birth-rate , Palestinians -LRB- those living within Israel proper , plus Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza -RRB- could well become a majority within a generation .

Israelis increasingly worry the national struggle between Israel and the Palestinians will be transformed into an internal struggle , for equal rights for all those living within historic Palestine .

Those fears prompted Israel 's current caretaker prime minister , Ehud Olmert , to warn as far back as November 2007 that if Israel does n't move quickly to achieve a two-state solution , it will be in a position not unlike South Africa during the apartheid area , whereby a minority -- in this case Israeli Jews -- rules over a restive majority -- the Palestinians -- by means of force , repression and discriminatory laws .

The bedrock of Israeli antipathy toward the Palestinians is part of the reason for the growing strength of the Israel Beiteinu -LRB- Israel is Our Home -RRB- Party , led by Avigdor Leiberman .

Tibi responds that Leiberman 's growing clout is symptomatic of `` an obvious fascist phenomena invading Israeli society . During the last years , racism became mainstream . ''

Back in the town of Na'alin , the kids throwing stones at Israeli troops do have some odd companions . Young Israelis , some of them self-described anarchists , also take part in the protests .

They do n't throw stones , but they do offer useful advice . `` Laththam ! Laththam ! '' one Israeli with black tattoos on his arms tells a young boy , no older than 12 , hurling rocks with a home-made sling .

`` Laththam '' is Arabic for `` cover your face , '' the advice imparted because if Israeli troops can identify stone throwers , they arrest them .

There still is cooperation of sorts between Palestinians and Israelis , but it 's an increasingly rare commodity . And this election probably wo n't do anything to bridge the growing gap between the two -- the curious friendship in Na'alin notwithstanding .
