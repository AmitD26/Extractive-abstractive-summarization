Jeffrey Bewkes , chairman and CEO of Time Warner , speaks at the NCTA conference in Washington .

With a service called TV Everywhere , Comcast and Time Warner will give cable subscribers access to `` premium '' television content via broadband , and later cellphone connections .

To begin with , 5,000 Comcast subscribers will begin testing the system next month , giving them access to Time Warner 's TBS and TNT channels on their computers , and the same channels ' video-on-demand catalogs on their cable boxes .

But if you prefer to watch your television for free on ad-supported sites like Hulu while paying only for the internet connection that delivers it , you could be in for a rude awakening . TV Everywhere represents an alternative -- and possible threat -- to the popular Hulu model .

Already `` at least 92 percent of Americans qualify to watch this for free online , '' according to Jeff Bewkes , chairman and CEO of Time Warner .

There 's nothing to stop television networks from putting their content on both Hulu and TV Everywhere , because TV Everywhere 's contract will be non-exclusive , according to Bewkes . However , given the choice between Hulu and TV Everywhere , television programmers have an incentive to go with the latter .

`` In addition , we are concerned that this program violates the open nature of the internet . By adding this additional toll lane , Comcast and Time Warner want to create their own ` managed channel ' within the internet and turn the internet into their own private cable channel . ''

So , what about Hulu ? Will its deals fall through given this new option ?

`` There will be some part -LSB- of Time Warner 's content -RSB- that will be out there -LSB- on Hulu -RSB- , said Bewkes . `` Short-form content , I think , will continue to be available -- promotional content will continue to be available . ''

However , only cable subscribers will be able to access other content online -- through officially licensed avenues , anyway .

`` Consumers vote every single month with their pocketbook , '' he added . `` They do n't have to subscribe to cable . They do n't have to pay for these services , yet they do . The number of people paying for subscription television has gone up and up and up every single quarter that we 've been in the business . ''
