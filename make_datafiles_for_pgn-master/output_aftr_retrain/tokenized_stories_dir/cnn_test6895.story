All these years , while we were being offered safety first , last and front , side and rear ways , hardly anyone in the vehicle industry had given much thought to what actually was in that perfume de profit , the new car smell that car buyers sought and bought .

As everyone knew , pollution related to vehicles originated from the exhaust pipe , not the shifter knob . It was spewed out the back of the rear , not the back of the rear view mirror . Well , what everyone thought they knew was wrong .

It turns out -- take a deep breath -- that most of that new car smell is not some carefully-compounded , luxury , feel-good incense to the Mammon gods . But the new car smell comes from toxic gases .

Not only that , but like a two dollar cologne , the effects can linger and linger for years , stinking up not only your shiny new car , but the reputation of the entire vehicle industry itself . AOL Autos : Best new small cars

Who says so ? Just about everyone in the vehicle business these days . But the initiator was The Ecology Center -LRB- EC -RRB- , a membership-based , nonprofit environmental organization based in Ann Arbor , Michigan . AOL Autos : 10 most fuel-efficient new cars

In a 2006 industry-awakening report entitled `` Toxic At Any Speed : Chemicals in Cars and the Need for Safe Alternatives '' , this independent green organization declared that much of the material in most car interiors that produce that new car smell is made with toxic chemicals known to pose major public health risks .

The report went on to say that not only are vehicle drivers and passengers breathing toxic air , but are also in constant physical contact with dangerous chemicals leaching from just about every interior surface of a new vehicle . The report says these chemicals give off gases that not only contaminate the air , but also coat interior surfaces with toxic `` fog , '' generally seen as that new car film common to new car interior windshields and windows .

Fake is probably as bad as real . The companies that market those `` new car smell '' products that are sold at car washes and auto accessories stores generally will not reveal product contents . One fragrance industry spokesman indicated they can contain artificial leather odor , plus aldehydes , esters and ketones , which are all organic or chemical compounds .

In addition to acettonitrile , decanol , formaldehyde , naphthalene and carbon disulfide used in foams , adhesives and fabrics , the two major problem chemicals in most new vehicles are -LRB- a -RRB- the PBDEs , which are used as fire retardants throughout the industry and -LRB- b -RRB- phthalates , which are widely employed to soften PVC plastics .

Report coauthor and EC 's Clean Car Campaign Director Jeff Gearhart wrote , `` We can no longer rely just on seatbelt and airbags to keep us safe in cars . Our research shows that autos are chemical reactors , releasing toxins before we even turn on the ignition . There are safer alternatives to these chemicals ... ''

The Ecology Center called for these actions :

Manufacturers : Should phase out PBDEs and phthalates in auto material parts .

Vehicle occupants : Should minimize health risks by using solar reflectors , ventilating car interiors with open windows and non-recirculating air conditioning and parking out of direct sunlight whenever possible . In other words , get rid of that new car smell .

Although the automotive industry took notice of the report , there was no instant fire drill to rectify the status quo . Reaction to the report was slow-growing , but due to things green busting out all over , just about every vehicle manufacturer began to initiate research and development to reduce or eliminate built-in passenger compartment pollution .

Addressing progress or lack of same in its recent Second Annual Report , the Ecology Center graded the country 's eight leading car manufacturers on their plastics policies and practices .

Bio-based materials

Toyota led the group with a ` B ' grade by developing an eco-plastic made from sugar cane or corn and building a pilot plant to produce it . DaimlerChrysler came in second through increased use of renewable materials , and Ford came in third for developing a soy-based foam and a bio-fabric for seating .

Interior air quality

PVC reduction

Honda was tops with a B for removing PVC from most applications in its products . Also cited were Hyundai , Toyota and DaimlerChrysler for replacing PVC parts in some lines .

But not all is mountain fresh air in vehicleland . While these studies show progress , vehicle manufacturers still have miles to go before the interiors of their offerings are safe from `` new car smell . ''

When grading the manufacturers that account for 94 % of total vehicles in sales in the US , it resulted in the highest overall grade of a C + for Toyota and a C for Ford , while the lowest score in this group overall was a D - for Volkswagen .

`` Safety is more than crumple zones and air bags , '' said a Volvo spokesman . `` All of our interiors comply with Oeko-tex 100 , probably the toughest cabin standard being used today . ''
