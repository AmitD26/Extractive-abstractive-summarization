-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If you sell it , they will come .

That 's the hope at least for many offering Michael Jackson related merchandise and memorabilia , including autographed items and domain names , in the wake of his surprising death .

Almost 20,000 items were up for sale after his death on the popular auction site eBay , where collectors could snap up everything from the rare to the ridiculous .

There were Michael Jackson gloves -LRB- sparkly , of course -RRB- , masks , wigs , sunglasses and fedora hats . Anyone in the mood for some senior soda could try and win an auction for an unopened six-pack of Pepsi from the 1984 Jacksons world tour .

Online merchant CafePress also offered a variety of items , including mugs , `` R.I.P. Michael Jackson '' magnets and dozens of T-shirt designs , including one screened with a drawing of tennis legend Billie Jean King and the words `` not my lover . ''

On eBay , bids for what the buyer claimed was a signed Michael Jackson guitar had reached almost $ 1,300 by Friday afternoon .

Jerry Ohlinger , owner of Jerry Ohlinger 's Movie Material Store in New York , predicted that although Jackson was generous in giving autographs , the price for a legitimate autograph probably will at least double from the $ 150 to $ 300 range it was prior to his death .

`` He would sign autographs whenever he appeared in person , '' Ohlinger said . `` For instance , he visited our store at least three times , and he signed autographs for all of the employees . ''

As of Friday , items purported to be autographed photos of Jackson were ranging in price from just over $ 5 to several thousand dollars .

Whenever Jackson would visit Ohlinger 's Manhattan store , he would shop for vintage photos of some of the legendary ladies of cinema , including his very dear friend Elizabeth Taylor , Ohlinger recalled .
