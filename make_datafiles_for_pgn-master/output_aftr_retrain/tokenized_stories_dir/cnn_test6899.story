The ongoing exchange of heavy-weapon fire between the two sides has trapped people in the town , residents said .

`` Everyone inside this house is scared because heavy shells are raining in the town , '' said one resident , Sahra Muse .

Bulo Burde is about 155 miles -LRB- 250 kilometers -RRB- southeast of the Somali capital of Mogadishu .

The United States is supporting the Somali government 's fight against the insurgents , including providing weapons to government forces . Al Shabaab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network .

Earlier this month , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Somalia 's transitional president and vowed to continue U.S. support for his government .

The United States announced in June that it is providing weapons and ammunition to help Ahmed 's government fight the militants . The weapons shipments are in accordance with U.N. Security Council resolutions , which ban some arms shipments to Somalia , said State Department spokesman Ian Kelly .

Clinton warned that terrorist groups like Al Shabaab pose a threat to the broader international community .

`` Certainly if Al Shabaab were to obtain a haven in Somalia , which could then attract al Qaeda and other terrorist actors , it would be a threat to the United States , '' she said .

`` Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa , like Somalia and Yemen , that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there , '' Panetta said in June .

Separately , the FBI is investigating what appears to be a massive recruiting effort by Al Shabaab in immigrant communities in the United States . More than a dozen young men of Somali descent have disappeared from the Minneapolis , Minnesota , area in recent months . At least three of them , including a suicide bomber , have been killed in Somalia .

President Ahmed is a former member of the Islamic Courts Union , which took part in the 2006 coup . His decision to renounce the bloody insurgency and try to establish peace in Somalia has put him at odds with Islamist hard-liners who are still battling for control of Somalia . It also paved the way for his election as president of Somalia 's U.N.-backed transitional government in January .
