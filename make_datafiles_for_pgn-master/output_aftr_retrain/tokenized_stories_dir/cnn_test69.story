-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Kentucky census worker who was found dead in September committed suicide and staged the scene to look like a homicide , authorities said Tuesday .

`` A thorough examination of evidence from the scene , to include DNA testing , as well as examination of his vehicle and his residence , resulted in the determination that Mr. Sparkman , alone , handled the key pieces of evidence with no indications of any other persons involved , '' Kentucky State Police said .

He was also in contact with the ground , `` almost on his knees , '' she said .

His glasses were taped to his head , and that tape was underneath tape that held a rag in his mouth , she said .

`` Mr. Sparkman had extremely poor eyesight '' and so would have needed his glasses secured , Rudzinski said .

But the most compelling evidence came from the fact that Sparkman had obtained $ 600,000 in accidental-death insurance , which would not have paid in the event of a suicide , as late as May , she said .

In addition , he told a `` credible witness '' of his plans to commit suicide and stage the scene to make it look like he was slain because he worked for the federal government . The details were consistent with how Sparkman died and was found , Rudzinski said .

The witness did not take action after Sparkman shared his plans out of a belief that he would not follow through , authorities said .

`` It was learned that Mr. Sparkman had discussed recent federal investigations and the perceived negative attitudes toward federal entities by some residents of Clay County , '' Kentucky state police said in a statement .

Forensic analysis of the writing on Sparkman 's chest showed that he had written it himself , Rudzinski said . Analysts found ink dots , made by writers on completing a letter , at the top of the letters , rather than at the bottom -- as would be expected if someone had made the writing on Sparkman . Despite a search by authorities , the black felt pen used for the writing has not been found .

Sparkman had told the witness , whom police declined to name , that he intended to dispose of some of his personal effects , including his laptop computer and other items . Police have not found those items , Rudzinski said .

Toxicology tests showed that Sparkman was not drugged or under the influence of any substance , she said . The red rag removed from his mouth was similar to those found in his pocket and at the scene .

The police investigation is still open , and additional test results are expected in the next two to three weeks , authorities said .

`` Our hearts go out to him , '' Rudzinski said . `` He still lost his father at the end of the day . ''

She would not say whether his son accepted the findings , saying she did not want to speak for the family .
