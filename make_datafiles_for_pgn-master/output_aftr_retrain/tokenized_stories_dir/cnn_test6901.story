-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a blog where people post , and make fun of , pictures of out-of-shape , poorly dressed and otherwise awkward people shopping at Wal-Mart .

The `` People of Walmart '' blog features photos taken by users at the mega-chain .

`` People of Wal-Mart , '' a gag started by two 20-something brothers and their buddy to share crazy pictures with their friends , has gone viral . Promoted largely on sites like Digg and Funny or Die -- and linked ad nauseam on Facebook and Twitter -- the site picked up enough traffic to crash its servers on Wednesday .

`` I 'm still baffled -- I really am , '' said Andrew Kipple , 23 , one of the creators of the site , who said his team was frantically working Wednesday to add enough server space to handle the surge in traffic .

Photos on the site , sent in by viewers all over the United States , frequently feature overweight people wearing tight clothes , bizarre hairstyles -LRB- with versions of the short-in-front , long-in-back `` mullet '' leading the pack -RRB- and fashion crimes ranging from furry leg warmers to miniskirts that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination .

Andrew and his brother Adam , 25 , said they thought of the site after a visit to a South Carolina Wal-Mart where they saw a woman they believed to be a stripper , wearing an obscene T-shirt and leading a toddler in a harness . Around the next corner was a man with a beard reminiscent of the rock band ZZ Top .

`` It 's kind of like the light bulb went off , '' Andrew said . `` We get the e-mails already from people who are like , ` Why did n't I think of this ? ' We just happened to be fortunate enough to have the ability to actually follow through on it . ''

A post on the group 's Facebook page Thursday morning said they had gotten more than 1.2 million page views on Wednesday , even though the site was down for much of the day .

The site was getting two or three photo submissions a day until last week they said -- when all of a sudden hundreds of e-mails , most with pictures , started rolling in .

The brothers say they do n't mean for their site to be mean-spirited , and that they have standards for which photos they use .

`` We 're not going to go out and say we 're not making fun of anybody or we 're the nicest guys in the world . But I think you have to draw a line somewhere when you have a site like this , '' he said .

`` If you have a mental handicap -- that 's not funny . If you have lost a leg and you 're on a crutch or in a wheelchair , some people may laugh at that , but we do n't find it funny . ''

He denied complaints that the photos -- many of which attract a string of snarky comments from readers -- single out people because they are poor or unattractive .

`` If you make a bad decision on what you 're going to be out in public wearing , that 's what we 're looking for , '' he said . `` If you 're 400 pounds , you should n't be wearing nothing but a pink tube top . Even if you shop at Goodwill , wherever you go , the shirts they sell have sleeves and they have your size . ''

Adam Kipple , who works as a Web designer for a marketing firm , said he and his brother are frequent Wal-Mart shoppers themselves and that , in a way , their site could be boon to the shopping chain .
