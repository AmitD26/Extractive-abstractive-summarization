-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- Just a two-hour detour from Paris , the Loire was once a playground to Renaissance royals . Now its vaunted châteaux are attracting enterprising young couples and artists who have remade them into captivating -- and surprisingly affordable -- inns .

Surrounded by 10-foot-high limestone walls , Le Clos d'Amboise offers an unexpected sanctuary in the town of Amboise .

`` If you 've never eaten a brioche with fresh Ste. Maure goat cheese , honey and walnuts for breakfast , then you have n't been to the Loire , '' says Laurent Dutheil , who is justifiably proud of the simple breakfasts he serves at his 23-room hotel in the western corner of the valley .

Dutheil also produces dozens of fragrant artisanal jams such as apple-lavender and quince-cinnamon . -LRB- Sadly , they are n't for sale , but you can buy Dutheil 's recipe book , `` Jam in the Cupboard . '' -RRB- The traditional foods fit well with the hotel 's venerable atmosphere : Diderot is housed in a sprawling 15th-century home that the Chinon-born Dutheil , along with his two sisters , Martine and Francoise , bought and renovated six years ago .

There are 13 guest rooms , decorated with items such as embroidered quilts and framed puzzles of boats assembled by jigsaw fanatic Véronique . Jazz enthusiasts , the Villanfins host occasional concerts featuring local groups , including Les Bras ` Coeurs , a quartet that performs Georges Brassens standards .

The soirees are held in the restaurant , known locally for its coq au vin : rooster stewed in cabernet bottled at Le Chai des Varennes winery next door .

AMBOISE

Le Clos d'Amboise

The bedrooms come equipped with decorative elements such as mahogany four-poster beds and original fireplaces , while the common room features wood floors modeled after those at the Palace of Versailles . Most of the rooms overlook the hotel 's private park , landscaped with 100-year-old magnolias and a pine tree that survived the French Revolution .

A pool by the rose garden is perfect for a cool dip after relaxing in the wood sauna , housed in a former stable . Just a 10-minute stroll from the hotel stands the riverside castle that belonged to King François I -- part medieval fortress , part Renaissance royal house . The king became famously enthralled by Leonardo da Vinci during a 1515 excursion to Italy , and he set up the painter in a gabled redbrick château -LRB- now a museum -RRB- , just down the road from his castle .

LIMERAY

Auberge de Launay

After years helping manage other people 's properties , the couple -- with their two small kids , Emma and Alexandre -- packed up their Paris apartment and bought an unassuming farmhouse in the secluded hamlet of Limeray to convert to a 15-room inn .

`` I grew up in the region , so when we made the decision to open our own place , I knew that I had to come back to the Loire , '' says François . In keeping with the spare design of the house , the decor at the Auberge is simple -- bedrooms are outfitted with neutral suede sofas , blond-wood floors and minimalist photographs of daisies and landscapes .

ONZAIN

Last year , Valois and his wife , Christine , redecorated a former gatekeeper 's house as a contemporary four-room cottage with knockoff Jackson Pollock paintings and sculptures that resemble enormous eggs .

`` My husband likes to turn things that seem ordinary into the extraordinary , '' Christine says . `` He designed a ` Sputnik ' bidet that has Japanese robots stationed around the tank . ''

He has kept the breakfast area much the way his grandmother designed it , with rustic stone walls , an ample fireplace and simple country furnishings .
