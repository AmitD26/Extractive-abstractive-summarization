-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A South Florida teenager accused of killing and mutilating 19 cats excitedly described to police how he dissected cats in class , and where to find cats for experimentation , according to police .

When Miami-Dade police told Tyler Hayes Weinman someone was killing cats in the neighborhood , the 18-year-old reacted by laughing , according to a newly released arrest affidavit made public Monday .

On Monday , Weinman pleaded not guilty to more than 40 criminal counts , including multiple charges of felony animal cruelty and burglary . He is out of jail on $ 249,500 bond and under house arrest wearing an electronic monitor , but is being held for 48 hours for a psychiatric evaluation .

The teen 's attorney David Macey said there was a `` lynch mob '' after his innocent client and accused Judge Mindy Glazer of `` prejudging '' Weinman .

`` He did not kill the cats , '' Macey told reporters outside the courtroom . `` The individual who committed this crime is still running around out there . ''

The arrest affidavit , which a judge gave prosecutors until Monday to make public , reads like a grisly horror movie and indicates Weinman was knowledgeable of and fascinated with dissection of cats .

During questioning , according to the affidavit , a detective told the teenager that police were informed he was involved in the cat slayings . Weinman replied he heard about the cats and that he told his mother . He told police that a school he had been expelled from was the only school in Miami-Dade that taught how to dissect using cats , according to the affidavit .

The teenager went on to offer several other bizarre and unsubstantiated trivia , including saying that Mexico is the only source for cats used for dissection and describing their size .

`` Weinman was asked to expound on what he meant and he repeated , with noted excitement , ` It just makes a certain sound , a tearing sound , '' says the affidavit .

Detectives stopped the teenager and told him about the dead cats . Weinman responded by laughing , according to the arrest affidavit . He was not held at that time .

In May , the teenager was pulled over for a traffic violation and police found a `` cutting instrument '' on the ground beside his car . According to the affidavit , as an officer questioned the teen , he noticed what appeared to be a cat scratch on his arm .

The teen `` was eager to show '' the scratches and took off his shirt so that photographs could be taken , according to the questioning detective 's account , which is detailed in the affidavit .

If the killer was an adult , they concluded , that person would be classified as a sociopath .

In late May , police then got a court order to place a tracking device on the Honda Civic driven by Weinman . The affidavit states the car was tracked to the latest feline victim which had been skinned along the abdomen from the pelvic area to the hind legs . The pelt and genitalia were missing .

The cat killings became headline news across the country . Around that time , Weinman joined a Facebook page called `` Catch-The-Cat-Killer . ''

The teenager is charged with 19 counts of felony animal cruelty , 19 counts of improperly disposing of an animal body and four counts of burglary . He 's pleaded not guilty to all of the charges .
