-LRB- Budget Travel -RRB- -- It 's all the rage to criticize the airlines . But we found some smart , practical initiatives that point the way to a better future .

This test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles .

Driverless pods at airports

Improved design of coach seats

Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat : As the seat reclines , the bottom slides forward , but the back stays in place . So the passenger sitting behind does n't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin . The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly . American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar , slide-forward seats .

Paperless boarding passes Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets . Now , cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports , such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles 's LAX . Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message . Security officers and gate agents scan your phone 's screen , making for an entirely paperless process . Some airlines , including American , Continental , and Delta -LRB- plus its sister unit , Northwest -RRB- , plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide .

More power -- sockets -- for the people

Sometimes it 's the simple things that count . Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight , but it did so in an especially sensible way , with standard sockets -LRB- no adapter necessary -RRB- at every seat on the plane . Because while Wi-Fi is nice -LRB- even when there 's a fee for it -RRB- , it 's even nicer to know that you wo n't run out of juice in the middle of a flight . Sockets obviously work with portable DVD players and cell phone chargers , too .

Replacements for outmoded radar-tracking systems

With most airlines , upgrading is an esoteric process that may involve loyalty program points , elite status , or just dumb luck . But when you check in at the airport for a Spirit Airlines flight , the kiosk presents a simpler formula . The screen may inform you that one of Spirit 's Big Front Seats -LRB- the carrier 's version of business class -RRB- is available for as little as $ 35 extra . The roomy seats are often dispensed on a first-come , first-served basis close to departure time . Depending on how you 're feeling that day , you may very well decide that an upgrade to a more comfortable seat is money well spent .
