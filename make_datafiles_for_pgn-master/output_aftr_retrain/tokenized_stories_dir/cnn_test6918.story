-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- U.S. President Obama sent a direct message to Iran 's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei weeks before this month 's disputed election , Iranian sources said Wednesday .

Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , calls for an end to protests last week at Tehran University .

The letter requested dialogue and engagement between the two nations , the sources said .

The White House refused to `` get into the specifics of our different ways of communicating , '' a senior Obama administration official said .

`` We have indicated a willingness to talk for a long time and have sought to communicate with the Iranians in a variety of ways , '' the official said .

Khamenei made an indirect reference to the letter in his sermon on Friday at Tehran University .

The Iranian source said the election dispute is wasting time on the issue of starting U.S.-Iranian negotiations . Watch how the reported letter is part of a new policy of engagement ''

`` The longer it is delayed , '' the source said , `` the less likely -LSB- U.S.-Iranian talks -RSB- will happen . ''

The source said he is waiting for `` real change '' even though the Iranian government welcomed the change in tone of the Obama administration before the current election turmoil in Iran . The official went on to cite a recent gesture by Iran toward Obama : the release of journalist Roxana Saberi .

The official said Iran accepted Obama 's assurances that she was not a spy and had allowed the Iranian citizen to leave the country .

Since , under intense scrutiny amid growing concerns over Tehran 's violent crackdown on street protests , Obama has sharpened his language on Iran .

The official noted that the Iranians have yet to respond to a diplomatic outreach made during talks on Iran 's nuclear program April 8 . At that time , the administration asked the European Union 's international policy chief , Javier Solana , to invite Iran to new talks with the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany .

The officials said intense discussions on the issue were taking place , but the final decision had not been made .

The Obama administration had decided to invite Iranians to the celebrations at overseas posts as part of Obama 's policy of engaging the Iranian regime .
