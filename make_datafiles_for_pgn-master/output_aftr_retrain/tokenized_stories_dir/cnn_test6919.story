LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brenda Gardenhire shows off her new home with pride . It looks like an oversized shopping cart covered with a khaki canvas . But to her , it 's `` wonderful '' -- a stepping stone to get her off the streets and get her life back in order .

Gardenhire is talking about her makeshift home called an EDAR , which stands for Everyone Deserves A Roof . The units are being distributed to homeless people in the Los Angeles area by the Everyone Deserves A Roof nonprofit organization .

It 's the brainchild of `` Revenge of the Nerds '' movie producer Peter Samuelson , who has spent much of his life working with charities to help impoverished children .

He got the idea to help the homeless in recent years as he rode his bicycle from Los Angeles to the beach at Santa Monica . Watch a canvas-covered ` home ' for the homeless ''

Samuelson said he initially wanted to build more permanent shelters for all of the homeless people in the Los Angeles area . `` But when you do the math , you 're looking at $ 3 billion to get 60,000 people off the damp concrete , and that 's just in L.A. , '' he said , explaining why he opted for the cheaper EDAR instead of permanent shelters .

He said the EDAR is n't a perfect solution , but it 's a good , economical stopgap . `` This is $ 500 to get a man or a woman or a child off the damp concrete , '' he said . `` I do n't think it 's the best . ... But for now , I think a little bit of privacy -- not being rained on , not sleeping on the ground , not getting pneumonia from the damp -- has a little bit of value . ''

Jose Font , 50 , agrees . He got an EDAR late last year . He said he 's been homeless off and on since 1979 . He slept on a tarp with a blanket and worked on computer repairs before he became one of about 60 people to get an EDAR .

`` Everybody calls it the hobo condo . Everybody envies me because I sleep on a mattress inside , '' he said . `` It makes me feel like I 've got something to come to . It feels more like a home than just a tarp and concrete . ''

Font keeps it locked to a telephone on public property when he 's away .

James Ramirez , a social worker with the Venice Community Housing Corporation , said he has been able to use the EDAR as incentive to get people 's lives back on track .

`` What we 're doing is using the EDAR as a carrot for them to come in to see us , '' Ramirez said . `` They want the EDAR because they want to keep dry when it 's raining and they want a place to stay at night that 's comfortable . So we 're using this to connect with them . ''

The EDAR organization says it 's starting with baby steps . In addition to the 60 units already given out , another 110 units have been ordered . The units are distributed to shelters , churches and other organizations that help the homeless . Those groups then distribute the units .

EDAR currently has about 30 people on a waiting list , plus another 10 shelters in the Los Angeles area . The organization is also looking at land provided by a local authority where they could let women and families stay on a site that also has functioning bathrooms .

EDAR has fielded dozens more calls from across the country and around the world about the units . Samuelson said they 're `` studying what works best '' and looking at an array of options .

`` People talk about the homeless as if it 's some homogeneous group of drunken , unemployed , too-lazy-to-get-a-job men . They 're totally wrong . They need to come meet people , '' he said . `` What 's the point in having a society if it 's devoid of helping people less fortunate ? ''

He added , `` As we raise money , we will get people off the concrete . ''
