The teen was among a group of young Somali-American men who left Minneapolis last year and were feared recruited by the extremist group , al-Shabaab , that has ties to al Qaeda , according to the U.S. State Department .

Al-Shabaab is blamed for a surge of violence in Somalia , as insurgents group fight the government to implement sharia , a stricter form of Islamic law .

Al-Shabaab , also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement , was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008 .

In October , Shirwa Ahmed , 27 , a Somali-American who had been radicalized by al-Shabaab in his adopted home state of Minnesota , traveled to Somalia and blew himself up and 29 others .

The incident , the first-ever suicide bombing by a naturalized U.S. citizen , raised red flags throughout the U.S. intelligence community .

The Somali-American population is now concentrated in clusters primarily in Minneapolis ; Columbus , Ohio ; Seattle , Washington and San Diego , California .

The potential recruitment of young Somali-American men has been made possible by `` a number of factors that come together when a dynamic , influential and extremist leader gains access to a despondent and disenfranchised group of young men , '' Andrew Liepman , deputy director for intelligence at the National Counterterrorism Center , said earlier this year .

Many refugees , he said , `` lack structure and definition in their lives '' and are `` torn between their parents ' traditional tribal and clan identities , and the new cultures and traditions offered by American society . ''
