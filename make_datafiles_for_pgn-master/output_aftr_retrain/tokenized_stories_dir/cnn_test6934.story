-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Calling the ruling `` huge , '' New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday reacted to a federal judge finding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ' failure to maintain a shipping channel led to catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Katrina .

Nagin said he hopes the court decision will `` open up the floodgates '' for others to file lawsuits against the federal government , including his Louisiana city .

However , he acknowledged it 's likely the federal government will appeal Wednesday 's ruling .

Duval issued the ruling in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane , who alleged the Corps of Engineers was liable for damages . The judge ruled against one couple , who lived in New Orleans East , but awarded the others , from the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish , damages ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 317,000 .

Nagin said he had thought the ruling was a long shot . `` This was a surprise but a pleasant one , '' he said .

The decision applies not only to the six plaintiffs , attorney Pierce O'Donnell said , but also to some 100,000 homes and businesses in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward . Under the precedent set by Duval 's ruling , they too will be entitled to compensation , O'Donnell said .

At one point a Category 5 hurricane , Katrina had weakened to a Category 3 storm with top sustained winds of 127 mph when it made landfall on the morning of August 29 , 2005 , between Grand Isle , Louisiana , and the mouth of Mississippi River . Its winds were only slightly diminished when it passed over more populated coastal areas hours later .

More than 1,800 people died in the storm , including nearly 1,600 in Louisiana . In New Orleans , the city 's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred .

Ivor van Heerden , a researcher who warned of the potential for catastrophic damage from a hurricane , said the ruling is `` total vindication for everybody who was involved . ''

He alleged Thursday that the university blocked him from being an expert witness in the case , but said he `` put together a lot of the science '' and reviewed the defense 's explanation to find the holes .

He said he intends to file a lawsuit against LSU , which he said has to pay him through the end of his contract , which ends in May .
