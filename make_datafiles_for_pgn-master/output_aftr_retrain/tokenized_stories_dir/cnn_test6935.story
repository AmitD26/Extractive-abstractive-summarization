AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as `` a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us . ''

Travelers are still concerned about the economy , said AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom , and the numbers remain well down from two years ago .

`` Clearly , there was a huge drop-off in the number of people traveling last year , '' he said . According to the association , Thanksgiving travel dropped 25.2 percent last year , compared with 2007 .

Still , Sundstrom added , `` We are encouraged that the numbers have stabilized and turning up from what they were a year ago . ''

The bulk of Thanksgiving travelers -- about 33.2 million -- will be traveling by car , AAA said .

Jennifer Burrell of Tucker , Georgia , said she , her husband and their two daughters were driving Thursday morning to the Asheville , North Carolina , area , and will return Sunday .

Citing excess baggage fees and surcharges for jet fuel , along with delays and flight groundings , Sundstrom said that it 's `` not a very friendly environment this decade for the airline industry or the airline traveler . ''

Of course , some Americans are not traveling at all .

Heather McKinnon of Broomfield , Colorado , said she is staying home with family for Thanksgiving .

`` I do n't like to fly and really rarely like flying on holidays , '' she said , adding that she would consider driving .
