During their three-hour journey winding through Napa Valley , passengers can choose from more than 100 wines to complement their meal .

The Napa Valley Wine Train has been shuttling passengers through one of the country 's most famous valleys for more than two decades , but now it 's under fire because of Republican Sens. Tom Coburn and John McCain . They ranked the wine train as No. 11 on their list of the 100 most `` wasteful '' and `` silly '' stimulus projects , leading some to call it the Stimulus Waste Express .

But CNN found that scorn undeserved . In fact , CNN confirmed that not a single stimulus dollar is being spent on the wine train itself . The stimulus money is really being used for a massive flood-control project for the valley . The train 's tracks happen to be in the way , so they have to be moved . It is a simple fix , but it 's not cheap . To make it happen , $ 54 million is being used to build a flood wall at the wine train depot , elevate the tracks and move them 33 feet , and raise four bridges .

How did the wine train end up on the list of wasteful projects ? `` The person who did the research for the senators did n't do a thorough job , '' Hilton said , `` and I think if they did a thorough job , we would n't have been on the list at all . ''

Barry Martin is the spokesman for the Napa River Flood Control Project . He called the senators ' report `` deliberate deception '' and a way to score `` political points . ''

The Army Corps of Engineers , which is overseeing the flood control initiative , said that every $ 1 million spent creates about 20 jobs but said it did n't have an exact figure of jobs for the project .

And the contractor , Suulutaaq , had reported just 12 jobs created to the White House . A spokeswoman said the company expects that 200 people will be employed over the life of the project .

`` We all have the same goal , '' she later said . `` Nobody appreciates waste . If he came out and explored this , I do n't think this would have been on the list . ''
