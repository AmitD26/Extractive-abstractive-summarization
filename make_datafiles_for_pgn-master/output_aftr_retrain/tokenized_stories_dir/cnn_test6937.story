-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Environmental saviors can turn up in the most unexpected places . For the answer to our global waste management crisis , we need only look as far as our back gardens , for example .

Forty million manure worms are being put to use in Sydney to treat its sewage .

Worms are nature 's waste disposal units . Or rather , it is more accurate to call them waste renewal units , as they do n't simply consume the waste -- they turn it into something far more useful : nutrient-rich compost .

There are a lot of them , too . You will find as many as 1 million earthworms in just 1 acre of land , according to NatureWatch , their population doubling in size every one-two months . And they work hard -- 1 million worms will get through 10 tons of leaves , stems and dead roots in one year , ploughing 40 tons of soil in the process .

What they end up producing is ready-to-go plant soluble nutrients . According to NatureWatch , earthworm castings have five times as much nitrogen , seven times as much phosphorous , 11 times as much potassium and 1,000 times more `` beneficial bacteria '' than the stuff the worm consumes in the first place . Literally speaking , what goes in is far less valuable than what comes out .

Utilizing ` black gold '

Worm compost :

Just one pound of worms can turn 1.3 million pounds of raw manure into high quality fertilizer in around 60 days , according to ScienceDaily . And plants love it . Research has shown that plant yields experience a significant boost from vermicomposting , by as much as 40 percent for broccoli , 80 percent for tomatoes and as much as 259 percent for carrots , according to The Ecologist .

According to the World Waste Survey , compiled by Veolia Environmental Services , we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004 . And a high proportion of that waste was organic matter which could have been composted . Around 32 percent of the European Union 's annual municipal waste -LRB- around 120 million tons -RRB- is food and garden waste , according to Waste Management World . And 30 percent of U.S. waste could have been composted in 2000 , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -LRB- EPA -RRB- -- representing 92 million tons of organic waste that otherwise sat rotting on a landfill , emitting methane into the atmosphere .

What Darwin , Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however , is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste .

Scientists in India have found that worms ' digestive systems and regenerative abilities are so remarkable that they can actually absorb toxic materials yet expel toxic-free manure . According to the Indian newspaper , India Together , researchers in Gujarat have found that worms can `` detox '' the organic parts of the industrial sludge which results from the effluent treatment of industrial or hazardous waste .

The method is ideal for industries -- such as paper , food processing , oil , textiles , dairy , distilleries and agro-chemicals -- where there is large enough organic components in the industrial sludge , Indian researchers say .

But even with vermicomposting , something that looks like one of the most environmentally sound ideas around , there 's a downside -- and it 's a rather large one .

It turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide . Unfortunately , in terms of greenhouse gas emissions , large-scale composting plants could be just as damaging to the environment as landfills of the same size , reports the UK 's Telegraph newspaper .
