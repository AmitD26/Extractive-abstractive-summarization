A heroin addict identified as Sarah says the program had an almost immediate affect on her life .

`` The intensity of the program is quite striking , '' said John Strang , who led the research team at Britain 's National Addiction Centre , associated with King 's College in London . `` The bond that is formed and the commitment that 's established between the patient coming in for treatment and the staff is far greater than you would ever ordinarily see . ''

The researchers reported that benefits were evident just six weeks into treatment among users who had failed at other kinds of treatment .

Sarah described how the program had an almost immediate affect on her life . She said she was able to keep a schedule , stop buying drugs on the street and gain an appreciation of what her life could be like if she was n't so consumed by getting high .

`` You 'll always be an addict basically ; it 's about managing it and leading a positive life '' said Sarah , adding , `` It quickly became , well , I actually do want to stop . I do n't really want to have to stick needles in me all my life . ''

Her biggest fear now is that the program will be cut or shut down if the government deems it too controversial .

Another patient , who asked to be identified as `` Emma , '' said , `` The morality of it was taken out of the question . I was n't being condemned for it and at last I could start taking responsibility in a rational way . ''

`` This thing that was the meaning of your life is becoming the thing that is getting in the way of your life and it becomes very unattractive , '' she said .

Strang said the stubborn nature of heroin addiction is proof that getting addicts into treatment is really a shallow achievement , because many will eventually turn to drugs again . He believes this promising approach could change the way hard-to-treat addicts are treated and convince the government that the initial high cost offers good value .

If the encouraging results continue , Britain could one day set up permanent clinics around the country , dispensing heroin for its most hard-to-treat addicts .
