He warned students that iPads , Xboxes , and other popular digital gadgets can turn information into `` a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment '' rather than a means `` of empowerment . ''

By the reaction , you would have thought our BlackBerry-toting president had called for a return to horse-drawn carriages , outhouses , and whalebone corsets .

The average American today spends more than eight hours a day peering into a screen -- TV , computer , or cell phone -- and the average teen sends or receives well over 2,000 text messages a month .

But even as we 've been enjoying the seemingly endless bounties of the net , neurobiologists and psychologists have been carrying out studies which suggest that the way we gather information online impedes comprehension , weakens understanding , and in general hinders learning .

Worse yet , the ill effects of heavy web use appear to continue to afflict us even when we turn our computers off .

The cognitive penalties can be particularly severe for students . In one revealing experiment , researchers at Cornell University divided a class into two groups . One group was allowed to use their laptop computers to surf the web during a lecture . The other group attended the same lecture but had to keep their computers closed .

Immediately afterward , the students took a test measuring how well they remembered the lecture 's content . The students who used their laptops performed significantly worse on the exam . It did n't matter , moreover , whether they surfed sites related to the subject of the lecture or unrelated sites . All the surfers performed relatively poorly .

Other researchers have found that students who read text with hyperlinks , as you routinely find online , end up with a weaker understanding of the material than students who read the same text in a traditional , linear format , as you 'd find in a printed book .

Each link appears to act as a little distraction , breaking the reader 's concentration . As the number of links mounts , comprehension diminishes further .

The multitude of messages and other bits of information that the Web fires at us , from emails to tweets to Facebook updates , have also been found to interrupt our thoughts in a way that impedes the formation of memories and the building of knowledge . The more information we juggle , the less able we are to make sense of it all .

`` Everything distracts them , '' one of the researchers said of the heavy multitaskers .

Only a curmudgeon would deny the many benefits that our computers and electronic networks have brought us . The internet and related technologies have made it much easier to stay in touch with friends and family members , to discover interesting and useful information , to express ourselves , and to collaborate with others .

The time has come for us to take a more balanced view of the net , looking at its costs as well as its benefits . That 's particularly true when it comes to educating our children . Sticking a kid in front of a computer screen is probably not the best way encourage the development of a strong , creative , and supple mind .

As President Obama implied , information should be a source not of distraction but of enlightenment .
