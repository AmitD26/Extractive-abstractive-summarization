Judge Sonia Sotomayor makes her way around Capitol Hill on Monday on crutches after breaking her ankle .

And a leading Republican , Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida , on Tuesday predicted the Senate will confirm Sotomayor .

Speaking on the Senate floor , Leahy said the July hearing date favored by President Obama would provide sufficient time for thorough examination of the federal appellate judge 's record .

Sotomayor is expected to win easy confirmation as the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and the third woman to sit on the nation 's highest court .

Martinez stopped short of endorsing her nomination , saying he wants to wait until after her confirmation hearings are held .

But he had positive things to say about her personal and judicial background and said she would `` fit in '' well on the Supreme Court .

`` For someone who is of Latin background , personally , I understand what she is trying to say . Which is , the richness of her experience forms who she is . It forms who I am , '' Martinez said .
