The desire to be female never went away . At age 48 , Madden confessed these feelings to a doctor , and started seeing a gender therapist who suggested Madden was transgendered .

Chastity Bono , child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono , announced Thursday the beginning of a transition from female to a male .

While still relatively rare -- one advocate estimates that 0.25 to 0.5 percent of the American population is transgendered -- the idea of changing gender identity has become more widespread in recent years . The term `` LGBT '' -LRB- Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual , Transgender -RRB- is more commonly recognized , and transgendered people have been portrayed in the 1999 film `` Boys Do n't Cry '' as well as the 2002 book `` Middlesex '' by Jeffrey Eugenides .

Many people who have transitioned , including Madden , say they knew they had been born into the wrong gender from childhood . As early as age 3 , Dr. Julie Praus , born male , did n't understand why her father wanted to play catch . As a boy , Praus learned how to fish and hunt , but enjoyed collecting Depression-era glassware vases . Praus , 48 , a psychiatrist in Brattleboro , Vermont , started living as a woman in March 2008 .

The process of changing genders

A therapist then gives a physician approval to start the patient on hormone treatment . At that point , the patient may or may not start living as the chosen sex , Alter said .

A higher percentage of males transitioning to females will go forward with genital surgery than females going to males , Alter said . Surgical methods for creating a penis -- which range from making one out of the clitoris to using the skin from the forearms -- are `` not perfect , '' and many patients are happy with just chest surgery , he said .

Genital surgeries for creating female genitalia are better , he said . Alter 's method is to make a clitoris out of the head of the penis , and make space for a vagina .

Facing the rest of the world

Some say changing genders is one of the best things they 've done , like Jamison Green , 60 , author of `` Becoming a Visible Man , '' who went through chest reconstruction and genital surgery .

`` I do n't have too hard of a time telling people about it , '' Green said . `` I worried about that a lot in the beginning , before there was any kind of community and support about this condition , but one of the things I learned early on was that living in fear and shame is not very healthy . ''

But all three have experienced shock and dismay from others around them . Green said his mother took five years to adjust . One of Praus ' sons does n't speak to her . Madden 's marriage to a woman ended in divorce during her transition , and her children have struggled .

Yet these three transgendered individuals say they feel better in many ways in their chosen gender roles .

Often , males who transition to females face more problems than females who become males , Kraft said . Transgendered individuals who start as men tend to face more stigma , particularly if they are more noticeably transgendered .

Transgendered individuals do face some legal quandaries . Some states require people to show proof of a medical procedure before changing gender on documents such as driver 's licenses , while others require that the person has taken hormones , Kraft said . People may also elect to change their birth certificates to reflect chosen gender .

Chastity Bono , who now goes by `` Chaz , '' has been a prominent gay-rights activist .

`` You could speculate that that could make it more complicated -- when you 're a public figure -- to take on something stigmatizing '' such as a gender transition , Kraft said .
