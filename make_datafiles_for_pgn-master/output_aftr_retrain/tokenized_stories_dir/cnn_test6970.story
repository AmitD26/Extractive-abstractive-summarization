-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn believes Michael Schumacher can show improvement when the Formula One circuit moves to China next week .

`` Achieving our first podium of the season with Nico was very rewarding in Malaysia at the home race of our title partner Petronas and a timely boost for the team , '' Brawn told F1 's official Web site .

`` We hope to continue these signs of improvement in China and it would be particularly good for Michael to be able to have a clean race and show the progress that he has made since the start of the season .

Schumacher is 10th in the drivers ' standings after finishing sixth and 10th in the first two races , while fellow German Rosberg is fifth -- four points behind overall leader Felipe Massa of Ferrari .

`` The enthusiasm for Mercedes-Benz and the support of the fans is very big in China so we have an attractive race ahead of us in Shanghai next weekend , Schumacher said .

`` I am confident that the fans will not leave the race disappointed . We looked quite reasonable in Malaysia at the last race and maybe things will play into our hands again in Shanghai . I am looking forward to the race and fully enjoying the competition again .

`` Admittedly the last two races have not been very fortunate for me , but I am very much aware of the reasons for it . I know how things go in F1 and if you look into the detail of the two races , I think everything is still going according to plan . You can only improve step by step , and I am confident that we are achieving this . ''
