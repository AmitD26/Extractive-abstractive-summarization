-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexico 's war against the drug cartels is frustrated by a risk-averse army and interagency rivalries , according to U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks . But amid some downbeat assessments of the challenges faced by President Felipe Calderon , some of the cables celebrate outstanding successes against the cartel `` capos . ''

One such success came almost exactly a year ago , when a Mexican naval unit killed one of Mexico 's leading cartel figures , Arturo Beltran Leyva -- with plenty of assistance from the United States .

The naval unit `` raided an identified location , where they killed several ABL bodyguards and arrested over 23 associates , while ABL and Hector -LSB- his brother -RSB- escaped . ''

But time was running out for Beltran Leyva -LRB- also known as El Fantasma and El Elegante -RRB- , thanks to U.S. surveillance .

Besides Beltran Leyva , at least three other cartel operatives were killed during the Dec. 16 , 2009 , raid , with a fourth committing suicide .

Some might question why the navy was involved in a land operation .

After the Beltran Leyva operation , there was glowing praise from U.S. diplomats for Mexican navy units .

There is no euphoria about Beltran Leyva 's demise , but the embassy hopes it will mark a new beginning . `` His death will not solve Mexico 's drug problem , but it will hopefully generate the momentum necessary to make sustained progress against other drug trafficking organizations . ''

`` A truly joint effort to implement a new U.S.-Mexico strategy is yielding stronger organizational structures and interagency cooperation on both sides and a deeper understanding of the threat posed by the drug trafficking organizations , '' reads one cable .

The same cable noted that the Mexican Army -LSB- SEDENA -RSB- had for the first time asked the United States for special forces training . `` We need to capitalize on these cracks in the door . Any retreat on engagement on our side will only reinforce SEDENA 's instincts to revert to a closed and unaccountable institution . ''
