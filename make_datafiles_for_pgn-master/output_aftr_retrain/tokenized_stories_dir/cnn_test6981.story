Harare , Zimbabwe -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The wife of Zimbabwe 's president has sued a Zimbabwean newspaper for $ 15 million following its publication of allegations that she was linked to and profited from illegal diamond sales in the southern African country .

According to papers filed at the High Court in Harare Wednesday , Grace Mugabe , the wife of President Robert Mugabe , is suing The Standard for defamation after its report based on diplomatic cables released by the website WikiLeaks .

`` The diamonds that are sold to regime members and elites are sold for freshly printed Zimbabwean notes issued by the RBZ -LRB- Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe -RRB- , '' the paper quoted a 2008 cable as saying .

`` The cables suggested that -LRB- the head of the bank , Gideon -RRB- Gono kept the money printing press running to finance the purchase of diamonds and this could have accelerated hyperinflation , which eventually rendered the Zimbabwe dollar worthless , '' the newspaper charged .

The documents said the newspaper wrongly suggested that Grace Mugabe had `` used her position as the First Lady to access diamonds clandestinely , enriching herself in circumstances in which the country was facing serious foreign currency shortages , which amounts should have been channeled to the fiscus .

`` The imputation of such conduct on a person of such high standing , the mother of the nation , is to lower the respect with which she is held by all right thinking persons , to a point of disappearance , '' the lawsuit said .

`` But looking at most of the claims , so far , I can say they are just meant to harass the press , '' he said .
