A reporter in this port city said businesses appeared open as usual , despite Alassane Ouattara 's call over the weekend for the strike to force incumbent Laurent Gbagbo from power after his apparent loss in the November 28 presidential runoff .

Ouattara 's demand came amid mounting international pressure on Gbagbo to step down .

In Paris , French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero told reporters Monday that the ministry had received an official request from Ouattara 's backers to put his ambassador into place , and was reviewing the person 's credentials .

The Ivory Coast has been paralyzed by the political stalemate , and scores of people have died in related violence . International powers , including the United States , the United Nations and the African Union , have recognized Ouattara as the winner and urged Gbagbo to cede power .

About 14,000 Ivory Coast residents escaping the instability and violence have fled to eastern Liberia , according to the U.N. refugee agency .

Sixty-two percent of the refugees are children and 55 percent are female , Liberia 's representative to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees , Ibrahima Coly , told CNN on Monday .

`` So far , the Liberian population has welcomed these people in a very warm way and they are sharing whatever they have , '' he said from Monrovia .

In general , the refugees are `` physically OK , '' he said . `` We have come across a few people who have their feet swollen because they have been walking for more than two or three days before reaching the border . We have seen also some kids who look a bit tired or malnourished , but these are really a limited number so far . ''

She added that the actual numbers may be higher since restrictions on movement by U.N. personnel have made it `` impossible to investigate all the allegations of serious human rights violations , including reports of mass graves . ''

Journalist Eric Agnero in Abidjan , CNN 's Niki Cook in Paris and CNN 's Tom Watkins contributed to this story .
