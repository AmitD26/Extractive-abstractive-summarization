The `` Red Knights '' consortium , made up of wealthy businessmen , has employed Japanese investment bank Nomura to help with its $ 1 billion move for the club , currently owned by the American Glazer family .

The Knights say Nomura will now work closely with the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust -LRB- MUST -RRB- and other potential investors to `` coordinate and formulate the proposal to be put to the Glazer family , '' according to a statement .

The Glazers have been criticized for the levels of debt at the current English champions , with the latest accounts showing that United are more than $ 1 billion in the red . The owners recently launched a bond issue to raise $ 750 million to reduce the debt . They also own NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers .

The Red Knights ' announcement comes just hours after the most vocal protest yet from Manchester United supporters against the Glazer family , during Wednesday 's European Champions League last 16 victory over AC Milan .

The club 's chief executive , David Gill , told a football conference last week that the Glazers were not interested in selling the club . Nevertheless the Red Knights are pressing ahead .

`` Nomura will work closely with the Red Knights , MUST and other potential investors to co-ordinate and formulate the proposal to be put to the Glazer family .

`` Nomura is beginning its role by contacting the many expressions of financial support the Red Knights have received to date . ''
