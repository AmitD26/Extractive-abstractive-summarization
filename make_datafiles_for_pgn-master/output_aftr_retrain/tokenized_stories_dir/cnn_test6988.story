Marriott 's TownePlace suite

`` Whereas before a lot of services were designed from the inside out , now , because consumers are so much more empowered , they are having to think about designing from the outside in , '' says Fran Samalionis , global practice leader for service design and innovation at IDEO . `` They have to think much more about the customer experience and then figure out how to make sense of that for the business . ''

A case in point is Marriott 's TownePlace Suites . The hotel chain approached IDEO for ideas about how to launch an extended-stay brand . IDEO followed guests and employees around , monitoring their habits and probing them with questions about every aspect of their experience at Marriott 's hotels . Their conversations taught them that extended-stay guests were mainly on the road because of work commitments ; they were away from home through necessity rather than choice and therefore wanted an experience from a hotel that was closer to what they were accustomed to at home -- a `` home from home . ''

Market research is not a new concept . Organizations have been bringing their potential customers together for decades to understand what they want from their services . But Samalionis argues that it is by sending its cohorts into the field to observe customers in their natural environments that IDEO gains the real insights and results .

Such was the case when IDEO worked with Bank of America to develop a new credit card . The card was targeted at young mothers and IDEO 's observation team set about following a selection of moms around as they went about their daily business : taking their children to school , shopping , even balancing their checkbooks .

They discovered that many people round up their transactions to the nearest whole number for speed and convenience . At the same time , many of the moms were struggling with the discipline of saving , even though they wanted to .

The solution IDEO came up with was to introduce a credit card , `` Keep The Change , '' which would instantly transfer the amount customers would usually round up into a separate savings account . Samalionis argues that this is an excellent example of where in-field research ultimately inspired an idea that could be transposed to a real-world scheme .

`` It 's not enough going out into the world and coming up with a point of view about that world , '' she says .

Ultimately , the effectiveness of an approach can be best measured by its financial returns . Bank of America 's `` Keep The Change '' credit card scheme generated 2.5 million new , and presumably happy , customers .

This willingness by designers to open themselves up to public consultation is becoming increasingly popular . In England , Bath 's Theatre Royal took opinions into consideration from a panel of local schoolchildren when designing their new children 's theatre , The Egg . A panel of nine - to eighteen-year-olds even had a say in the choice of architect and the menu for the cafe .

Innovations derived from the consultation include knee-high glass panels on the doors so that smaller theater-goers can see where they are going and a sound-proofed room so that parents with crying babies can sit and watch the show without disturbing the rest of the audience .

In Italy , car maker Fiat opened itself up for suggestions from the public during the design of its relaunched Fiat 500 . Under the project title `` 500 Wants You , '' the hitherto inward-looking manufacturer invited ordinary people to submit ideas for designs on its Web site .

IDEO , and other design firms like it , are changing the way large organizations interact with their customers . They are learning about new ways to keep consumers satisfied , and boosting their bank balances in the process . But in the end it 's the consumer who is profiting the most from this new approach .
