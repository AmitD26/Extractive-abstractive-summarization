-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S Army has granted a member of a religious minority permission to keep his turban , beard and uncut hair while he serves in the military , the Pentagon and a group representing him said .

Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi , a doctor , is a Sikh , a faith that calls on its adherents not to shave or cut their hair .

Kalsi filed a request in the spring for an accommodation to follow the principles of his religion . This month the Army granted his request , the Sikh Coalition told CNN . The Pentagon public affairs office later confirmed that Kalsi would be allowed to keep his turban , beard and uncut hair .

The civil rights group hailed the move as `` a major step toward ending a 23-year-old policy that excludes Sikhs from service . ''

Kalsi said he was `` overjoyed . ''

But the Sikh Coalition provided what it said was a copy of the letter from the Army .

Maj. Gen. Gina Farrisee said in the letter that Kalsi 's `` beard , uncut hair , and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times . ''

Kalsi is not the only Sikh asking permission to keep his hair , beard and turban while serving in the Army . Capt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan , a dentist , applied at the same time as Kalsi . His case has been deferred until he receives the results of his dental board examinations , the Sikh Coalition told CNN .

Both were scheduled to report for active duty in July .

Amardeep Singh , the head of the Sikh Coalition , told CNN in the spring that the issue affects observant Sikhs , not those Sikh-Americans who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair .

The issue is important for the roughly 500,000-strong American Sikh community , Singh said .

Sikhs faced hostility after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , when people associated them with al Qaeda terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants ' appearance . The Sikh religion was founded in India .

`` These kids are being harassed in New York . It 's Queens , the most diverse county in the United States . If this is happening in Queens , it 's happening in other parts of the country . ''

So , he said , the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Army sends the opposite message -- `` that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country . ''

CNN 's Joe Sterling in Atlanta , Georgia , contributed to this report .
