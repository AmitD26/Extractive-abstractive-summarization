AIDS experts in the region say that access to health care , especially when it comes to screening , is a major problem in rural communities .

`` If you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card , the South is the worst , '' she said .

It is also difficult to get HIV education to people in rural areas , he said .

Of the 29 states reporting county-level data for the National HIV/AIDS Atlas , Georgia had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of HIV and AIDS prevalence .

Although this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment , Georgia ranked fifth in reporting of new AIDS cases in 2007 , behind Texas -LRB- fourth -RRB- , Florida -LRB- third -RRB- , New York -LRB- second -RRB- and California -LRB- first -RRB- , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .

`` Not knowing one 's HIV status endangers one 's health and the health of one 's sexual partners . By getting tested for the virus and learning one 's HIV status soon after infection , treatment can begin early , substantially delaying the development of HIV-related illness and prolonging life , '' said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health .

The National HIV/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States . The map , a project of the National Minority Quality Forum , encompasses all 50 states , the District of Columbia , Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands .

The more red a region appears , the greater the prevalence , which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time .

Users can look at rates of disease by gender , race/ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available . The map also has different settings for HIV and AIDS , the more severe illness caused by the HIV virus . They can also zoom into counties and , for New York City only , ZIP codes .

About 33 million people have HIV/AIDS worldwide as of 2007 , according to the World Health Organization . The CDC estimates that 1.1 million Americans have HIV and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the United States in 2006 . Nearly 75 percent of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males .

`` Being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the HIV epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the U.S. , '' said Patrick Sullivan , associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University , who collaborated on the atlas .

Demographics and county-level data are not available for some states , or parts of some states , because of the way these places report data by region , researchers said . These areas appear as gray when users zoom in . Some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low .

The atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006 , the most recent available . Collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available .

The atlas , which launched Monday morning , had about 100,000 visitors by Tuesday afternoon , and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time , said Gary Puckrein , executive director of the atlas project .
