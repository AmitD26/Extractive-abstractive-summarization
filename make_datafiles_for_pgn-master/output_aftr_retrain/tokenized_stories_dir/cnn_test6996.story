Abidjan , Ivory Coast -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan , Ivory Coast , where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week .

Violence sharply escalated over the last week in Ivory Coast 's commercial capital Abidjan and spread to the political capital Yamoussoukro as well as the west of the country , putting more refugees and displaced people on the roads . The government imposed a curfew from Friday to Monday morning .

The violence rose sharply mid-week after a mission of four African heads of state , mandated by the African Union to find a `` binding solution '' to the Ivorian post electoral crisis , left Abidjan .

Emanuel Djaman , a teacher in Abidjan , said he saw several bodies lying on the ground when he was leaving his school after it was shut down because of the fighting . Other witnesses fleeing the area reported heavy fighting and casualties .

The conflict was set off in November after a run-off presidential election between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and challenger Alassane Ouattara -- an election in which both men claimed victory . An independent electoral commission declared Ouattara the winner of the election , but Gbagbo has refused to step aside .

Earlier Friday , during a rally in Abidjan , Gbagbo 's minister of youth , Ble Goude , called on young supporters of the incumbent `` to organize committees to impede by any means the movements of U.N. forces around the country . '' He also told the youth to get ready to liberate `` the Golf Hotel in one week from now . ''

Earlier this week , government spokesman Ahoua don Mello alleged that the pro-Ouattara forces were engaged in `` a revolution with the help of UN forces . ''

U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure denied the allegations in a telephone interview .

The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002 .

More than 33,000 people have fled to neighboring Liberia since the crisis began ; 20,000 more have been internally displaced , according to the United Nations .
