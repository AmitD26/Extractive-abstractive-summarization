-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United Nations on Monday accused Belarus of defying an arms embargo against Ivory Coast by delivering three attack helicopters to the disputed president of the West African nation .

U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said Monday afternoon that U.N. officials on the ground in Ivory Coast were unable to confirm whether the delivery was made , saying they were forced to withdraw from the airport before they were able to verify the report .

U.N. officials later said that the team sent to investigate the possible breach of sanctions was fired upon Monday by local security forces in the Ivory Coast .

The deliveries violate an arms embargo that has been in place since 2004 , Ban 's spokesman said .

Andrei Savinykh , a spokesman for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry , vehemently denied the allegation , calling it part of a campaign of `` lies and slander '' against Belarus .

A `` destructive information attack is being carried out '' against Belarus , said Savinykh , according to the Belarus state-run Belta news agency .

Violence in Ivory Coast escalated sharply over the past week , after four African heads of state left Abidjan . They had been given a mandate by the African Union to find a `` binding solution '' to the post-election crisis in Ivory Coast .

Gbagbo and Ouattara supporters have clashed in the central cities , Yamoussoukro and Daoukro , in addition to ongoing fighting in Abidjan .
