First Up : Afghanistan Violence

AZUZ : First up , violence in Afghanistan , where a gunfight broke out at an air force compound in Kabul . Eight U.S. service members and an American contractor were killed in the shooting Wednesday . Coalition officials said an Afghan military pilot started the gunfight . The Taliban said it 's responsible for yesterday 's shooting . The Taliban is the group that the U.S.-led coalition removed from power when the Afghanistan war started in 2001 . A Taliban spokesman said the group had worked with the shooter . But coalition authorities -- and the shooter 's brother -- denied that . The shooting happened at the North Kabul International Airport . Officials say it started as an argument between the Afghan pilot and an international colleague . That argument led to the gunfight .

Obama Birth Certificate

AZUZ : That was n't the only announcement at the White House yesterday . President Obama publicly showed off his birth certificate , which says that he was born in Honolulu , Hawaii . Okay . Why ? Well , there are two requirements to be U.S. president . You have to be at least 35 years old , and you have to be a `` natural born '' citizen . Some people had doubts that President Obama was born in the U.S. . They wanted to see this : his long-form birth certificate . Because without that proof , their argument was that he might be constitutionally ineligible to be president . This issue 's gotten a lot of attention in the media recently . The White House released the birth certificate yesterday to try to put an end to the questions .

Gas Prices , Oil Profits

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-

UNIDENTIFIED MALE : There 's no reason for the price to continue to go up , because there 's lots of gas . I mean , lots of oil , I hear .

SYLVESTER : Average price for regular gasoline is $ 3.87 a gallon . But in cities like Washington , D.C. , gas at some stations is already at the $ 5 mark or higher . Those prices are expected to contribute to huge first-quarter profits for oil companies . On top of the mega-profits , the oil industry enjoys $ 4 billion in federal tax breaks . There 's now a growing chorus to end those subsidies .

FADEL GHEIT , FINANCIAL ANALYST , OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY : The oil companies do not need subsidies , especially when you have $ 100 oil . It 's outrageous for an oil company or oil lobbyist to ask for a subsidy when you have this high level of profitability .

RAYOLA DOUGHER , ECONOMIC ADVISER , AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE : And at the end of the day , the final earnings , the profits to these companies , broadly go to tens of millions of Americans . Anybody with a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- , a pension plan , retired firefighters , teachers . These are the folks that , at the end of the day , benefit from these earnings . About 98.5 percent of the stock of these companies is broadly owned by the American people .

Do n't Fail Me Preview

AZUZ : CNN 's `` In America '' series explores different aspects of U.S. society . The newest documentary we worked on focuses on something you are all very familiar with : education . I had the chance to sit down recently with CNN 's Soledad O'Brien . She 's the correspondent for the `` In America '' programs , and we talked about what this new program is all about .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-

SOLEDAD O'BRIEN , CNN ANCHOR , SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT : It really is an `` Education in America '' series . `` Do n't Fail Me '' is the story of three students who represent different geographical and also socio-economical areas in the United States . And what we wanted to look at in that particular title was really the position students , American students , are in today .

You know , American students rank 17th and 25 in math and science , respectively , in this country , when you look at all industrialized nations . Those are terrible , terrible , terrible statistics . And so , the question was : How do you change that ? How do you move the United States back up to number one , where we used to be several decades ago ?

The question is really these three students , who are great students , ambitious students , motivated students . Who , their plea is very much `` do n't fail me . '' Sometimes teachers fail students , sometimes systems fail students , sometimes students fail themselves ; they 're not ambitious . In this particular case , we 're looking at the entire educational system . Is it failing these young people ?
