-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japan 's national soccer team will not play as a guest nation at the Copa America tournament in Argentina after failing to secure the release of the earthquake-hit country 's Europe-based players .

The J-League has been so badly disrupted by the March 11 disaster that domestic clubs will not allow players to travel to South America .

JFA technical director Hiromi Hara met with officials at 11 clubs , but was told that they could not release the players because next season will start earlier than usual due to the mid-2012 staging of the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine .

`` Many of our players have become top players at these clubs , and that is something to be pleased about , '' Hara said .

`` Club officials told me they would understand if this was the Asian Cup or a one-off charity match , but they had a problem with it being the Copa America . ''

The JFA has made alternative plans to prepare for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers in September .

Japan won the 2011 Asian Cup in Qatar in January , beating Australia in the final under the guidance of coach Alberto Zaccheroni .

`` This year has turned to be an exceptional year following the East Japan disaster , and we have been put into a situation where we have had to make a difficult decision , '' the Italian said .

`` However , we would like to move on to set our full focus on our preparations for our important World Cup qualifiers . ''
