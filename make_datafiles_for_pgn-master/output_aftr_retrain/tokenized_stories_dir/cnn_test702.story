Lt. Cason Shrode said that in less than two minutes , his team 's generator was hit and they were out of power .

`` They were under heavy enemy contact , '' Sgt. Jayson Souter said , describing the October 3 attack that pinned his comrades at Combat Outpost Keating , a remote base in Nuristan province .

Four servicemen -- Souter , a fellow soldier , an Apache helicopter pilot , and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the Keating attack in an interview posted by the Department of Defense on Facebook and NATO 's International Security Assistance Force YouTube Channel .

The battle started early on October 3 and lasted for 12 hours . At the end , eight American soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed and buildings at the outpost were destroyed .

`` We started receiving a heavy volley of fire . Probably 90 seconds into the fight they ended up hitting one of our generators so we lost all power , '' Shrode said in the interview posted online by the Defense Department . `` At that point I knew that this was something bigger than normal . ''

Troops called in air support . Helicopter gunner Chad Bardwell said he had to confirm the fighters he saw on ridgelines were the enemy because he had never seen such a large group of insurgents .

Chief Warrant Officer Ross Lewallen , the Apache pilot , said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a `` time-consuming endeavor '' governed by tough terrain . He said the morning battle was `` significant , '' but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons .

`` There 's a lot of cover so you really ca n't detect the enemy until they start moving again , '' he said , adding that it was tough for medical evacuation aircraft to land `` because we were still trying to control '' the outpost .

The intense assault on Keating led to fires . There were five main buildings at the post and four of them burned . Soldiers eventually ended up going into one building .

`` The next morning it was pretty much ash besides that one building . I mean that 's the way to describe it . Most of it had burned down . So we were pretty much at one building and the rest was just a shadow of what it used to be , '' Shrode said in the Defense Department interview .

He disputed media reports suggesting that there were n't enough weapons and troops . He said 40 minutes into the fight , air power arrived .

`` We had everything we needed . It was just a big attack with a lot of people . Bad things happen -- but I think we did well , under the circumstances . ''

Reflecting on the fight , Souter said , `` Everybody basically came together and in the mix of it all , they were donating blood for the wounded that we had . They all pulled together to make sure that we can pull our boys out of this . ''
