-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Stringent restrictions remain in place Monday on about 100 soldiers at a large military base in Washington state after the theft of `` sensitive '' and valuable `` military-grade '' equipment .

`` There are no weapons , and there 's no danger to the public , '' Ophardt said .

After learning of the thefts , the Army decided on Wednesday to put members of the Army 's 4th Brigade , 2nd Infantry Division on lockdown , preventing soldiers from making phone calls or leaving the unit 's barracks or unit office .

The unit has been home from Iraq since September 2010 .

These measures were relaxed somewhat on Saturday , with some supervised visits allowed on a case-by-case basis to deal with personal issues and permission granted to eat at the base 's dining facility . Division members , who live either on or off the base , still must sleep at the barracks .

There is no timetable as to when all the restrictions will be lifted , Ophardt said , adding that decision will depend on the investigation .

Military officials did their monthly inventory of the vault in December . They then did another after the holiday vacation and determined that `` large amounts '' of items were missing -- `` immediately '' precipitating the lockdown , said Ophardt .

A $ 10,000 reward has been offered by the Army in the case .

`` There are a zillion possibilities , '' Ophardt said of what might have happened .
