-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Good things come to those who wait .

Reminiscent of `` Desperate Housewives '' in its less desperate heyday , `` GCB '' follows Amanda Vaughn -LRB- Leslie Bibb -RRB- , a woman who ruled in high school but has since been humbled by life when her marriage ends in scandal and she has to return home to Dallas .

Unfortunately for Amanda , a mother of two , her former `` frenemies '' - turned-socialites and their husbands have n't quite evolved , and they do everything they can to make her life miserable . Emmy - and Tony-winning actress Kristin Chenoweth stars as one of Amanda 's rivals , and Annie Potts steals scenes as Amanda 's meddlesome mother . The show is based on a best-selling book from Kim Gatlin .

NBC 's `` 30 Rock '' is returning at 8 p.m. ET Thursday for a sixth season , TNT 's gritty cop drama `` Southland '' will be back at 10 p.m. ET January 17 for a fourth season , and the 11th season of `` American Idol '' resumes at 8 p.m. ET January 18 and 19 on Fox .
