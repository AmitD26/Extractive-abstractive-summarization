London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Don McCullin is best known for the unwavering gaze of his war photography .

And yet , as enduring as these images are , forgetting them is exactly what McCullin now wants to do . `` That war stuff ... I do n't even want to print it anymore , '' he says . `` I want to put it right out of my mind . ''

But , along with his photos of poverty , `` that war stuff '' has won McCullin a handful of photography awards and filled tens of books and exhibitions across the world , including his latest , `` Shaped by War , '' which opened Friday at the Imperial War Museum in London .

How he made it home alive is another matter . As McCullin himself admits : `` You ca n't learn about survival after a certain point . After that , it 's sheer luck really . ''

Shell shock in Vietnam

In 1968 , one of McCullin 's greatest moments of `` bottle '' produced arguably his most celebrated image : A shell-shocked soldier in Vietnam that he photographed during a huge battle for the ancient city of Hue .

He said : `` When you saw those napalm tumbling , carrying molten death , you 'd say to yourself , ` Keep going . Keep going . Keep going . '' And he did , staying with the 5th Marine Regiment for the duration of the battle , during which time , he says , they lost 70 men and 300 wounded .

McCullin came away having taken some of the most powerful photographs of his career -- but he was left suffering combat stress , much like the soldier in his photograph .

A personal battle

McCullin himself says he was `` completely insane , '' by the end of the battle . When he finally got back to the press center and changed and showered , he realised some remnants of that fight would be harder to get rid of .

McCullin has spent many years battling the psychological after effects of war , trying to balance the quest for excellence in his work with the horrors he 's witnessed .

`` It really messes you up , '' he said . `` It 's incomprehensible the way human beings can slaughter each other in front of you . And you take it home with you . And it 's like you have n't cleaned your teeth in several months , it leaves a bad taste in your mouth . ''

McCullin 's gentle approach

That empathy comes through in his gentle approach to the victims he photographed .

`` I was very gentle with people . I would come to people that were injured and try to get their consent , '' he says . `` I would not be brash the way I 've seen lots of journalists operating ... pushing and shoving and having fist fights in front of victims .

`` I would seek out the chance to take my photographs and I would look at the person I was photographing and try to convey my disgust to them and I would try to bring them to me in a trusting way . ''

`` People say my landscapes look like war scenes because I do -LRB- print -RRB- them very dark , '' he admits . `` But , you know , I suppose the darkness is in me , really . ''

Last year , he also published `` Southern Frontiers , '' a book of photographs of Roman ruins in the Middle East and North Africa .

It was inspired , he says , by a spur-of-the-moment trip to Algiers many years ago with travel writer Bruce Chatwin . They journeyed around and found themselves , to their surprise , in a Roman town `` with these great slabs of granite as roadways . ''

He 's stored the memory ever since and when he wanted to do one more project and `` totally get away from war '' it fitted . Of course , he says , the irony is that today war would have stopped him from going to some of the places in the book .

Searching for peace

Mainly , though , McCullin 's current quest is for peace of mind . He 'll never forget the wars he 's witnessed -- `` It took me all my life to try and understand , you know , why do people do this to each other and I still have n't come to any conclusions about it '' -- but they do n't haunt him they way they used to .

A far cry from the macho war photographer image , McCullin says the thing that gave him the most joy recently was coming home after a holiday and picking some blackberries in the field behind his house .

`` I felt real human freedom , '' he said . `` Just having the choice of going and picking those blackberries and ambling home and washing them .

`` I 've got a last chapter of my life and I want it to be enjoyable . I do n't want to be persecuted by myself anymore , by my guilt anymore -- I 've had all that . ''
