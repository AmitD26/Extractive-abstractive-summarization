-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The US has slapped sanctions on three firms including a major Chinese oil trader for selling refined oil products to Iran , just days after US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner travelled to Beijing to press for Chinese support on Iran sanctions .

The US State Department announced late Thursday night that penalties would be imposed on China 's Zhuhai Zhenrong , the Singapore-based oil trader Kuo oil , and the UAE-based independent oil trader FAL .

A spokesperson for Zhuhai Zhenrong said the company had not sold gasoline to Iran . `` We 've never exported a barrel , not even a wee bit of refined fuel to Iran , '' said Zheng Mei , director of the public affairs department .

According to the statement , the three firms violated US restrictions on supplying Iran with refined oil products that were passed in 2010 . `` Under the sanctions imposed today , all three companies are barred from receiving US export licenses , US Export Import Bank financing , and loans over $ 10m from US financial institutions , '' the US State Department said .

China supported the most recent United Nations sanctions resolution on Iran in 2010 , and some analysts believe that in exchange for that support the US may have turned a blind eye to Chinese companies which may have violated US laws . Last year the US placed sanctions on seven companies for selling refined oil products to Iran , but none of those were Chinese .

Zhuhai Zhenrong is a state-owned oil trader based in Southern China . The company has a special mandate from the State Council to do crude trades that offset military trade debt with Middle Eastern countries , according to their website .

Ms Zheng , the spokesperson for Zhenrong , said the company would continue buying Iranian crude . `` Zhuhai Zhenrong 's trade with Iran is carried out under the two governments . The trade accords with international law and Chinese laws and regulations , '' she said .

The US State Department said Zhuhai Zhenrong is Iran 's largest supplier of refined oil products , brokering sales of gasoline worth more than $ 500m between July 2010 and January 2011 .
