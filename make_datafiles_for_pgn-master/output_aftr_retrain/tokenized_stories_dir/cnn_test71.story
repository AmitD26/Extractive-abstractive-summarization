LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The last living survivor of the Titanic earned only a small fraction of what auctioneers hoped to raise when she sold her final remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills .

Millvina Dean , 97 , was trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers .

The 17 items belonging to 97-year-old Millvina Dean sold for about $ 8,000 on Saturday , according to auctioneer Alan Aldridge -- not enough to pay for two months at her nursing home .

`` A young man bought the canvas bag for £ 1,500 -LRB- $ 2,200 -RRB- and donated it back to Millvina , '' Aldridge said . He did not reveal the buyer 's identity .

The canvas bag might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship , Aldridge said .

`` Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia , the rescue ship , in a mail sack , '' Aldridge said . After her rescue , Dean , her mother and brother returned to England with a canvas sack , among other possessions .

It was the second auction in less than a year at Henry Aldridge & Son for Dean , who was a 9-week-old baby when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912 .

Aldridge said before the sale he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible .

Dean 's previous sale , in October , raised just over £ 30,000 , Aldridge said .

`` There are cousins but there is no one directly to support her , '' Aldridge said . `` The property she lived in -LRB- before she moved to the nursing home -RRB- was not hers . She 's just an ordinary little old lady .

Dean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection , Aldridge said .

The auction included 17 items from her collection -- most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her , but not from the ship itself .

The letters include descriptions of her family 's trip to board the Titanic and the immediate aftermath of the sinking . Dainton-West , who was 10 months old when the ship went down , died in October 2007 , the auctioneer said .
