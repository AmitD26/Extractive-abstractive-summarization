-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An icy asteroid orbiting the sun between Mars and Saturn is adding credence to theories that Earth 's water was delivered from space , according to a report published in the new issue of the science journal Nature .

`` Astronomers have looked at dozens of asteroids with this technique , but this is the first time we 've seen ice on the surface and organics , '' astronomer Andrew Rivkin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Maryland , told Nature.com .

The findings on 24 Themis lend weight to the idea that asteroids and comets are the source of Earth 's water and organic material .

Geochemists believe that early Earth went through a molten phase that would have removed any organic molecules , meaning any new organic material would have had to come to the planet at a later time , said Humberto Campins at UCF .

`` I believe our findings are linked to the origin of life on Earth , '' he added .

Scientists now plan to scan the asteroid belt for more evidence of water and organic materials , hoping to determine if 24 Themis is just an interloper -- possibly a comet that got caught in the asteroid belt -- or the first of many water-bearing asteroids that will change the way astronomers look at the solar system .

Asteroids were once thought not to contain water because they were too close to sun
