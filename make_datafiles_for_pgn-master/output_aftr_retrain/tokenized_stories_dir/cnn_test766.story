-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jacob Zuma insists the World Cup has already brought South Africa closer together , five days before the tournament begins .

The South African president says football fervor has gripped the nation ahead of the opening on game on Friday , which sees South Africa take on Mexico at the Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg .

`` The enthusiasm , joy and excitement that has engulfed the entire nation in recent weeks has not been witnessed since president Nelson Mandela was released from prison -LSB- in 1990 -RSB- , '' Zuma told a press conference .

`` The South African flag has become the most popular item on the shopping list of South Africans and this augurs well for our nation-building . ''

The build-up to the World Cup has been dominated by speculation that the host stadiums may not be completed in time , or that the necessary infrastructure may not be in place , but Zuma has declared the country ready to host one of the world 's biggest sporting events .

`` At this point it is proper for me to acknowledge and thank our founding president and icon , Nelson Mandela , for his visionary leadership and statesmanship , '' said Zuma .

`` If he did not appear , we would understand . If he is there , it will be a bonus for this tournament . We wish he would be there . ''
