Richard Holbrooke 's ` bombs for peace ' policy was vindicated when bombings brought an end to the war .

Three years later , he would become one of the most influential U.S. figures working to end a war that had introduced a new euphemism for genocide : ethnic cleansing .

Holbrooke , who had worked as a diplomat , journalist and investment banker , was intrigued , disgusted and challenged by what he saw in the early days of the war in Bosnia .

Returning with CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour in 2008 , Holbrooke remembered feeling the connection with his own family history : His Jewish grandfather fled Germany shortly after Hitler took power .

`` I thought I 'm seeing a color remake of the black and white scenes we 'd seen in World War II of Jews signing away their property at the point of a gun and then being shipped off to who knows where , '' Holbrooke said .

`` I do n't think you have to be Jewish to understand that what you 're seeing was a genuine crime against humanity . The Europeans were doing nothing , and the Americans were doing less . '' Watch as Holbrooke talks with CNN 's Christiane Amanpour at the scene of the crime ''

Holbrooke , who had served President Jimmy Carter as an assistant secretary of state , offered his recommendation to Bill Clinton 's advisers during the 1992 presidential campaign : Direct use of force against the Bosnian Serbs .

`` I took a stand that I believed was correct , '' Holbrooke said . `` I did n't think it was so controversial . ''

When Clinton embraced a get-tough policy , Holbrooke was optimistic . In the back of Holbrooke 's mind , there was a lingering question : `` Will he do as president what he said he would do as a candidate ? '' Watch Clinton 's campaign pledge ''

Holbrooke wanted to handle Bosnia for the Clinton administration . But after the election , Holbrooke -- the consummate insider -- found himself on the outside . Instead of getting the Bosnia portfolio , he was named U.S. ambassador to Germany .

`` By advocating vigorous action -LSB- in Bosnia -RSB- , I was kind of marginalized by people inside the government who were less in favor of vigorous action , '' he told Amanpour .

Clinton 's national security adviser , Anthony Lake , told CNN that the Europeans `` were , to put it mildly , extremely reluctant to see us pursue unilaterally any actions which could imperil their troops . ''

Lake said the president 's hands were tied . `` We tried to convince them . And the Europeans said , ` Absolutely no . ' ''

Under mounting criticism in the press , Clinton asked Holbrooke in May 1994 to leave his post in Germany and return to the White House to help with Bosnia .

But Holbrooke and others in the administration who advocated force would nonetheless see Bosnia 's Muslims endure another 15 months of heartbreak and death -- including the slaughter of 8,000 at Srebrenica .

`` I do n't like to advocate the use of force , -LSB- because -RSB- I know people will get killed , '' Holbrooke said . `` But there are times when you have to use force in order to stop people from being killed in larger numbers , and it seemed to me this was a clear-cut example . ''
