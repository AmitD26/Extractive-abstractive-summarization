-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre will meet this week with an NFL official as part of the league 's investigation into allegations that he sent sexually explicit messages to women , an NFL spokesman said Monday .

Aiello said the meeting with Favre would not include Commissioner Roger Goodell , but the spokesman would not divulge with whom or where the meeting was to take place . `` We do n't generally provide these kind of details , '' Aiello said .

Asked Sunday what he expects to come out of the meeting , Favre said , `` I do n't expect anything . As I said last week , during the week , tonight , I 'm concerned about the next game . I 'll let that take its course . ''

The claims were first published by the sports website Deadspin.com , which has posted nude pictures , text and voice messages it alleges he sent to a model and former television host who worked for the New York Jets in 2008 .

The Jets have given National Football League officials all the information they have regarding the incident , a team spokesman said last week .

Deadspin first reported in August that Favre sent text messages , left voice mails and sent pictures of himself naked from the waist down to Jenn Sterger , who worked as a sideline personality and host for the Jets at the time . It also published what it said were excerpts from the messages .

Afterward , Deadspin reported that a second woman had come forward to allege that she had received other lewd messages from the quarterback and that a third woman , whom the site did not identify , had received similar messages .

The site reported the two women were massage therapists hired by the Jets and identified them only by pseudonyms .

Derris said the therapists were hired for two days in the team 's 2008 training camp and would not confirm whether they had any direct contact with Favre .
