-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wright County Egg , one of two Iowa farms at the center of this past summer 's salmonella outbreak and massive egg recall , won federal approval Tuesday to sell to consumers eggs produced at two henhouses .

`` During the outbreak , I said that FDA would not agree to the sale of eggs to consumers from Wright County Egg until we had confidence that they could be shipped and consumed safely , '' said Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement . `` After four months of intensive work by the company and oversight , testing , and inspections by FDA , I am satisfied that time has come . ''

The outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis sickened more than 1,600 people and triggered the recall of more than a half-billion eggs . Wright County Egg , of Galt , Iowa , had not shipped eggs to consumers from the two hen houses since August .

-- The laying hens present in these houses at the time of the outbreak have been removed and the houses cleaned , sanitized and tested to ensure that they are no longer contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis .

-- Infected pullets were replaced with Salmonella enteritidis-negative pullets that have been vaccinated .

-- A rodent problem has been corrected and a system put in place to control and monitor them .

After the recall , fresh eggs at facilities believed to be contaminated were sold to `` breaking plants '' that break the eggshells , pasteurize the eggs and turn them into liquid or other form used in a variety of products , officials said . That step was meant to kill any pathogens .

The two barns resuming shell egg production will produce about 72,000 dozen eggs per week , or about 3.7 million dozen eggs each year , according to Wright County Egg . About 800,000 eggs per week are still going to `` breaking plants . ''

Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Hampton , Iowa , have worked to correct problems so that they could again ship shell eggs directly to the table .

According to the FDA , since August , three egg-producing houses owned by Hillandale had been extensively tested and have been found to have no evidence of Salmonella contamination .
