-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Togo 's national soccer team have been officially disqualified from the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations by the Confederation of African Football -LRB- CAF -RRB- .

The region 's governing football body for football has confirmed that the team , known as the `` Hawks '' , will take no further part in the tournament being hosted by Angola after failing to appear for their first group game against Ghana on Monday , according to CNN affiliate ITN .

The squad flew back home to Togo after three of their traveling party were killed and two players seriously injured by a machine-gun attack which occurred as their bus crossed the border into the northern , oil-rich state of Cabinda on Friday .

Group B has now been reduced to three teams : Ghana , Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso -- the latter two drew 0-0 on Monday .

The CAF has also ordered a moment of silence to be observed in memory of the slain Togolese before each match in the first round of the tournament , it announced Monday .

But the UK Press Association reported that the CAF had received no such request .

`` Personally , I have to say that I am scared because I do n't know this country . After seeing what happened to Togo , I am scared . You do n't know when a problem could happen again . My only worry is returning home .

`` Football has become something very important throughout the world , and the image which has been left following the attack is something very bad for African football . We came here to play , not to die . ''

`` We have shown our ability to safeguard events since 1994 , '' Jordaan said . `` In 140 events we have not had a single incident .

`` You can draw up a list of countries with that track record and you 'll find very few in the world . ''
