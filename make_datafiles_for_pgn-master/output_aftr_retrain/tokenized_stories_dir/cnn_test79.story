`` I will miss this job , -LRB- but -RRB- the district is very substantially changed , '' with roughly 325,000 new constituents , Frank told reporters . The veteran congressman said he was planning to retire after 2014 regardless , but said he did n't `` want to be torn '' next year between the need to serve his existing constituents , reach out to new district residents and protect his signature Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law .

While Massachusetts ' entire House delegation is Democratic , local Republicans insist Frank 's retirement will put the reconfigured district in play .

`` It is clear that Congressman Frank was not looking forward to another hard fought campaign after losing his gerrymandered district and spending nearly every penny he had in 2010 , '' Massachusetts Republican Party Executive Director Nate Little said in a written statement .

`` Republicans were already gearing up for a strong race and Frank 's sudden retirement injects added optimism and excitement into the election . ''

Frank , first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980 , is the top Democrat on the powerful House Financial Services Committee . The controversial 2010 Dodd-Frank measure , designed to rein in Wall Street excesses after the 2008 financial collapse , passed the House without any GOP support .

Frank made headlines earlier in his career by becoming one of the first openly gay members of Congress . He was formally reprimanded by the House in 1990 for allegations relating to his association with a male prostitute .

Frank 's current district -- which extends from the affluent , liberal Boston suburbs of Newton and Brookline to the cities of New Bedford and Fall River -- is considered safe Democratic political terrain . Frank did , however , receive an unusually strong challenge from Republican Sean Bielat in 2010 .
