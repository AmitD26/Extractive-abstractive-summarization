Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A compromise bill to provide free medical treatment and compensation to first responders of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack won final approval Wednesday from the House and Senate , sending it to President Barack Obama to be signed into law .

The bill passed on a voice vote in the Senate , and then on a 206-60 vote in the House on the final day of the lame-duck session of Congress .

Still , there was a quorum -- a simple majority of 435 House members -- to vote on the bill .

The vote was the last by the House for the year , as it later adjourned until January 5 , when a new Congress will be sworn in and Boehner takes the speaker 's gavel .

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the Senate 's approval of the bill `` affirms our nation 's commitment to protecting those who protect us all , '' and some of those first responders also welcomed the development but questioned why it took so long .

Negotiations Wednesday morning involving Schumer and fellow Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York with Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Mike Enzi of Wyoming led to a deal that reduced the cost of the bill by $ 2 billion and made other changes sought by GOP opponents , according to statements by the participants .

`` Every American recognizes the heroism of the 9/11 first responders , but it is not compassionate to help one group while robbing future generations of opportunity , '' said Coburn , who had demanded that the cost of the bill be lowered and fully paid for . `` I 'm pleased this agreement strikes a fair balance and improves the bill the majority attempted to rush through at the last minute . ''

According to Coburn , the agreement reduces the overall cost of the bill by $ 2 billion to a total of $ 4.2 billion over a 10-year period . His statement said that $ 1.5 billion of the cost goes for health benefits and $ 2.7 billion will pay for compensation for health problems of emergency responders .

The agreement also caps attorneys ' fees at 10 percent of any total compensation award , and includes potential limits on compensation for individuals who already have received workers compensation for injuries due to the 9/11 response , the Coburn statement said .

Democrats previously agreed to pay for the bill with fees collected on various services involving foreign countries and foreign visitors .

On Tuesday , Schumer said it appeared the bill would come up for a Senate vote once lawmakers voted on New START , a nuclear arms control pact with Russia that is one of Obama 's top foreign policy priorities . Both votes occurred Wednesday afternoon .

The James Zadroga 9/11 Health Bill is named after a deceased New York Police Department detective who had worked in the toxic plume at ground zero .

According to the bill 's supporters , it is funded by a procurement fee on some foreign countries that trade with the United States , the continuation of a fee on some travelers to the United States and a fee on visas for some companies . The version being negotiated by the senators Wednesday drops some of those funding sources .

On Tuesday , a group of 9/11 first responders joined lawmakers in Washington to urge the Senate to pass the health care bill .

In the years following the attacks , health experts have noted respiratory and mental health conditions , such as post-traumatic stress disorder , in those who engaged in ground zero rescue and cleanup efforts .
