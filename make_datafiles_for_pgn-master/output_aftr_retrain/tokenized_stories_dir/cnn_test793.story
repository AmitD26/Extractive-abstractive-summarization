-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has dismissed reports he is about to quit the English Premier League champions .

It had been claimed the 51-year-old contacted the League Managers ' Association on Sunday night to discuss his position .

`` I do n't know if it is enough to clarify my position today to close this rumor and speculation , '' began the 51-year-old . `` These rumors are totally untrue , I do n't know why this rumor came out today in the papers .

`` The LMA -LRB- League Managers ' Association -RRB- called me last night to understand what was happening , but I was at home . These rumors are totally untrue .

`` I have my contract until 2012 here in this club , I said a lot of times I would like to stay here , that I love this club , I love these players and have a lot of confidence in these players and this squad so there is no reason to change my idea .

The departure of Wilkins , who played for the club for six years , coupled with a poor run of form has put pressure on Ancelotti , even though Chelsea remain top of the Premier League table .

But the Italian , who led former club AC Milan to two Champions League titles , insisted the scrutiny that comes with his job is something he enjoys .

`` There is no reason to think about my position . My position is very clear , I am the coach and I have to train my players and maintain the club to the best level , '' he added .
