New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Painting , simple painting is what caused Samten Dakpa to become a victim of terror .

For painting classic Tibetan images as a teenager , Dakpa says , Chinese police -- intent on suppressing Tibetan culture -- arrested , beat and tortured him , shoving his hands into a coal-burning oven .

`` The individuals who come to us are among the most traumatized and brutalized individuals there are , '' said Dr. Allen Keller , who founded the program in 1995 . `` But they also come to us with incredible resilience , and we have the opportunity to help them heal . ''

`` When Sampten first came to us , he was in excruciating pain , both physically and emotionally . He could barely use his hands , '' Keller said . `` He would try to paint and he could barely hold a paint brush . When he did he would get terrifying memories of the torture he endured . ''

Doctors operated on Dakpa 's right hand , allowing him to hold a paint brush without pain for the first time in years . His left hand , badly scarred , still has limited mobility .

`` Just these two fingers are stuck here and I can not open more than this , '' Dakpa said as he tried to stretch his palm . `` Middle finger , if I try to open strongly , it hurts a lot . ''

So , this spring , surgeons plans to operate on the left hand .

Mahawa has received treatment for his jaw and persistent back pain as well as psychological counseling .

`` I 'm feeling really relaxed when I paint . It 's very meditational , '' said the torture survivor .

Cheikhna Mahawa , meanwhile , feels victory over his former captors , as he teaches calculus and linear algebra at City College of New York while he pursues a doctorate there .

`` Absolutely . Without a doubt , '' Mahawa said when asked if it 's worth fighting for education , even to the point of becoming a victim of torture .
