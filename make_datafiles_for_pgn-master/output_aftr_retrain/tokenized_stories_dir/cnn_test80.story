New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The crowd of festival goers at a holiday market in New York City 's Columbus Circle Friday seemed to support the message city tourism officials have been spreading far and wide : The Big Apple is open for business and welcoming its usual influx of holiday visitors .

Superstorm Sandy 's wrath a month ago will cost New York state $ 41 billion , according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo , but tourists have largely been unfazed by the storm , which caused very little damage to Midtown Manhattan , the hub of the city 's magical holiday attractions .

`` Absolutely not , '' said Michigan visitor Kelly Coll , 48 , who has traveled to New York this season for the last 14 years with friend Tiffany Moen , 46 . `` The storm did not affect our plans at all , '' Coll told CNN on Friday afternoon .

The tourism association estimates there will be around 52 million tourists this year , up from last year 's 50.9 million .

`` Ninety-five percent of all of our hotels , attractions , restaurants and transportation are completely back to normal , '' Fertitta said . `` For all intents and purposes , visitors should not feel deterred from coming to New York . NYC is open for business . ''

`` I was not skeptical at all because of everything I had seen on television , '' said Roger Archut , 30 , a first-time visitor from Germany . Storm damage in New York City was portrayed as `` under control . ''

John Murphy , 54 , visiting from Ireland with his wife , shared a similar story . Coverage of the storm indicated to him that the area most crucial for holiday attractions , Midtown , home to Fifth Avenue and the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree , was `` well maintained . ''

Yet just because tourism is expected to reach an all-time high this year does n't mean some businesses are n't hurting in the aftermath of the storm .

At the southern tip of Manhattan in the hard-hit Financial District , Harry 's CafÃ © & Steak , a popular eatery with visitors during the holiday season , still struggles .

`` There has definitely been a decrease in business , '' owner Peter Poulakakos told CNN on Friday . Many restaurants rely heavily on the holiday season for a huge portion of their yearly income .

Despite declines , many remain hopeful that business will pick up in the coming weeks .

`` But thankfully , now it is beginning to get back to normal and hopefully will continue on that path . ''
