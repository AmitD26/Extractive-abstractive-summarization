Thousands of South Koreans gathered at the foot of a ski jump well past midnight in a passionate display of excitement that included fireworks , singing , dancing , picnicking and kimchi -- the traditional Korean side dish .

`` This is the victory of the South Korean people , '' said President Lee Myung Bak in Durban , South Africa , Wednesday , where the decision was announced .

Their slogan for the Winter Olympics is `` New Horizons . ''

`` I can not even tell you how happy I am , '' said one resident . `` Everyone came together and prayed that we would win . '' South Korea has never hosted the Winter Games , though the capital city of Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games .

France has hosted three editions of the Winter Olympics , most recently in 1992 in Albertville . Annecy met with many difficulties in its bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics , including a small budget and change in leadership on the bid committee .

Had it won , Munich would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics . The city attracted the Summer Games in 1972 .

Representatives from the three cities made their cases to committee members in Durban , South Africa Wednesday .
