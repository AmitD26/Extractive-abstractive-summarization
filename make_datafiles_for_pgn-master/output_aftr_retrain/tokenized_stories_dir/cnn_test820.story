Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The legendary rock band KISS signed up to pay tribute to Michael Jackson in an October concert that will also headline Christina Aguilera , Leona Lewis , Smokey Robinson , Cee Lo Green and JLS , the promoters told CNN Monday .

Musicians who played in Jackson 's touring band for the past two decades will also reunite as the house band for `` Michael Forever : The Tribute Concert '' in Cardiff , Wales , according to promoter Global Live Events .

Kevin Dorsey , who served as musical director for several Michael Jackson tours , will also direct the October 8 show , it was announced Monday .

But fan reaction posted on the concert 's Facebook page was negative to news that KISS would perform .

Many of the negative comments referred to a story published by the Canadian Press a week after Jackson 's death on June 25 , 2009 , quoting KISS leader Gene Simmons concerning sexual molestation allegations against the pop star .

`` We want to make clear that this does not reflect the position of the entire family , '' the two brothers said in a joint statement after their mother and four siblings endorsed the show .

`` While we wholeheartedly support the spirit of a tribute that honors our brother , we find it impossible to support an event that is due to take place during the criminal trial surrounding Michael 's death , '' Jermaine and Randy Jackson said .

Dr. Conrad Murray 's involuntary manslaughter trial begins in September and is expected to continue through October .

Katherine Jackson plans to attend the trial , although she will miss some days to fly to Wales to attend the show with Michael Jackson 's children , she said .

`` It will be on a Saturday when the courtroom is dark , '' Paul Ring , a Global Live Events executive said .

Members of the Jackson family taking the stage October 8 include several of Michael Jackson 's brothers , `` the next generation of Jacksons , '' and 3T , which consists of Tito Jackson 's three sons , the promoters said .

`` This concert will unite various generations and musical genres , reminding everyone of just how amazing a talent Michael was , '' Ring said .
