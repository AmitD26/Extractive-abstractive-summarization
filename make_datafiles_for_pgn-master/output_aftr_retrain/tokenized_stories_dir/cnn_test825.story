By Tuesday , search teams had found a total of 46 bodies , and it was still unclear if there were more victims from Monday 's massacre . The target was a group that included the female relatives of Ismael `` Toto '' Mangudadatu , who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao province in May .

Mangudadatu said he had received threats which he believed were from allies of the incumbent governor Andal Ampatuan -- that he would be kidnapped if he filed the candidate papers himself . Instead , his wife , sister , and the group of journalists accompanying them were kidnapped and brutally killed , possibly tortured , raped and beheaded , according to local media reports .

A local police commander described the grisly search operation near an isolated village , telling reporters from ABS-CBN News that 17 bodies were pulled from a single grave .

`` They were piled on top of each other , '' Chief Superintendent Josefino Cataluna said . `` It looked as if they were buried hurriedly . ''

Those killed included at least 12 journalists , according to the press freedom organization , Reporters Without Borders , making Monday the deadliest single day for journalists anywhere in the world .

Neither Ampatuan nor any of his advisers has commented on the slaying allegations .

`` It 's not hard to determine the motive , '' according to Philippine analyst Kenneth E. Bauzon . `` How dare this -LSB- Mangudadatu -RSB- challenge him when he knows that the governor is a position that is presumably reserved for -LSB- the Ampatuan -RSB- family . ''

A government construction vehicle was found at the site of the hastily dug mass grave , fueling the belief that Ampatuan or his allies had a role in the massacre .

Now , the region is bracing for a backlash of possible reprisal killings . The Philippine government has placed Maguindanao and its surrounding regions under a state of emergency and survivors of Monday 's massacre have entered a government witness protection program , according to the state-run Philippines News Agency .

Arroyo has sent top level government officials to Maguindanao to `` personally oversee military action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts , '' she said Tuesday .

`` No effort has been spared to bring justice to the victims and hold the perpetrators accountable to the full limit of the law , '' she said .

`` I think that this is a culmination for many years of impunity on the part of any family or group for that matter because this has been tolerated by the Arroyo administration , '' said Bauzon , a political science associate professor at Saint Joseph 's College in New York , who is from Mindanao and has authored several books on the region and its politics .

The killings could further damage the political reputation of Arroyo , whose administration has already been scarred by allegations of a tainted election in 2004 and criticism over her response to the recent typhoons to strike the country .

Arroyo issued an executive order in July 2006 that allowed local officials and Philippine National Police to deputize volunteer watchmen , known as barangay tanods , to fight against insurgent groups in the southern regions . This order has been blamed for allowing local politicians to convert their private militias into legal security forces .

The strong clan rivalries and the armed groups that support each clan may make it impossible for Arroyo to rout out those behind Monday 's mass killing , according to Bauzon .

`` The dynasty is strongly entrenched and for her to disband private armies by this warlord overnight is too much of a task , '' he said . `` The Americans were not able to do it in half a century and all she can do is set her sights low by really going after the most visible of the perpetrators . ''
