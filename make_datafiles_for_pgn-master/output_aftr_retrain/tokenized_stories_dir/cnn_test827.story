The Sweden international , who spent just one season in Spain following his big-money move from Milan 's city rivals Internazionale in 2009 , suffered a thigh injury in training on Monday .

`` The tests carried out showed that the player has a strain in his thigh muscle and will not be leaving for Barcelona with the rest of the squad . He will rest for a few days and then start his treatment towards the end of the week , '' the Italian club 's website reported .

Ibrahimovic 's absence could mean a reprieve for Italy international Antonio Cassano , who was expected to make way for Brazil star Alexandre Pato despite scoring in the club 's Serie A opener on Friday . Ibrahimovic also netted in that game , a 2-2 draw with Lazio .
