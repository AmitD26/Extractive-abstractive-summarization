New Orleans -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Waging war against historic flooding in eight Midwestern and Southern states , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened a spillway north of New Orleans on Monday in an effort to calm the rising Mississippi River .

A crowd gathered near the entrance to the Bonnet Carre spillway to watch workers use cranes to slide open the gates to the flood control system . The spillway , like another that could be opened next week , is designed to divert floodwater away from New Orleans and slow the raging river to protect the low-lying city .

Bonnet Carre is part of a system built after the devastating Mississippi River flood of 1927 . While the river 's highest levels may still be days away , a decision to open the second flood control structure -- the Morganza Spillway -- may not be , Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said .

The Bonnet Carre spillway diverts water from the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico by way of Lake Pontchartrain . But opening the Morganza Spillway would flood populated areas and could put Morgan City , Louisiana , and other communities at risk .

`` It 's sort of torturous , '' Memphis Mayor A.C. Wharton Jr. said . `` We 've been waiting so long . It 's hard keeping people 's attention . It 's warning fatigue , if you will . But we 're ready for it . ''

The river level stood at 47.8 feet Monday evening and is expected to crest at 48 feet , said Ryan Husted , a forecaster for the National Weather Service in Memphis . President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state of Tennessee Monday , which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms , flooding and tornadoes since early April .

The river covered the lowest parts of the city 's historic Beale Street and had forced about 400 people from their homes Monday , Wharton said . Another 1,300 remained in low-lying areas , he said .

But local officials were taking no chances .

`` It 's a very powerful river . It looks like it 's running very slowly , but it has a very strong current , '' said Bob Nations , director of preparedness in Shelby County , Tennessee , which includes Memphis . `` We still do n't know -LRB- exactly what -RRB- the river might do . ''

`` It 's affecting daily life tremendously , '' said Pegues , a Shelby County elections ' division employee who submitted photos of the flooding to CNN iReport . `` It is pretty severe downtown . ... I know a lot of ... people have lost their homes . ''

`` We can not get to the park , which is underwater , or to other towns , '' he said . `` Most of the roads are closed , plus the water sewage plant is getting sandbagged . '' If a nearby sewer plant is forced to shut down , `` We wo n't have tap water to bathe in or drink , '' he added .

`` I 'm very sad . I look at that and I do n't have a home , '' Marilynn Nally said , pointing to her flooded family farm . `` I feel like we 're having to suffer for somebody else . ''

As the floodwaters worked their way south , the operator of a nuclear power plant in Port Gibson , Mississippi , expressed concerns that rising water could cut off an access road to the facility . However , there was no plan to shut down the Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station and no immediate cause for concern , a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Agency said Monday .

`` Pray for the best , but prepare for the worst , '' he said .

Even with a forecast for record or near-record crests into next week and weeks of high water to follow , Corps officials say they expect nothing like the widespread and devastating flooding that occurred along the southernmost stretch of the Mississippi River in 1927 .

That flood began near Memphis in the fall of 1926 and did not end until the following August , according to the National Weather Service . It devastated the levee system , and flooded 165 million acres of land , sweeping 600,000 people from their homes . It came at a cost of 246 lives and the equivalent of nearly $ 624 million in 2011 dollars .

As a result of that flood , the report says , Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1928 , which led to a massive public works programs to build a system of levees and other structures designed to hold back the river more effectively .

The latest flooding in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys is largely the byproduct of torrential rains throughout the region . Over one two-week stretch , there was about 600 % more precipitation than usual , Reichling said .

Still , a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told HLN 's Vinne Politan that people around the river and its tributaries need to be careful and should not wait until they see water to take action .

`` It 's going to be a tragedy on many levels . So many people are going to be displaced . They 're going to be displaced for a long time and they may not have much of anything to come back to , '' said Jeff Rent .

CNN 's Greg Botelho , Marlena Baldacci , Phil Gast and Ben Smith contributed to this report .
