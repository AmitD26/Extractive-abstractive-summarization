Khartoum , Sudan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Sudan 's government has gained control of a remote town that had been under attack by fighters from a rival tribe , the nation 's information minister said Monday .

Some of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor , said Barnaba Benjamin , South Sudan 's minister of information and broadcasting .

Earlier Monday , a military official said that roughly 4,000 army and police reinforcements were on the way to Pibor after weekend attacks .

The United Nations also said it sent a battalion of peacekeepers to Pibor last week amid reports that members of the Lou Nuer tribe were marching toward the town , home to the Murle tribe , after attacking the village of Lukangol .

Fighters first struck Pibor on Saturday , attacking a portion that was out of the reach of U.N. peacekeepers , said Col. Philip Auger of the South Sudan army .

Benjamin said there were no casualties and no direct confrontation between the two tribes there , because most of the Murle had fled when they heard the Lou Nuer were approaching .

Rajendran said the organization was afraid for its workers ' safety and `` very concerned '' for the people of Pibor and Lukangol .

The attack on Pibor follows reports last week that Lou Nuer fighters raided Lukangol , burning it to the ground and forcing thousands to flee toward Pibor .

At least 50,000 people have fled the violence in the state that began last year , said Quade Hermann , chief of radio at Radio Miraya , a U.N.-backed radio station in South Sudan .

She similarly said that the town of Pibor is secure now , though the situation there remains fluid . The people who fled remain scattered , and the United Nations is working on a plan for how to distribute humanitarian aid , Hermann said .
