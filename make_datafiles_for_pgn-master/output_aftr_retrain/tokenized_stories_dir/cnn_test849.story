If pop culture were a team sport , Jobs would have certainly played quarterback .

The other `` toys '' he helped create like the iPod , iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media , but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist . Even the commercials , from the 1984 , George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent `` Are you a Mac or a PC , '' were uber-cool .

While Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech , he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood . And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods , it all began with George Lucas .

As Jobs explained to the news program `` 60 Minutes '' in 2003 , when Lucas was creating `` Star Wars '' he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog . The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company , which honed the technology behind the process , would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $ 10 million in 1986 .

As chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar , Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry .

The world had n't even heard of computer-generated imagery -LRB- CGI -RRB- in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films . The first of these , `` Toy Story , '' captured audience 's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children 's toys .

`` Toy Story '' went on to become the top-earning film of that year , grossing $ 192 million in domestic box office receipts and $ 362 million worldwide . It spurred two sequels , theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise .

By then he was firmly back in the driver 's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple , which was setting the world afire with its inventions .

One of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store , which revolutionized the world of music downloads .

The introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes . The ability of the iPod , and later the iPhone and iPad , to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes .

Innovation was not without some growing pains , however .

`` Apple is the strongest company in the music industry because there was not enough competition , and still to this day there is not enough competition , '' Lang said . `` As an industry it ca n't then influence packaging , merchandising -- all the things that are vital . ''

`` But I think you 'd be hard-pressed to find one music executive worth his or her salt who would n't agree that Jobs ' vision and tenacity blazed a trail for digital music as we know it today , '' Werde said . `` Without a doubt , when you think of the Mount Rushmore of the music business -- pioneers like Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler , Clive Davis and Jimmy Iovine - Steve Jobs has earned his prominent place .
