Sustained winds in some areas are expected to reach up to hurricane-force levels of 75 and 80 miles per hour , with higher gusts possible , meteorologist Stephen Kearney told CNN .

Nome , with a population of about 3,700 , will endure sea levels 7 to 8 feet above normal , with occasional 10-foot waves , he said .

Chip Leeper , incident commander with the Nome government , said people in low-lying areas and on the edges of a sea wall are being advised to seek shelter elsewhere . There were no mandatory evacuations late Tuesday .

While the town was taking the matter seriously , residents were taking things in stride .

`` Most people are a hardy lot , '' Leeper told CNN . `` We do n't scare easy . ''

Forecasters said the storm would cross the Chukotsk Peninsula and take a northwestern track into the Chukchi Sea on Wednesday .

Widespread flooding and severe beach erosion are expected in several areas , including Norton Sound .

While fall storms happen , this one has officials particularly concerned because of the anticipated coastal flooding . Usually , the less-populated Aleutian Islands to the south are most affected .
