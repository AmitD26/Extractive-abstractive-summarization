U.S. Air Force planes prepare to take off in November 2001 from the air base at Incirlik , Turkey .

The recent rise in tensions between Turkey and the United States has led the military to increase its planning for alternatives , two military officials with direct knowledge of the ongoing assessment said .

`` Events have triggered more detailed planning for the curtailment or closure '' of access to Turkey , one official said . The key issue is to find ways to ship supplies and other critical equipment into Iraq .

The U.S. military already had been considering alternatives to Turkey because of the growing dependence on that country after the cutback of U.S. forces in central Asia in recent years .

But now , with more `` detailed planning '' under way , the military is considering a variety of options in hopes of being ready for whatever , if anything , the Turks do .

The initial assessment is that any cutoff from current access to Turkey would force the U.S. military into longer cargo flights , which would mean extra costs for fuel and for wear and tear on equipment . It may also look for other air hubs in Jordan or Kuwait , officials say . See Turkey 's strategic position ''

`` For those who are concerned that we get as many of these mine-resistant ambush-protected heavy vehicles into Iraq as possible , 95 percent of those vehicles today are being flown into Iraq through Turkey . ''

The full House could soon vote on the genocide resolution . A top Turkish official warned Thursday that consequences `` wo n't be pleasant '' if it approves the measure .

The resolution arrives at a particularly sensitive point in U.S.-Turkish relations . The United States has urged Turkey not to send its troops over the border into northern Iraq to fight Kurdish separatist rebels , who launched some cross-border attacks against Turkish targets .

The Turkish military is poised to strike across the border to fight the group -- the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK -- a move opposed by the Bush administration . The Turkish parliament could give approval for the incursion into Iraq as early as next week . E-mail to a friend
