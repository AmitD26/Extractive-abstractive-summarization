Tripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In Tripoli , `` no guns '' signs outnumber ones that say , `` no smoking . ''

She witnessed men drawing weapons while arguing on the street . `` Seeing men shouting , waving guns and pointing them at each other just because of a silly argument is frightening , '' she wrote .

A year after the start of the Libyan revolution , human rights groups describe a nation of lawless militias who commit crimes with impunity and threaten to destabilize the nation by hindering efforts to rebuild .

A year ago , Libyans dared to take to the streets of Benghazi , their simmering anger heated to a boil by the arrest of human rights lawyer Fathi Terbil . As many as 2,000 protesters gathered outside of government offices . They chanted slogans against Moammar Gadhafi , the man who had ruled them with a firm grip for four decades .

They called for a `` Day of Rage '' on February 17 . After that , the protests intensified and spread and eight long months later , after brutal fighting and a NATO air campaign , Gadhafi was defeated .

This week , Libyans could hardly believe a year has passed by .

As Libyans prepare to celebrate their freedom , revolutionary fighters in the capital are on high alert and additional checkpoints have sprouted everywhere .

Ordinary Libyans cling to the optimism that blossomed with the first protests in Benghazi last February . Building a nation after four decades of tyranny is no easy task , they say .

At the main plaza that Gadhafi called Green Square -LRB- it 's now known as Martyr 's Square -RRB- , revolutionary music blares from cars .

But many still fear former regime loyalists might try to disrupt anniversary celebrations or somehow still destroy the new Libya .

Only 17 % of Libyans feel people can be trusted , found an Oxford Research International poll , touted as the first national survey of Libya and startling in some of its revelations .

Consider that only 29 % of Libyans said they would prefer to live in a democracy ; 35 % said they would still prefer rule by a strong leader .

And 16 % of the 2,000 Libyans surveyed were ready to resort to violence for political ends . That means 630,000 people are potential fighters , in addition to the 280,000 people who previously picked up a gun .

They insist on retaining arms to protect their revolution , especially given that military and police presence is virtually nonexistent .

Mohammed , 28 , says Libya 's government is weak ; its defenses not strong enough .

The nation needs a government that can quickly integrate revolutionary factions under one umbrella ; one that can activate a functioning judiciary . Recruit a national army , he says .

`` I am hoping for the best every day , '' he says .

But he worries . And is not alone in his fears .

Other Libyans decry the lack of transparency in decision-making and the government 's inability to impose authority over the the militias .

Tripoli residents complain of daily cuts in electricity and an ill-equipped health care system .

Government officials argue that they have inherited a mess left behind from the four decades of Gadhafi rule . They have pleaded for patience .

`` There is a feeling growing that the NTC is not doing enough towards driving this revolution from phase one to phase two in this transitional period , '' he says .

`` It is a government with no real power and what it really needs is to have a partnership with the guys who are on the ground and make them a part of this state , '' AlSharif says .

The goal before was to get rid of Gadhafi . Now , Libya 's leaders will have to unify the nation with new goals -- ones that respect the enormous sacrifices of the Libyan people , AlSharif says .

`` We need to be faithful to their sacrifices to our country and to ... remember the goal of this revolution was not one to get rid of the Gadhafi regime and to create chaos , '' he says . `` This would be a disaster , an ultimate betrayal to our guys who fell in the fight for freedom and to establish an advanced modern state . ''

And that , he says , was why the revolution was worth it .
