-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka will face a big test of her new status this weekend as women 's tennis moves from singles tournament play to the Fed Cup teams event .

The Australian Open champion will lead Belarus into action against the United States for the first time , but despite the stars on show they will be competing in the second tier of the competition .

The U.S. team will be led by the Williams sisters Serena and Venus , both former No. 1s and the winners of a combined 20 grand slam singles titles .

Serena lost in the last 16 in Melbourne last month , but Venus will return to action in California after a five-month absence after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder .

Can anyone stop champion Djokovic ?

`` I think just being on a team and just having some adrenaline just gives me even more energy , to be honest , '' the 31-year-old -- who revealed she was suffering from Sjogren 's Syndrome in September -- told reporters .

`` Instead of trying to run through a wall , just really kind of take a step back and be smart . I think that 's kind of what I 've learned .

Serena , a 13-time grand slam winner , is looking forward to teaming up with her sister ahead of their possible pairing at the London 2012 Olympics .

`` We played on the same team a few times , '' said Serena , who was also part of the team which defeated Russia in 1999 . `` We always have a blast and always make the best of everything .

Belgium , who reached the last four in 2011 , will be without Melbourne semifinalist Kim Clijsters for the home clash with Serbia , headed by world No. 13 Jelena Jankovic .
