-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A frequently overlooked place of farms , friendly towns and relatively few people is , for now , the epicenter of U.S. politics . The place is Iowa . The question is Why-owa ?

The answer is a quaint and quirky institution known as the Iowa caucuses -- an unusual , old-fashioned evening of talking about the candidates running for president and then voting on them .

Separate caucuses are held across Iowa as neighbors debate the pros and cons of candidates with each other before they vote among themselves , and that result then gets totted up with the other caucuses statewide to decide the winner .

Candidates have spoken at rallies , debated each other on TV and opinion polls are released at least weekly .

Americans have long chosen their presidential candidates sequentially state by state .

This year , all attention so far has been on the fight to become the Republican nominee because Obama is expected to be the Democratic candidate .

To a casual visitor the primaries look a lot like any election , with the familiar routines of voters , ballot boxes and booths .

But Iowa caucuses are different and the rules vary in the roughly 1,800 state precincts that hold them . There is n't necessarily a secret ballot ; sometimes there 's no ballot at all .

After everyone gets a chance to express their opinions , the vote can be on paper , with a show of hands or , for Democrats , just by congregating into groups corresponding to the different candidates and seeing who has the biggest group .

It 's a particular kind of politics with a long past . The caucuses date back in different forms more than 150 years . But they never attracted much attention until the 1970s when Iowa moved its caucuses ahead of the first primary and decided to stage them all on the same evening .

The media started paying attention and candidates learned that a strong showing could generate headlines nationwide .

Even so , winning Iowa does n't predict much because with just three million people , the state is so small , so rural , so white and , these days , so affluent .

So maybe it 's no surprise that , looking back over the decades , the most popular candidates in Iowa do n't tend to get their party 's nomination or the presidency .

`` Iowa is first , '' Winebrenner notes . The `` caucuses provide early evidence -- hard news -- on the progress of the presidential race . This is the perception of Iowa 's role , and it is therefore the reality ... ''

But there is more to the reality . Even if Iowa does n't add much to the process , it does subtract .

After the Iowa caucuses the most successful or determined candidates will stay in the race and head to the northeastern state of New Hampshire for its primary , the first in the nation , on January 10 . The others tend to start heading home .
