-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Muslim civil liberties group filed a lawsuit Friday against the federal government for allegedly violating the First Amendment rights of Michigan Muslims and violating a 1993 federal law that upholds the free practice of religion .

The group says the agencies violated the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which says the federal government can not substantially burden a person 's free exercise of religion .

Agents allegedly asked `` How many times a day to you pray ? '' `` Do you pray your morning prayer in the mosque ? '' and `` Who else prays in your mosque ? '' according to CAIR .

`` Invasive religious questioning of American citizens without evidence of criminal activity is not only an affront to the Constitution , but is also a waste of limited resources , '' CAIR-Michigan Executive Director Dawud Walid said .

U.S. Customs and Border Protection responded Friday , saying that it `` strictly prohibits profiling on the basis of race or religion . ''

The FBI declined to comment .
