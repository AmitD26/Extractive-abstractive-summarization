LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britain 's competition watchdog has ordered airport operator BAA to sell three of its seven airports , including two in London .

BAA must sell Gatwick Airport first .

In publishing its decision Thursday , the commission said the sale of the airports will encourage competition `` where today there is no competition at all . ''

`` The precise pace and the precise ways in which the benefits from such competition will emerge may be uncertain , but we are confident that the benefits will build over time , driven by the momentum of the development of competition , and will be significant , '' Clarke said .

`` The intensity of price competition may initially be limited by current capacity constraints and price controls , but these constraints are themselves at least in part the result of common ownership , '' the commission said .

Carrier Virgin Atlantic , a longtime critic of BAA 's ownership of the airports , welcomed the commission 's decision .

`` It will undoubtedly benefit consumers , '' said airline spokesman Paul Charles . `` Better airport facilities in the UK and lower prices will be the result . ... The important next step is to ensure that there is adequate oversight of the divestment process . ''

The Competition Commission is an independent public group that investigates mergers , markets and regulated industries . The Office of Fair Trading , a government department , asked the commission to look into airport competition in March 2007 .

The once-state owned BAA , which used to be known as the British Airports Authority , was privatized in 1986 and floated on the stock market in 1987 . It is now owned by Spanish property group Ferrovial .
