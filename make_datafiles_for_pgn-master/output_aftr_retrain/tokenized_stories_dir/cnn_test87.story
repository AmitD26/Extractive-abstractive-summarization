It happened at 2:22 p.m. , 12 minutes after the pilot declared an emergency , saying the plane was severely shaking , the highway patrol said .

`` She went right through the glass window , '' McBride said . `` She 's banged up , but she 's going to be all right . ''

He added , `` She 's lucky to be alive because that house is a wreck . ''

Video from CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 showed white smoke rising from a large , black hole in the one-story house , which is surrounded by trees . Parts of the roof were melted away .

`` Because of the steepness of the trees in the area , the tall pine trees , it looks like it was a pretty steep descent and it went right into the roof , '' Lt. Justin Asbury of the highway patrol said .

McBride said he was looking outside when the plane passed low overhead not more than 40 feet in the air , he estimated .

The plane was making an odd sound as it passed overhead , as if it was stalling , he said . `` It sounded like the engine was n't running right at all . ''

The plane took down all the utility wires on the street , which is in a rural residential area with many retirees .

He said it appeared the plane was going in the general direction of the airport , but not directly toward it .
