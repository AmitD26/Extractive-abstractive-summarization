-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One million people registered for Apple 's music-centric social network in the first 48 hours it became available in September . But some evidence indicates that Ping may be having trouble keeping their attention .

However , a collaboration between Twitter and Apple could open a backdoor to a part of the corporate workforce that has been locked out of Ping during the crucial daytime hours .

In order to use Ping , you must first create an iTunes account , which requires a credit card . Apple says it has some 150 million credit cards on file , but that requirement still creates an obstacle for children who do n't have credit cards of their own . Kids , aged 13 to 17 , made up Facebook 's fastest-growing demographic this summer , according to data from Inside Facebook , which tracks activity on the social network .

Next , and here 's what could be a major hindrance for office workers , you must have the iTunes software installed on your computer in order to use Ping . The program does n't typically come packaged with corporate-issued machines .

But in many offices , Twitter and Facebook are just a few keystrokes away in a Web browser .

The workday has proved to be prime time for Facebook , the world 's most trafficked social network . About a quarter of workers in the U.S. and U.K. say they spend more than an hour on social networking sites during office hours , according to a recent survey . Seven percent of Web pages workers accessed recently were to Facebook , observed internet security firm Network Box .

Ping widens its potential daytime audience thanks to the partnership with Twitter , which has 175 million registered users . But the integration is only a one-way street , a Twitter spokeswoman said . Tweets can not be fed into Ping .
