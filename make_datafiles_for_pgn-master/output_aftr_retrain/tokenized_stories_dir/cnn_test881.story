-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A rejuvenated Fernando Torres scored a hat-trick on Sunday in the English Premier League as Chelsea thrashed Queens Park Rangers 6-1 at Stamford Bridge .

Chelsea were 2-0 up before Torres was on the score sheet with Daniel Sturridge blasting home inside the first minute and John Terry heading a second 12 minutes later .

Torres entered the fray in the 19th minute , receiving a inch-perfect pass from Saloman Kalou before rounding QPR keeper Paddy Kenny to score .

The 28-year-old , who sealed Chelsea 's famous 3-2 aggregate win in midweek against Barcelona , added his second five minutes later driving home after a mix up between Kenny and defender Nedum Onuoha .

The result capped a wonderful week for Chelsea whose heroics at the Nou Camp on Tuesday earned them a place in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich on May 19 .

`` Reaching the Champions League final was important , but we also want to finish in the top four and we showed we were focused today from the first minute after Daniel Sturridge 's goal , '' Torres said .

Tottenham moved back into fourth place on Sunday with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers at White Hart Lane .

Goals from Rafael Van der Vaart , who bundled home from close range in the 22nd minute , and a stunning Kyle Walker free-kick 15 minutes from the end all but condemn Blackburn Rovers to Championship football next season .

With two games left , Steve Kean 's team will need to beat both Wigan and Chelsea in their final match to keep their slim chances alive .
