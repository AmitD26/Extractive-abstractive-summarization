Johannesburg , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of people are expected to march Tuesday in South Africa to protest a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals .

Zuma 's supporters in the ruling African National Congress say the portrait is insulting and call it an attack on both the president and his party .

The painting by artist Brett Murray , called `` The Spear , '' is reminiscent of Soviet-era propaganda posters . Red on one half and black on the other , the painting shows Zuma in a proud stance with his genitals prominently exposed .

The painting was defaced last week after a storm of protests and condemnation , the SABC reported .

`` We believe all these actions by the gallery are not only a violation of the right to dignity of ... President Jacob Zuma but are a clear and calculated attack on the ANC , '' the party said on its website .

The Sunday newspaper City Press removed the image of the portrait from its website after the ANC threatened a boycott , but it complained Monday the ANC still wants the paper to apologize for running it in the first place .
