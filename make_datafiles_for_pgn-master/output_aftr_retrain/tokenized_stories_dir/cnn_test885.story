-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Supreme Court begins each session with a proclamation that ends with the words `` God save this Honorable Court . '' Even strict advocates of the separation of Church and State ought to say `` Amen '' to that line after Thursday 's decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act .

Despite what almost all the pundits predicted , the court 's decision provides some evidence that there remains one institution of American government that can not be seen as nakedly partisan . In the end , Chief Justice John Roberts , a career Republican who was nominated for the Supreme Court by George W. Bush , cast the deciding vote upholding the signature act of the current Democratic administration .

This , I think , is what Americans indicated they were looking for when they elected a president in 2008 who , four years earlier , had risen to national prominence by giving a speech in which he took issue with those who would `` slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states . ''

Unfortunately , the divide between Republicans and Democrats has , if anything , gotten worse over the past 3Ã‚ 1/2 years . Of course , each side blames the other for this result ; they are both right . More blame , however , is not what is needed . We used to refer to Congress , or at least the Senate , as the `` world 's greatest deliberative body . '' We all know that very little of what might be termed `` deliberation '' goes on within either chamber nowadays . Instead , Republicans attack Democrats , and Democrats attack Republicans .

Of course , Supreme Court justices have advantages . They do not have to stand for election and , as the chief justice wrote in his opinion read Thursday , they do not have to take a position on whether a law `` embodies sound policies . ''

Nevertheless , the court , and particularly the chief justice , offered an important lesson to the political branches on Thursday on how they might undertake to solve the nation 's problems . Will those who serve in the political branches listen ? Their initial reactions are certainly not encouraging .
