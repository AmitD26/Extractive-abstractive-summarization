`` He 's one of the Republican governors who has been out on the point on this issue about whether there are excesses in public employee unions in terms of their pension plans or health care plans and so forth , '' noted CNN senior political analyst David Gergen , calling the topic a `` very , very hot issue '' across the country .

After the law was signed , Democrats and their labor allies immediately began a recall effort that eventually led to Tuesday 's vote .

The AFL-CIO in Wisconsin , which worked in favor of the recall , defended the effort to oust Walker .

To Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity , a conservative advocacy group that pumped more than $ 10 million into the state backing Walker 's policies , the recall campaign sent a message that the Republican Party machine and its backers will help colleagues willing to take on the tough battles .

`` I think every governor , every state legislator around the country is looking at Wisconsin , and they 're going , ` OK , if I got the courage to stand up and do what I think is right to get my state moving again ... will someone have my back ? ' '' Phillips said before Tuesday 's vote . `` And hopefully the answer is going to be , you bet . ''

Walker 's message -- that state workers unions had too much power and were preventing necessary budget cuts -- resonated with voters , Gergen said .

The victory by Walker is `` a substantial defeat for labor , for public employees unions , and a substantial victory for those who have been trying to curb them '' Gergen concluded .

President Barack Obama easily won Wisconsin in 2008 , but the Republican victory Tuesday now puts the state in play in the November general election , analysts agreed .

Republican strategist Ari Fleischer noted Obama mostly stayed out of race that was so important to the labor movement .

Obama publicly backed Walker 's opponent , Democratic Mayor Tom Barrett of Milwaukee , but neglected to stop in Wisconsin to campaign with him even though he was next door in Illinois last week .

`` I have a hard time seeing big labor returning to Wisconsin this fall to put in a lot of effort for President Obama since he did n't show up there for them this year , '' said Fleischer , a CNN contributor .

`` This is just the opening shot of a battle that is going to go on until November , '' he said of the Tuesday vote .

`` I think it was overreach by the labor unions , '' McDonnell said . `` This is the third recall . They tried a judge , legislators , and now governor , and I think people realize this is too much . ''

`` The exit polling shows that people in Wisconsin support public employees strongly , they support the right of collective bargaining , '' Erpenbach said . `` By sending Gov. Walker back to the governor 's residence , obviously I think what people are saying is not so much about the policies , just that they 've had it with recalls and they feel very strongly that removing Gov. Walker from office right now for what he 's done is n't the right way to go . ''

`` I think he can certainly give voice to a lot of the restlessness and resentments and that sort of thing that are stirring against some of the excesses in labor unions , '' Gergen said of Romney , `` but what I hope he does not do is declare war on public employee unions . I think that would be a terrible mistake . There are some things that need to be fixed , but we do n't need a war . ''

Analysis : Wisconsin now tougher for Obama , but still uphill climb for Romney
