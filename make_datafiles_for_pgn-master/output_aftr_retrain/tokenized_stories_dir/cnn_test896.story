Hooks , who led the NAACP from 1977 to 1992 , died last week at the age of 85 after a lengthy illness .

Speakers delivered eulogies as Hooks ' casket sat in front of the church pulpit .

`` Dr. Hooks leaves big shoes behind , and none of us can fill them , '' Jealous said .

Morial said Hooks believed that `` if you choose to serve , it can not be a part-time thing , it can not be a sometime thing , it can not be a pretend game . ... It must be in your heart , soul and DNA . ''

The Tennessee House canceled its activities so lawmakers could attend the funeral in Hooks ' hometown .

Hooks , who grew up in the segregated South , was `` a vocal campaigner for civil rights in the United States , '' the NAACP said when it announced his death .

Hooks was nominated to the Federal Communications Commission in 1972 . He became the agency 's first black commissioner and was with the agency for five years before leaving to serve with the NAACP .

He also worked with colleagues to set up a program in which more than 200 corporations agreed to participate in economic development projects in black communities , the NAACP said .

President George W. Bush awarded Hooks the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the nation 's highest civilian honor , in November 2007 .

`` As a civil rights activist , public servant and minister of the gospel , Dr. Hooks has extended the hand of fellowship throughout his years , '' Bush said .

`` It was not an always ... easy thing to do . But it was always the right thing to do . ''
