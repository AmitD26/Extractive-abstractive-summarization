So what do ratings agencies do , and why are they so important ?

The `` Big Three '' are Standard 's & Poor 's , Moody 's Investor Services and Fitch Ratings . All originated in the United States , although Fitch has dual headquarters in New York and London .

What do they do ?

Countries are rated on a sliding scale : Germany for example , has a top rating -LRB- AAA -RRB- which allows it to borrow cash at cheap interest rates . The lower the rating grade , however , the higher interest payments a nation must pay to attract investors to buy its bonds . Anything that slips to junk status -- as Ireland , Portugal and Greek government bonds are rated -- is considered a `` highly speculative '' investment . Furthermore , the pool of eligible investors is reduced -- many institutional investors , such as government pension funds , are forbidden to invest in junk-rated bonds .

Why do they wield such power ?

What does a debt rating downgrade mean ?

The decisions of the `` Big Three '' catalyze market moves in often unpredictable ways , creating a strong ripple effect . In the wake of the Greece downgrade last year , for example , investors across the globe started rethinking investment in other governments ' bonds and began selling off more risky investments -- throwing the EU into crisis and depressing the value of the euro .

Historically , they were created to give investors an unbiased assessment of investments and investors paid for access to the ratings . In the 1970s , however , credit rating agencies started charging the issuers of new investments fees for ratings . In 1975 , U.S. legislators -- fearing a proliferation of unscrupulous ratings agencies -- designated Standard & Poor 's , Moody 's and Fitch as the only ratings organizations banks and brokers could use to evaluate the credit worthiness of their products .

What are the complaints against the firms ?

Critics also note that the agencies are paid by the very entities they rate , raising questions about their trustworthiness .
