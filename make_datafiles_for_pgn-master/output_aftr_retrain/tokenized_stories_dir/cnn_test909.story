The documentary film opens after an elderly woman dies in Tel Aviv . Her grandchildren assemble to clean out her apartment , packed with dusty books , vintage clothing -LRB- dozens of pairs of fancy gloves , for instance -RRB- , enough purses to stock a department store , jewelry , mementoes and closets full of knickknacks . But buried among the detritus they chance upon something remarkable -- mysterious papers linking the grandparents to an important Nazi figure . How could such ardent Zionists , who left their native Germany in the early 1930s , have been involved with an SS official like Leopold von Mildenstein ?

`` The film developed as a detective story , '' says Israeli director Arnon Goldfinger , grandson of Gerda Tuchler , the woman who owned the flat . Of all his family members , only Goldfinger seemed driven to uncover the secrets of his family 's past .

The plot thickens

The mystery of the newspapers prompted Goldfinger to dig deeper . Additional documents , photos and letters pointed to only one conclusion -- Gerda and her husband Kurt were not simply acquainted with von Mildenstein and his wife -- they had become the warmest of friends . This became all the harder for Goldfinger to digest when he learned more about von Mildenstein : He was no mere travel writer , but the head of the Nazi 's Jewish Affairs Department in the early 1930s . In that capacity von Mildenstein is said to have recruited an up-and-coming member of the party -- Adolf Eichmann .

A twist in the tale

Goldfinger 's investigation took him to Germany , where he tracked down von Mildenstein 's daughter , Eda , who proved receptive to his efforts to shed light on their families ' intersecting past . She helped him confirm something that may sound astonishing : After the war -- a conflict that claimed the lives of millions of Jews , including Gerda Tuchler 's own mother -- Gerda and her husband remained friends with the von Mildensteins .

`` The Flat '' does n't end there . Goldfinger continued to investigate , and what he found would confront him with an ethical dilemma .

Having destroyed the fiction von Mildenstein promoted -- that he had split with the Nazis before the war -- Goldfinger then faced a difficult decision : whether to share what he had learned with von Mildenstein 's daughter , Eda .

`` Morally I felt I had no alternative . I can not say -- as my mother did in the film -- ` It 's not our business . ' -LRB- I decided -RRB- I must tell Eda what I know . I can not anymore hide the secrets , so it was a very tough moment and very hard to understand how to do it . ''

Ultimate mysteries

`` My family was surprised when they first saw the film , '' Goldfinger told CNN . `` My siblings and especially my mother were not so interested in the history of my family , of our family , '' he says .

Why was Goldfinger 's mother so lacking in curiosity about her family 's past ? Why did Goldfinger feel compelled to investigate the family mystery while his siblings evinced so little interest ? How and why did Eda shield herself from the truth about her Nazi father ?

For some mysteries there are answers . For others , alas , there are not .
