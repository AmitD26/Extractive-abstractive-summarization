HLN head Ken Jautz takes over as executive vice president of CNN/US , replacing Jonathan Klein , who headed the network for six years . CNN 's chief marketing officer Scot Safon will run HLN , replacing Jautz .

`` Ken is a rarity -- a working journalist who is an even better news executive , '' wrote Walton in a memo to staff . `` Ken has launched , made profitable and turned around businesses for our news organization , Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner literally around the world . ''

Jautz , who joined CNN in 1989 as a bureau chief in Germany , has held a wide variety of jobs at the company , including executive vice president in charge of CNN 's business news operations . During a stint with Turner Broadcasting Europe , he helped launch channels in several European markets . Most recently , Jautz has presided over the revamp and rebranding of the HLN channel , introducing signature programs such as Nancy Grace , Joy Behar , ShowBiz Tonight , Issues with Jane Velez Mitchell and Morning Express with Robin Meade . The new evening line-up doubled the network 's prime-time ratings .

Safon takes over HLN after heading CNN 's marketing for the last eight years , winning wide industry accolades for his marketing campaign for CNN and CNN = Politics . Before joining CNN , Safon oversaw marketing for one of CNN 's sister channels , TNT .

`` Jon has made important contributions to the CNN story , and he leaves with our respect and friendship , and with my sincere thanks , '' Walton wrote to staff .

Walton said that a search is under way for the new position of company-wide managing editor . The assignment for the new editor , Walton wrote to staff , is to generate `` the kind of front-page reporting and analysis that captures a news event , translates its meaning and shapes the dialogue about the story . ''

Phil Kent , CEO of Turner Broadcasting System , the parent company of CNN , also highlighted the role of the new managing editor position , saying it would `` build on the network 's unique strengths in journalism and on CNN 's quality editorial voice across all platforms . ''

`` Jim Walton is a world-class leader , and I 'm in full support of his newly announced organizational structure and leadership team , '' Kent said . `` I believe these changes will position CNN/U . S. and HLN for future growth and success . ''
