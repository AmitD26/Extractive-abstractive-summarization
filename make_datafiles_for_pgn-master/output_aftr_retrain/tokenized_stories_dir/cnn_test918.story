But some other concerns are just timeless .

`` Do n't underestimate the pull of safety and security in the minds of American voters , '' said Candy Crowley , host of CNN 's `` State of the Union '' and moderator of last week 's presidential debate . `` There is no issue closer to home and hearth than the safety and security of your family . That is the most basic question the federal government has to answer . ''

President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney face off Monday night in the last of the three presidential debates , and they will be looking to convince voters that they can protect America and American interests abroad better than their opponent .

Here 's a look at these likely debate topics and what 's at stake for Americans .

Afghanistan : Will the war really be over soon ?

Obama has promised to withdraw combat troops in Afghanistan by the end of 2014 , 13 years after the war began . Romney has said he would generally abide by the deadline , although he said he would solicit the advice of military commanders first .

But the feasibility of that plan is being questioned after some recent setbacks , including a rise in `` green-on-blue '' insider attacks .

`` Insider attacks are particularly worrying because they call into question the most critical pillar of the Obama administration 's Afghanistan strategy , which is to train and build a capable and credible Afghan force that can maintain security and prevent the return of the Taliban and al Qaeda after foreign troops ' departure in two years , '' said Ahmad Majidyar , a senior research associate at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute . `` Training and mentoring requires close partnership and is impossible without trust . ''

5 things to watch in tonight 's debate

Polls have shown that most Americans are tired of the war . A CNN/ORC International survey from March indicated that only 25 % of Americans favored the war , and 55 % said the U.S. should remove all of its troops before 2014 .

Iran : Are we nearing the ` red line ' ?

While the U.S. tries to end one war , it is trying to prevent another .

There are fears that Israel might stage a pre-emptive attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities , drawing the U.S. into conflict . Or that the U.S. might be the one to attack to protect its ally Israel .

This `` red line '' is under dispute . Experts and policymakers differ about the time Iran would need to develop a nuclear weapon . But the clock is ticking .

`` America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy , and we believe that there is still time and space to do so , '' Obama said . `` But that time is not unlimited .

`` Just imagine Iranian aggression with nuclear weapons , '' Netanyahu said at the U.N. `` Who among you would feel safe in the Middle East ? Who would be safe in Europe ? Who would be safe in America ? Who would be safe anywhere ? ''

Syria : Should America step in ?

Syria 's key role in the heart of the Middle East means there might be long-term geopolitical consequences at stake .

Many analysts see the conflict as a proxy war between Iran and its Sunni Arab rivals in the region , between Iran and the United States , and even between the United States and Russia . There are also concerns that Syria could devolve , like Iraq once did , into a bloody , sectarian battle that could further destabilize the region .

And any time you talk about instability in the Middle East , there are worries about al Qaeda and other hard-line militants filling any power vacuums or failed states .

`` Syria 's problems will not stay confined to Syria , '' he said . `` Syria is a multi-sectarian society with shared identities with groups in other countries . As a result , the sectarian tensions that are being unleashed there are also spilling over from Syria 's borders . ''

Terrorism : Bin Laden 's dead . Now what ?

Obama has been criticized for security failings at the embassy and for not having enough intelligence about the attack , especially in the immediate aftermath . Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the tragedy reflects the president 's foreign policy failings .

Obama has taken an aggressive approach to pursuing al Qaeda terrorists abroad , and he 's authorized six times as many drone strikes as his predecessor , according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen .

China : A different kind of threat

Obama has been applying pressure behind the scenes , said Adam Hersh , an economist at the Center for American Progress Action Fund , and China has raised its exchange rate nearly 8 % from 2010 to April 2012 . Other economists , however , think the yuan is still undervalued .

Another way China directly the U.S. is that it is one of America 's leading creditors . There is concern that because China owns so much U.S. debt , it might hold too much sway over what the U.S. wants to do in the future .

`` A nation with our current levels of unsustainable debt ... can not hope to sustain for very long its superiority from a military perspective , or its influence in world affairs , '' Adm. Michael Mullen , former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said last month .

So even if tonight 's debate is about foreign policy , expect the economy to make a cameo .
