-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney have targeted Ohio with incessant campaigning , a slew of television ads and nonstop political phone calls . The importance of the Buckeye State can not be overstated : Ohio has not voted for the loser in the presidential election since 1960 .

Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have visited Ohio 10 times in the past 30 days , including a rally in Dayton on Tuesday . Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan , have stumped 21 times . It is the second most-visited state on the campaign trail , behind only Florida , another swing state .

The Obama campaign has flooded the Ohio airwaves with $ 57 million in advertising ; Romney for President has spent $ 34 million -- anything to pick up the state 's vital 18 electoral votes .

In fact , Beck said , all political ad space in the major TV markets has been purchased through the November 6 election .

`` Ohio is ground zero for the jobs debate , '' GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said .

Castellanos , who was a top media adviser to the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign and a Romney adviser in 2008 , said Ohio is `` a microcosm of American swing voters : Reagan Democrats ; suburban soccer moms ; and even Up-Tinos , upwardly mobile Latinos , an increasingly important target for both parties . ''

If the campaigns needed any more ammo for their efforts , they got it on Monday . The latest collection of polls in Ohio shows a razor-thin margin separating the candidates . The CNN Poll of Polls shows Obama at 48 % and Romney at 45 % in the Buckeye State .

Pundits say that Ohio is a must-win state for Romney , that his chances for the necessary 270 electoral college votes become nearly impossible without carrying Ohio . `` This is the big one , '' King said .

The Romney campaign also has focused on three typically Republican states that went for Obama in 2008 : Indiana , North Carolina and Virginia .

Getting those three states , plus Ohio , would be crucial in electing Romney as the nation 's next president . By contrast , Obama could win by picking up Wisconsin , Iowa and Ohio . `` You could make an argument the president should just camp out right here in the Midwest , '' King said .

At the center of it all is Ohio , one of the nation 's great industrial states , with 11.5 million people . Cleveland , Akron , Youngstown and Toledo have traditionally voted Democrat in support of the auto , steel and tire unions , while Cincinnati and Columbus have leaned Republican .

Campaign enters final stretch

`` He started talking about binders . Binders ? '' Biden said . `` Whoa ! ''

Romney leads among men by a similar margin .

Beck attributes Romney 's comeback to three issues :

Obama and Biden have campaigned hard in Ohio and Michigan on Romney 's opinion piece that said to let Detroit go bankrupt , repeating the refrain `` Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive . `` A billboard in the Ohio city of Defiance , where GM has a plant , carried that same message for four weeks , but not before stirring a swirl of emotions .

`` A lot of people here were offended by it , Republicans and Democrats alike , '' said Mayor Bob Armstrong , a Democrat . `` The message was just not a good message . ''

The Defiance mayor said he hopes Americans `` stop all the bickering '' and `` get behind our president , whoever it might be , and put all this behind us . ''

In a sign of voter enthusiasm , more than 1.4 million Ohioans have voted or requested an absentee ballot since early and absentee voting began on October 2 . Almost a third of Ohioans voted early in 2008 , in large numbers for Obama . Republicans say they 're better organized this time around and hope to make inroads there .

One thing 's for sure , Beck said , Ohio voters can expect more campaign stops by the candidates , more phone calls , more political mailings . `` We 're pretty well-balanced between the two parties , '' Beck said . `` And that means both candidates are going to court Ohioans because both sides feel they can win . ''
