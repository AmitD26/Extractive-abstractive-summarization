-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Andy Murray is focused on winning his first grand slam title , but the Olympic tennis champion is facing new distractions following his success at London 2012 .

`` Some ask strange questions : What did I think of Prince Harry 's hotel photos ? What do I think about the Crown Jewels ? ''

Murray , seeded third in the absence of the injured Rafael Nadal , defeated Croatia 's Ivan Dodig on Wednesday for his second successive straight-sets victory in New York this week .

The Scot will next face either 30th seed Feliciano Lopez or his fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar .

Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer won his opening match in three sets , beating big-serving world No. 34 Kevin Anderson of South Africa .

He will next face another seasoned campaigner in Finland 's Jarkko Nieminen , who also reached the last eight back in 2005 .

The 20-year-old Harrison , who lost his first-round match last year , matched his 2010 debut achievement by beating Germany 's Benjamin Becker in straight sets .

Serbian eighth seed Janko Tipsarevic became the seventh man at this year 's tournament to win after dropping the first two sets , having faced a shock defeat at the hands of world No. 129 Guillaume Rufin .

Tipsarevic , whose quarterfinal achievement last year was his best result at a grand slam , finally triumphed in three hours 37 minutes against the 22-year-old Frenchman .

He will next face American Brian Baker , who continued his fairytale comeback by winning his first match at the tournament since his last appearance seven years ago .

The former second-ranked junior player had multiple surgeries which wrecked his career , and had been coaching tennis at Belmont University when he decided to return to the professional tour this year .

`` I had some nerves . I do n't think it was probably the prettiest match ever . A win is a win , '' said the 27-year-old , now ranked 70th despite still studying for a business degree and continuing his coaching role at Belmont .

`` I think just getting out and not having played the U.S. Open in seven years and having expectations and having a lot of friends and family just gives you ... I mean , it 's good nerves .

`` I think it helps you focus a little bit more and want it a little bit more , but it was exciting time to be back after so much time off . ''

Muller , who reached the last 16 in 2011 , earned a clash with Australia 's former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt , who is expected to retire after the tournament .
