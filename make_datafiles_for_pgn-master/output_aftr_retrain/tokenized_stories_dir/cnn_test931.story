Lance Armstrong has been revealing in his two-part exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey Thursday and Friday night , but critics say he is leaving out important details .

There has been a lot to learn from Armstrong and from those watching him as he starts to tell the truth .

Getting caught is just the beginning .

`` We would n't be sitting here if I did n't come back , '' Armstrong told Winfrey .

Cycling colleague Floyd Landis went public in 2010 with his own doping and leveled allegations at Armstrong as well . This eventually led to investigations against Armstrong .

Alternative steps for redemption

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency , which tests Olympic athletes for performance enhancing drugs , praised his televised interview as a `` small step in the right direction . ''

But it still would like a full confession of all of his doping activities , under oath at the USADA . The agency had started an investigation against Armstrong , who sued to try to stop it .

Armstrong said he would participate if the agency forms a broad `` truth and reconciliation commission , '' involving doping across the sport of cycling .

`` I was a bully , '' he told Winfrey of how he treated others who might expose his doping and lies .

` I want to compete again '

Things escalated to the level they did `` because of my actions and because of my words , and because of my attitude and my defiance , '' he said .

There were also allegations he still denies , like coercing teammates to dope as well .

He publicly derided those trying to expose him , ruining some of their lives . `` We sued so many people , '' Armstrong told Winfrey -- people who were telling the truth and lost to him in court in spite of it .

It was about controlling the narrative of his heroic story . `` If I did n't like what somebody said ... I tried to control that and said that 's a lie ; they 're liars , '' Armstrong said .

Be nice to people on your way up .

You may meet them on your way down . Lance has . And now the tables have turned .

Why we cheat

`` This was a guy who used to be my friend , who decimated me , '' said Betsy Andreu , the wife of one of Armstrong 's former teammates , who went public with doping allegations against Armstrong .

Andreu , author Daniel Coyle , journalist David Walsh , whom Armstrong attacked for writing about his doping for over a decade , former teammates and others he has discredited and sued have now gained plausibility .

They are already critiquing his confession and casting doubt on its completeness . Andreu and Coyle have called Armstrong out over his denial of allegations that he coerced teammates to use performance enhancing drugs .

It 's hard to regain trust .

Sunday Times journalist Walsh believes the cyclist 's bullying was worse than his lies and left behind deeper scars .

Cancer survivors ' mixed feelings

Armstrong said he had been ruthless because he `` expected to get whatever he wanted and to control every outcome . ''

`` There will be people who hear this and never forgive me , '' he said . `` I understand that . ''

The emotional damage to his children seemed to touch him the most .

Appearing to hold back tears , Armstrong said he confessed to the three oldest children over the recent holiday break . `` The older kids need to not be living with this issue in their lives , '' the athlete said . `` It is n't fair . ''

Speaking specifically about his 13-year-old son , whom he had heard defending him , Armstrong said he told the youth : `` Do n't defend me anymore . ''

Hindsight is 20/20 .

That he did not think it was cheating is the `` scariest '' part . `` I viewed it as a level playing field , '' he said , where most everybody doped .

Armstrong also does not believe he could have won cycling 's most prestigious race seven times in a row without performance enhancing drugs . And his success was not synonymous with contentment .

`` That was n't the happiest time of my life , '' Armstrong said of his championship years . He told Winfrey he felt happier giving her his confession .

But the nadir , Armstrong says , was his departure from his cancer awareness charity Livestrong , which distributed the iconic plastic yellow bracelets .

They first asked him to resign as chairman of the board .

He got out of the way and hopes the charity , which was built on his debunked fairy tale legacy , can carry on without him .

In place of a record seven wins by Lance Armstrong , the chronicles of the Tour de France bear seven record vacancies .

No one won .
