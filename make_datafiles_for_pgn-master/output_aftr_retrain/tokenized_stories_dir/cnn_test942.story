On the other hand , as of August this year , about 48 Tibetans , mostly Buddhist monks and nuns , have self-immolated in Tibetan parts of China . In March 2012 alone , seven people self-immolated , and Tibetan exiles in India have been setting themselves on fire . The political result ? Nothing .

So why does the self-immolation of one man accomplish so much , but the same gesture performed by so many others accomplishes nothing ? Perhaps the question should be phrased differently , because a closer look at Bouazizi 's deed and the Tibetan cases reveals that it is something other than the sheer number of self-immolations that makes them a catalyst for change .

Two more Tibetans self-immolate in China protest

Tunisians could easily identify with Bouazizi 's extreme predicament . His actions spoke to the community 's shared frustration and despair . But the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied . Some want a `` free Tibet , '' as do all Tibetan exiles , but others only want freedom of religion , or political autonomy , or the opportunity to study in Tibetan as opposed to Chinese , or the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet .

When a self-immolator like Bouazizi is perceived as taking upon himself the humiliations and shameful submissions , the collective cowardice and voluntary servitude of his people , he burns off , along with his body , the diffuse sense of shame and guilt that has been paralyzing his community .

The burning body thus becomes a site of cleansing , catharsis and regeneration . The community is going -- vicariously , but no less effectively -- through a `` purification by fire . '' And in the process an important thing takes place : That society reinvents itself , it is transformed from a shattered community into a political community .

Such a religious and cultural viewpoint must prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with the self-immolators . Accommodating this radical form of violence within a culture that has for centuries fed on cosmic compassion and political non-violence is not an easy process .

That is why the recent string of self-immolations in Tibetan parts of China is a sign that this could be changing . Most self-immolators are young -- some are teens -- which indicates that the new generation of politically aware Tibetans might have lost patience with the Dalai Lama 's nonviolent political philosophy and want to respond differently to the Chinese 's aggressive methods .

What we see now is possibly the beginning of a new type of political engagement in Tibet , a new pattern very different from Bouazizi 's and Palach 's , who emerged from communities that had been brought to their knees . Tibetans , instead , over the last 60 years have considered their nation as occupied , but not defeated . Since 1959 they have with some regularity risen against the Chinese authorities .

For many Tibetan monks and nuns of today the burning body has become a tool for the most resounding of self-assertions ; when you are in flames your presence can not be ignored anymore .

It is a shouting game of sorts , except that no party shouts . The Tibetans express themselves by burning ; the Chinese authorities do the same by shooting Tibetans . Then , another monk or nun engages in self-expression and everything starts anew .

Yet a Tunisian 's setting himself afire set off Arab spring , he says . Why was that different ?
