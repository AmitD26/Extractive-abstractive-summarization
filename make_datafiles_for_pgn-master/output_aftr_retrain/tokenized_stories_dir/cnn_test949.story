-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The medical aid charity , Medecins Sans Frontieres , is pulling international staff out of Somalia after three of its members were killed .

MSF says hundreds of thousands of Somalis need urgent aid .

The group -- sometimes known as Doctors Without Borders -- said 87 non-Somali staff have been withdrawn from 14 projects across the country .

U.N. officials have described the situation as a humanitarian crisis requiring worldwide efforts .

`` Mortality rates in several areas are far beyond emergency thresholds . Hundreds of thousands of Somalis are struggling to survive and are in urgent need of immediate assistance from the international community . They are the indirect victims of such attacks on humanitarian workers . ''

In recent months , Somali government troops backed by Ethiopian forces have battled Muslim militants daily , with the northern section of the capital Mogadishu hardest hit .

Many of the militants are aligned with the Islamic Courts Union , which controlled much of the country before being deposed in Ethiopia 's December 2006 invasion .

The United States accuses the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures and did not protest Ethiopia 's invasion .

In a statement issued Thursday , Amnesty International said : `` In the current humanitarian emergency in Somalia and amid massive violations of international humanitarian and human rights law , humanitarian workers , human rights defenders and journalists have been particular targets of all parties to the conflict .
