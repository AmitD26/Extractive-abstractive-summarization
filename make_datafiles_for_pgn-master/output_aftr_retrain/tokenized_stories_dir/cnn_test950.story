`` The drone strikes killed five al Qaeda fighters but other militants are still on the run and hiding in the area , '' one of the officials told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media . `` These parts of Shabwa have been strongholds for militants for more than a year , in large part because of the weak government security presence . ''

Residents in al-Saeed said the drones have been flying in the district for nearly a week .

FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress in May that al Qaeda and its affiliates , `` especially al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , currently represent the top counterterrorism threat to the nation . ''

The group was behind the so-called underwear bomb attempt on a U.S.-bound international flight on Christmas Day 2009 and an effort to smuggle bombs in printer cartridges onto U.S.-bound cargo planes in 2010 .

The Yemeni army killed hundreds of militants and arrested many others in the provinces of Abyan and Shabwa this year , after the terror group took advantage of a political stalemate in the country in 2011 to seize control of numerous towns in the south .

The drone strikes have sparked controversy in Yemen and Pakistan , where they 're also used to target militants , after civilians have been killed accidentally in some of the explosions .

Yemen 's parliament summoned Interior Minister Abdul-Kader Qahtan last month , demanding an explanation for a U.S. drone attack that killed 13 people , including two women , in the town of Rada in al-Baidha province .

Members of parliament demanded an immediate investigation into U.S. drone strikes that they said targeted `` innocent people '' under the pretext of fighting al Qaeda .

After taking office in February , Hadi vowed to continue fighting al Qaeda until the group is uprooted from the country .
