Damage assessments were under way in Plantation and Sunrise , Florida , after a suspected tornado swept through south Florida about 10 p.m. Tuesday . At the time , a tornado warning for the area was expiring , said Joel Gordon , battalion chief for the Plantation Fire Department .

Gordon said about 25 homes were damaged in Plantation . In Sunrise , another 25 were damaged , with six classified as uninhabitable , according to city spokeswoman Christine Pfeffer .

`` You 're in your house one minute and the next minute everything is moving , the house has shifted , '' said Laila Najm of Plantation , who was home with her mother and dog when the storm hit .

A tree fell on her home , causing the roof to leak , she said , and the house came off its foundation . Windows were broken , debris and standing water littered her porch and the home lacked running water on Wednesday . Her car windows were broken as well .

Three people sustained minor injuries in Plantation , but none were transported to a hospital , Gordon said . Some gas leaks from propane cylinders were reported , he said , and `` we were able to secure those without any major damage or issues . ''

`` The biggest thing we 're trying to get out to the public is to please stay off the roads , '' he said . `` The roads in this area are very small , they 're tight . We have to get big equipment through . ''

A barn was also destroyed , and a house next to the VFW was damaged , he said . The homeowner reported `` it sounded like a freight train coming through the house , '' Schobel said .

`` Bands of thunderstorms with frequent lightning are hitting the middle and lower Keys , '' the statement said . `` A secondary cell of storms is moving eastward which is expected to impact all of Monroe County for several hours . The superintendent does not want students at bus stops in standing water with the frequent lightning . ''
