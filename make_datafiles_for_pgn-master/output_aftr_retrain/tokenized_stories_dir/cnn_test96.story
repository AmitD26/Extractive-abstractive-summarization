With its capital in Juba , South Sudan became independent last year following decades of civil war . Its arrival in the international community was celebrated at the time , but conflict with the Sudanese regime soon resumed .

Border clashes have brought the countries to the brink of war and left South Sudan coping with a massive humanitarian crisis as people flee the fighting .

South Sudan obtained around 70 % of the formerly united country 's oil reserves when it became independent last year . But the countries have been unable to agree on how much the landlocked South should pay to use infrastructure that remains in Sudan .

South Sudan shut down production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $ 815 million worth of its oil . Sudan said it confiscated the crude to make up for unpaid fees .

The shutdown has sent the economies of both countries reeling , but South Sudan has been hit particularly hard by the loss of income from virtually its only export .

The young nation has also wrestled with corruption in its first year .
