President Barack Obama is in a stand-off with House Speaker John Boehner over the issue , and Congress might vote on measures to restrict funding for the mission this week to protest what Boehner says is Obama 's violation of the war powers law .

The president disagrees , based on a legal analysis of the situation backed by his general counsel , the State Department and Defense Secretary Robert Gates , Carney said .

House Republican sources told CNN on Monday that several options are under consideration for votes this week -- probably Thursday -- to exert some congressional control over the Libya mission . No decision will be made on how to proceed until GOP legislators return Tuesday from a long weekend in their districts .

`` Ultimately -LRB- the legislation -RRB- needs to have enough teeth for it to be to worth it , '' said one senior House GOP aide .

The House already was planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill this week , and legislators including liberal Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio intend to propose an amendment to cut off funding for the Libya mission .

In addition , House members were further angered by news of strong disagreement within the Obama administration over the president 's analysis of whether the Libya mission came under the War Powers Resolution .

The New York Times reported Saturday that a lead attorney for the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel as well as counsel at the Pentagon argued internally that the president needs congressional authorization for the Libya mission , and the president overruled them .

`` For me to get up and tell you that by some miracle , every lawyer in this administration was in agreement on that issue , you would n't believe me , because it 's simply been too contentious for now 38 years , '' Carney said .

`` The president 's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya , but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring -LRB- Libyan leader Moammar -RRB- Gadhafi down , '' conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' later adding that Obama `` needs to step up his game with Libya but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi . ''

Gates also backed the Libyan mission , saying Obama was right to limit the scope of U.S. involvement and that he believes the president has complied with the War Powers Resolution .

Obama responded with a report to Congress last week that argued the limited role of U.S. forces in the NATO-led Libya mission failed to constitute engaging in hostilities as defined by the War Power Resolution .

On Friday , Boehner said he specifically asked if the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel agreed with the administration 's legal analysis , and that the White House 's failure to answer that question made cutting funds for the mission a possibility .

`` The House of Representatives will not allow the White House to continue skirting its obligations to the American people , this Congress , and the laws of this nation , '' Boehner said in a statement . `` Over the coming week , our members will review all options available to hold the administration to account . ''

Passed in 1973 , the War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war , followed by a 30-day extension to end the hostilities . That 90-day period ended Sunday .

In the Senate , Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts have drafted a resolution that supports the Libyan mission . If adopted by Congress , the resolution would serve as congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution , they say .

Congressional opponents of the Libya mission include liberals such as Kucinich who generally oppose any war effort , as well as some Republicans who complain its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Gadhafi 's ouster . The opponents also say the Libya situation could become a stalemate that drains resources at a time of mounting federal deficits that must be addressed .
