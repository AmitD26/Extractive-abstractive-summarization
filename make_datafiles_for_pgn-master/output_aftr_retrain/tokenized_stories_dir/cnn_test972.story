-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Boston Marathon bombings were horrific and senseless crimes . Thus far , all the publicly released evidence suggests that the crimes were the work of just two individuals , the Tsarnaev brothers .

There have been numerous calls to prosecute Tsarnaev in federal court because federal law offers the possibility of the death penalty , but Massachusetts law does not . This would be a very poor basis upon which to make the choice .

In the Oklahoma City bombing , the federal prosecution was given priority because Timothy McVeigh was motivated by hatred of the federal government to directly attack it , destroying a federal building and killing scores of federal employees and their children in the process .

Did one brother brainwash the other ?

There does not appear to be a similar federal interest here . The Boston Marathon is the quintessential Boston event , and the victims were predominantly Massachusetts residents . Those killed by the blast were a local restaurant manager , a schoolchild and an international student attending Boston University . The law enforcement officer victims were an MBTA Transit Police officer and an MIT campus police officer .

The crimes , in addition to the bombings , included an attempted convenience store robbery and a carjacking , crimes typically prosecuted in state court .

Opinion : Nine questions about the bombers

One option that clearly should not be on the table is any effort to treat Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant . He is an American citizen . Just like McVeigh , he is entitled to all the rights and privileges afforded citizens under the U.S. Constitution and does not forfeit them because he appears to have committed heinous crimes .

And if and when Tsarnaev is well enough to be questioned , the interrogation should start with a Miranda warning . Now that the crisis has passed , there is no urgent need to invoke the New York v. Quarles `` public safety exception '' as a means of circumventing this young man 's constitutional rights .

Boston is the cradle of American liberty and is justifiably famous for its rejection of oppressive and tyrannical government . Let us not sully that reputation by sacrificing Tsarnaev 's civil liberties in the heat of the moment .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frakt .

Many say bombing suspect 's trial should be in federal court due to death penalty

Former prosecutor David Frakt says that 's a poor basis for a decision on where to try him

@highlight

He says the case seems more focused on state matters , belongs in Mass. court

Frakt : Do n't treat Tsarnaev as `` enemy combatant '' ; do n't deny him civil liberties
