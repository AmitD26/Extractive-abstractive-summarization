`` Arrested Development '' fans can hardly wait for its sweet return on Netflix at the end of this month , so what 's a few hours in line to get a photograph with the series-inspired Bluth 's Original Frozen Banana stand , making its way around New York this week .

Actor Terry Crews , who joined the cast this season , greeted the throngs . Posing with the two actors serving the bananas , he delivered a famous line from the series : `` There 's always money in the banana stand . ''

Produced by Ron Howard , `` Arrested Development '' follows the bizarre moments shared by Michael Bluth -LRB- portrayed by Jason Bateman -RRB- and his eccentric family . The heart of the sitcom is its over-the-top characters played by Michael Cera , Will Arnett and Portia de Rossi , to name a few .

New co-star Crews says his personal favorite is Lindsay Bluth , played by de Rossi . `` The Lindsay character is so pathetic in so many ways , '' he said . However , he also has a special place in his heart for Tony Hale 's character , Buster Bluth .

`` He put his whole life into bringing this show back for the fans , and Netflix provided the wonderful opportunity , '' Crews said . `` It 's an iconic thing , and it 's an amazing thing to watch this happen . ''

Crews -- a fan of the show who said he was thrilled to get the call from Hurwitz to join the revived series -- considers the release of an entire season at once to be a game-changer for the industry .

But thanks to Netflix , he said , `` You can tell the story as much as you want , and you can follow it as much as you want . ''

The actor points to the success of Netflix 's original series `` House of Cards '' as proof that releasing an entire season at one time can actually fuel fans ' hunger for more . And with only days remaining in `` The Final Countdown '' to `` Arrested Development , '' questions are already being raised as to what comes next .

`` I think definitely the next step after this is a movie , '' Crews said , adding to Hurwitz 's hints that he has tailored the new season to lead to film . `` If ` Veronica Mars ' can get Kickstarted into a movie , look at what the ` AD ' crew is about and what this about . We could make this happen . ''
