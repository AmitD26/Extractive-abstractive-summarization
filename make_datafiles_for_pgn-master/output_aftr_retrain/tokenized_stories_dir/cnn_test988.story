-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For award-winning Nigerian film director Obi Emelonye , the London premiere of `` Last flight to Abuja '' in early June was supposed to be a celebratory event , a marquee moment introducing his suspense-filled airplane disaster thriller to the rest of the world with pomp and grandeur .

But then June 3rd happened .

On that fateful Sunday , the Dana Air Flight 992 from the Nigerian capital of Abuja crashed into a densely populated neighborhood in Lagos , killing all 153 people aboard as well as at least 10 people on the ground .

The tragic news left Emelonye , whose high-octane action movie is based on a series of fatal air crashes that stunned Nigeria in 2006 , in a state of shock .

But after consulting his team , Nigerian officials and some of the families of the bereaved , Emelonye was convinced to go ahead with the original plan , using the movie to spotlight aviation safety in Nigeria .

`` They said ` no , this might end up being one of the longest lasting legacies to the lives of these people that were lost so needlessly in those crashes , ' '' he remembers . `` This film was supposed to flag some of those issues that have now taken their lives , so it 's in their interest that this story goes out there -- if for nothing , to put the issue of aviation safety squarely in the public agenda so that we do n't forget . ''

`` The film has taken on added significance way beyond my planning , '' he explains . `` It has become an advocacy ... for aviation safety , not just in Nigeria but for the whole of Africa , and it 's a responsibility I take very seriously . ''
