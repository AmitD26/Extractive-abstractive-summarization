President Clinton , at the 2000 Correspondents ' Dinner , mentioned that he was a fan of that night 's comedian , Jay Leno : `` Because , together , we give hope to gray-haired , chunky baby boomers everywhere . ''

And then there was President George W. Bush . There are no words to describe my gratitude for all the material he provided comedians . But he could also be intentionally funny at his own expense .

At the 2001 Correspondents ' Dinner , Bush took out a book written about his verbal gaffes and reviewed them with the audience . One of the funniest moments was regarding his famous grammatically incorrect line `` Rarely is the question asked : ` Is our children learning ? ' '' Bush then comically explained , `` If they would read it closely , they would see I 'm using the transitive plural tense , so the word ` is ' are correct . ''

Now , let 's look at Obama . Yes , he has often used self-deprecating humor .

For example , at the 2011 White House Correspondents ' Dinner , he joked , `` Some people now suggest that I 'm too professorial . And I 'd like to address that head-on by assigning all of you some reading that will help you draw your own conclusions . ''

But here 's where Obama has increasingly taken presidential comedy to a new place . At that same event , Obama took on two critics point-blank , using cutting humor . The first was the thin-skinned Donald Trump , who at that time was considering running for president against Obama in 2012 .

Obama made three sharply barbed jokes at Trump 's expense . One was about how trivial Trump 's decisions on `` The Apprentice '' were when compared with that of the POTUS . The second ridiculed Trump for what he would allegedly do to the White House if he won : turn it into a garish-looking hotel and spa .

And then at the Alfred E. Smith Dinner in New York a few weeks before the most recent presidential election , Obama mocked Romney again : `` Earlier today , I went shopping at some stores in Midtown . I understand Gov. Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown . ''

You can dismiss these as simply jokes , but then you are n't grasping how political comedy works . These jokes are funny but also have a message embedded within . For example , the jokes about Romney intentionally furthered the image Obama wanted to paint of Mitt , namely that he was very wealthy and out of touch with the average person .

The change in presidential humor , I believe , can be traced to the influence of `` The Daily Show . '' Since 1999 , Jon Stewart has redefined political comedy , using it to entertain , educate and eviscerate . Obama and his joke-writers have simply embraced this style of political comedy to comically undermine critics .

Like it or not , those seeking the presidency in 2016 better do more than build a network of fundraisers and supporters . You 'd better work on your comedic barbs , because American politics is becoming the country 's toughest room to play .
