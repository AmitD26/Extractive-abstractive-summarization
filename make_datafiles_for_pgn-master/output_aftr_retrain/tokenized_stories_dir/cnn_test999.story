Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dozens of Chinese workers angry over a pay dispute have held their U.S. boss hostage for five days , the American businessman said .

Starnes was calm but looked haggard , wearing the same blue jeans and a blue shirt that he said he has been wearing since last week .

The incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division . He said he transferred workers to another division , but some workers did not want to move . So the company gave them severance packages .

Starnes said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages .

But workers who spoke to CNN from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account . Some said they 're owed two months ' worth of back pay and feared everyone at the plant would be laid off , as they claimed no new materials had entered the factory .

Starnes disputed that .

Starnes said the employees have n't caused any physical harm but have disrupted his sleep by banging on doors and windows .

He has a cot and is receiving three meals a day , said Les Capella , the U.S president of Specialty Medical Supplies .

Capella said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave . But he said the 80 to 100 employees at odds are demanding about $ 500,000 -- which would bankrupt the company .
