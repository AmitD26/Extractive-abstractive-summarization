Seoul -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South Korea 's actions toward Pyongyang after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il were intended to show that Seoul does not have animosity toward the North , President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said in a meeting with political leaders Thursday .

Lee told members of the governing and opposition parties that he believed North Korea had probably not expected South Korea to take such measures toward the North .

Seoul expressed its sympathy to the North Korean people through a statement on Tuesday , a day after North Korea 's state-run media announced the death of Kim .

South Korea also said that while it would not send an official delegation to the North , it would allow a limited number of private groups to send delegations to the North if desired . It also announced that it would let civilian groups send messages of condolence to the North upon approval of the Unification Ministry in Seoul .

Pyongyang said Thursday that it would welcome a private delegation from Hyundai Asan , a South Korean company with heavy investments in the North , to pay respects to Kim .

North Korea delivered the message -- addressed to the chairwoman of Hyundai Group , Hyun Jeong-eun -- through the company 's office in the North 's Kaesong Industrial Park some 45 kilometers -LRB- 27 miles -RRB- north of Seoul , said Roh Jee-hwan , a Hyundai spokesman .

Hyundai Asan has held a working level meeting with the government to discuss the details of the trip , according to the Unification Ministry .

The recent moves have been considered a break from the hardline approach to the North that Lee 's administration had taken since coming into office in 2008 . It contrasted with Seoul 's reaction to the death of North Korea 's founder , Kim Il Sung , in 1994 when the conservative South Korean government at the time did not offer its condolences .

`` The swift stabilization of North Korea 's leadership is in the interest of all neighboring countries , '' Lee said Thursday .

Many observers see the recent moves as efforts by Lee to improve the soured relationship with Pyongyang after tensions flared last year because of the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel and the shelling of an island near Seoul .

Seoul demanded an apology for the sinking of the ship , which killed 46 seamen , but Pyongyang denied involvement . And North Korea said the South had provoked the bombing of the island , which led to four deaths .

`` The death of Kim Jong Il can be seen both as a crisis and an opportunity , '' said Kwon Young-se , the chairman of the South Korean Parliament 's Intelligence Committee and a member of Mr Lee 's governing party . `` The decision that the Lee Myung-bak administration made to express its condolences , I think , reflects a choice to consider what has happened in the past but also think about the future . ''

Kwon said he believes that by extending sympathy to the people of North Korea , as opposed to North Korea as a country , the Lee administration has found its own compromise .

Lee 's efforts with the North are much less advanced than those of the two previous governments , under which the leaders of the two Koreas held summit talks in Pyongyang , Kwon said , but noted that Lee has made the first step toward improving what had become a tense , cold relationship between the two capitals .

Public opinion in the South is divided on whether it is appropriate to pay respects to Kim .

Critics have called for a more proactive approach by Lee , suggesting that sending condolences to the North Korean people was too indirect .

Some South Koreans argue that now is the time for Seoul to seize an opportunity to make a breakthrough in North and South relations , while others say the idea of paying respects to the dictator is out of the question .

`` We do n't pay respects in the South to someone who has committed atrocities , why are we even discussing this issue ? '' an internet user posted on an online message board under the username hwachon11 _ 1 .

`` I know there 's a lot of debate about the issue , but I think we need to see the North as a nation that we want to reunify with '' a person using the name brit4men posted on the same message board . `` I think it 's only appropriate we send a delegation . ''
