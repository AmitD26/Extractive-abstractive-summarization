-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Get ready : The 2016 campaign for the White House is getting under way .

Among those attending next week 's Republican Governors Association meeting in Las Vegas are the group 's chairman , Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell , as well as popular Republican governors such as New Jersey 's Chris Christie , Wisconsin 's Scott Walker and Louisiana 's Bobby Jindal .

While the RGA 's annual confabs are all about policy and politics , 2016 is sure to come up because all four governors are thought to be contenders for the party 's next presidential nomination .

Even though the 2012 election is barely in the rear view mirror , speculation over the next race for the White House is getting started . With President Barack Obama winning a second term on Tuesday , an incumbent will not run in 2016 , meaning both parties may have competitive nomination battles .

Biden : ` You 'll vote for me in 2016 '

The two names grabbing the most attention in the hunt for the next Democratic nomination are Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .

As he was leaving a Delaware voting booth on Election Day , Biden was asked whether it was the last time he 'd cast a ballot for himself .

`` No , I do n't think so , '' he replied , smiling .

Last month , he dropped a mention of a possible '16 bid . While on a phone call with a voter in Florida , the vice president discussed health care and insurance , making his case for the president 's health care reform law .

`` And after it 's all over , when your insurance rates go down , then you 'll vote for me in 2016 , '' he said .

Biden , who will be 73 on Election Day 2016 , made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008 .

As for Hillary Clinton , it does n't matter how many times the soon-to-be-former secretary of state says she wo n't run for president again , there 's always speculation that she may change her mind between now and the next presidential cycle .

When asked by Marie Claire magazine last month if she would make another bid for the White House , she said , `` No , I 'm not . ''

Hillary Clinton repeats ` no ' for 2016

`` I have been on this high wire of national and international politics and leadership for 20 years , '' Clinton said . `` It has been an absolutely extraordinary personal honor and experience . But I really want to just have my own time back . I want to just be my own person . I 'm looking forward to that . ''

But until she makes a Shermanesque statement , speculation will continue .

`` The truth is , everyone else is frozen until Hillary decides what she wants to do , '' a Democratic strategist , who asked to remain anonymous , told CNN .

In addition to Biden and Clinton , there are some other possibilities .

Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo did not run for the Democratic nomination in 1992 , which went to Bill Clinton , but will his son , New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo , go where his father did not ? Cuomo is up for re-election in 2014 .

Also possibly considering the White House is term-limited Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley , the current chairman of the Democratic Governors Association .

Other governors who might be considering runs are Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and outgoing Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer .

And then there 's the U.S. Senate , where all 100 members may imagine themselves as president . Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia , Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota , Kirsten Gillibrand of New York , and even Sen.-elect Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts could be on any list of potential presidential candidates .

The Democratic strategist has some advice for potential candidates : `` Everyone who wants to run for president in the Democratic Party should beat a path to Jim Messina 's door . Then camp out in Iowa . ''

Messina was Obama 's campaign manager , and Iowa , of course , traditionally kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar .

As for the Republicans , Christie is at the top of any potential list . But before any run for the White House , the New Jersey governor next year faces what may be a tough re-election campaign in a blue state .

McDonnell , who is term-limited at the end of this year and who was considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney , may want to make a bid for the top spot .

Walker is a hero to many conservatives , thanks to his battles against public sector workers in Wisconsin . After surviving a recall election this year , Walker is up for re-election in 2014 .

Christie : Romney ` did n't get enough votes '

Jindal , who 's very popular among fiscal as well as social conservatives , is also entertaining thoughts of running for president , and Texas Gov. Rick Perry , who has to decide about running for re-election in 2014 , may also take a second shot at the GOP nomination .

Romney 's running mate , Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin , returns to his leadership role in the House . Will Ryan , a favorite of fiscal conservatives and many tea party activists , make a run for the top spot in the next presidential cycle ?

This week 's election proved that the GOP has a problem with Latino voters . Will freshman Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , a GOP rock star who 's urging his party to address this problem , make a run for the White House ? If he does n't , maybe his mentor , two-term former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , who has strong relations with the Hispanic community , could make a bid .

Rubio , by the way , will be in Iowa in a week and a half to headline an event for the state 's Republican governor .

Rubio is n't the only Republican senator whose name comes up . Add John Thune of South Dakota to the list . And will freshman Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky follow in his father 's footsteps and run for president ?

Rand Paul talks 2016 prospects

The GOP is famous for awarding the nomination to the candidate who came in second in the previous primary cycle , like with Romney this time . If that 's the case , then watch former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania . He gave Romney a run for his money , he 's from an electoral-vote-rich state that the Republicans think they can reclaim , he 's got a working-class background , and he 's beloved by social conservatives .

Add in two more names from the 2008 cycle : Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , who performed much better than expected in the GOP primaries , and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , who was her party 's vice presidential nominee that year . Huckabee is still popular , thanks to his radio programs and weekly show on Fox News Channel , and Palin still commands a loyal conservative following .

`` There is a vacuum of leadership right now in the Republican Party . Whoever steps up right now to point the party toward its future will help the party and advance their own fortunes politically , '' says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos .

But Castellanos , who was a senior media adviser to Romney 's 2008 White House bid , says do n't look to the past .

Wishing for a Rubio run

`` The next Republican nominee will be tasked with taking the party into the future . It wo n't be the old retreads . It wo n't be Santorum , Huckabee or Palin . We need a new Republican from the ranks of GOP governors , senators , or even Jeb Bush and -LRB- former Secretary of State -RRB- Condi Rice who still represent the GOP 's future . ''

So what do these possible 2016 wannabes do as the very early preseason begins ?

If they do n't have leadership PACs already , they form them , make speeches , campaign for fellow party members in the 2013 and 2014 races , write books and do cable news interviews , as they build up allies and support in the states that vote early in the primary and caucus calendar .

`` This is n't a phase where people decide to run for president , it 's when they start to do things that leave that door open , '' says a different Democratic strategist , who predicts that `` there will be a wide open field on both sides next time around . ''
