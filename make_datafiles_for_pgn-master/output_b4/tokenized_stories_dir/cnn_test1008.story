-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Facebook wants to cut clutter .

The social media site , which has more than 1 billion users , on Thursday announced a newly redesigned news feed that blows up photos and visual content , and adds categories that focus on specific types of content . The Web version of the social network now looks much more like the mobile apps , which are also getting a revamping .

Facebook announced the changes during a media event at its headquarters in Menlo Park , California . The new Web version will roll out slowly to users starting Thursday , and updated iOS and Android apps will be available in the coming weeks .

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg compared the revamped feed to a local newspaper and the new channels to the traditional sections , such as sports and business , you 'd find there .

`` I think that there 's this important and social place in this world for this customized newspaper , '' Zuckerberg said .

He did n't note the irony of comparing Facebook to an industry that his site and others are marginalizing .

The news feed is the first , and sometimes only , page people see when they log on to the Facebook website or fire up a Facebook mobile app . The nerve center of the Facebook experience , the news feed fills the middle of this home screen with updates , photos , articles and other content and activity from your friends , such as likes and app updates . Interspersed among that somewhat-chronological content are posts from pages you follow and targeted ads .

The main page , which Facebook is calling the `` front page '' to go with its newspaper metaphor , is adding categories so people can look at a more narrow feed of specific types of content as an alternative to the all-in-one view . There are views for all friends , most recent , close friends , music , photos , games and following .

Photos will show every single image your friends post as well as the photos posted by the pages you follow , including anything shared to Facebook from Instagram . The music channel will show a combination of nearby concerts , feeds from musicians you follow and the songs friends are listing to with third-party apps such as Spotify . The channels will appear on the mobile apps and Web versions of Facebook .

`` Everyone 's going to start on the front page like they do today . This just gives people more power to dig into the topics they care about , '' Zuckerberg said .

The individual elements that populate the news feed have been redesigned to fill the page better , the company maintains . Text is taking a back seat to visual content , which now makes up almost 30 % of the content in the news feed , according to Zuckerberg . Photos , videos and albums are bigger . Shared articles show a bigger image and larger summary along with a logo for the publisher . Content in the feed about individuals and pages will show a little slice of their timeline , including their cover photo and a button to add them as a friend or to like the page . Maps and posts for third-party apps such as Pinterest have also been cleaned up .

Previously , the news feed occupied less than 40 % of the real estate on the Facebook home page , according to Julie Zhuo , Facebook 's director of design . To cut down on clutter and give the feed more room to breathe , navigation elements on the left have been slimmed down to a narrow black column of icons , similar to the mobile interface .

One thing that 's not changing is the algorithm that decides what posts are displayed in a feed , which has received some criticism . Zuckerberg defended the practice of not showing a full and complete chronological feed of all content , saying people benefit from more important content , such as major life events , being given a more prominent place in their feeds .

The filters might be great for users , but they could have a negative effect on companies that have sunk money into promoting their pages and gathering fans , said one analyst . Those fans can switch to a more narrow feed of just their friends -LRB- or music content or photos -RRB- that does n't include brand pages , potentially making it more difficult for companies to reach their followers .

`` It 's going to continue to erode the value of companies having Facebook pages and fans , '' said Forrester analyst Nate Elliott . `` Facebook is walking a really fine line , they 're not providing enough value . ''

Ads will still be featured on the friends-only feeds , so companies and brands that want to reach people who switch to those views can by buying advertising from Facebook . Elliot says this could be interpreted as a `` bait and switch '' by marketers .

Ads -- which are included in the redesign -- are Facebook 's primary source of income . The company made $ 4.2 billion off advertising in 2012 , which accounted for 82 % of the social network 's total revenue , according to Engadget . Most of that ad money comes from the Web version of Facebook , and 23 % was from ads on mobile devices .

The company may get money from advertisers , but it needs to keep the users who click on those ads engaged , active and happy on the network .
