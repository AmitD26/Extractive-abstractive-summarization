-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just moments after Mitt Romney triumphantly introduced Congressman Paul Ryan to American voters on the deck of the battleship USS Wisconsin , I happened to witness a heart-wrenching event on the tarmac of an airport hundreds of miles away : The casket of a fallen service member was returning home to his family in Florida .

As I stood silently with a group of passengers watching a small honor guard march to attention , the hearse backing up to the conveyor belt , and the grieving family members holding each other up , I was reminded again that a nation 's foreign policy has direct impact on all our lives .

If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war ? How will the election reshape our policies toward the rest of the world ?

The selection of Ryan as Romney 's running mate has heated the spotlight on the economy , on the huge and growing national debt , and on the large number of Americans who , years after the start of recession , remain unemployed . Sensing Obama 's vulnerability , Romney and Ryan would like to keep the focus there . But international conflicts have a way of intruding on the best agendas of American statesmen and political strategists .

President George W. Bush did not expect 9/11 -LRB- crazy conspiracy theories aside -RRB- , just as Obama had no idea that the Arab uprisings would transform a key region of the world and test his skill in a series of conflicts , some of which confronted America 's values against its alliances .

We do know that whoever sits in the Oval Office will face tough decisions on Iran and Syria , two problematic countries that are likely to demand attention at or near the top of the foreign policy rundown . And , we know that when the next presidential term starts , as many as 68,000 U.S. service members may remain in Afghanistan .

A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning . The Republican duo differs dramatically from Obama and Vice President Joe Biden when it comes to economic policy , but on foreign affairs it 's hard to find a truly sharp disagreement on fundamental issues , despite dissimilarities in tone .

When it comes to cheering America 's greatness , Obama was at first reluctant . `` I believe in American exceptionalism , '' he famously said , `` just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism . '' He added that he is `` enormously proud '' of America , but the qualified statement opened a new flank . That was in 2009 .

Obama has since learned his lesson about being shy in praising America . And so did Romney , who tried to draw a distinction with the president by launching his campaign with a book unsubtly titled , `` No Apology : The Case for American Greatness . ''

In a speech last year , Ryan waxed idealistic about America , talking about the need for `` energetic '' American leadership , about the `` fundamental desire for liberty '' in all human beings and the need to promote our `` moral principles . '' But he quickly pulled the soaring idealism back to earth , saying policy should be `` tempered by a healthy humility about the extent of our power . '' In other words , do not compromise our values unless we have to . And , by the way , we have to .

American exceptionalism : 2012 winner must unite America on ideals

Ryan , who has no foreign policy experience and has spoken little of it , outlined the dilemma facing the U.S. when he spoke about the Arab uprisings . `` We are seeing long-repressed populations giving voice to a fundamental desire for liberty , '' he said approvingly , but then he worried about the possibility that the end of one dictatorship would open the way for another .

Regarding Afghanistan , the war in which Americans are serving and dying , Romney and Obama have , incredibly , largely avoided the topic . Despite vague criticisms , Romney is on record supporting Obama 's plan to remove American forces .

Romney once , a little bafflingly , declared that Russia is America 's main foe . In reality , whoever wins the election will need Russia 's cooperation on the global stage to counter vital and urgent problems .

On Iran , arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for America , both Romney and Obama have stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons . Both have said `` all options '' remain on the table to prevent that from happening , including a military strike .

And despite criticism of Obama 's approach to Israel , Romney agrees with Obama that Israel is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of U.S. foreign policy .

Romney and Ryan may ultimately speak more forcefully in public settings about the Middle East -- and that is easier to do when you do n't yet hold power -- but the fact is that Obama has earned high praise from many Israeli hawks . And if you look closely at Romney 's proposals for Iran , what he calls for is more economic sanctions .

When Romney took his recent overseas trip , his objective was to highlight differences with Obama . He drew criticism when he called Jerusalem Israel 's capital , but that 's exactly what Obama said when he was running for office . Obama went even further , saying `` Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided . ''

To be sure , rhetoric and images matter a lot . Obama 's effort to win over Muslims , which has largely failed , created the impression that the alliance between Israel and the United States is not as strong as it once was . That image has real world repercussions . And the chill that surrounds meetings between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is real . But the relationship is based on much more than ties of friendship between leaders .

The two campaigns have differences in some areas , particularly regarding the future Pentagon budget , which Obama would cut by $ 500 billion in 10 years . Romney would spend more to expand the Navy , part of a strategy that looks at China as an upcoming rival . That China `` pivot , '' by the way , is shared with the Obama administration .

But overall , America 's foreign policy choices , based on national interest , national values , strategic considerations and popular opinion , will not significantly change regardless of whether Obama or Romney wins the presidential election .

Romney and Ryan , if they win , are likely to up American involvement in the Syrian conflict , and they may well preside over an American conflict with Iran . But Obama may do just the same .
