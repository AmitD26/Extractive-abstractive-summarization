-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The FBI said Monday night that a Tennessee mother and her 14-year-old daughter are dead , though the man they believe abducted them -- along with two other daughters -- remains at large .

Authorities previously reported that they had found two bodies Friday at a Guntown , Mississippi , residence tied to the kidnapping suspect , Adam Mayes . But it was not until Monday that the Shelby County , Tennessee , medical examiner positively identified the pair as Jo Ann Bain , 31 , and her daughter Adrienne Bain , according to the FBI .

Mayes is considered armed and dangerous , with authorities asking for the public 's help in tracking down him and the two other girls , 12-year-old Alexandria Bain and 8-year-old Kyliyah Bain , whom he also allegedly abducted .

Authorities established contact with and tried to interview the 35-year-old Mayes soon after the mother and her three daughters were reported missing on April 27 by Jo Ann 's husband from Whiteville , a western Tennessee town of 4,600 people , but then he fled , Joel Siskovic , the spokesman for the FBI bureau in Memphis , Tennessee , told CNN affiliate WPTY .

He was last seen May 1 in Guntown , the same northern Mississippi town where the bodies were found . Details have n't been released as to how or exactly when they died .

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation late last week issued an Amber Alert asking for the public 's help in finding the Bain sisters and for information leading to Mayes ' arrest .

Aaron T. Ford , special agent in charge at the FBI 's Memphis bureau , told CNN on Sunday that investigators believe all the kidnapping victims `` were transported across state lines into Mississippi . ''

Local , state and federal law enforcement 's focus is now in Union County , Mississippi , where Guntown is located , the FBI agent said . Authorities have also pointed out , however , that Mayes has connections to Texas , North Carolina , South Carolina and Florida and could be en route to Arizona .

Mayes may be using the alias of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass , his Facebook profile name , the FBI said Monday .

Rick Foster , whose wife was a lifelong friend of Jo Ann Bain and whose daughter was a classmate of Adrienne Bain , recently told CNN that Mayes had been a friend of the Bain family for years . Mayes lived about 90 miles away in Mississippi , Foster said , but would stay with the Bains when he was in the Whiteville area .

He described Mayes as `` a big kid in a grown man 's body . ''

Mary Patterson , Mayes ' landlord in Alpine , Mississippi , told WPTY that she thought he was a `` kind '' and `` fun guy . ''

`` If somebody told me this , I would have never believed it , '' she said .

Authorities characterize Mayes as a white man who has blue eyes and brown hair , weighs about 175 pounds and stands 6-foot-3 . He recently cut his own hair and may have done the same to the three children , according to the Amber Alert .

As for the Bains , Foster described the marriage between Jo Ann and her husband , Gary , as `` perfect '' and said the family had planned to move to Arizona once the school year ends .

The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service are offering a $ 50,000 reward for information leading to Mayes ' arrest and to the missing girls .
