-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rafael Nadal saw his incredible winning run at Monte Carlo ended last week but made no mistake Sunday in wrapping up his eighth Barcelona Open crown .

Fellow Spaniard and fourth seed Nicolas Almagro was Nadal 's victim as he clinched his 39th career title on clay with a 6-4 6-3 victory .

Almagro , beaten in his nine previous matches with Nadal , took an early lead with a double break in the first set , but could not hold his advantage .

Nadal was as relentless as ever on his favorite surface and needed only one hour 32 minutes to complete victory .

`` This has been an important week for me . To win here again is a great joy after everything I 've been through , '' Nadal told the crowd after his victory .

`` It was a fantastic match for me . ''

Since returning to the ATP Tour following a seven-month injury layoff , he has reached the final in all six of the tournaments he has entered and won four of them , the first man to reach that mark this season .

His Barcelona triumph , making it 39 straight wins in the Catalan capital , has been added to titles in Sao Paulo , Acapulco and the hard courts at Indian Wells .

World No. 1 Novak Djokovic denied Nadal a ninth straight title in Monte Carlo but sat out the Barcelona event .

The pair are set to lock horns again at the Madrid Masters which starts next weekend as the build-up continues to next month 's French Open where Nadal will be defending his crown .

In other ATP final action Sunday , Lukas Rosol , who stunned Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon last year , claimed his first career title in emotional fashion .

The Czech beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-3 6-2 in the Bucharest final and dedicated his victory to his father , who sadly passed away 10 days ago .
