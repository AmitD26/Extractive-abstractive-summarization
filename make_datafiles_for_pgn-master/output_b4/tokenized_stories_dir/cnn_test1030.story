-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- From the moment she steps onto the stage , lighting up the concert hall with her radiant smile and striking flowing dress , to the very last notes of her energy-filled show , which finds everyone at their feet , it 's easy to see why Fatoumata Diawara feels right at home while performing .

`` I like to be on stage , '' says the 31-year-old singer , one of the latest stars to come out of the seemingly endless reservoir of musical talent that is Mali . `` It 's one of my favorite places , I love that . ''

Indeed , under the stage lights of Yoshi 's in San Francisco , Diawara 's Malian influence and personal charisma shine through .

Guitar on hand , she sings effortlessly in a warm , wavering voice but she can as easily break into powerful vocal solos and high-pitched ululations ; as the evening progresses , she takes the audience into a journey of rhythms and emotions . With boundless energy , she strides across the stage , her braided hair swirling around frenziedly as she dances with abandon .

First passion

Even as a child , the versatile performer , who was born in the Ivory Coast to Malian parents in 1982 , was very much into singing and dancing . But even though she was already a member of her father 's dance troupe at a very young age , it was Diawara 's talent in acting that first wowed audiences and paved her way to stardom .

At the age of nine , Diawara was sent to live with her actress aunt to the Malian capital Bamako . One day , while she was on the set of one of her aunt 's films , the director asked the young Diawara to play a small role .

The part was only a few lines , but the exposure would lead to much larger roles . In 2001 , she starred as the title character in `` Sia , Le Reve Du Python , '' a highly successful film that boosted Diawara 's reputation in Mali -- to this day many people in the West African country refer to her as Sia -- and also attracted interest from abroad .

Fleeing marriage

In the 2001 drama , Diawara plays a young woman who flees her family to avoid being sacrificed to a god -- a role that has real life echoes for Diawara .

Shortly after the release of the film , Jean-Louis Courcoult , director of famous French theater company Royal de Luxe , traveled to Mali to offer Diawara a part in a new production .

But Diawara 's aunt , who had guardian 's rights , objected to the idea and arranged for her 19-year-old niece to be married to one of her cousins .

Going against tradition , Diawara took the bold decision to flee Mali and pursue her dream . After making all the necessary preparations in secrecy , she managed to slip out of her aunt 's house and catch a flight to Europe .

New life , new career

Once in France , Diawara became a member of Royal de Luxe , traveling around the world for more than six years . Her new career also afforded her many other opportunities , including invitations to record songs with Malian musicians in Paris .

After getting a taste of life as a musician , Diawara decided to pursue it on her own . She taught herself how to play the guitar , recorded a demo and stared performing at cafÃ © s in Paris .

`` I said , ` OK my voice can be a good way to express who I am ; what is my story ; where I come from , ' '' says Diawara , who released her first album , `` Fatou , '' in 2011 . In the critically-acclaimed album , she explores familiar subjects , including women 's issues and arranged marriages .

`` They wanted to give me to a man/but I refused as I did n't love him/I want to choose a man for myself/who I love , '' Diawara can be heard singing in `` Bissa , '' echoing her personal experience .

Giving back

Once she left Mali , Diawara never looked back . That was until last year , when a crisis threatened to destroy the country 's rich music heritage .

In March 2012 , a military coup sent the country 's president into hiding . That opened the door to insurgency by Islamic militants who began to enforce their strict interpretation of Sharia law , including a ban on music .

Diawara , who was still living in Paris , felt compelled to do something to ensure the great traditions of the music she loves live on . She went back to Mali and rallied 40 of the country 's most popular artists , including kora maestro Toumani Diabate and legendary singer Oumou Sangare , to record a song calling for peace titled `` Mali ko . ''

Once back in her country , Diawara also reconnected with her family , making amends . It was also a chance for her to give back to the beloved country she fled but which still influences her music .

`` I 'm not a politician , I 'm nobody , '' she says , `` but it is about my country ; my Earth , where I 'm from . My roots , my story , my family . ''

Back in San Francisco , Diawara takes a bow amid loud cheers as she leaves the stage following yet another energetic performance .

`` I enjoy being with my audience because I know what I did to be in front of them , '' she says after the concert . `` That 's why I like this moment ; it 's my freedom , '' she adds . `` Music is my best friend . ''
