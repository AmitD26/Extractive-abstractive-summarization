-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In March , a young woman talking to a friend on the phone said she heard someone coming in the back door of her Kentucky apartment . She has n't been heard from since .

The NamUs Web site has helped in closing 147 missing persons cases and ID ` ing 149 decedents since its launch .

Decades earlier , on March 15 , 1967 , the remains of a woman clad in a blue dress and white shoes were discovered in a field in Baltimore , Maryland .

The two cases are separated by nearly 500 miles and more than 42 years , but authorities are hoping they can both be solved with the help of a federal database that went online this year .

The National Missing and Unidentified Persons System -LRB- http://www.namus.gov// -RRB- is designed to help law enforcement agencies and medical examiners across the country unravel the mysteries of cold cases involving missing persons and unidentified remains . It also gives countless families a place to look for loved ones and a chance to find answers and peace of mind .

Launched in January , the database was created after the Department of Justice was tasked with finding ways to help solve the thousands of missing persons and unidentified decedents cases in the United States , according to a statement on the Web site . It 's funded through a cooperative agreement from the National Institute of Justice , which is part of the Department of Justice 's Office of Justice Programs .

NamUs communications director Christine Vivian said the project `` was created to address the issue of the estimated 40,000 unidentified dead nationwide , and give families a tool to assist in finding missing adults . ''

`` As more cases are entered into the system , more people in every area -- law enforcement , victim advocacy and the general public -- can become part of the conversation that will resolve cases , '' Vivian told CNN in an e-mail .

The database offers what may be the most comprehensive public search engine to date for this undertaking .

`` With advances in forensic sciences , there is always the possibility of closing an old case , '' NamUs Operations Manager Billy Young told CNN . `` No matter how old the records are , we have someone looking at them . ''

NamUs is operated by the National Forensic Science Technology Center in Largo , Florida . It has two separate parts : a database of missing persons information containing 1,996 cases -- of which 147 have been closed -- and an unidentified decedent data system , which lists 5,569 cases . Of those , 149 people have been identified .

Information entered in the missing persons file is automatically cross-referenced with the unidentified remains cases to see if there are any matches , the Web site said .

The woman in the blue dress in Baltimore is not one of them . Her skeletal remains were found in a field in the winter of 1967 , but forensic experts believe she probably died the previous year . She was 5 feet , 3 inches tall and between the ages of 21 and 45 .

The young woman in Kentucky is listed on the missing persons database . She is Crystal Hall , of Pikeville . On March 1 , the 24-year-old who called herself `` Red '' was in her apartment and told a friend on the phone that someone was trying to enter her home from the rear door . It was the last time anyone has heard from her .

Hall was last seen wearing a red shirt , dark blue jeans and large hoop earrings . She has the name `` Willy '' tattooed on her left leg and another tattoo of a heart on her right arm .

Her case file is typical of thousands of other entries for both NamUs databases , which contain detailed information on physical characteristics , clothing , accessories , police reports , photographs and dental charting .

Typical also is case 5593 , which describes a man believed to be in his 30s who was found intoxicated and unconscious on the ground in New York on May 31 . He was taken to a hospital with a traumatic brain injury and died on June 3 .

The man , who had black hair and was wearing blue jeans , had several scars on his body . He was also missing part of a finger on his right hand .

Young hopes that posting the man 's case on the Web site will provide answers to family or friends who may be searching for him .

`` It lets them know that someone is constantly looking for their loved ones and they are not being forgotten , '' he said . `` It gives them hope that one day they will be able to get closure . ''
