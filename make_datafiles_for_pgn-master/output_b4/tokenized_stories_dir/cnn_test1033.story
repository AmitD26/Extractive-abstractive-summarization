Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Obama administration is likely to come under new pressure to take more decisive steps in Syria following opposition claims that Bashar al-Assad 's government used chemical weapons to kill more than 1,000 people .

While the regime denied the fresh accusations , the administration said it could not immediately verify the accuracy of newly released videos online purportedly showing civilians suffering from chemical agents outside Damascus .

Still , the images were searing and prompted the United States to seek an urgent U.N. investigation , demand accountability , and not rule out additional help .

`` There is an investigation team that 's on the ground in Syria right now . And we are hopeful that the Assad regime will follow through on what they have claimed previously , that they are interested in a credible investigation that gets to the bottom of reports that chemical weapons have been used , '' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said .

Earnest added the administration has regularly considered increased aid for the rebels .

`` The conduct of this investigation , the results of this investigation or the efforts by the Assad regime to inhibit this investigation will certainly impact that calculation about possible additional aid , '' Earnest said .

Key questions would immediately surface if the latest troubling development from a region wracked by civil war for more than two years were to change the overall calculus for the United States .

What new steps would it take ? How would it address uncertainty about the rebel makeup ? And how would it approach what some believe is a worsening multidimensional trust gap on the issue of rebel assistance ?

The administration has rebuffed calls for a stronger military aid response , opting to push for a political solution and provide humanitarian , logistical and limited weaponry and other hardware .

A chief problem has been identifying those rebels the United States would happily deal with vs elements said to be militants , including some with ties to al Qaeda .

`` Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides , '' Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey wrote this week to Rep. Eliot Engel of New York .

`` It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor . Today , they are not , '' he said in the August 19 letter .

Inherent political mistrust amid sharp partisan divisions in Washington coupled with close congressional vetting also have influenced the response to Syria . Congress is currently on vacation until after Labor Day .

Also critically , mistrust cuts both ways .

According to experts who have traveled to Syria during the war , opposition groups have little faith in the United States .

`` Our credibility was n't high to begin with and obviously did n't improve with time , '' said David Lesch , Middle East history professor at Trinity University and author of `` Syria : The Fall of the House of Assad . '' `` They basically shrug their shoulders and say , ` Oh well , what is new ? ' They feel like they are on their own on this . ''

Lesch said the administration had not had enough contact with oppositions groups from the outset .

`` There is just a lack of knowledge of these groups , '' he said .

This is the second time the administration has faced questions about chemical weapons use in Syria .

Last August , President Barack Obama said using those weapons would cross a `` red line '' and provoke a U.S. military response . His administration confirmed in June that chemical agents were used in April and it resulted in an uptick of military aid .

But the `` red line '' tag has seriously damaged U.S. credibility in the region , said Andrew Tabler , author of `` In the Lion 's Den : An Eyewitness Account of Washington 's Battle with Syria . ''

`` Reacting way too late - that has been our policy on Syria for some time , '' Tabler said . '' -LRB- The United States ' credibility is -RRB- very low because of its inability to keep to its word . We have done absolutely nothing to enforce the red line . What kind of signal does that send to the Syrian people ? ''

But in his letter , Dempsey warned that even limited military action in Syria could lead to deeper involvement -- a point the military has made previously . The administration has said it has no plans to put `` boots on the ground . ''

A team of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors landed in Syria this week to begin probing chemical weapons allegations , and the U.N. Security Council planned a meeting on Wednesday to address the issue .

CNN 's Samira Said , Ed Payne , Jessica Yellin , Dana Bash and Chloe Sommers contributed to this report .
