-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Heavy rain , hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people feared killed by a massive landslide in eastern Uganda , officials said Thursday .

About 300 people were missing and feared dead after Monday 's landslide , including 100 students , said Catherine Ntabadde , a spokeswoman for the Ugandan Red Cross Society . At least 87 bodies had been recovered , she said .

Officials have lowered the death toll , from 106 , since Tuesday . `` We found some body parts , which we have decided not to count as a whole for now , '' said Musa Ecweru , the minister for disaster preparedness .

Hundreds of rescuers , including the nation 's military , used shovels and hoes to dig through the mud in a desperate search for survivors . Residents from nearby villages joined in , some armed with garden tools , while others used their bare hands .

`` It 's impossible to take bulldozers and any heavy equipment to the site . The earth is very delicate and heavy machinery may cause more landslides , '' Ntabadde said . The terrain also is inaccessible by road , Ecweru said .

The area is so steep that evacuees are walking about 6 miles -LRB- 10 kilometers -RRB- to nearby camps . The Red Cross , United Nations and World Food Program are helping provide food , water and other essentials , such as blankets , to the displaced , officials said .

They 've also set up mobile clinics to provide medical care . Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni flew to the site of the landslide Wednesday and attended a funeral for victims .

A select few attended the service , because of the risk of more landslides , Ecweru said . Museveni ordered the nearly 4,000 people living nearby to be evacuated to permanent locations in less hilly terrain .

The chances of finding survivors were fading as heavy rain pounded the area , leaving rescuers focusing on recovery efforts , the Red Cross spokeswoman said .

`` We have not found anyone alive today , '' Ntabadde said . `` We do n't expect to find any more people alive . '' Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter , officials said .

`` The villages of Nametsi , Namakansa and Kubewo in Nametsi parish have been wiped out , '' Ntabadde said .

The neighboring village of Bamuyaka in Bubita Sub County also has been affected . Flooding also has destroyed roads and washed away bridges in at least seven districts . The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon , on the Kenya-Uganda border .
