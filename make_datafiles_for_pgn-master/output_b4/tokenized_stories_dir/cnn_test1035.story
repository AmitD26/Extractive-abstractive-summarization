-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Over the past two years the United Kingdom 's press freedom ranking has declined .

In the 2011/2012 Reporters Sans Frontieres -LRB- RSF -RRB- index , the UK ranked 28th out of 179 countries , and in the 2013 index the country went down a point ranking at 29 out of 179 countries .

The UK prides itself on being a country with a long heritage of upholding the rights of individuals accompanied by a free and strong press . The UK government is a P5 member of the U.N. Security Council , a leading country in the G8 , European Union , and the Commonwealth , and uses its influence to advocate for human rights to be respected globally .

Two years ago , the News of the World phone hacking scandal shook the institutional confidence of the UK media to its core . The UK 's innate belief of the right to a free and strong press betrayed the innate respect of the same national belief -- the rights of individuals . The conclusions found in the Lord Judge Leveson inquiry cemented this scandal as not only unprecedented but raised the question , for the first time ever , if legislation was needed to regulate the UK press ?

Greenwald : Lawsuit filed in UK over Miranda 's detention

Much debate led to the draft Royal Charter for UK Press Self-Regulation . The draft document outlines how the UK should devise a self-regulatory body within its longstanding history of media freedom . The UK is now faced with yet another situation that has shocked the international community and shaken the country 's press freedom identity for a second time -- the detention of David Miranda -LRB- assisting his partner , Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald -RRB- . The Greenwald / Miranda case , however , flies in the face of the argument of UK press self-regulation and raises great concern over terrorism laws , investigative journalism and the protection of journalists ' sources .

The question remains , however , does the UK 's press freedom ranking reflect the debate now ensuing the country on UK press regulation and now the protection of journalists sources , or is there more to the methodology of the UK ranking than meets the eye ? In other words , can the UK improve its ranking ?

The research is based on a two tiered system : In-house research and a questionnaire sent to press freedom experts and journalists .

RSF 's research for the UK 's 2013 ranking focused on areas of concern such as , the -LSB- then -RSB- libel laws -LRB- which had been reformed after the publication of the 2013 index -RRB- , the draft Communications Data Bill , which had been rejected but is now under reconsideration and , lastly , elements of the UK anti-terror laws .

UK based NGO Article 19 published a report which outlines the three problematic `` themes '' found in UK anti-terror laws : `` The broad definition of terrorism , the use of anti-terror laws to stifle legitimate social and political protest and the new prohibitions on the encouragement , other inducement or glorification of terrorism . ''

RSF has found that a significant factor in index ranking methodology is that index rankings should not be taken as an indication of the quality of the media in the countries concerned . Such a concept brings the discussion to the heart of the matter within the UK . How can the UK , with the established fundamental freedoms of a democratic society , government , parliament , judiciary and media not rank in the top echelon of press freedom indexes ? When examining countries that score within the top echelon in the RSF and Freedom House press freedom indexes , a number of the countries do have press self-regulatory bodies underpinned by statute .

Miranda ` afraid ' during questioning

Media regulation within historically and fundamentally democratic nations does not necessarily equate to a lack of press freedom in countries which rank in the top echelon on press freedom indexes and have self-regulatory bodies underpinned by statutes . Self-regulatory press systems , however , might not be applied as successfully in countries that do not have deeply rooted democratic traditions and systems in place , and do not meet all international standards of human rights .

The issue is wider and more complex than the notion of one glove fits all . Is such a system right for the UK with a deeply rooted tradition of good governance and democratic values compared to other like-minded western countries that have press self-regulatory bodies , underpinned by statute , and rank higher than the UK in press freedom indexes ?

Professor Robert Picard , director of research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University states : `` Indexes are not a perfect science ; many smaller Western countries are more open and transparent -LSB- Iceland and Sweden , for example -RSB- as opposed to larger Western countries , particularly those larger Western countries that lead in international intervention .

Western countries that lead in international intervention will not be as transparent with official documents and operations , as Western countries which do not lead on international intervention , due to security reasons and because of confidential relationships with foreign governments . For example , in Iceland , almost all official and political documents can be viewed by the public on or off line -- even the Iceland president 's telephone number can be found in the phone book . ''

Professor Picard concluded : `` With this in mind , countries like the UK will most likely never be number one in press freedom rankings , unless the county 's entire political , economic and international stance changes drastically , making the UK a country that does not lead on international intervention . ''

Some research has found that a country having a press self-regulatory body underpinned by statute does not always mean that the quality of the media within the country suffers , if the country has strong standing democratic traditions of good governance , independent judiciary , and upholds international standards for all human rights .

In the wake of the Greenwald / Miranda case , the UK must examine that the legal frameworks in place to protect its citizens from terrorism , has intelligent checks and balances that allow for the free flow of investigative journalism and information that is published for the same national interest .

Upon publication of the Leveson report , RSF pointed out , however , that non-regulation , especially for a country that sets the precedent with longstanding respect and tradition of press freedom , is always the most advantageous , and in some circumstances , the best choice .

As pointed out in Lara Fielden 's report , `` Regulating for Trust in Journalism , '' James Harding , editor of The Times observed : `` The phone-hacking scandal has put investigative journalism in the dock , and it was -LSB- UK -RSB- investigative journalism that put it there . ''

In regards to the Greenwald/Miranda case -- if you silence the media , you silence informed citizenry ; without informed citizens freedom of information , freedom of any kind , can be greatly compromised .
