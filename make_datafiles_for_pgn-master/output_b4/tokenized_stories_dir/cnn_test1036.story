-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- When HBO airs `` Behind the Candelabra '' on May 26 , the world will get to see Matt Damon play Liberace 's drug-addled , surgically enhanced lover -- a role about as far from Jason Bourne as it gets .

But Damon , who sat down with costar Michael Douglas to talk with EW for this week 's cover story , says he is n't ruling out a return to his blockbuster spy franchise despite the fact that he handed the reins over to Jeremy Renner in last year 's `` The Bourne Legacy . ''

That movie rebooted the series by introducing the idea of a world with multiple Bourne-style secret agents â € '' which means the original Jason Bourne could still be out there somewhere .

`` Tony Gilroy , who wrote the first one and the second one , came up with an idea : I think they look at it as kind of the reverse of ` X-Men , ' '' says Damon , who opted not to sign on for a fourth film because he and director Paul Greengrass `` could n't figure out '' a script . `` Whereas with ` X-Men , ' you get a giant bunch of superheroes and then do the ` Wolverine ' spinoff , I think Tony pitched it as , ` OK , we started with the ` Wolverine ' spinoff . Now let 's try to make the ` X-Men . ' So I 'll create all these other programs , and you can have your evergreen that way . There 'll be other agents . ' ''

So does this mean Damon and Renner might share the screen in a Bourne movie someday ?

`` That would be their dream , '' says Damon . `` Tony 's whole thing was , ` Look , my story wo n't preclude Matt from doing another one . This one can live on a parallel track . ' ''

In the meantime , Damon is taking on outside-the-box projects like `` Behind the Candelabra , '' though the actor says he was surprised at how much he could relate to the bizarre love story between Liberace -LRB- Douglas -RRB- and Scott Thorson -LRB- Damon -RRB- . `` My way in was my own marriage and understanding how these long-term relationships work , '' he says . `` Their relationship is absurd and funny and tragic and heartbreaking . And I realized : That 's all of our lives . I found the relationship was highly relatable . ''
