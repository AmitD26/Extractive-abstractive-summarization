-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Triathlon has a reputation for being expensive . In fact , the perceived costs are enough to stop some prospective participants from taking up the challenge .

There 's no doubt that triathlons are harder on the bank balance than other sports , such as running , soccer , baseball or swimming . But believe me when I say that you do n't need to max out your credit card to do triathlon , to enjoy triathlon and even to succeed in triathlon .

In 2007 , I raced my first Ironman on a road bike -LRB- not the normal TT bike used for Ironman racing -RRB- with regular wheels . I borrowed my friend 's race kit , and wore a $ 20 pair of sunglasses I bought from a gas station in New Zealand three years prior to the race .

The most important investment you can make is in the form of hard work , drive and determination . The most important piece of equipment you can have is a huge heart . The most important weapon in triathlon is your mind .

10 ways to act like a champion

Having said that , it 's hard to compete in a bike ride without a bike . And race directors are not overly keen on your swimming , biking or running in your birthday suit . So here are a few items that every triathlete , budding or otherwise , needs to be able to train and race in this amazing sport :

Goggles : Leaky , ill-fitting goggles can cause panic and discomfort . If possible , try goggles on before you buy them . They should stay on your face , even without the strap . Your eyelashes should n't touch the lenses , and the nose piece should n't cut you like a knife . Slightly tinted goggles are best , as they are suitable for both cloudy and sunny conditions .

Wetsuit : Wetsuits are mandatory in some races . They help keep you warm and also provide buoyancy . Ideally , your wetsuit should be swim/triathlon specific , rather than a surf wetsuit .

You do n't need to spend a fortune -- some companies offer one-off , monthly or even season rentals . Just make sure you swim in the wetsuit before race day and learn how to get it on and off properly . It needs to be snug , but not too tight or restrictive .

Swimcap : These are usually provided by race organizers , but a spare is useful for training and for doubling up if the water is cold .

Bike : You need one , but what kind ? Bikes can be few hundred dollars or as much as the price of a car . If you 're just starting triathlon and only planning on doing one or two local events , you can use a beach cruiser , shopper or mountain bike . But if you are thinking of doing more , it 's probably best to buy a road bike -- which you can train , race and even commute on .

Secondhand bikes can be a great value , but it 's your responsibility to make sure your bike is roadworthy . Getting a personal `` bike-fit '' from a bike shop is worthwhile .

Race day tips from an Ironman champ

Shoes : Whether you use regular or so-called clipless pedals -LRB- a bit of a misnomer , as you actually clip into them -RRB- will depend on your cycling experience and confidence . Your choice of pedal determines what shoes you wear . Cleated shoes -LRB- these lock onto the pedals -RRB- are definitely not essential for those new to cycling . With flat pedals you can use the same shoes for cycling and running .

Buy a sturdy running shoe that you can trust that suits your form/biomechanics -LRB- a good running shop can help with this -RRB- .

Helmet : Of course , helmets are a must , but it does n't have to be the all-song-and-dance `` aero '' kind . A regular brain bucket will protect your head fine ; just make sure it has passed the necessary safety tests .

Race suit : You could wear a pair of shorts and a T-shirt under your wetsuit and keep them on until the finish line . But while not essential , opting for a tri suit in a race enables you to wear the same outfit from start to finish . There are basically two options , a single-piece tri suit , or a two-piece shorts and singlet .

Tri training : Taking to open water

There are lots of other items that are useful , but not essential , and it 's easy to spend far more than you need to succeed . Start with the gear listed here , and then make sure you can use it .

Once you fall in love with the sport , and if your wallet can handle the pressure , you may want to add some optional extras or upgrade what you have .

But remember , it 's not all about the gear . It 's about the idea , the plan , the ambition ... . the dream .
