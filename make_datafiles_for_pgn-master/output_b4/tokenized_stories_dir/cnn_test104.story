Four missiles were fired Wednesday at a suspected militant hideout in the area of Mir Ali of North Waziristan , one of the seven districts of the volatile tribal region , the two intelligence officials said , requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the matter to the news media .

The protest march against U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan came to a halt on Sunday when authorities used steel shipping containers and security forces to block access to the demonstration 's final destination in the tribal region .

When confronted with the roadblock , Khan directed protesters to turn back , saying the march had achieved its goal of drawing attention to the controversial U.S. drone strikes .

Khan has been a fierce critic of U.S. policy in Pakistan and the use of drone strikes , calling them a violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty and a strategy that stokes militant anger towards Washington .

In recent years , the U.S. government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in Pakistan 's mostly ungoverned tribal region , widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan . U.S. officials say the drone strikes are an effective strategy against militant groups and insist civilian casualties are rare .
