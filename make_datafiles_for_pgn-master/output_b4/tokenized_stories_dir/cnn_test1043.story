-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Things have n't been going great for Paula Deen the last few days : She 's been dropped from the Food Network , QVC is `` reviewing the relationship , '' and her biggest defenders so far have been her sons â € '' and their examples left a lot to be desired .

But Deen has got at least one public figure in her corner : Anne Rice . The vampire author took to her own Facebook page to defend the chef , but her comments -LRB- first discovered by Jezebel -RRB- are likely to just cause more controversy .

Rice first posed the question to her readers by saying : `` What 's happening with Paula Dean ? Is it fair ? I never heard of her until today , and wow , this looks like a crucifixion . Opinions , thoughts welcome ... are n't we becoming something of a lynch mob culture ? ''

QVC is ` reviewing business relationship ' with Paula Deen

She then decided that the `` opinions , thoughts '' needed were her own , and had quite a bit to say in the comments , including , in part , '' ... This woman is just what you said . She 's an old southern lady , and she never made these unwise remarks of hers to a black person . We have no evidence at all that she has ever personally insulted or injured any black employee or friend . ''

No evidence , of course , except Deen 's own sworn deposition about the offense level of jokes . `` I ca n't , myself , determine what offends another person , '' Deen said before going on to explain how she wanted to hire `` all black waiters for her brother 's 2007 wedding . ''

Rice continued her defense in the court of public opinion , via Facebook : `` It 's so easy to persecute an older , overweight , unwise , crude , ignorant woman who may very well be a good person at heart who has achieved a great deal in her life . So easy to vilify her and hate her and try to destroy her life . Woe to anyone today who is not slender , young , clever and politically correct . ''

Paula Deen will finally be giving her own side of the story on the `` Today '' show Wednesday . A rep for Rice did not immediately respond to EW 's request for comment .
