-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serena Williams underlined her status as the overwhelming favorite for the women 's U.S. Open title with a crushing `` double bagel '' win over Carla Suarez Navarro in the quarterfinals of the New York grand slam .

The defending champion , bidding for a fifth singles triumph at Flushing Meadows , beat the Spanish world No. 20 6-0 6-0 to become the first woman since Martina Navratilova in 1989 to win a women 's U.S. Open quarterfinal without losing a game .

`` I played well -- I played really well , '' world No. 1 Williams told the WTA 's official website . `` I was just more focused than anything .

`` I like to believe there is always room for improvement though . I have n't really thought about it yet , but off the bat , I think it was very difficult to hit a big serve today because of the winds , and I did n't get my serve up as much as I wanted to . But I do n't know . I do think I definitely played well tonight . ''

The American 's latest commanding win means she has lost just 13 games at the tournament ahead of her semifinal meeting with Li Na , who is appearing in the last four of the year 's final grand slam for the first time after beating Russia 's Ekaterina Makarova .

`` I 'm still in the tournament and I 'm not thinking like , ` I 'm really dominant now ' , '' added Williams . `` I 'm thinking I have a really tough match in the next round and want to do well . ''

Earlier in the day second seed Victoria Azarenka , beaten by Williams in the 2012 final , won her delayed fourth round match against former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic .

In the men 's draw , top seed Novak Djokovic made light work of his fourth round meeting with Spaniard Marcel Granollers .

The six-time grand slam champion wrapped up a 6-3 6-0 6-0 win in just one hour and 19 minutes .

The world No. 1 was delighted with his performance as he bids to erase the memory of an agonizing five-set defeat to Andy Murray in last year 's final .

`` I had some great matches in the past that I can compare with this one today , but definitely today , second and third set have been some of the best tennis that I 've played on Arthur Ashe in my career , '' Djokovic told the ATP Tour 's official website .

`` It 's a fantastic feeling when you 're playing this well . You love spending time on the court and experiencing such great zone where you are at that moment . ''

Djokovic 's quarterfinal opponent will be 21st seed Mikhael Youzhny , who got the better of 2001 champion Lleyton Hewitt in a marathon five-set contest .

Defending champion and second seed Murray survived a scare to set up a last eight match with Swiss No. 9 Stanislas Wawrinka .

The Briton lost the first set of his meeting with Uzbekistan 's Denis Istomin before roaring back to clinch a 6-7 -LRB- 5-7 -RRB- 6-1 6-4 6-4 victory .

`` I wanted to just try and get through the match , '' said 2013 Wimbledon winner Murray . `` In the end it was difficult conditions . It was extremely windy today .

`` With the way he plays , he hits the ball pretty big and flat on both sides , strokes pretty low , hard at times to control . He made it very difficult for me .

`` With the way the third set ended up going , I was just very happy to get it done , because he had chances at the end of the third set to go ahead . ''
