Kogelo , Kenya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Four years ago this village was the center of `` Obama mania . ''

The celebration of 2008 `` was exceptional , it is something not any of us would have imagined to have happened because we were at the brink of history being made , '' said village resident Malik Obama , half-brother of the president .

In 2008 , Malik Obama peered into a tiny TV with a flickering CNN signal for an all-night vigil watching results come in . After a rain-soaked night that stranded more than a few reporters who had come to the village , Malik Obama emerged bleary-eyed but dancing . A crowd of supporters chanted his name .

Kogelo is the birthplace of Barack Obama 's father , Barack Obama Sr. . Then-Sen . Barack Obama visited in 2006 and paid special homage to his grandmother , Sarah Obama -LRB- now universally known as Mama Sarah -RRB- . It 's not just Sarah and Malik , there is a whole wing of the Obama clan here : cousins , aunts and half-cousins .

If 2006 was the start of the love affair , in 2008 it went full-blown .

Everywhere there were Obama T-shirts , DVDs and cakes -LRB- a black forest cake with an edible picture of the president-to-be and Mama Sarah was a favorite -RRB- .

Things have certainly cooled down since then .

To many Africans -LRB- and Americans , if polls are correct -RRB- , Barack Obama 's presidential campaign of `` hope '' and `` change '' hit a wall of reality when he came into office .

Africans , in particular , saw great hope in the new American president with African roots . But after just one brief swing through Ghana in four years at the White House , many feel let down by Africa 's `` favorite son . ''

The administration contends that Africa is a priority , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been a regular fixture in Africa .

But to Africans , and especially to Kenyans , it is not the same .

`` Under the circumstances with what he has had to deal with we understand , '' said Malik Obama , `` and we hope that circumstances will change . We hope he has the opportunity to come here and say hello . ''

Even without a visit from President Obama , Kogelo is still trying to make good use of the connection .

Where there was once just a dirt track running through town , now a paved road is nearing completion . Electricity is connected to many houses . Water projects have increased .

Simply put , President Obama 's win put Kogelo on the map . Locals here say that charities flooded into Kogelo to get a bit of the `` Obama cache . ''

With a tight race looming in 2012 , many here are nervous .

`` I donÂ ¹ t know the other person who is contesting , '' said Pastor Joseph Omundi of the Christian Life church in Kogelo , `` but we know Barack Obama is the son of this land . ''

Omundi , a fiery preacher who delivers sermons with a translator in a staccato double act , said his congregation has been praying for `` peace , the economy , and Barack Obama . ''

Everyone a CNN crew spoke to in Kogelo is for Obama : the fruit vendors ; the commuters streaming by in matatu , or minibus , vehicles ; and even the opinionated boda boda , or bicycle and motorcycle , drivers . Many just refer to Mitt Romney as `` the other guy . ''

While Kogelo has changed , with a new recreation center and lodge for foreign tourists , it is still just a rural village some 260 miles -LRB- 418 kilometers -RRB- west of Nairobi , the capital . The flood of foreign visitors predicted by the government has n't materialized , and the much-touted road is n't quite finished .

But Malik Obama stays positive .

`` Washington , D.C. , is the capital of the United States , but Kogelo is the capital of the world , because everybody comes to visit , '' he said .
