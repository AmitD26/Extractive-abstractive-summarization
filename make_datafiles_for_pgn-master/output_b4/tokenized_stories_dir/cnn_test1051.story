-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Annie Leibovitz on Monday defended her provocative photograph for Vanity Fair magazine of teen heartthrob Miley Cyrus -- aka Hannah Montana -- who has expressed embarrassment about the pose .

`` I 'm sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted , '' the celebrity photographer said in a written statement . `` Miley and I looked at fashion photographs together and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it . The photograph is a simple , classic portrait , shot with very little makeup , and I think it is very beautiful . ''

The statement came a day after the 15-year-old apologized to her fans for her participation in the photo shoot , which took place February 9 in Calabasas , California .

`` My goal in my music and my acting is always to make people happy , '' Cyrus said in a written statement . `` For Vanity Fair , I was so honored and thrilled to work with Annie .

`` I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be ` artistic ' and now , seeing the photographs and reading the story , I feel so embarrassed . The pictures of me on the Internet were silly , inappropriate shots .

`` I appreciate all the support of my fans and hope they understand that along the way I am going to make mistakes and I am not perfect .

`` I never intended for any of this to happen and I am truly sorry if I have disappointed anyone . Most of all , I have let myself down . I will learn from my mistakes and trust my support team . My family and my faith will guide me through my life 's journey . ''

Vanity Fair spokeswoman Beth Kseniak also defended the pictures , which are posted on the magazine 's Web site and are being published in the June issue .

`` Miley 's parents and/or minders were on the set all day , '' Kseniak said in a written statement . `` Since the photo was taken digitally , they saw it on the shoot and everyone thought it was a beautiful and natural portrait of Miley . In fact , when -LSB- Vanity Fair writer -RSB- Bruce Handy interviewed Miley , he asked her about the photo and she was very cheerful about it and thought it was perfectly fine . ''

But the publicist for Cyrus said her parents departed at the end of the day , prior to the pictures being taken and did not see any digital pictures .

Cyrus stars as an ordinary teenager with a double life as a rock star on the Disney Channel 's `` Hannah Montana . '' The channel says `` Hannah Montana '' is the top-rated cable television show for children ages 6 to 14 , reaching more than 164 million viewers around the world .

One of Leibovitz 's pictures shows a topless Cyrus clutching a blanket to her chest , her back exposed , looking toward the camera over one shoulder .

A caption reads : `` Um , was Cyrus -- or Disney -- at all anxious about this shot ? '' It then quotes Cyrus as saying : `` No , I mean I had a blanket on . And I thought , ` This looks pretty , and really natural . ' I think it 's really artsy . ''

The magazine refers to the `` topless but demure portrait '' as Leibovitz 's idea and quotes Cyrus as saying , `` It was n't in a skanky way . ... And you ca n't say no to Annie . She 's so cute . She gets this puppy dog look and you 're like , ` O.K. ' ''

A Disney Channel spokesman , Patti McTeague , said in a statement released Sunday that the photos were meant to sell magazines .

`` Unfortunately , as the article suggests , a situation was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old in order to sell magazines , '' she said .

The incident underscores the polarities that exist in society about how to view sexuality among girls -- repress it or exploit it , said Gigi Durham , author of `` The Lolita Effect . ''

`` Neither is healthy , '' she said .

Though the photographs are `` artistically very beautiful , '' the magazine is `` exploiting her body for profit , '' she said .

`` I have certain qualms about exploiting girls ' sexuality in this way , '' she said . `` She 's young and ought to be able to explore her sexual self without a commercial emphasis being put on it . ''

That is not to say that nudity or sex is bad , she said . Even teens ought to be able to express themselves sexually , she added . But , `` within the commercial context , it becomes sexuality for profit , which is an entirely different issue . ''

Cyrus completed a 70-date tour this year that sold out venues nationwide , starred in a movie that ranked number one in February and saw two albums rocket toward the top of the charts .

This is not the first time Leibovitz 's work has raised eyebrows . She shot a 1980 photograph of a nude John Lennon hugging his clothed wife , Yoko Ono , that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and two cover shots for Vanity Fair of actress Demi Moore , one showing the nude actress seven months pregnant , the other showing the nude actress with a suit painted on her body .
