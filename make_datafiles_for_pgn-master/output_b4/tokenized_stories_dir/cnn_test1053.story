-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Getting the ax is hard . But it 's a lot harder with 1,000 of your co-workers listening in .

One employee of Internet giant AOL was canned in a very public way because he apparently tried to take a photo of the boss during a mass conference call .

AOL CEO Tim Armstrong was on a call about the future of Patch , the hyperlocal news websites he founded , when he noticed Patch 's creative director Abel Lenz and his camera .

`` Abel -- put that camera down right now . Abel ! You 're fired . Out ! '' Armstrong said , according to audio obtained by the media blog JimRomenesko.com .

The call fell silent for five uncomfortable seconds . Then , Armstrong resumed business as usual .

`` If , uh , you guys think that AOL has not been committed to Patch and wo n't stay committed to Patch , you 're wrong , '' he said .

Lenz later tweeted from a New York bar : `` No comment . ''

Incidentally , less than a minute before Lenz 's fatal snapshot , Armstrong said he did n't care if anyone leaked information about Patch .

`` I also want to clear up the fact that leaking information or anything around Patch is n't going to bother me , '' the CEO said . `` It does n't bother me , I 'm not changing direction . ''

AOL and Lenz have not responded to CNN 's request for comment .

According to Business Insider , the call took place Friday amid news that AOL is slashing the number of Patch sites from 900 to 600 .

While some employees were reportedly expecting to hear about layoffs , no one expected to hear a firing live during the call .
