-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A white Mississippi man has been sentenced to life in prison for the 2011 murder of an African-American man , with the judge calling it an inexcusable , `` despicable '' crime .

Deryl Dedmon pleaded guilty to murder and a hate-crime charge before a judge in Jackson on Wednesday afternoon , admitting to the June killing of James Craig Anderson . Hinds County Circuit Judge Jeff Weill sentenced him to two concurrent life terms , saying , `` This craven act is n't who we are . ''

`` Whatever excuse you offer , forget that . There is no excuse , '' Weill said . He added , `` The state of Mississippi condemns this despicable crime . ''

Dedmon , 19 , told the judge that he was a `` changed man '' who had found religion since his arrest .

`` I wish I could take it all back , '' he said , adding , `` I was young and dumb , ignorant and full of hatred . I chose to go down the wrong path . ''

Dedmon is also expected to plead guilty to still-undisclosed federal charges Thursday , three sources with knowledge of the case told CNN -- the first indication that a federal case was pending in Anderson 's death . Officials would disclose no details , but Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith said he expected other charges -- and other arrests .

`` This is just the beginning , '' Smith said .

Anderson 's killing prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in Jackson , a city of about 537,000 people . His sister , Barbara Anderson Young , said during Wednesday 's hearing that her family was praying for `` racial conciliation . ''

`` These last months have been very difficult , '' Young said . `` We cried . We wept . We reminisced about our beloved brother , Craig , a loss I can not even explain . Craig was a big-hearted person who loved his fellow man . ''

Anderson died after he was beaten and run over by a truck driven by Dedmon , according to police . Dedmon was part of a group of seven white youths from largely white Rankin County who decided to `` go f**k with some niggers , '' after a night of partying and drinking , law enforcement officials have said , quoting some of the suspects in the case .

Smith has said the evidence indicated the suspects , who ranged in age from 17 to 19 , `` went out with the intention to harm and , in this case , kill a black man . '' According to investigators , they drove 16 miles in two vehicles from Rankin County to Jackson , where after exiting the highway , they found Anderson alone in a parking lot about 4 a.m. on June 26 .

The white men allegedly beat Anderson repeatedly , yelling racial epithets . After the beating , Dedmon drove his Ford F-250 truck over him , leaving him to die , according to what some of the teens cooperating with police have told authorities .

Anderson 's death drew national attention after CNN first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a Jackson suburb .

A second man , John Aaron Rice , was initially charged with murder , but a judge reduced the charges to simple assault because Rice was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill Anderson .

For months , lawyers had been working behind the scenes in Jackson , where Dedmon is being held , fighting over a change of venue in a possible trial . Smith had hoped to have a trial in Jackson , where the crime occurred and which is largely black . But defense attorneys wanted to move the trial to an area with a larger white population , the law enforcement officials said .

Murder suspect carried ` backpack of hatred '

Authorities believe Dedmon led and instigated the attack . On a sweltering Mississippi night in June , a gang of youths climbed into Dedmon 's green truck and a white SUV and drove to the western edge of Jackson . They would have seen Anderson immediately as they exited the highway , officials said . He was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp .

On the videotape obtained exclusively by CNN , the group pulls into the parking lot and stops where Anderson is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible .

The young men can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and Anderson . Witnesses told authorities this is when Anderson 's beating took place , as the white youths yelled racial epithets , including `` white power . ''

Authorities allege Dedmon and many of the other teens pummeled Anderson repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground , although this is not visible on the tape . After the beating , some of the white youths left , and others got into the green Ford truck .

At this moment , Anderson becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walked toward the truck .

`` Defendant Dedmon drove the F-250 out of the parking lot and turned right onto Ellis Avenue , '' the lawsuit says . `` Just as Dedmon turned right , his headlights shone directly on Anderson , who , having been severely beaten , was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel 's entrance . Dedmon accelerated , drove onto and over the street curb , and struck Anderson with the front of the F-250 . ''

Shortly afterward , Dedmon allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing , according to statements some of the teens made to detectives . `` I ran that nigger over , '' he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the youths in the other car .

`` He was not remorseful , '' Smith said . `` He was laughing , laughing about the killing . ''

But during a bail hearing last year , Dedmon 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the `` racial allegations . ''

The U.S. Justice Department had been looking into the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors . Federal investigators also have been digging for months into other possible crimes in the area committed by Dedmon and others that might show a pattern of racial violence .

Anderson 's family had asked state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty against Dedmon or any other youths who might be charged in the case , saying they oppose capital punishment in part because of their religious faith . The family also filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white youths who were present at the beating of Anderson . The Southern Poverty Law Center , a nationally recognized organization in Montgomery , Alabama , that opposes racism and intolerance , joined in the lawsuit to help the case , joining forces with the family 's attorney , Winston J. Thompson III .

`` James Anderson lost his life for no other reason than the color of his skin , '' said Morris Dees , chief trial counsel for the law center . `` Those responsible must be held accountable for their callous and deadly actions . We are filing this lawsuit today to ensure his family gets a measure of justice . ''

Anderson , a line worker at a Nissan plant , sang in his church choir , Thompson said . He is survived by his partner of 17 years .

`` He was just a pillar of the community , '' Thompson said . `` He paid his taxes on time ; he went to work , came home -- he was just an average , ordinary citizen , good guy , wonderful gardener . ''
