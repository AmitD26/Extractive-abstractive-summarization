-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Every awards ceremony has its reputation , and MTV 's Video Music Awards proudly wears the badge of scandal .

Where the Oscars are elegant and the Golden Globes rowdy , the VMAs are all about testing the boundaries of what culture deems `` decent '' and reveling in youthful -LRB- and , yes , sometimes immature -RRB- freedom .

This reputation was cemented from the first VMAs broadcast in 1984 , when a then-26-year-old Madonna sensually writhed on stage in a wedding dress to `` Like A Virgin . '' At the time , she was told her antics would ruin her career -- when in fact the opposite happened . It 's now one of the most well-known moments not only from the VMAs , but from the now 55-year-old 's legendary career .

Countless pop stars and rockers have followed in Madge 's footsteps , with each new year bearing the promise of an ever-shocking performance .

MTV VMAs : From Courtney to Kanye , why I know to expect the unexpected

So when Miley Cyrus took the VMAs stage on Sunday and proceeded to provocatively dance -LRB- with teddy bears , no less -RRB- before removing even more clothing , was she committing the offense the Internet has claimed , or simply upholding 30 years of VMAs tradition ?

With her striptease , 20-year-old Cyrus did n't do anything her predecessors have n't already . In 2000 , Britney Spears was not yet 19 when she ripped off a pantsuit at the VMAs to reveal a sparkling , flesh-toned body stocking underneath .

As host network MTV has said of the memorable moment , Spears ' `` striptease -LRB- not to mention the accompanying panting and grinding -RRB- served notice that Britney was no longer the pigtailed schoolgirl of the ' ... Baby One More Time ' video , but rather a full-grown , supremely sexy woman . ''

The singer followed up that headline-making move by dancing seductively with a snake in 2001 . In 2003 , as a callback to the VMA original `` Like a Virgin '' performance , Spears and Christina Aguilera wore wedding white for the performance . And then there was the famous Spears kiss with Madonna . When that scene threw Spears back into the crossfire , the pop star told CNN that she was just `` performing and expressing myself . ''

And need we remind you of Nirvana 's havoc-filled performance of `` Lithium '' in 1992 , or Diana Ross feeling up Lil Kim 's bare breast in 1999 ? -LRB- If you need a refresher , recall that Lil Kim was wearing a violet bodysuit that exposed one breast , which was covered with nothing more than a matching purple pasty . -RRB- Howard Stern , Marilyn Manson , Prince and Lady Gaga -LRB- the latter was at this very same show ! -RRB- have all bared their bums for MTV 's viewers .

6 memorable moments from the 2013 VMAs

To be sure , Cyrus ' Sunday performance took notes from all of the above and combined them into one show-stealing set .

But that 's more or less what the VMAs have historically been : A place to go wild -LRB- within reach of censors -RRB- , and a platform for young stars to show the world that they 're now adults , perhaps even one that feels comfortable bending over in front of an audience and dancing in a latex two-piece .

Yet the reaction to Cyrus appears to be more eviscerating than previous years . Some viewers were in awe that this is the same Cyrus who was once the Disney Channel 's teen queen on `` Hannah Montana , '' and others aghast at the provocativeness of her performance .

`` Raise your hand if you feel personally victimized by Miley Cyrus ' #VMAs performance , '' tweeted E! Online .

`` Do you think -LRB- Miley 's dad -RRB- Billy Ray Cyrus woke up with an achy breaky heart this morning after his little girl 's performance at the VMAs last night ? '' said Lady Antebellum 's Charles Kelly .

Judd Apatow , posting a picture of Cyrus from her 2012 movie `` So Undercover , '' tweeted that he 'll `` always have this version of Miley . Let 's live in the past and heal . ''

Cyrus herself has been silent about her set and its overwhelming reaction , but anyone who 's paid the slightest attention to the star would n't be too surprised by her routine .

Although she rose to fame on `` Hannah Montana , '' a role she landed at just 13 , Cyrus has always had a rocky relationship with the squeaky clean image she was expected to uphold . At 15 , the singer/actress came under fire after she posed topless for Vanity Fair , holding a sheet to her chest as she gazed at the camera .

The following year , Cyrus was criticized for her Teen Choice Awards performance , during which she danced atop an ice cream cart -- complete with a pole -- while singing her hit , `` Party in the U.S.A. '' The moment would infamously become known as Cyrus ' `` pole dance . '' She was 16 .

In the days following her 18th birthday in 2010 , Cyrus was subjected to more scrutiny when a video surfaced of the star smoking a bong apparently filled with salvia . The attention has only increased in the years since , as Cyrus has tried to transition from her Disney days into being a grown-up pop star , complete with an eye-catching haircut and the occasional middle finger thrown up in photographs .

While her critics have been vocal about their discomfort with her behavior , Cyrus has said that she 's simply being herself .

Speaking on her new album , `` Bangerz , '' to Billboard magazine , she said that she feels like `` I can really be myself . ... I really have more of a connection of who I am , and I feel like I can maybe express that more in my music now . ''

Basically , we 're hearing Britney Spears 2.0 . The moves Madonna and Spears once performed at the VMAs are now an indelible part of pop culture history , moments that make the VMAs appointment-viewing after 29 years . -LRB- BuzzFeed , for example , has come up with an astonishing 95 reasons why the `` VMAs are absolutely nothing without Britney Spears . '' -RRB-

Will Cyrus ' 2013 performance receive the same fate ? It 's far too early to tell . But if the legacy of the MTV VMAs is any indication , she 's going to express what she wants -- whether we like it or not .
