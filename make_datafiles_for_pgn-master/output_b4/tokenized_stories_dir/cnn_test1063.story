-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For ardent royalists and keen followers of the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee celebrations , there could have been few more fitting tributes to the British monarch 's abiding reign than Sunday 's 1000-strong flotilla .

The vast fleet of multi-colored , eccentrically-clad yachts - which included everything from ancient tall ships to Viking-style longboats -- was led by a gold-gilded barge carrying the queen herself , reflecting an intimate and centuries-old communion between the royal family and the high-seas .

Throughout history , British monarchs have relied on the country 's sea power to protect their kingdom and conquer new territories . During the 18th and 19th centuries their naval conquests ensured that the `` sun never set '' on its empire , but even though times have changed since then , the monarchy still enjoys a very special relationship with the symbolically titled Royal Navy .

The queen 's husband , Prince Philip , is its Lord High Admiral , while her son Charles holds the rank of Admiral -- having taken command of his own ship in 1976 . Prince William is Sub Lieutenant and Commodore-in-Chief for Scotland and Submarines and completed an attachment with the Royal Navy in 2008 .

The queen 's father , George VI , was the last British sovereign to have seen action in navy battle when , as a 20-year-old Sub-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy , he fought during the First World War in the Battle of Jutland , May 1916 .

But it 's not just in the arena of naval warfare that the royals exhibit their maritime affections .

There are probably few finer examples of a regal leisure boat than `` Her Majesty 's Yacht Britannia , '' built especially for the queen in 1953 .

Now decommissioned and on display in Edinburgh , Scotland , the vast and lavishly designed `` Britannia '' has sailed over one million miles during 44 years of service over the course of 968 official royal visits .

Once described by Queen Elizabeth as `` the one place where I can truly relax , '' the royal yacht was built to many of her specifications . Over the years it played host to the likes of Sir Winston Churchill , Boris Yeltsin , Rajiv Gandhi and Nelson Mandela and has been used for four royal honeymoons - including Prince Charles and Princess Diana 's 16-day trip in the Mediterranean .

Back on the Thames , British monarchs have a long-standing tradition of using the winding river to celebrate different types of royal events such as processions , receptions , coronations , weddings and christenings .

According to the Diamond Jubilee Pageant historians , King Richard III may have been the first English monarch to go to his coronation by water , rather than by land , in 1483 .

Four years later Henry VII did n't spare any costs when his queen , Elizabeth of York , was escorted up the river by a company of barges adorned with red , flame-breathing dragons .

A generation later , Anne Boleyn 's coronation in 1533 was one of the grandest spectacles ever seen on the river . Reports from the event suggest that it featured an impressive armada of more than 300 lavishly-apparelled vessels , and her leading barge contained a moving mechanical dragon -- complete with men dressed as monsters , casting fire towards the spectators on the riverbank .

An altogether less frightening pageant was hosted by King George I , who commissioned German-born composer Handel to write him a piece for the event in 1717 . The `` Water Music '' concert was performed for the king on his barge and , according newspaper reports of the time , he enjoyed it so much he ordered the 50 exhausted musicians to play the suites three times during the trip .

`` Back then the Thames was the biggest boulevard in London , so if a monarch wanted to make an impression on the populous they would do it on the river , '' said Pageant Master Adrian Evans , the man responsible for organizing Sunday 's eye-popping event .

As Britain began to industrialize , the number of royal pageants began to dwindle . At the time the river was virtually an open sewer , with the Houses of Parliament once having to be abandoned because MPs were `` overpowered by the smell , '' according to the official Diamond Jubilee Pageant website .

The industrialization during the Victorian era also meant the streets of London were paved and broadened to make way for machinery and traffic .

`` When the streets started to be redeveloped the event planners realized it was easier to do these types of celebrations on dry land , so they forgot about the river , '' said Evans .

Until now that is . After decades of hard work to clean the Thames , . it is now enjoying a new era of popularity .

`` The relationship between the river and city has changed over the past 30-40 years . The Thames is now one of the cleanest metropolitan rivers in the world . The best new architecture in London is built on the riverbank 's edge , and a walk by the riverbank is one of the most popular things for tourists to do when they come to visit , '' said Evans .

`` I think it 's fabulous that the river has sunk back into the hearts of the city . So it makes absolute sense that the Diamond Jubilee pageant should be on the river , '' he added .

Ultimately , the royal family 's love-affair with sailing vessels `` comes down to the fact that Britain is an island nation '' according to Hannah Cunliffe , from the National Historic Ships UK organization .

Pageant master Adrian Evans agrees , but says that the symbolic connection between royalty and the sea reflects a broader disposition embedded in the national psyche : `` Britons ' relationship with water runs deep , and our characters have been forged by the canals and the rivers . ''
