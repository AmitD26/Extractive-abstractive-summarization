-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In recent weeks , Sen. Rand Paul galvanized the nation with a 13-hour filibuster , became the toast of the Conservative Political Action Conference and embraced immigration reform before the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce .

It 's naive to think that a few speeches can reshape the Republican Party , but Paul may well represent a tectonic shift on the American right .

The junior senator from Kentucky has a vision of the Constitution in full , advocating the Second Amendment 's right to keep and bear arms and the Fourth Amendment 's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure .

He 's for civil liberties -- to protect against police abuse or presidential drones , as well as economic liberties and the freedom to run a business without unnecessary regulation . And he wants to give the blessings of those liberties to those who come to America in search of a better life .

Rand Paul has some ideas for Republicans

As a libertarian and a traditional conservative , we disagree with Paul on a number of issues . Yet we both see his constitutional conservatism as auguring a future in which social tolerance , fiscal temperance and a humbler role for government are pursued not as ends in themselves but because that 's the best path .

Conservatives `` conserve '' society by reacting to the excesses of previous generations , but the issues that prompt the reactions vary according to the times . Even the solutions to the same problems may shift with new information and reflection . National Review founder William F. Buckley , a key figure in the modern conservative movement , famously changed his mind about civil rights , the drug war and even Iraq .

Conservatives started the environmental movement with Theodore Roosevelt 's protection of national parks at a time when natural resources were plundered without regard to public health . But now , environmentalists abuse the Endangered Species Act to protect salamanders at the expense of jobs and the Clean Water Act 's wetlands protections to prevent development .

Similarly , conservatives argued for larger police and military forces in response to crime and communism , but now that cost is part of our fiscal problem .

Opinion : Rand Paul is right

Modern conservatives need to remember these lessons as they consider the future .

Their predecessors were largely successful in defeating communism , liberalizing the economy and reducing crime . But those policies were n't perfect -LRB- or cheap -RRB- : the crime-fighting of the 1980s and '90s , with an emphasis on policing and incarceration , contributed to current problems such as unfunded pensions , bloated government unions and overcrowded prisons .

After the election losses in 2012 , some Republicans have advocated a need to change . In comes Rand Paul , who may well be on the leading edge of a new conservatism , which will focus on four areas :

1 . Its social policy will focus primarily on protecting freedom of conscience in an increasingly pluralistic society , while undoing the excesses of the drug war and punitive sentencing for nonviolent crime . For example , as the country moves toward acceptance of same-sex marriage , some states have restricted the ability of Catholic charities to continue functioning without violating key religious tenets . People may disagree on moral issues , but a nation where religious charities ca n't operate is a far worse place .

2 . This new conservatism will align with the ideas of governors such as Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , who are fighting battles for domestic policy reform . At stake are the power of public-sector unions and the future of entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security . The challenge is to fix our fiscal woes while protecting the vulnerable in society , as religious conservatives understand is required by their faith . Without fiscal temperance , as well as education reform and a better regulatory environment , there will neither be the opportunity for social mobility nor resources for a social safety net , public or private .

3 . We also need to unwind our military engagements while maintaining flexibility in a rapidly changing world . Numbers do n't lie , and our debt and deficits demand a reduction in military spending . Conservatives should aim to achieve the necessary reductions in a smart fashion that maintains readiness and does n't endanger America 's interests . This will be a challenging balancing act , but it should be driven by strategic concerns rather than arbitrary benchmarks .

4 . Finally , conservatives should consider comprehensive immigration reform that would allow skilled and unskilled workers to seek their American dream while granting parole , not amnesty , to those hard-working migrants now here illegally .

Paul , Rubio provide competing glimpses of a revamped GOP

This recipe may not be the `` ideal '' that conservative pundits would like to see , and it does n't necessarily reflect our utmost individual preferences , but it reflects the practical realities of this age .

Rand Paul has n't -LRB- yet -RRB- changed conservatism , but his views will shape the movement 's future .
