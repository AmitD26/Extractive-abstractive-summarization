-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Odin Lloyd texted his sister in the wee hours of June 17 .

`` NFL . Just so you know . ''

At the time , according to prosecutors , Lloyd was in a silver Nissan Altima with Aaron Hernandez , a star tight end with the NFL 's New England Patriots , and two other people .

About 3:25 a.m. -- two minutes after the message went out -- gunshots shattered the quiet night in a southeastern Massachusetts industrial park , according to witnesses .

Not five minutes passed before a surveillance camera at his North Attleborough home captured video of Hernandez carrying what appears to be a gun , prosecutors said . Lloyd lay dead about a mile away .

The video is among the evidence prosecutors are gathering in their case against Hernandez , 23 , who is set to be arraigned Friday .

Let go by the Patriots , Hernandez will step into a courtroom for the sixth time since his June 26 arrest .

He 's expected to formally plead not guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Lloyd , a 27-year-old semipro football player .

`` He 's bearing up under the pressure , '' defense attorney Michael Fee said when Hernandez was indicted last month . `` He understands what 's in front of him , and he 's committed to clearing his name . ''

Fee has told reporters that the case against his client , who is being held without bond , is circumstantial . `` There 's an incredible rush to judgment in this case , '' according to the attorney .

For his part , according to a TMZ report last month , Hernandez declared his innocence as he responded to a fan letter , saying that `` all the people who turned on me will feel like crap . ''

Investigation continues in another case

Friday 's arraignment comes as authorities continue to investigate Hernandez in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston .

Investigators have obtained July 2012 video surveillance allegedly showing Hernandez at a nightclub at the same time as two men who were fatally shot that night , according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation .

The video apparently does not show Hernandez interacting with Daniel Abreu , 29 , and Safiro Furtado , 28 , according to a law enforcement source . The development was first reported Wednesday by the Hartford Courant .

Boston police have said the men were inside a BMW sprayed with gunfire after they left the nightclub .

Law enforcement sources said they believe Hernandez rented a silver SUV with Rhode Island registration that was linked to the scene of the double homicide .

After Lloyd 's murder , Bristol , Connecticut police discovered the vehicle by accident while searching the garage of Hernandez 's uncle , a law enforcement source told CNN .

Boston police had been looking for the vehicle for almost a year , law enforcement sources added .

Hernandez has not been charged in the unsolved double shooting .

His attorneys have previously declined to comment to CNN when asked about the ongoing Boston investigation .

Defense : Jury will find him ` innocent '

A Bristol County , Massachusetts , grand jury last month indicted Hernandez on a first-degree murder and five weapons charges .

Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the shooting of his friend Lloyd , who was dating the sister of Hernandez 's fiancee .

Fee said he was pleased with the indictment because it gave his client `` a path to trial , '' and that a jury will find Hernandez `` innocent . ''

Police have not located the gun believed to have been used in the Lloyd killing .

But prosecutors say Hernandez returned a rental car with a bullet casing that allegedly matched bullets found at the scene .

Surveillance cameras showed the car believed to be carrying Hernandez and the others at the industrial park , according to authorities .

Hernandez has been sitting in a jail cell as his former team , known for its stellar offense , contends for another Super Bowl title . The Patriots open their regular season Sunday against the Buffalo Bills .

In his letter to the fan , as reported by TMZ , the fallen NFL star said the world makes things `` out of false accusations '' and that he will be exonerated .

`` I know there is a reason I 'm going thru this and I will figure it out through my relationship with the Lord , '' Hernandez wrote .
