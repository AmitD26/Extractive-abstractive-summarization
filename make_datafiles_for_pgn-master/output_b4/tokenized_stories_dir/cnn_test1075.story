-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Samsung plans to introduce a smartphone with a curved display screen , an executive of the South Korean company said Wednesday .

D.J. Lee , Samsung 's head of mobile marketing , made the announcement at an event in Seoul to roll out the Galaxy Gear smartwatch and Galaxy Note 3 smartphone .

He said the phone would be available in October , presumably with a limited release in South Korea .

Unfortunately , that 's about all the detail he provided -- no exact release date , no details on the design , no price and no word on where it will be available .

Curved screens are a rarity among smartphones , which typically feature flat , rectangular displays . But Samsung has been tinkering with next-generation screens for a while . Early this year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , the company showed off prototypes of a line of flexible display screens it calls YOUM .

`` This new form factor will really begin to change how people interact with their devices and open up new lifestyle possibilities , '' Brian Berkeley , senior vice president of Samsung 's display lab , said at the January event . `` And it 's only going to get better . ''

In a video , they teased a smartphone with a bendable screen that opens up into a smallish tablet .

Berkeley also demonstrated how a phone display screen that 's curved along its edges would open up exponentially more space for viewing content .

A bendable , plastic display screen could also be virtually unbreakable , although it 's unclear whether the new phone -- which could be a version of the new Galaxy Note 3 -- would be plastic or some sort of step along the way .

Samsung has made a Rolls Royce of a television , the $ 9,000 , 55-inch KN55S9C , with a curved screen . And Samsung 's Galaxy Nexus smartphone , released in 2011 , had a slight curve to its screen . But the new model will presumably take the concept further .

`` I 'm expecting the company to aim for an even more extreme curve with its next phone , '' Devindra Hardawar wrote for VentureBeat . `` With its large-screen Galaxy Note lineup , Samsung has shown that it is n't afraid to step into slightly oddball territory . The Note also proves those gambles can pay off for Samsung . ''

A curved screen would also boost Samsung 's status as a leader on the mobile innovation front . Samsung Galaxy phones have outsold Apple 's iPhone during various periods over the past year , as Apple has been dinged by critics who say the company 's phones are no longer breaking new ground .

There were similar criticisms of the newly released iPhone 5S , which was viewed by many as a baby step forward , although reviews of the device have been mostly raves , and it sold a record-setting 9 million units in its first weekend on the market .
