-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Williams has turned to Brazilian Felipe Massa to boost its flagging F1 fortunes , the British based team confirming his signing for the 2014 season Monday .

Williams , once a major force in the constructors ' championship , has claimed just a single point in 2013 and has parted company with Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado .

In his place comes the 32-year-old Massa , surplus to requirements at Ferrari after the signing of Kimi Raikkonen , but with a wealth of Grand Prix experience .

He will partner Finland 's Valtteri Bottas as Williams looks to revive its flagging fortunes .

`` We are delighted to be able to confirm our 2014 driver line-up and welcome Felipe into the Williams family , '' said team principal Frank Williams .

`` He is an exceptional talent and a real fighter on the race track ; he also brings a wealth of experience as we begin a new chapter in our story . ''

Massa , runner up to Lewis Hamilton in the 2008 title race , has 11 wins and 36 podium finishes in his F1 career , but has had to play second fiddle to Fernando Alonso at Ferrari in recent seasons .

`` When I was a kid , I always dreamed about racing for Williams , Ferrari or McLaren and I 'm glad to be signing with another icon of the sport following my time at Ferrari , '' he said .

`` With such a major change of regulations in 2014 , I hope my experience will be useful in helping the team in its effort to move on from a difficult period , '' he added .

Bottas impressed Williams with his performance to put their car third on the grid after qualifying for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal this season , but he was unable to capitalize in the race .

Maldonado , who gave Williams a surprise victory in last season 's Spanish Grand Prix , has been unable to build on that promise and it is unclear if he will secure a seat with another team in 2014 .

`` We wish him well for the future , '' said Williams , who has signed Massa and Bottas to multi-year contracts .

His team last won the constructors ' title -- the last of nine -- back in 1997 , with Jacques Villeneuve claiming the drivers ' crown .

Meanwhile , Raikkonen will miss the final two races of this season due to a long-term back problem that requires surgery .

The injury flared up at September 's race in Singapore , and the 34-year-old Finn has now decided to have an operation so he is fit for the start of next season .

His Lotus team may promote third driver Davide Valsecchi , according to the F1 website , or give reserve Jerome d'Ambrosio a runout in the GPs in Austin and Sao Paulo .
