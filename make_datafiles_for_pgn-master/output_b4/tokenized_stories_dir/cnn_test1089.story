-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The audio recordings of 911 calls from the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting will be released Wednesday afternoon , after a state attorney dropped his attempt to block the disclosure .

State Attorney Stephen Sedensky , whose office conducted an investigation into the shocking mass shooting , said Monday he was withdrawing an appeal of a decision by the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to release the calls .

Sedensky said he discussed his decision with attorneys for the Connecticut town and lawyers from the office of the chief state 's attorney .

The release of the recordings will be administered by the attorneys for the Town of Newtown , Sedensky said through a written statement .

Last week , Connecticut Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott upheld the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission 's ruling to release calls related to the December 2012 shooting .

The Associated Press had challenged authorities ' refusal to release the 911 tapes .

The calls are scheduled to be made public at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday .

Sedensky 's office issued a 44-page report last week that concluded the shooter was a mentally ill recluse who never gave any indication that he was planning to kill people .

Sandy Hook killer took motive to his grave

The massacre at Sandy Hook left 26 people dead , including 20 children , making it the second-deadliest shooting in U.S. history .

The gunman , Adam Lanza , shot himself at the end of his 11-minute rampage .

The killings in Newtown , about 60 miles outside New York , happened less than five months after a similar bloodbath at a movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , outside Denver .

Those mass slayings triggered a nationwide debate over gun violence , school safety and mental health , a debate that produced some new restrictions on firearms in several states .

A backlash against those laws by gun-rights advocates followed , and there was only limited action on a federal level after a Republican filibuster blocked expanded background checks for gun buyers .

CNN 's Yon Pomrenze and Matt Smith contributed to this report .
