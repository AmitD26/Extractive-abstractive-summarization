-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- History is against Kevin Krigger . A black jockey has n't won America 's most prestigious race -- the Kentucky Derby -- for over a century .

But in Krigger 's mind , history has already been rewritten -- we just do n't know it yet .

`` I know I 'm going to win . Why ? Because I 'm riding Goldencents , '' he told CNN in his lilting Caribbean accent . `` I could n't be this confident on any other horse . ''

The bookmakers appear equally assured , placing Krigger as the second favorite to win the $ 2 million `` Run for the Roses '' -- so called for its iconic blanket of ruby-coloured flowers draped over the winner .

Kentucky is the first race of the U.S. Triple Crown series -- followed by the Preakness and Belmont Stakes .

But for many , the Derby -- run on Churchill Downs ' historic dirt track -- is also a fabulous festivity , capturing the public 's imagination in a way few horse races can .

History repeats ?

If Krigger 's prediction is right , he 'll be the first black jockey to win the premier race since Jimmy Winkfield took the trophy back-to-back in 1901 and 1902 .

Today , look out across any U.S. race track and you 'll likely see an ocean of white -- and increasingly Latin American -- jockeys at the helm .

But turn back the clock 150 years and African Americans ruled the field -- when the Kentucky Derby first launched in 1875 , 13 of the 15 jockeys were black .

Much like the NBA today , black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades , winning 15 of the first 28 Derbies .

`` They were the premier horsemen in the world , '' says Joe Drape , author of `` Black Maestro , '' which tells the story of champion jockey Winkfield .

`` It was the first professional sport for black athletes in America . They were at the forefront of horse racing and it was a place where they could earn a good living . ''

But the rise of Jim Crow laws in the late 1880s -- segregating blacks and whites -- spelled an end to the golden era of jockeys like Winkfield .

Listen : Derby 's forgotten history is rekindled

They would later be replaced by successive waves of plucky immigrants ready to try their luck on the track -- from the Irish to Latin American riders today .

In 2013 , Krigger is one of 50 black jockeys competing in the U.S. -- out of an estimated 1,000 .

So could the 29-year-old from the Virgin Islands be the one to return the trophy the original godfathers of racing ?

`` If someone is going to be the first African American in 111 years to do it , then why not me ? '' he said .

Childhood dreams

The same thought ran through Krigger 's mind as a youngster watching the Derby on TV , from his home on the island of St Croix .

Horses were a part of life for the rural community , and as a four-year-old Krigger would pull the animals next to cars so he could clamber on board .

At 10-years-old he was given his first mare , challenging other children to races on the beach and down dirt roads .

Horse-mad Krigger would even balance his saddle on the arm of the sofa and pretend to ride it .

`` I was born riding horses -- walking came second , '' he said . `` I watched the Derby every year and I knew that one day I would ride in it . It was always my dream . ''

Moving on up

At 17 , he headed to the U.S. to follow that dream , competing across the country with some success , though failing to crack into the top-ranked competitions .

His time would come a decade later . In 2011 Krigger finally found his stride , winning 124 races and notching up $ 2.8 million in prize money .

The racing world took notice -- Krigger got a call from famous Los Angeles agent Tom Knust with an offer to compete at some of the top southern California circuits .

He need n't have asked twice . Krigger packed up his family of four children and long-term girlfriend , and moved them from Seattle to a hotel , and then a trailer , before settling into a rented house .

He came under the tutelage of reigning Kentucky Derby winning trainer , Doug O'Neil , with a chance to ride the horse of his dreams -- Goldencents .

It 's little wonder Krigger is feeling confident about this Saturday 's derby -- the pair has won four of their six races together .

Expectation and dedication

Since winning the Santa Anita Derby last month -- the first black jockey in the 78-year history of the race to do so -- hype has been building around the possibility Krigger could make a repeat performance at Kentucky .

California 's Santa Anita Derby is seen as an important precursor to Kentucky , with seven of its winners going on to take the `` Run for the Roses . ''

But despite the enormous expectation , Krigger remains cool as ice : `` Every one of my races I approach the same way -- at the end of the day , it 's just another race . ''

He 's trained hard to reach this momentous point in his career -- he rises at 5 am each morning -- and success will have nothing to do with his skin color .

`` I do n't think my win is a win for African American jockeys -- every one of us has to earn the respect of our trainers , '' Krigger said .

`` The next black jockey is n't going to ride in the Kentucky Derby because of me -- it 's going to be down to them . ''
