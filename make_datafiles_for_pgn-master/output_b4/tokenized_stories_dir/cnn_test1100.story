-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Fashion Week in New York , London , Milan and Paris have ended in a flash of ruby-reds , turtlenecks and thigh-high boots . But what about Charleston , Nashville , Austin or Cleveland ?

Granted , these are n't cities where editors , buyers and bloggers from around the world flock to discover next season 's trends . But , regardless of what the Onion thinks of Iowa 's style sense , regional fashion weeks matter to the communities that host them -- and they 're starting to catch the attention of big-city fashion folk , too .

After all , `` not all designers are born and bred in New York , Paris and Milan , '' said Fern Mallis , who 's credited with creating New York Fashion Week as we currently know it . After her success there , she helped launch and guide fashion weeks in Sydney , Shanghai , Miami and Cleveland as senior vice president of IMG Fashion in the 2000s .

Each year seems to herald the launch of a fashion week in a smaller , regional U.S. city and , unlike their famous counterparts , runway shows are n't always the main event . Cleveland 's schedule in May includes pop-up boutiques , wine and cheese parties and a screening of `` Diana Vreeland : The Eye Has to Travel , '' a documentary about the influential fashion editor of Harper 's Bazaar and editor-in-chief of Vogue . In April , Nashville Fashion Week will offer a day of industry panels and several nights of runway shows featuring a mix of hometown heroes and established brands such as Tracy Reese and Nonoo .

Yes , in some cities , the weeks are basically glorified business-boosting happy hours where flavored vodka drinks and rose flow liberally from local boutiques . There 's a bit of navel-gazing , to be sure .

But , as Mallis put it , what 's the harm in trying ?

`` Regional fashion weeks are aspirational . I find something very refreshing and honest about them , '' Mallis said . `` If the sidebar is that restaurants and hotels get a lot of business , even better .

`` The fashion industry is always looking for the next hot talent and you never know where you 'll find it . It 's a funny industry , where you need to be seen , and the best way for designers ' work to be seen is on the runway , wherever it is . ''

`` Project Runway '' Season 11 contestant Amanda Valentine credits her participation in Nashville Fashion Week for the boost she needed to make the cut on the reality TV show .

She earns a living as a stylist in Music City 's entertainment industry while still cultivating her brand from a studio in the basement of her Nashville home . But during fashion week , local organizers tend to provide models , hair and makeup services , saving designers like her thousands of dollars .

Valentine auditioned for `` Project Runway '' in 2009 but did n't make the final cut . After participating in Nashville Fashion Week , she returned for auditions in 2012 with a portfolio of professional runway images and press clips lauding her work .

`` The exposure and press helps because it gives you an outside opinion that you can point to , '' Valentine said . `` Having the professional images and the ability to say ` I participated in a show ' also adds to your credibility . ''

Designers to watch after New York Fashion Week

Usually , runway shows distinguish the boozy shopping parties from events with the potential to propel young designers . A show in Nashville , Tennessee , or Austin , Texas , can give designers a chance to shine or stumble -- without the intensely critical media eye that looms over London or Paris . It just takes some time for a regional fashion week to grow from one to the other .

Charleston Fashion Week in South Carolina started out as a `` chic party '' in Marion Square and along King Street , where fashionistas hobnobbed over cocktails . In seven years , it has grown into an event that draws promising talent , industry heavyweights and thousands of attendees . Last year , the event 's economic impact was $ 2.4 million , according to figures from the Charleston Area Convention and Visitors Bureau .

The emerging designer competition is the event 's centerpiece . The nightly showdown began Tuesday , whittling down a roster of 20 aspiring designers to five finalists , who sent their collections down the runway Saturday night in a bid for the grand prize .

The winner takes home $ 5,000 in cash , $ 10,000 in online marketing and promotional services , a book of professional runway images of the winning collection , and a sewing machine . Prizes like that would certainly help semifinalist Afriyie Poku , who makes a living doing custom alterations on a secondhand sewing machine in his Atlanta apartment . He 's also on call for tailoring jobs at a hotel he quit last month to free up time to work on his menswear collection .

The tall-haired , Ghana-born Atlantan transformed the living room of his Midtown apartment into a workshop after being selected in December to participate in the contest .

His design idol is Ralph Lauren , so naturally his collection is based on traditional menswear silhouettes with what he calls an `` attention to detail that brings it into the modern era . '' Poku takes pride in his fashion-forward embellishments , such as high-waisted riding pants with reverse pleats , a side zipper or leather inseam patches , and a double-breasted morning coat lined to be warm enough on its own .

The self-taught tailor says he has a character or archetype in mind for each piece -- the hunter , the gentleman -- but he acknowledges that he 's designing for himself . That 's how he learned to sew , by altering clothes to his liking , in a fitted , tailored style inspired by his uncles , businessmen in Ghana , even if his first creation was a pair of pants made from a bedsheet .

`` My view was , ` Everything you wear has to fit well , ' '' Poku said . `` But when I went to Macy 's , things were not made to fit as I wanted , so I 'd buy clothes and made them to fit like I wanted them to fit . ''

In the month before the competition , he stayed awake for days at a time to finish the collection . In the home he shares with his girlfriend , an aspiring opera singer , he pieced together 12 fall menswear runway looks -- eight for the semifinal and four more in case he advanced to Saturday night 's final .

Poku said he does n't want to start his own label or become a `` Project Runway '' - style celeb just yet . For now , his goal is to find an apprenticeship with an established menswear designer or contract sewer .

`` I just want to give it a try and see what happens , '' he said in an interview last week in a home studio littered with spools of thread and bags of fabric . `` Even if I do n't win , I feel like just being there will help me find what I need to advance to the next level . ''

In Charleston , he knew he 'd have the eyes of an appreciative local community , as well as some established designers from the upper echelons of high fashion .

Christian Siriano already has a foothold in the industry . Celebrities such as Sarah Jessica Parker , Rihanna and Heidi Klum wear his gowns on the red carpet . He has a flagship store in New York and an eponymous line sold in Neiman Marcus and boutiques around the world . Still , he had a full schedule this week in Charleston .

`` We look at it as a business opportunity to find new customers and form new relationships with retailers , '' said Siriano , the youngest designer to win `` Project Runway '' or land on Crain 's 40 Under 40 list . `` Who wants to alienate a customer who 's ready to shop ? ''

Siriano already showed his ballet-inspired Fall 2013 collection in New York and Paris , but he brought it to Charleston for a show Saturday . On Friday he participated in a trunk show hosted by a family-owned department store , Gwynn 's of Mount Pleasant , where he would like to see his clothes sold , he said . He also judged the emerging designer competition , along with Mallis and other industry insiders and entertainers : singer-songwriter Ashanti , designers Brandon Sun and Antonio Azzuolo and Hannah Goff , winner of the 2012 Charleston emerging designer competition .

Cynthia Rowley judged the emerging designer competition in 2009 , when swimwear designer Marysia Reeves won . Since then , Reeves ' swimwear has been featured in publications including Vogue and WWD , and her collections have been picked up by Barneys New York , Anthropologie and other high-end boutiques around the world .

`` Charleston has a sophisticated , fashion-savvy audience , so it 's just a matter of making my products more accessible to them , '' said Rowley , who was in the city this week to visit her King Street store and promote her latest collection for Belk department stores . `` It 's also a great way for me to learn more about what 's happening in fashion in that part of the country . ''

The emerging designer competition final drew hundreds of people Saturday . The competition was tight , but ultimately the panel chose Poku as the winner , with Mallis describing his collection as `` something special . '' He also won the audience favorite award , another $ 250 prize .

Dozens of fans swarmed around him , making it hard for his sisters and girlfriend to reach him . As far as he was concerned , the win vindicated his efforts .

`` It 's shown me I am meant for this , '' he said of his win . `` This is my way in life . Any impact I 'll be able to make on the human race will be in this field . ''
