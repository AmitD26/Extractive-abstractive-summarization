London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The family of the British soldier brutally slain in a cleaver attack in southeast London spoke movingly Friday of a man who was a devoted husband , father and brother , as well as a dedicated serviceman .

Stepfather Ian Rigby said Drummer Lee Rigby was a `` precious gift '' who had always wanted to serve in the army and was a devoted family man .

It was difficult accepting that his stepson died on his native soil , he said .

When a soldier is serving in Afghanistan , `` you come to terms with it , '' Ian Rigby said . `` You do n't expect something like that on your doorstep . It 's very difficult . ''

`` I just want to say that I love Lee , I always will , and I 'm proud to be his wife , '' said Rebecca Rigby , sobbing . `` He was a devoted father to our son , Jack , and we will both miss him terribly . ''

Her husband had been due to travel home to see her and their 2-year-old son this weekend , she said .

In the capital 's Woolwich neighborhood , where Rigby was slain Wednesday by two men who drove a car into him , then hacked him with knives and a cleaver , a bank of flowers left in tribute swelled by the hour Friday .

Soldier was a machine gunner , Royal Palaces drummer , father

Many of those who came to the road near an army barracks were emotional as they paid tribute not just to him , but to the contribution of all British servicemen and women .

A note signed by two army cadets , reads : `` I understand the great lengths you would have gone to to protect our British people . It 's a huge disappointment to hear the way people have treated you in your own country . ''

One bouquet , propped in a pair of black army boots , had a message that read : `` RIP Brave Soldier . Dream sweet dreams . Remembered always and never forgotten . Our thoughts with you and your family . ''

One elderly man , using a cane , had tears in his eyes as he walked , shaking his head , up and down the flowers for half an hour . He removed his hat , looked to the heavens and made the sign of the cross .

Another woman , loudly sobbing , asked police officers standing by the growing array of tributes : `` Why did this happen , why did this happen here ? My children go to the school just there . ''

A man sharply dressed in a suit and tie brought his toddler son to drop off flowers , each placing their blooms next to the army boots . The father reached down to hug his son , tears filling his eyes .

One note referred to both a quote by the late Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi and comments made by one of the attackers , saying : `` An eye for an eye makes the world go blind . ''

Another had a more sinister message . Attached to a wooden cross adorned with a red poppy , the symbol of remembrance for the British armed forces , it read : `` Your passing shall be avenged . ''

Outpouring of support for charity for vets

Since the brutal slaying , the outpouring of support for a charity that supports Britain 's wounded military veterans , Help for Heroes , has been so great that its website has crashed .

Rigby , a 25-year-old machine gunner and military drummer , was wearing a Help for Heroes T-shirt when he was attacked in Woolwich , according to witnesses .

Help for Heroes said Friday it had been `` overwhelmed with people spontaneously showing their support for the Armed Forces '' since the news broke .

`` This sudden surge of interest in the work we 're doing to help the wounded and their families has taken us completely by surprise , '' the charity said , noting that some were buying hoodies and T-shirts like the one Rigby had on .

`` We just want to help , and all funds we receive will be used to provide direct , practical support to those affected by their service to our country . ''

3 men arrested in connection to slaying

There 's been no indication that Rigby knew the men who attacked him with meat cleavers Wednesday afternoon .

One of the two , who approached a man filming the gory scene in the Woolwich neighborhood , suggested that Rigby had been targeted only `` because Muslims are dying daily '' at the hands of British troops like him . Britain 's armed forces have served in Iraq and Afghanistan . All its combat troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .

`` We must fight them as they fight us . An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , '' he said in the video aired by CNN affiliate ITN .

Friends , acquaintances and British media have identified that man as 28-year-old Michael Adebolajo , a British national of Nigerian descent .

Police have not released his name , nor those of the others they 've arrested .

Adebolajo and the 22-year-old suspect also tied directly to the attack are now hospitalized under guard after a confrontation with police in which they were shot . A 29-year-old man arrested Thursday is being on suspicion of conspiracy to murder .

Two women arrested Thursday , ages 29 and 31 , have been released without being charged , police said Friday .

Police continue to search five addresses in London and one in Lincolnshire , which is in eastern England .

Suspect knew British Muslim radical leader

It is understood the two people suspected of carrying out the knife attack were known to Britain 's domestic security service . They had been featured in previous investigations into other people , but were not themselves under surveillance .

Abu Baraa blamed Wednesday 's attack not on his friend Michael Adebolajo -- who he says is the bloody , cleaver-wielding man shown talking in the ITN video -- but on the British government and said there may be more attacks .

`` As long as -LRB- British -RRB- foreign policy is engaging in violence , they 're only inviting violence in retaliation , '' Baraa told CNN .

By sharp contrast , Prime Minister David Cameron said `` the fault lies solely with sickening individuals who carried out this attack , '' adding that `` nothing in Islam ... justifies this truly dreadful act . ''

British Muslim radical leader Anjem Choudary told CNN on Thursday that he knew Adebolajo , noting the suspect attended demonstrations and a few lectures organized by Choudary 's group Al-Muhajiroun .

In fact , an ITN video from April 2007 shows Adebolajo standing behind Choudary at a rally protesting the arrest of men who allegedly made inflammatory speeches inside a mosque .

Syrian cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed , who founded Al-Muhajiroun in the late 1990s , told CNN Terrorism Analyst Paul Cruickshank by phone from Tripoli , Lebanon , he also had been acquainted with Adebolajo .

Bakri Mohammed used to live in the United Kingdom but was barred from returning after the 2005 terror attacks .

Bakri Mohammed said Adebolajo , who he knew by his Muslim name `` Mujahid , '' attended several talks he gave in London from 2003 to 2004 and was at his side at a number of Al-Muhajiroun protests against the war in Iraq around that time .

One talk Adebolajo attended was at a Woolwich community center , he said , noting the group met in such locations because they were not welcomed in mosques . The very large majority of British Muslims reject Bakri Mohammed 's views .

The radical cleric said that although they did not have many interactions , Adebolajo stood out because he was a new convert to the religion .

Bakri Mohammed said he had no contact with him after he left the UK .

Volley of shots

Dramatic video footage obtained by Britain 's Daily Mirror newspaper , filmed from an apartment block overlooking the street , shows the moment when armed police arrived at the scene .

One of the attackers rushes at the police vehicle brandishing knives while the other aims a gun . Both are brought down by a volley of shots .

The firearms unit was called in after the initial alert because British police do not usually carry weapons . Witnesses remarked that the two attackers appeared to wait for the armed police to arrive , nearly 15 minutes after their assault on Rigby .

The two injured suspects remained in stable condition at separate South London hospitals Friday , the Metropolitan Police said .

The attack , which Cameron and others called an act of terror , stirred anxiety and alerts in Britain not seen since the summer of 2005 , when coordinated bomb attacks struck London 's public transport network .

An additional 1,200 police are now on London 's streets to reassure the public , police said Thursday . Extra security is in place for military personnel and sites .

Violent reactions ?

The Woolwich bloodshed spurred concerns not only about violence by Islamic extremists , but also about attacks targeting Muslims by people angered by Rigby 's killing .

London attack mirrors plot to behead Muslim soldier

In Kent , police arrested a man on suspicion of `` racially aggravated criminal damage '' at a religious building . And on Wednesday night in Essex , a man with two knives was arrested after throwing a smoke grenade at the Al Falah Braintree Islamic Center and demanding someone come outside to answer to the Woolwich slaying , said the mosque 's secretary , Sikander Sleemy .

Members of the far-right English Defence League clashed with police late Wednesday , with a tweet from its official account touting that `` it 's fair to say that finally the country is waking up ! :--RRB- NO SURRENDER ! ''

`` Do n't listen to the Government cover ups , The lies about Islam being peaceful , '' read another EDL tweet Thursday .

Political and social commentator Mohammed Ansar appealed for `` a sense of calm -LRB- and -RRB- perspective '' after what he called `` a really , really heinous act of , I would say , criminality , ... not terrorism . ''

`` What we do n't need are knee-jerk reactions ... to really ratchet up tensions and really stoke and inflame anxieties within communities , '' he told CNN .

Nearly 100 senior British imams together issued a statement sharply condemning the `` sick and barbaric '' killing , which they said had spurred `` hate-fueled individuals '' to attack mosques and Muslims . The group called for action and dialogue to prevent attacks by extremists of all ilks .

`` We -LRB- urge -RRB- our fellow citizens not to be taken in the mindless rantings of the -LRB- few -RRB- extra extremists in our midst , '' they said . `` We , the British people , are not so easily fooled ; nor are we so easily divided . ''
