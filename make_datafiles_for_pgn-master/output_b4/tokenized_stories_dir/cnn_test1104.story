-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seen the ball drop in New York 's Times Square ?

Caught the fireworks over Sydney Harbour ?

There are plenty of other ways to ring in the New Year .

Byron Bay , Australia

Among the first places in Australia to see the sun rise , Byron Bay in New South Wales hosts one of the country 's largest parties on New Year 's Eve .

This year , for the first time , the three-day Falls Music & Arts Festival will take over the town from December 31 to January 3 , which means tunes from MGMT , Grizzly Bear , The Roots and Vampire Weekend .

Away from the North Byron Parklands , festivities will feature family friendly activities from 9 p.m. , plus an early morning event on Main Beach on the first day of the New Year .

If you do n't have a ticket to Falls , are n't a local or do n't have a hotel booked , you wo n't get in . The mayor is planning to `` lock '' everyone else out in order to `` curb alcohol-fueled violence and destruction of property in the town . ''

Good times apparently await those who have prepared in advance .
