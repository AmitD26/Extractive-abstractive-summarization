-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Arsenal 's eight-year trophy drought looks set to continue as Arsene Wenger 's men crashed out of the English FA Cup on Saturday losing 1-0 to Championship side Blackburn Rovers at the Emirates .

The Gunners , whose last silverware came in the same competition in 2005 , were undone by a Colin Kazim-Richards ' goal in the 72nd minute to send the former Premier League side into the quarterfinal draw .

It is the second time this season that Arsenal have been knocked out of a domestic cup competition by opposition from a lower league -- fourth-tier Bradford City beat them on penalties in the League Cup in December .

With their league title chances also dead in the water , Arsenal only remaining chance of glory this term is in the Champions League . But they will need to pick themselves up smartly with Bayern Munich arriving at the Emirates on Tuesday for the first leg of their last-16 .

`` We do n't need to think too much about the eight season -LRB- trophy drought -RRB- , '' Wenger said after the match .

`` The players who played today did n't play eight seasons ago and we must focus on the next game . ''

Fellow Premier League team Everton also ran into trouble against lower division opposition in their FA Cup tie .

David Moyes ' side looked to have succeeded where their Merseyside rivals Liverpool had failed in the previous round , as they led 2-1 into injury time against Oldham Athletic . But a late Matt Smith 's header earned the League One side a replay .

On Sunday , Chelsea will look to overcome Brentford in their fourth-round reply while Manchester City and Wigan face Leeds United and Huddersfield respectively in the fifth round . Manchester United play Reading on Monday .

Meanwhile in the Bundesliga , Bayern Munich are almost home and dry in their bid for a 23rd title after coasting to another easy win on Friday .

Saturday 's fixtures saw no slip ups from the runaway leader 's closest rivals .

Second-place Borussia Dortmund kept up their faint hopes of retaining their title with a 3-0 win at home to fourth-place Frankfurt .

Third-place Bayer Leverkusen also won on Saturday , beating second-from-bottom Augsburg 2-1 to remain one point behind Dortmund and open up a four-point gap on Frankfurt .

Fifth-place Freiburg overcame Werder Bremen 3-2 at the Weserstadion while Hamburg also won -- 1-0 against Monchengladbach .

But there was deadlock in the game between Mainz and Schalke . Michel Bastos scored a brace -- the second rescuing a point for the Royal Blues .

Greuther Furth remain rooted to the foot of the table after losing 1-0 to Dusseldorf .
