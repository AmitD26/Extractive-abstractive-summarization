London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A jury in the case of two former personal assistants accused of defrauding celebrity chef Nigella Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi was sent out Thursday but has not yet reached a verdict .

Francesca Grillo is accused of defrauding Lawson and Saatchi of 580,000 pounds -LRB- $ 950,000 -RRB- , and Elisabetta Grillo is accused of defrauding them of 105,000 pounds -LRB- $ 172,000 -RRB- . They deny the charges .

The jury was sent home for the night and will resume deliberations Friday .

One of the defendants was not in the dock at the end of deliberations Thursday because `` she is not feeling well , '' the judge said .

The Italian sisters have told Isleworth Crown Court in west London that Lawson authorized their personal expenditures on Saatchi 's company credit cards , including on designer shoes , clothes and trips abroad .

Their respective defense lawyers said in their closing arguments Thursday that the prosecution 's claims had not been proved .

They also argued that for the jury to return a guilty verdict , it would have to be sure that Lawson did not authorize the sisters ' spending either explicitly or implicitly .

Both defense lawyers questioned Lawson 's credibility as a witness and said their clients ' claims that she repeatedly used drugs were relevant to that issue .

Elisabetta Grillo 's defense lawyer , Anthony Metzer , told the jury that his client was the `` soft underbelly '' by which Saatchi was attacking Lawson after the breakdown of their relationship . The couple divorced this year .

Karina Arden , representing Francesca Grillo , said her client had made no attempt to hide her spending , so it was impossible for Lawson to say she was ignorant of it .

The case has gripped UK media , thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and intimate insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi , a millionaire art collector .

Jane Carpenter , giving the prosecution 's closing argument in the case , said Thursday that the sisters had abused their position `` time and time again '' and that they `` grew bolder and greedier '' as time went by .

`` Just because Saatchi is a wealthy man , obviously it does n't mean he should be defrauded by the staff , '' Carpenter said . `` That seems to be what the defense are putting forward . ''

She urged the jury to find both sisters guilty .

In her own testimony , Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times , during two periods of her life , and used cannabis in the past . But she denied being a habitual user .

The court heard that none of the witnesses had seen her take drugs .

Lawson , whose culinary skills and flirtatious manner have long entranced UK audiences , has also appeared as a judge on the ABC show `` The Taste '' in the United States . A second season of the show is due to air in January .
