Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Michael Jackson 's death instantly changed the lives of his family and friends . The weeks immediately after the pop icon died were chaotic , and many questions are still unanswered for those closest to Jackson .

Michael 's children

The day their father died , Prince Michael , 13 , Paris , 12 , and Blanket , 8 , moved in with their grandmother Katherine Jackson at the Encino , California , home where Michael once lived with his family .

The home is filled with memories of their father , including many photos of a young Michael Jackson . The theater room of the large house was converted into a classroom where they 've been home-schooled for the past year .

The grassy yard of the Encino estate is often filled with Michael 's kids playing ball with four cousins -- the sons of Jackson brothers Jermaine and Randy -- who have lived there the past year with their mother .

They share a computer with internet access , which resulted in fans getting a rare and candid look at Blanket 's dancing , acting and light saber skills when several videos were uploaded to YouTube in April .

While Jackson kept his children shrouded in privacy during his life , they have appeared at a handful of public events to honor their father since his death .

Paris made the world cry at the end of a memorial for her father when she said , `` Ever since I was born , daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine . ''

Paris and her older brother took the stage at the 2010 Grammy Awards to accept their father 's lifetime achievement award .

`` To all his songs , his message was simple , love , '' Prince Michael said . `` We will continue to spread his message and help the world . ''

The three children traveled to Gary , Indiana , this week for their first visit to their father 's first home . They will take part in a tribute there , along with Katherine Jackson and their grandfather Joe Jackson .

Michael 's mother

Katherine Jackson 's main focus since her son 's death has been caring for his three children . A Los Angeles judge immediately gave her temporary custody , which became permanent after Debbie Rowe , the mother of the two oldest children , agreed not to challenge her .

Michael 's 80-year-old mother waged a legal fight for several months for control of Jackson 's estate , but gave up her probate challenge in October . She and Jackson 's children are the main beneficiaries of the estate . For now , they are receiving an $ 86,000 monthly family allowance .

Katherine Jackson and her husband have attended every hearing in the criminal case against Dr. Conrad Murray , the physician who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in their son 's death .

She has only recently begun speaking publicly about her son 's death , giving a handful of media interviews . Katherine Jackson also posted a YouTube video this month announcing her support for a tribute to Michael Jackson to be held June 26 in Beverly Hills , California .

Although Katherine and Joe Jackson have been married for 61 years , they do not usually share a home .

Michael 's father

In the weeks after Michael Jackson 's death , Joe Jackson -- his children call him Joseph -- denied allegations that he physically abused his son during his Jackson 5 days .

`` Never . Never have . And I -- and I raised him just like you would raise your kids , you know ? But harm Michael , for what ? I have no reason . That 's my son . I loved him and I still love him , '' Jackson told CNN 's `` Larry King Live '' in August .

Joe Jackson has been outspoken and active in raising questions about his son 's death . Jackson has called for a more serious charge than involuntary manslaughter against Murray .

He recently filed a complaint with the California Medical Board against AEG , the company that was producing the comeback concerts . The complaint accused AEG of neglecting to provide the recommended medical equipment and a nurse who was supposed to assist Dr. Murray . Those measures could have prevented the singer 's death or revived Jackson when he stopped breathing , according to the complaint .

Michael 's father also plans to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray on Friday , the anniversary of his son 's death .

Jackson , not mentioned in his son 's 2002 will , has an ongoing legal challenge against the men named as executors in the document . The probate judge has ruled against him , but it is under appeal .

While Jackson , 80 , receives a monthly Social Security check , he depended on financial support from his son . That ended with his son 's death . He petitioned the probate court to award him $ 15,000 a month in support , but the request is still pending .

Jackson , who lives in Las Vegas , Nevada , has been promoting his vision of a Jackson family museum and entertainment center in Gary , Indiana .

Michael 's siblings

Michael Jackson 's five brothers and three sisters have , at times , come together as a family since his death . But , as with many large families , they each follow their own paths .

Brothers Jackie , Jermaine , Tito and Marlon appeared together on an A&E Network reality show last fall that followed their attempt to record and perform again as a musical group . The series ended after six episodes with no new songs and no public performances . Brother Randy chose not to take part in the show .

Jermaine Jackson has been the most visible publicly , traveling around the world to promote his own projects and Michael Jackson 's legacy . He recently performed a tribute concert to his brother in Gambia .

Sister Janet has stayed busy with her acting and music career , which included roles in two Tyler Perry movies in the past year .

La Toya Jackson has been outspoken in her belief that Michael Jackson was the victim of a criminal conspiracy to kill him . She has attended each of Murray 's court hearings .

Rebbie Jackson , the oldest of the Jackson siblings , recently resumed her singing career . However , she has mostly remained out of the spotlight .

Michael 's ex-wife

Debbie Rowe is a former nurse who married Michael Jackson in 1996 , gave birth to his two oldest children and then agreed to a divorce settlement in 1999 . Prince Michael and Paris remained with their father .

In the weeks after Jackson 's death , Rowe considered a legal challenge for custody of the children . She finally reached an agreement with Katherine Jackson that would allow her supervised visits with the children under guidelines to be recommended by a child psychologist . It is unclear if the children know Rowe is their mother .

Michael 's doctors

Murray lost his only patient when Jackson died a year ago . It was several months before Murray resumed his medical practices in Houston , Texas , and Las Vegas , Nevada .

He never got paid the $ 150,000 monthly salary he was owed for the two months he was Jackson 's personal physician while the pop star rehearsed in Los Angeles for his comeback concerts , Murray 's lawyer said .

Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson 's death in February . The judge refused to suspend his California medical license , although Murray can not personally administer anesthesia on patients . The maximum sentence if convicted is four years in prison .

His preliminary hearing , which is expected to last at least a week , could begin in late September . A trial could be held next year .

Dr. Arnold Klein , Jackson 's dermatologist and longtime friend , was never criminally implicated in Jackson 's death , although drug agents did subpoena medical records from his office .

Klein hinted in an interview that he may have been a sperm donor for Jackson 's children . His lawyer unsuccessfully appeared at a probate hearing last summer to seek a role for Klein in the children 's lives .

Michael 's money

When Jackson died , he was nearly $ 500 million in debt , according to a source familiar with his estate who is not authorized to speak about financial matters . In the year since , the debt has been reduced to about $ 300 million , the source said . The remaining debt is `` very manageable '' considering the income flowing into the estate , the source said .

Sony Music , which recently signed a $ 250 million recording contact with Jackson 's estate , said fans bought 31 million Jackson albums in the past year . Sony 's film division also paid $ 60 million to produce the `` This Is It '' documentary that was a global blockbuster last year .

The estate also has a steady flow of cash from the rights to 250 Beatles songs that Jackson shares with Sony .

Merchandising rights , a Cirque du Soleil deal and a memorabilia tour have also brought in millions to the estate .

Jackson 's estate is being administered by John Branca , an entertainment lawyer , and John McClain , a former music executive , who were named executors in the 2002 will . Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has not made a final ruling on who will have permanent control of the estate .
