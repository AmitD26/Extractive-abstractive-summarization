-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A month of conflict has displaced about 413,000 people in South Sudan , the United Nations said Wednesday , after a major surge in the number of people fleeing violence in the past week .

Representatives of the government and rebels have been holding talks in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , but fighting continues to wrack the world 's newest country .

Hundreds of people have been wounded and thousands displaced by heavy fighting over the past few days , Medecins Sans Frontieres -LRB- MSF -RRB- said Wednesday .

The group , also known as Doctors Without Borders , said its teams had treated 116 people suffering from gunshot wounds in the towns of Malakal and Nasir in Upper Nile state amid clashes there and elsewhere .

The violence has also forced about 78,000 to flee to neighboring countries , the United Nations said , on top of the hundreds of thousands displaced within South Sudan 's borders . Many are women and children .

More than 42,000 people are now in Uganda 's West Nile region , according to the United Nations ' refugee agency , the UNHCR , while about 18,600 have sought refuge in Ethiopia .

Nearly 6,800 people from Jonglei have fled to Kenya , many of them children . And an estimated 10,000 have fled into Sudan 's volatile West Kordofan and South Kordofan states .

The U.N. refugee agency warned Tuesday that with fighting still reported in parts of South Sudan , particularly Jonglei and Upper Nile states , it expects more displacement both within and beyond its borders .

The exodus has been fueled by the fighting and people 's fears , combined with worsening living conditions and a lack of food in some places , UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told reporters in Geneva , Switzerland .

Many South Sudanese men are taking their families to the Ugandan border and leaving them there before returning to their country , he said .

`` From the refugees we have spoken to , we are hearing eyewitness accounts of killings , houses being burnt and shooting , '' Edwards said .

Within South Sudan , about 65,000 people have sought sanctuary at U.N. bases .

The country erupted into violence on December 15 , when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup . Since then , militia members loyal to Machar have battled government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir .

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has condemned anti- and pro-government forces for stealing food and vehicles used by the humanitarian community .

In a statement issued on Tuesday , his spokesperson said Ban was `` alarmed by the rising number of fatalities resulting from the continuing fighting in South Sudan '' and reiterated those responsible for attacks against civilians , humanitarian workers and UN personnel will be held to account .

The U.N. Mission in South Sudan reported heavy fighting Tuesday between pro- and anti-government forces in Malakal , in Upper Nile state in the northeast of the country .

Stray shots injured dozens of displaced people who 'd sought refuge at a nearby U.N. base , the mission said .

MSF said the medical needs of the displaced are placing existing health facilities under increasing pressure , with some clinics and hospitals already overwhelmed . The group added it was reinforcing emergency teams to deal with the rising health and humanitarian needs .

`` While we continue to treat more wounded patients in our hospitals every day , we are also concerned about the living conditions of the hundreds of thousands of displaced people across the country , most of whom fled their homes with nothing and have little food , water , or access to health care , '' Raphael Gorgeu , MSF head of mission in South Sudan , said in a statement .

`` The fighting in Malakal over the past few days has limited our ability to reach displaced people where they are gathering , preventing people from receiving the medical and humanitarian assistance they desperately need . ''

Between 200 and 300 women and children who were fleeing fighting drowned when an overloaded ferry overturned on a river near Malakal over the weekend , an army spokesman said .

On Tuesday , Ghana said it was preparing to send 850 troops to join a U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan .

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization appealed this week for $ 61 million to help it provide food assistance to those in need .

Even before the violence broke out last month , about 4.4 million people were expected to face food insecurity this year , an agency news release said . Now , many more are at risk of hunger .

South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war .
