-LRB- Real Simple -RRB- -- Visit a bathroom in a home in the Netherlands and you might find a good idea staring you in the face : a list of birthdays important to your host posted opposite the toilet . Why in that spot ? To assure that it 's viewed regularly .

While you may not want to sacrifice your bathroom aesthetics for the sake of remembering key birthdays , the more often you see the dates , the more likely it is you 'll remember them .

As founder and `` Exalted Queen Mother '' of the Red Hat Society , an international network of women over 50 , Sue Ellen Cooper chooses to keep her long list of reminders in the kitchen .

`` I have a list of every significant birthday taped to the inside of my pantry door , '' she says . `` It 's impossible not to see those dates every time I open the pantry . ''

Whether it 's inside a cabinet , on the refrigerator , or bookmarking a page in the novel you 're reading , place your list in a spot where you are likely to view it every day and you 'll always be aware of an impending birthday . Real Simple : How to handle a milestone birthday

Use a perpetual calendar to remember birthdays

Traditional calendars are less than ideal for keeping track of birthdays , as they require you to pencil in all your important dates each year .

A perpetual calendar solves that problem by charting the months without naming the day of the week for each date . Find 5-by-14-inch calendars for $ 10 at www.galison.com . You can also download a printable perpetual birthday-reminder calendar -LRB- for free -RRB- at Hallmark.com , or use the Real Simple : Birthday reminder worksheet .

Similar to a perpetual calendar but used exclusively for birthdays , a birthday book allows you to jot down birthdays without having to rewrite each date yearly .

Keep it somewhere visible , though , such as on top of a coffee table or on your desk , as opposed to placing it on a bookshelf , where it may get lost amid your Steinbecks and Angelous . The 2 3/4 - by-4 1/4-inch pocket birthday organizer from Fred Flare -LRB- $ 8 -RRB- will fit in your handbag , so you can commit dates to memory as you wait for your latte .

Track birthdays in your day planner

For some , a day planner or a Filofax is preferable to a wall calendar because it 's portable .

Erica Ecker , a.k.a. `` The Specialist , '' is a New York City-based organizational specialist who recommends writing birthdays in a day planner with a colored marker . `` Pick a unique color , '' she says , `` so that when you go to rewrite the dates for the next year , the birthdays stand out . ''

Ecker also inserts mini Post-it notes as `` birthday alarms . '' Insert one in the planner a few days ahead of the first birthday for which you would like to send a card . This way , you 'll get the card in the mail on time . Once you 've done that , move the Post-it ahead in the book to a few days before the next important birthday .

If rewriting birthdays feels like too much of a chore , jot down birthdays on the tabbed section dividers before each month in your day planner . Then you can simply pull out the dividers the following year and place them before each month in your new planner . Real Simple : Look great in your birthday photos
