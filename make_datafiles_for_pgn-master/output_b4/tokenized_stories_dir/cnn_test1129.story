-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A niece of fashion designer Ralph Lauren appeared Tuesday at an Irish court hearing on charges that included air rage related to an incident on Monday , CNN affiliate TV3 reported .

A judge was considering a bail application for Jennifer Lauren , 41 , the Irish commercial broadcaster reported .

Lauren spent Monday night at the Shannon Garda Station and appeared Tuesday at the hearing , which was held in a pub , state broadcaster RTE reported .

Local media reported that the unlikely location was because there was no dedicated courthouse in the area .

The incident occurred aboard a Barcelona-to-New York flight that was diverted to Shannon Airport . Lauren is charged with engaging in threatening , abusive or insulting behavior intended to disrupt the peace or being reckless as to whether a breach of the peace might have been caused , RTE said .

She is also charged with being intoxicated `` to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that you might endanger yourself or other persons on board on the same date on the same flight , '' RTE said .

And she is further charged with engaging in behavior likely to cause serious offense or annoyance to anyone aboard the plane after having been asked by a flight member to stop acting that way , it said .

The incident led the captain of the Delta Air Lines Flight 477 , with 216 passengers , to land at Shannon , where Lauren was arrested .

A Delta spokesman said the diversion was due to `` an unruly customer . ''

The plane resumed its flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport more than two hours later .

A lawyer for Lauren , Sharon Curley , did not immediately return a call or e-mail seeking comment . But she told Killaloe District Court that her client would plead guilty to the charges , RTE said .

At Tuesday 's district court hearing in the Brian Boru pub in the adjoining Lough Derg town of Ballina , Judge Patrick Durcan said that Lauren 's case would be heard Wednesday in Ennis and that he would weigh the disruption to the airline and passengers , RTE added .

Lauren was expected to pay bail of 2,500 euros Tuesday .

Lauren runs a business in the United States called Jenny Lauren Jewelry .

Her 2004 memoir , `` Homesick : A Memoir of Family , Food and Finding Hope , '' describes her effort to overcome an eating disorder and related health problems during her teens and 20s .
