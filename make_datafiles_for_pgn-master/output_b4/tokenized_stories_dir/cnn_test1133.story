Aleppo , Syria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Journalists often get invited on tours of battle zones during wars , but the one the Syrian government organized for CNN and several other media outlets Wednesday was more than bizarre .

We had been told we were going on a trip to the front line in Damascus . Instead , we were driven to an airfield and packed into an old Soviet-made Yakovlev YAK-40 aircraft . It was n't until we were in the air that government officials on the flight finally offered up some information .

`` We are going to Aleppo , '' one said with a smile . He told reporters that ours would be the first civilian aircraft to land at the city 's international airport since December 2012 , when the airfield was shut because of heavy clashes in the area .

We sat still , slightly nervous about the guinea pig role we had been thrust into by the government , as our pilot performed a spectacular combat landing on a foggy day . As the aircraft taxied toward the terminal we finally realized that we were the news of the day . A live transmission vehicle and dozens of reporters were waiting to greet us as Syrian government TV carried the live banner proclaiming `` The reopening of Aleppo Airport and the landing of a commercial flight . ''

Mohammed Wahid al Akad , Aleppo 's provincial governor , was on hand to greet us , eager to show us the gains that Syrian forces had made in and around the city -- and also talk about the ongoing negotiations in Switzerland between representatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's government and various opposition factions .

`` What we want from Geneva is to stop foreign money , fighters and weapons coming into Syria . We as Syrians can reconcile with each other , make our own government to rebuild our country , '' he said . Three buses picked us up for a tour of areas the military had recently taken back from rebels .

Aleppo and its surrounding areas are a key battleground in Syria 's hard-fought , nearly three-year-old civil war . The killings have been far too numerous to count .

In December , overwhelmed doctors scurried to help scores of patients amid days of air raids by the government .

`` There was a big massacre today , '' Dr. Ammar Zakaria told CNN at the time . `` We were treating shrapnel wounds , deep abdominal and brain injuries . I just lost count of the amputations . ''

For a long time it appeared opposition forces might take full control of Syria 's largest city . But infighting among various rebel groups and a resurgent Syrian army has reversed momentum . The government soldiers we spoke with sounded confident and emboldened by their recent gains .

`` Al Qaeda were the worst people to fight against . They are Islamists , they see us as infidels and they want to kill us , '' one soldier said .

As the buses drove us to the town of Tal Hassil near the airport , people lined the streets , chanting pro-Assad slogans . We were not sure how spontaneous this show of affection really was .

We were taken to an aid distribution center before the tour took us to regime-held areas of Aleppo .

The city has the same remarkable dynamic as many other Syrian cities during the civil war , including Homs and Damascus . As the mortars boom and machine guns crackle during heavy clashes in many parts of town , other neighborhoods seem totally normal , to an almost absurd extent .

The United Nations and other international groups accuse Syrian regime forces of using heavy weapons against civilian areas , including barrel bombs -- oil drums filled with explosives that cause massive destruction wherever they are dropped .

But in many government-controlled parts of the city , just a few blocks from the fighting , the streets are full of people and the shops are well stocked . There are trendy restaurants and cafÃ © s , even as rebels control almost half of the city .

Syrian officials believe that Aleppo could be a model for a ceasefire between regime and rebel forces . But looking over the skyline , it is easy to see just how hard that will be .

At a sniper position atop of one of Aleppo 's tallest buildings , soldiers showed us areas under opposition control . Some are held by the moderate Free Syrian Army , or the newly-constituted and moderate Islamic Front . But others are under the control of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -LRB- ISIS -RRB- , the al Qaeda-linked group which is battling against other rebel factions in its bid to set up an Islamic caliphate in Syria .

Aleppo offered many surprises before we climbed back into our rickety old YAK-40 jet at the end of the day . But it still seems that a ceasefire in the city is a long way off , even if the Geneva negotiations go well .
