-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Athletes from 97 nations will march in Vancouver tonight at the Opening Ceremony of the XXI Winter Olympic Games . Turn on your TV . Watch and cheer .

Cheer for the sportsmanship and spirit shown at this highest level of competition among the world 's nations .

A fine example of this sportsmanship happened four years ago , when a ski pole , a race in Italy and maple syrup came together . It started when Norwegian cross-country ski coach Bjørnar Håkensmoen performed an extraordinary act .

On February 14 , 2006 , Canadian cross-country skier Sara Renner began the women 's team sprint competition in Turin with something to prove . After having placed no higher than eighth in four events at the Salt Lake City Games in 2002 , Renner was determined to improve her performance in Turin . But in the middle of the final heat , something terrible happened . One of her ski poles broke .

Suddenly , all seemed lost . Four years of intense training for this 17-minute race were about to amount to nothing . Then Håkensmoen saw what happened .

Without giving it a second thought , he handed the Canadian skier the Norwegian team 's spare pole . Renner and teammate Beckie Scott charged forward to finish in second place , earning a silver medal . Norway ended up fourth -- without a medal .

An appreciative Renner thanked Håkensmoen with a bottle of wine . The Canadian people , touched by the selflessness of the Norwegian coach , established Project Maple Syrup , an organization designed to solicit donations of a Canadian national treasure . In all , 5.2 tons of maple syrup -LRB- 7,400 cans -RRB- were shipped across the Atlantic to Håkensmoen and then on to Norwegians . Canadians also sent thank-you notes and recipes .

In an instant , Håkensmoen reminded all those who were fortunate enough to witness his act of sportsmanship that the rings on the Olympic flag , intended to represent a color of every flag of every nation in the world , are interlocked and interdependent .

The Olympics remind the world of the folly in thinking that anyone can stand alone . There are times when all people and all nations need a little help , whether that help comes in the form of a charitable donation , a word of encouragement or even a spare ski pole .

Perhaps what is most remarkable about Håkensmoen 's gesture that day was how unremarkable it was to him . When asked about his action by The Associated Press , Håkensmoen replied , `` It was natural for me to do it , and I think anyone should have done it . '' Håkensmoen 's act demonstrates why the Olympic Games matter : because sometimes -- in spite of skyrocketing salaries for professional athletes , increased illegal drug usage and waning loyalty between fans and their teams -- sometimes sports get it right .

Today , cheer not just for the United States but for the other 96 countries as well . Cheer because any time so many nations congregate with common goals , under common rules and in peace ought to be cause for celebration .
