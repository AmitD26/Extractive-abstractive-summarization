-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As saber rattling grows over the Syrian president 's alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people , Bashar al-Assad 's once high-profile wife , Asma , has kept a low profile .

`` She 's just hunkered down in Damascus , '' said Andrew Tabler , a senior fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of `` In the Lion 's Den : An Eyewitness Account of Washington 's Battle with Syria . '' `` She 's standing by her man . ''

That 's where she can be seen in photographs of the al-Assads posted this week on Instagram .

No images of bloody battle fields mar the view of the president caught in the middle of the civil war . Instead , photo after photo of the couple show a picture of caring . In one , the first lady -- who majored in computer science and French literature at King 's College London -- wipes away a boy 's tear . In another , she is listening intently to a group of women .

The photos appeared after the president announced this month that he was adding Instagram to his social media blitz . He also has his own Facebook page and a YouTube channel .

A brutal war ? Not to hear al-Assad 's Instagram tell it

And , judging from the comments , he has fans in Syria , Russia and Turkey .

`` God bless you , '' `` We love you , '' and `` We want you to win this war '' are common comments posted on the images .

But not all the remarks are positive .

`` This is not the real Syria , '' one writer posts . `` Show as the actual Syria , please . ''

The only reference to the war that has killed more than 100,000 Syrians , according to the United Nations , comes in captions beneath photos of the president shaking hands with soldiers `` protecting civilians '' and `` regaining security and stability '' in Darraya .

The rest of August , according to the account , has been packed with diplomatic functions , awards ceremonies and Asma tossing salad , stirring pots and filling bowls as Muslims broke fast during the holy month of Ramadan .

Some of the president 's almost 34,000 Instagram followers seem to sense spin in the postings , with one asking of the fashion-conscious first lady , `` So she managed to find time to stop shopping for shoes ? '' and another demanding photos of her Christian Louboutins , the brand of French shoes that can command $ 1,000 a pair .

Almost as common as the comments asserting , `` What a load of BS this account is '' are followers offering warm wishes of `` God bless you , '' `` We love you '' and `` We want you to win this war . '' Some supporters used a '' #LongLiveBasharAlAssad '' hashtag .

Western intervention looms in Syria

The president , who also has a Facebook page and a YouTube channel , began posting the photos July 24 .

`` They 're pretty standard , '' Tabler said Wednesday in a telephone interview about the propaganda tools . `` I do n't think there are any surprises there . ''

But Tabler , who once lived in Syria and interacted with the first family , said he had little insight into her current doings . `` We broke relations a long time ago , '' he said about the 38-year-old former investment banker with J.P. Morgan , who was born in Britain to a family of Syrian descent .

When Asma al-Akhras met Bashar al-Assad during the 1990s , he was studying in London to be an eye doctor . After the death of her beau 's father , Syrian President Hafez Assad , in June 2000 , the ophthalmologist became president and , that December , the couple married .

Since then , they have had at least three children . She was reported last spring to be pregnant with a fourth .

Before the outbreak of the civil war in Syria in March 2011 , the first lady had projected an image of a reformer .

Local merchants routinely praised the secular `` modern image '' of al-Assad and his wife , particularly in contrast to Turkey 's pious Sunni prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , whose wife wears an Islamic headscarf .

A 2011 Vogue magazine article described her as `` a rose in the desert . ''

The story , which was published after the uprising had begun , was ridiculed for being tone-deaf to suffering in the country .

Though the European Union placed Asma al-Assad and members of her family under sanctions shortly after the article was published , the story presented her as she had worked to be perceived -- as an exceptionally modern woman in the Arab world , Tabler and other experts have said . Unlike other first ladies in the region , she seemed intent on speaking from a position of power and influence . Her focus , she said , was protecting children .

Afterward , the writer of the Vogue article told CNN she felt duped by the first lady when she learned that the Syrian president 's forces had killed children . `` I wondered how this English woman I had met who so believed in the youth of Syria could stand by and not do anything , '' said Joan Juliet Buck . `` I fell for the line this woman fed me . ''

Throughout her years as first lady , Asma al-Assad has focused on children . In a 2009 CNN interview , she spoke about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict , saying that she would not tolerate an oppressive and violent regime . She spoke at length about how it broke her heart that children on either side would be caught in the crossfire .

That led many observers to expect her to condemn the attacks on civilians , many of them children . But no such response has emerged .

Getting to know Syria 's first family

In February 2012 , an article published in The Times of London said Asma al-Assad appeared to support her husband , while also seeking dialogue and comfort for the bereaved in the country .

According to an e-mail sent through an intermediary from Asma al-Assad 's office , `` The president is the president of Syria , not a faction of Syrians , and the first lady supports him in that role , '' The Times reported .

Meanwhile , the little that has emerged about her life has contrasted sharply with the brutality of the civil war that has engulfed the country : Leaked e-mails between the president and the first lady showed that she was shopping online for jewelry , art and furniture .

On the day of a massive anti-Assad rally in Hama , Asma al-Assad e-mailed a London art dealer about buying tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of art .
