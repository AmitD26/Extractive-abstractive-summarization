-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A staff reporter for the Agence France-Presse news agency , his wife and two of his three children were among nine civilians killed in an attack on a hotel in the Afghan capital , the news agency said Friday .

The incident began when four teenagers entered the Serena Hotel in central Kabul on Thursday and started shooting randomly , according to police .

AFP said journalist Sardar Ahmad started working for the news agency in 2003 and went on to become its senior reporter in Kabul , `` covering all aspects of life , war and politics in his native country '' and specializing in security issues . He also founded the Kabul Pressistan private news agency , AFP said .

The hotel was hosting special celebrations at the time of the attack to mark the eve of the Persian New Year , or Nowruz , AFP said . Nowruz is a major holiday in Afghanistan .

Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi , the deputy interior minister , said Thursday that those killed included Afghans and foreigners , children and adults . Six people were also injured .

Afghan security forces killed the four gunmen , who police said were under 18 and were `` government opponents . ''

Police said they believe the gunmen entered the hotel by smuggling small pistols in their shoes and then hid in the bathroom for several hours before launching their attack .

The hotel also was the site of a shooting , in January 2008 , that killed seven people . The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack .

Thursday 's attack was the latest to claim the lives of foreigners in the Afghan capital . This month , gunmen shot and killed a Swedish journalist . In January , a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people , most of them foreigners .
