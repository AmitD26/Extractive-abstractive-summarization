Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States is replacing its much-mocked system of color-coded terrorism alerts with detailed advisories about specific threats , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Thursday .

`` When we have information about a specific , credible threat , we will issue a formal alert providing as much information as we can , '' Napolitano said . That information will include a summary of the threat , steps authorities are taking to guard the public and what the public can do , she said .

`` The alerts will be specific to the threat . They may recommend certain actions or suggest looking for specific suspicious behavior . And they will have a specified end date , '' Napolitano said in a speech at George Washington University .

Napolitano 's formal announcement confirmed reports that emerged Wednesday . The new system , set to take effect in late April , replaces the five-color system established after al Qaeda 's September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York and Washington .

Napolitano said those warnings were `` too often accompanied by little practical information . '' The new system , she said , is built on the idea `` that we are all in this together , and that we all have a role to play . ''

The five-color system has rarely changed from its middle setting of yellow , or `` elevated , '' for the general public and orange , or `` high , '' for commercial aviation . It has not been lowered below those levels since its establishment in 2002 .

The system was the butt of jokes and parodies almost from the start , and polls found that the public considered it confusing . Kate Hanni , of the airline travelers ' advocacy group FlyersRights.org , called it `` very useless . ''

`` People just ignored it , '' Hanni told CNN on Wednesday . Since the color rarely changed , passengers came to believe it did n't mean anything , she said .

In addition , some critics accused the Bush administration of manipulating the system to gin up fear at politically sensitive times . Just days after he announced his resignation in 2005 , then-Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told a Washington forum that he sometimes disagreed with the rationale for raising the alert but was overruled by others on the administration 's Homeland Security Advisory Council , which made the decisions . The Bush administration denied Ridge 's assertions .

Napolitano said the new system `` is built on a clear and simple premise : When a threat develops that could impact you -- the public -- we will tell you . ''

The alerts will distinguish between `` elevated '' and `` imminent '' threats and could be limited to warnings for specific industries or police or communicated more broadly to the public , she said .

The yellow alert was raised to orange five times for the nation as a whole and three times for specific industries . The orange alert for aviation was raised to red once , in August 2006 , and only for flights from Britain to the United States .

The alert followed the announcement by British authorities that they had disrupted a major plot to blow up jetliners , and it was lowered back to orange six days later .
