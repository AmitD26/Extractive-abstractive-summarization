-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Poor pull-string Woody did n't have it this bad in `` Toy Story . ''

Sure , he felt pretty awful when Andy demoted him from top toy in favor of Buzz Lightyear , that way-cool spaceman who liked to shout `` To infinity , and beyond ! ''

But at least he did n't get thrown out of the closet .

Tell that to the timeworn tokens of Monopoly : the shoe , top hat , wheelbarrow , clothes iron , battleship , race car , thimble and Scottie dog .

One of them is being forced into exile -- taking a ride on the Reading or perhaps left to shuffle along the streets of Atlantic City , New Jersey , muttering about the glory days .

Not to pass GO . Not to collect $ 200 .

Rather , to go directly to jail .

Hasbro , maker of the board game available in 111 countries and 43 languages , is replacing one of the tokens with one `` that 's more representative of today 's Monopoly players , '' according to Eric Nyman , senior vice president for Hasbro Gaming .

In a campaign replete with marketing genius and every cliche you can think of , Hasbro is encouraging fans of a special Facebook page to vote daily until February 5 for the token they want to save and for the one they want added .

New choices are a diamond ring , guitar , toy robot , cat or helicopter .

The game was introduced by Parker Brothers in 1935 during the heart of the Great Depression . According to Hasbro , which bought the company , more than 1 billion people have played the game in its various versions .

Some tokens are long gone , among them the lantern , cannon and rocking horse .

The winning token will make its debut in mid - to late 2013 .

The classic token with the fewest votes will get the boot . Ironic if that turns out to be the shoe .

`` Fans who would still like to play with the classic eight tokens have a limited time to pick up the existing version of the game , '' said Hasbro .

Comments on the `` Save Your Token '' Facebook page were hot and heavy .

`` Get rid of the iron and bring in the kitty , '' one commenter said . `` That way the dog will have something to chase around the board . ''

Others pleaded for the game to be left alone .

Some , including Jan Blackstock Harville , waxed nostalgic while looking ahead .

`` That ugly shoe needs to go , '' she wrote . `` Although I did swallow the top hat when I was 3 so we never had it ! I vote for the robot . ''

Wednesday night , the leaderboard of old tokens showed the Scottie to be the safest , followed by the race car .

Pity the wheelbarrow . It 's looking for a miracle .
