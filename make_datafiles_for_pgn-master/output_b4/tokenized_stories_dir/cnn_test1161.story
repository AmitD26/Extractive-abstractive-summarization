-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- His appointment at Bayern Munich was regarded as a something of coup , but less than a year after his arrival in Bavaria the first cracks have appeared in the relationship between Pep Guardiola and the German club .

Widely regarded as the best coach in the world , Guardiola joined Bayern last year armed with a footballing philosophy that had brought him world domination during his time at Barcelona .

The Spaniard quickly guided Bayern to victories in the club World Cup and the UEFA Super Cup , before securing the German Bundesliga title in record-breaking speed .

But after crashing out of the Champions League at the semifinal stage to Real Madrid this week in humiliating fashion , the Spaniard 's possession-based style of football has come under criticism .

`` If we do n't win , it does not help me when Bayern Munich 's chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and sporting director Matthias Sammer , are backing me , '' Guardiola told reporters Friday .

`` If we lose I 'm a risk for the club . It 's a big club and you always have to win . If this does n't happen , the club may decide something else . ''

Perhaps more worryingly for Guardiola , honorary president Franz Beckenbauer openly expressed his exasperation after Bayern 's Champions League exit .

`` Bayern are not right , '' Beckenbauer , who both played for and managed Bayern , told Spanish newspaper Marca .

`` This is something that we have known for weeks . The disappointment is huge . ''

But Guardiola is adamant he will not alter his approach , insisting it is down to Bayern to decide if they want him to continue as manager .

`` The club must decide whether the coach is the right man for this team , '' said the 43-year-old Spaniard .

Bayern 's 4-0 home defeat by Real raised questions that Guardiola 's team is too tactically predictable .

`` I 'm a strong person . There was lot of criticism but that 's the nature of the beast . Criticism is normal , '' Guardiola said .

`` I ca n't train the players with other coaches ' ideas . Even after the defeat -LSB- against Madrid -RSB- I 'm confident in my own ideas .

`` Next season , we will play 100 % with my ideas . I ca n't coach this club or its players without believing in my ideas . ''

Guardiola says he is already planning for life in Munich next season , when he will be hoping to repeat his success on the domestic front , while going those extra steps further in Europe .

Despite the setback in Europe , Guardiola could yet win a fourth trophy this season with Bayern playing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17 .

Later Friday , Karl Hopfner was elected as the new president of the Bavarian giants , succeeding Uli Hoeness , who will serve a three and a half year jail term for tax fraud .

Hoeness , who was at the meeting ahead starting his sentence , received a standing ovation from the club members and hinted he would return once he is a free man .

`` I made a huge mistake and I will accept that . When I return , I am not going to retire , '' said the 62-year-old Hoeness , who was found guilty of evading $ 39.5 million of taxes at a trial earlier this year .

Hopfner , who is 61 , has spent over 30 years in a series of senior positions at Bayern .
