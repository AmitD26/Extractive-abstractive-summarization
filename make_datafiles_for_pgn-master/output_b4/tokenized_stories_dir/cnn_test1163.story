Madrid -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Preliminary charges of financial corruption have been filed against Spain 's Princess Cristina for a second time by a judge investigating her husband for alleged diversion of public funds .

Judge Jose Castro is leading the investigation at a local court in Palma de Mallorca , in Spain 's Balearic Islands .

The magistrate brought preliminary charges against the princess in April last year but they were dropped in May , after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court , citing insufficient evidence .

But Castro continued his investigation and has now decided to bring preliminary charges again . Prosecutors are once more opposing them .

A court spokeswoman confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the conflict between Castro and the prosecution would automatically see the issue returned to the provincial court .

A panel of four judges will then decide whether to uphold the preliminary charges .

It is expected that the panel will make a decision ahead of the March 8 court date requested by Castro .

The princess 's husband , Inaki Urdangarin , is accused of diverting , for private use , public funds earmarked for his nonprofit foundation .

Urdangarin , an Olympic medalist in handball , led a private foundation that secured contracts from regional governments to promote sports and tourism .

He has faced preliminary charges for more than a year . The preliminary charges could eventually be dropped , but a filing of indictments would set a trial in motion .

Through their lawyers , the princess and Urdangarin have denied any wrongdoing .

Urdangarin was granted the title of Duke of Palma when he married Princess Cristina , King Juan Carlos ' youngest daughter , in 1997 .

The fraud scandal has created unprecedented problems for Spain 's popular royal family and kept the country riveted .

In April , the royal household revealed that it had asked the government in February to include the monarchy in a new law on transparency -- regarding financing and other activities .

The government approved the law in September .
