-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Here are 15 things everyone should know about Fred Rogers :

Every one of Mr. Roger 's cardigan sweaters was hand-knitted by Fred Rogers ' mother .

1 . Even Koko the Gorilla loved him . Most people have heard of Koko , the Stanford-educated gorilla who could speak about 1000 words in American Sign Language , and understand about 2000 in English .

What most people do n't know , however , is that Koko was an avid Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood fan . As Esquire reported , when Fred Rogers took a trip out to meet Koko for his show , not only did she immediately wrap her arms around him and embrace him , she did what she 'd always seen him do onscreen : she proceeded to take his shoes off !

2 . He made thieves think twice . According to a TV Guide piece on him , Fred Rogers drove a plain old Impala for years . One day , however , the car was stolen from the street near the TV station . When Rogers filed a police report , the story was picked up by every newspaper , radio and media outlet around town .

Amazingly , within 48 hours the car was left in the exact spot where it was taken from , with an apology on the dashboard . It read , `` If we 'd known it was yours , we never would have taken it . '' Mental Floss : Memorable commencement speakers

3 . He watched his figure to the pound . In covering Rogers ' daily routine -LRB- waking up at 5 a.m. ; praying for a few hours for all of his friends and family ; studying ; writing , making calls and reaching out to every fan who took the time to write him ; going for a morning swim ; getting on a scale ; then really starting his day -RRB- , writer Tom Junod explained that Mr. Rogers weighed in at exactly 143 pounds every day for the last 30 years of his life .

He did n't smoke , did n't drink , did n't eat the flesh of any animals , and was extremely disciplined in his daily routine . And while I 'm not sure if any of that was because he 'd mostly grown up a chubby , single child , Junod points out that Rogers found beauty in the number 143 .

According to the piece , Rogers came `` to see that number as a gift ... because , as he says , `` the number 143 means ` I love you . ' It takes one letter to say ` I ' and four letters to say ` love ' and three letters to say ` you . ' One hundred and forty-three . ''

4 . He saved both public television and the VCR . Strange but true . When the government wanted to cut public television funds in 1969 , the relatively unknown Mister Rogers went to Washington .

Almost straight out of a Frank Capra film , his 5-6 minute testimony on how TV had the potential to give kids hope and create more productive citizens was so simple but passionate that even the most gruff politicians were charmed . While the budget should have been cut , the funding instead jumped from $ 9 to $ 22 million .

Rogers also spoke to Congress , and swayed senators into voting to allow VCR 's to record television shows from the home . It was a cantankerous debate at the time , but his argument was that recording a program like his allowed working parents to sit down with their children and watch shows as a family .

5 . He might have been the most tolerant American ever . Mister Rogers seems to have been almost exactly the same off-screen as he was onscreen . As an ordained Presbyterian minister , and a man of tremendous faith , Mister Rogers preached tolerance first .

Whenever he was asked to castigate non-Christians or gays for their differing beliefs , he would instead face them and say , with sincerity , `` God loves you just the way you are . '' Often this provoked ire from fundamentalists .

6 . He was genuinely curious about others . Mister Rogers was known as one of the toughest interviews because he 'd often befriend reporters , asking them tons of questions , taking pictures of them , compiling an album for them at the end of their time together , and calling them after to check in on them and hear about their families . He was n't concerned with himself , and genuinely loved hearing the life stories of others .

And it was n't just with reporters . Once , on a fancy trip up to a PBS exec 's house , he heard the limo driver was going to wait outside for 2 hours , so he insisted the driver come in and join them -LRB- which flustered the host -RRB- .

On the way back , Rogers sat up front , and when he learned that they were passing the driver 's home on the way , he asked if they could stop in to meet his family . According to the driver , it was one of the best nights of his life the house supposedly lit up when Rogers arrived , and he played jazz piano and bantered with them late into the night . Further , like with the reporters , Rogers sent him notes and kept in touch with the driver for the rest of his life .

7 . He was color-blind . Literally . He could n't see the color blue . Of course , he was also figuratively color-blind , as you probably guessed . As were his parents , who took in a black foster child when Rogers was growing up . Mental Floss : Praise for the blind genius who invented cruise control

8 . He could make a subway car full of strangers sing . Once while rushing to a New York meeting , there were no cabs available , so Rogers and one of his colleagues hopped on the subway . Esquire reported that the car was filled with people , and they assumed they would n't be noticed .

But when the crowd spotted Rogers , they all simultaneously burst into song , chanting `` It 's a beautiful day in the neighborhood . '' The result made Rogers smile wide .

9 . He got into TV because he hated TV . The first time he turned one on , he saw people angrily throwing pies in each other 's faces . He immediately vowed to use the medium for better than that . Over the years he covered topics as varied as why kids should n't be scared of a haircut , or the bathroom drain -LRB- because you wo n't fit ! -RRB- , to divorce and war .

10 . He was an Ivy League dropout . Rogers moved from Dartmouth to Rollins College to pursue his studies in music .

11 . He composed all the songs on the show , and over 200 tunes .

12 . He was a perfectionist , and disliked ad libbing . He felt he owed it to children to make sure every word on his show was thought out .

13 . Michael Keaton got his start on the show as an assistant . He helped puppeteer and operate the trolley .

14 . Several characters on the show are named for his family . Queen Sara is named after Rogers ' wife , and the postman Mr. McFeely is named for his maternal grandfather who always talked to him like an adult , and reminded young Fred that he made every day special just by being himself . Sound familiar ? It was the same way Mister Rogers closed every show .

15 . The sweaters . Every one of the cardigans he wore on the show had been hand-knit by his mother .
