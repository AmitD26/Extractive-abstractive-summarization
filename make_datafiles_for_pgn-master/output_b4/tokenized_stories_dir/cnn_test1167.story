-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States is n't the only Western country dealing with racial tension . Racism is alive and well in Europe , as shown by an ugly , explosive remark at a high political level in Italy that surfaced this weekend .

Roberto Calderoli , an Italian senator , compared Cecile Kyenge , the country 's first black Cabinet minister , to an orangutan . He also is quoted as saying that Kyenge 's success has encouraged illegal immigration to Italy and that she should be a minister `` in her own country . ''

There 's been an uproar since he uttered the words , and there are calls for him to resign -- one news channel poll said more than 80 % of viewers believe he should . An online petition calling for his resignation has been started . Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the talk is `` unacceptable beyond any limit . ''

It is the latest in a string of racial slurs and insults directed at Kyenge , a Congolese-born member of the Democratic Party . She assumed her integration minister post last April in the country 's coalition government .

Calderoli , a member of the anti-immigration Northern League party , made the remarks this weekend at a political rally .

`` I love animals -- bears and wolves , as everyone knows -- but when I see the pictures of Kyenge , I can not but think of , even if I 'm not saying she is one , the features of an orangutan , '' he was quoted as saying .

`` If I 've offended her , '' Calderoli said after his remarks were publicized , `` I apologize . ''

`` It was a joke , a comment in a joking way . There was nothing particularly against her . It was just my impression . ... It is all very well that she be a minister , but in her own country . Given that this government needs to govern Italy , I hope that it is done by Italians , '' he said .

Kyenge responded diplomatically , saying Calderoli `` does not need to ask forgiveness to me , but he should rather reflect on the political and institutional role that he carries . It is on this that he needs to make a profound reflection also to then apologize .

`` Also , he must go beyond putting everything on a personal level . I think the time has come for us to study the problem of communication , '' she said .

Kyenge moved to Italy in the 1980s to study medicine . She became an Italian citizen and is an ophthalmologist in Modena . Her ascent to a top position reflects the success of immigrants but also has fanned the flames of nativism .

She received death threats before visiting an area where the Northern League is powerful , and the reports of slurs have emerged persistently .

A local politician recently said on Facebook that Kyenge should be raped so she can understand the pain felt by victims of crime , which some politicians blame on immigrants .

She 's been called a `` Congolese monkey , '' `` Zulu '' and `` the black anti-Italian . '' One Northern League official said `` she seems like a great housekeeper , '' but `` not a government minister . ''

Letta , who called the episode `` shameful '' and `` intolerable , '' made an appeal to Northern League leader Roberto Maroni to `` close this chapter right away . ''

If he does n't , `` we will enter a logic of complete confrontation which I do n't believe he needs , no one needs it , '' Letta said . `` Neither does the country need it . ''
