ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Chicken nuggets . Sandwiches . Pizza . Baseball games . Play-Doh . These are some of the basics of childhood that could prove deadly to my 4-year-old son , Teddy .

Teddy took his first sip of milk in 2005 , triggering a strong allergic reaction as seen in this family photo .

Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis , a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing .

He has to steer clear of milk , eggs , wheat , peanuts and tree nuts -- even places like baseball stadiums where peanut exposure ca n't be avoided .

We found out about Teddy 's allergies partially through trial and error and then through allergy testing when he was 18 months old , and we did n't want any more missteps .

Now our job is to try to prevent contact with those foods until he either outgrows them or he becomes old enough to police himself . Watch what we go through to protect Teddy ''

Our vigilance starts before food even enters the house . When we are in the grocery store , we have to read every label to see if the food contains something harmful . See tips about living with food allergies ''

We 'll get all the way through one of these and be thinking , `` hurray ! '' and then see `` caramel coloring '' and have to put it back . There 's still enough wiggle room in food labeling , apparently , to not have to list what 's in that -- often milk -- or what 's in `` natural flavoring . ''

Devil in the details

And just because a food item was OK last week does n't mean the recipe has n't changed . And just because the package looks right does n't mean you 've picked up the right package .

I was in a hurry when I picked up rice cheese in December , so I did n't carefully read the label . Teddy saw the cheese when I was unloading the groceries and asked for a slice -- and then another .

Although the cheese looked like our regular vegan cheese without milk , it was an almost identical package that contained milk protein .

Teddy ended up in a hospital emergency room with hives all over his arms , legs , tummy and back . His nose was running and he was drooly . He got a shot of epinephrine before he could develop breathing problems .

It 's a harsh reminder that we can never let down our guard .

Once we get food into the house , we try to label it . We have stickers , or we use markers to warn away from giving a particular product to Teddy . Labels are n't enough for baby sitters . We set out a bin of `` Teddy safe '' snacks .

School : Lots of cupcakes , no Play-Doh

School is tough , too . The macaroni necklaces my 8-year-old daughter Catie once made for me in pre-K were charming . Who would think that something so simple could make another kid very sick ?

There 's no Play-Doh . It can have wheat in it . Same for papier-mache . Teddy 's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products . But it can be exhausting .

Every month , it seems , there is another `` holiday '' at school . And all seem to be connected to food celebrations .

Every time other parents send food in , we have to worry about whether Teddy will be safe . I try to always be the `` cupcake mom , '' because I can make cupcakes without milk , eggs or wheat that still taste good . -LRB- Even the teachers fight to get them . -RRB- When someone else brings cakes , I try to find out in advance so I can make a Teddy-safe alternative . If there is no warning , the school has a bin of Teddy-safe snacks .

Challenges in the kitchen

I try to cook mostly Teddy-safe food at home . The first reaction many people have to hearing of Teddy 's allergies is a dumbfounded , `` What does he eat ? ''

There are actually many foods that are OK for him : meats , vegetables , fruits and most grains . We just do n't often get the chance to use convenience foods .

I have alternatives for meatloaf and tacos that work OK . But sometimes I just want to make pasta for the family . I know that I could just make rice pasta for everyone . But , frankly , it 's about three times the price and does n't taste as good .

So I have to be careful . I ca n't use the same spoon to stir both .

And even when I 'm draining the pasta , I have to remember that if I do n't drain the rice pasta first , I have to use two colanders . So I try to keep that straight .

This is why it 's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant . It 's very easy for a contaminated utensil to be used in the kitchen without us knowing . And that would be after getting the restaurant staff to show us labels from all food items .

This month , we will be meeting with some staff members at Teddy 's new elementary school , where he 'll be entering kindergarten in August . When we start a new school or new situation , it 's always an anxious time . We 're going to talk with the school nurse and cafeteria manager about strategies to keep Teddy safe .

Teddy will need a classroom as free from danger as possible , and that can be an issue .

As soon as we talk about not having peanut products in his classroom , some people think we do n't want their kids to have peanut butter sandwiches for lunch . No , we just want peanut products eaten only in the cafeteria .

In the lunchroom , Teddy can be watched so that if peanut butter touches him or milk is spilled on him , he will be decontaminated as quickly as possible .

-LRB- If milk touches Teddy , he gets hives -- he does n't even have to ingest it . This is a lot different from `` lactose intolerance , '' which some people confuse with a milk allergy . Lactose intolerance produces gastric distress for someone . A milk allergy can be life-threatening . -RRB-

We 'll probably post signs the way we 've done at his day cares and preschool , showing him in reaction to an allergen and listing what action to take .

Fears of budget cuts

We 're hoping that the school nurse does n't fall victim to budget cuts , because that is our emotional safety net right now . We 're comforted by the thought of someone with anaphylaxis experience being close to Teddy .

It 's all part of the constant vigilance , doing our best to keep him safe .

If we 'd been handed a list of Teddy 's allergies when he was freshly born at the hospital , I think we 'd have been overwhelmed .

But we found out a bit at a time , and we 've been dealing with it now for more than three years . Despite some bumps , Teddy 's been able to survive our stumbles and thrive .
