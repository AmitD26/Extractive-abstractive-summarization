-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- OK , so it looks like something from a horror movie .

But a customized silicone mask , fitted over the face , head and mouth of endurance swimmer Diana Nyad , was a key difference-maker in helping the 64-year-old complete the grueling , 100-mile swim from Cuba to Key West , Florida , on her fifth try .

Nyad needed the mask for protection against box jellyfish , deadly creatures common to tropical waters and whose venomous sting cut short her fourth attempt to swim from Cuba last summer . Because the mask is cumbersome , she only wore it Saturday night when her support team feared jellyfish were nearby .

`` I was grateful for it . I knew I was n't going to be stung at all . I felt 100 percent prepared for the jellyfish , '' Nyad told reporters Tuesday morning after her record swim .

But the design of the mask , with its narrow mouth opening , was not perfect . For 13 hours Saturday night and early Sunday , it caused her to swallow `` tremendous volumes '' of seawater , which in turn led to bouts of vomiting . Nyad grew dehydrated , weakened and discouraged .

`` That night was hell on Earth , it really was , '' she said .

The jellyfish dispersed by Sunday afternoon , however , and Nyad did not wear the mask again during the crossing .

After Cuba-Florida feat , Nyad to swim 48 hours in New York

Venom from box jellyfish contains paralyzing toxins that attack the skin , heart and nervous system and is considered to be among the most deadly in the world . Twenty to 40 people die from stings from box jellyfish annually in the Philippines alone , according to the National Science Foundation .

During last year 's swim , Nyad wore protective gear over her face , hands and body . But the jellyfish still stung her repeatedly in the mouth , aborting her attempt about halfway between Cuba and Key West .

`` Literally the only square inch exposed of my entire body was the lips . We just could n't design a way to protect the mouth and still breathe while swimming , '' she said last month in a blog post on her website . `` Yet these animals ... are brilliant at finding animals to sting and they indeed found my lips . On both occasions , I suffered the paralysis , the otherworldly sensation of being burned alive . ''

So Nyad partnered with Stefan Knauss , a California prosthetics expert who spent a year developing the silicone mask . They tried many molds and different designs of the mouth area before finding one that worked best . Nyad tested the mask , along with her other protective gear , by swimming through a swarm of hundreds of box jellyfish in June .

`` As difficult as the swimming was , I was not stung once , '' she said . `` Those deadly tentacles could not penetrate . ''

And indeed , the jellyfish were not a problem on Nyad 's triumphant fifth crossing , which she completed Monday afternoon after nearly 53 hours in the water .

Opinion : Nyad shows baby boomers so ` not over '

But the jokesters of Twitter had some fun with her mask .

`` Not only did Diana Nyad finish her swim , but that new mask of hers can double as a Halloween costume . One-stop shopping . Smart lady , '' wrote a Boston-based blogger on Twitter .

And there was this , from a Kansas-based comedian : `` Somewhere under the sea the King of the Jellyfish yells at his men `` WE HAVE FAILED . DIANA NYAD 'S SILICONE MASK HAS SHAMED US ALL . ''
