London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Queen Elizabeth 's jubilee tour strikes an historic note today , when the British monarch visits Northern Ireland on a trip it is hoped will mark a symbolic end to the decades-long conflict there .

She 's been to the province almost every year over the last decade . But this visit is especially significant as it follows her tour of the Republic of Ireland last year .

It was the first visit by a British head of state since Ireland 's independence , and at the time , British Prime Minister David Cameron described it as a game-changer .

As head of state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , the queen has a purely symbolic role . But her influence - after six decades on the throne - is palpable . And her ability to mark an historic turning point unquestioned .

Despite the passing of 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement , resentment among Ireland 's Catholics - both North and South - has lingered over the wrongs committed during British rule .

Queen arrives in Northern Ireland

But the queen 's visit last year helped to heal some of those wounds .

In Dublin she visited Croke Park , where British forces killed Irish civilians at a Gaelic football match in 1920 , on what became known as Bloody Sunday .

At a state dinner the same day , there were gasps as she spoke in Gaelic . The Irish president was seen mouthing the word ` wow ' and commentators declared the speech historic .

The queen managed subtly to set the tone of a visiting head of state as opposed to a ruling one . The image was powerful and cathartic for those still bitter towards Britain .

`` It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache , turbulence and loss , '' she said .

In Northern Ireland , the queen has the chance to make history again -- but this time it is personal .

The queen 's cousin , Louis Mountbatten , was assassinated by the Provisional IRA -LRB- Irish Republican Army -RRB- in 1979 , using a bomb planted in his fishing boat . Three others died in the same explosion .

The queen was devastated : Mountbatten had introduced her to his nephew , Prince Philip , during her teens ; the pair went on to marry and have four children .

After decades of struggle , key Republicans in Northern Ireland are ready to have their symbolic moment of peace with the `` Queen of England , '' as they call her .

Sinn Fein has decided that Republican icon and Northern Ireland 's Deputy First Minister , Martin McGuinness , should shake hands with the queen in front of the cameras . McGuinness is a former IRA commander .

What makes this simple handshake even more poignant is that the queen is not just representing the UK , she 's also representing the victims of the sectarian conflict . As someone who lost a loved one in an IRA attack , she is one herself .

With a simple gesture , a victim and a former man of violence will put their personal feelings aside in the name of duty , and in the name of peace .
