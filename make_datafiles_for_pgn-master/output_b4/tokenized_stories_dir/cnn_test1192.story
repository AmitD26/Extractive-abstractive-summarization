-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A disputed maritime border . Long-standing tensions . And Tuesday , a sharp escalation of hostilities . North and South Korea fired at each other for about an hour on an island that sits off a disputed border . The deadly skirmish raised fears of war between the two rival nations , once again spiking tension in the entire region .

How did the latest hostilities begin ?

South Korea said North Korea fired artillery Tuesday toward the border between the two nations . Two South Korean marines were killed and 18 soldiers and civilians were wounded .

South Korea had been conducting maritime military drills , which the North called `` war maneuvers . ''

The North accused the South of `` reckless military provocation '' for firing dozens of shells inside North Korean territory around the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong .

Plumes of smoke billowed from the island of 1,300 people but it was not immediately clear how much damage was incurred . Many residents were fleeing to the South Korean port of Incheon .

Why did this happen ?

Tension has been running particularly high in the Korean peninsula after the March 26 sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan . Tuesday 's incident , however , is one of the most serious that has occurred in recent years .

The hostilities come as North Korea is undergoing transition -- the ailing and reclusive leader Kim Jong Il is believed to be in the process of transferring power to his son Kim Jong Un . Some analysts believe upcoming internal changes have prompted North Korea to flex its military muscle in recent days .

Tuesday 's violence was also preceded by the revelation of a North Korean uranium enrichment program .

Has this happened before ?

Yes , Yeonpyeong Island has come under attack before . Last January , South Korea reported that the North had fired shells that fell in waters north of the Northern Limit Line , the de facto inter-Korean maritime border .

North Korea wants that border redrawn farther south .

Over the past six decades , small-scale skirmishes have flared repeatedly along both land and sea borders as each state aims to reunify the peninsula according to its own terms and system of government . Deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999 , 2002 and 2009 .

What is the history of conflict ?

After Japan 's defeat in World War II , Korea became a divided nation , the capitalist South supported by the United States and its Western allies and the communist North an ally of the Soviet Union .

Cold War tensions erupted into war 1950 , devastating the peninsula and taking the lives of as many as 2 million people . The fighting ended with a truce , not a treaty , and settled little .

Technically , the two Koreas are still at war .

Besides the border skirmishes , other incidents also have proved provocative . In 1968 , North Korea dispatched commandos in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate South Korea 's president . In 1983 , a bombing linked to Pyongyang killed 17 high-level South Korean officials on a visit to Myanmar . In 1987 , the North was accused of bombing a South Korean airliner .

What happened with the Cheonan ?

South Korea said a North Korean torpedo last March sent the warship Cheonan to the bottom of the Yellow Sea off the Seoul-controlled island of Baengnyeong . The sinking , also in the border area , killed 46 South Korean sailors .

South Korea was outraged by the incident . North Korea vehemently denied any responsibility , even after an international investigating team blamed North Korea . The United Nations Security Council statement condemned the attack but stopped short of placing blame on the North .

Will the two nations go to war ?

South Korea put its military on high alert following Tuesday 's exchange of fire . But whether that will translate into further military action is impossible to predict .

Events in the past few months suggested a slight thawing of icy relations .

North and South Korea had begun discussions on the possible resumption of reunions of family members separated by the Korean War , and North Korea has requested military talks . In early September , the South offered food aid to the impoverished North for the first time in three years .

Given the closed nature of North Korean politics , it 's hard to tell what changes the new leadership of Kim Jong Un will entail or whether re-engagement is on the table . Another wild card is the influence of China ; some South Koreans fear a Chinese takeover in the event of a North Korean collapse .

Some analysts viewed Tuesday 's exchange as North Korea flexing its military muscle in the light of its leadership transition . Others said it was related to the nuclear issue .

How will nuclear talks be affected ?

Washington accuses Pyongyang of running a secret uranium-based nuclear program . The United States , along with the two Koreas , Russia , Japan and China , have been involved in what is called the Six Party Talks .

But those talks have been slow , arduous and in limbo since 2008 . And after the revelation of the North Korean uranium enrichment facility a few days ago , the resumption of talks seemed to be in jeopardy .

Stephen Bosworth , the U.S. special envoy on North Korean denuclearization , said Tuesday 's hostilities will prove a further obstacle .

Choi Jin-wook , senior researcher at the Korea Institute of National Unification , said the North is `` frustrated with Washington 's response to their uranium program , and they think that Washington has almost given up on negotiations with North Korea . ''

`` I think they realize they ca n't expect anything from Washington or Seoul for several months , so I think they made the provocation , '' Choi said .
