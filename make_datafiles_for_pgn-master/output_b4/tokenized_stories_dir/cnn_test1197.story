-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One of the jurors who convicted Michael Dunn of attempted murder after he fired into an SUV during a fatal argument believes he should have been convicted of first-degree murder .

`` I believed he was guilty , '' Valerie said in an interview with ABC 's `` Nightline '' early Wednesday . Also known as Juror No. 4 , she asked that her full name not be given in order to protect her identity .

A Florida jury on Saturday night convicted Dunn of three charges of attempted second-degree murder for shooting into an SUV full of teenagers after arguing about their loud music . He was also convicted of one count of shooting into the vehicle .

But a separate first-degree murder charge in the death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis resulted in a hung jury . Prosecutor Angela Corey said she would seek a new trial on the charge .

Dunn faces 60 years or more in prison for the attempted murder charges when he 's sentenced next month .

Split over self-defense

On the murder charge , Valerie said the jury split over the issue of self-defense .

Florida law says the use of deadly force is justifiable if someone reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm .

In his testimony , Dunn insisted that Davis threatened him and that he saw a gun . Police never recovered a weapon .

Valerie said the jury 's first vote was 10-2 in favor of a murder conviction . Over nearly 30 hours of deliberations , the vote became 9-3 .

Attempted murder conviction

Ultimately , the jury convicted Dunn on the charges of attempted murder .

Valerie said all the jurors felt Dunn crossed a line when he continued to fire at the SUV as it fled the scene in Jacksonville . In their minds , any threat Dunn may have felt before had passed .

`` We all believed that there was another way out , another option , '' she said .

But for Valerie , it never should have happened at all . Dunn could have chosen another path .

`` Roll your window up , ignore the taunting , put your car in reverse ... move a parking spot over . That 's my feeling . ''

Ron Davis , the victim 's father , told ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' he believed Dunn should have been found guilty of first-degree murder . But the father said he thought jurors tried hard to render a just decision .

`` We believe absolutely with all of our hearts that they did everything that they could to come to what they believe was the most just decision , '' said Jordan Davis ' mother , Lucia McBath . `` We do now know that they were torn . ''

Jailhouse phone calls

The revelations from the juror come after prosecutors released recordings of nine phone calls Dunn made while he awaited trial in a Florida jail .

Some of the conversations were mundane , while others revealed a man who calls himself the victim and the victor .

`` Like , I 'm the f *** ing victim here , '' Dunn said . `` I was the one who was victimized . ''

`` I mean , I do n't know how else to put it , '' Dunn continued . `` They attacked me . I 'm the victim . I 'm the victor , but I was the victim too . ''

Other comments by Dunn highlighted his negative perception of the teens .

`` When the police said that these guys did n't have a record I was like , you know , I wonder if they 're just flying under the radar , '' he told his fiancee , Rhonda Rouer . `` Because they were bad . ''

Gas station confrontation

It was November 23 , 2012 , when Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville , parking next to a red Dodge Durango with four teenagers inside .

The teens had come in for gum and cigarettes ; Dunn , meanwhile , had just left his son 's wedding with his fiancee , who 'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips .

Dunn did n't like the loud music -- `` rap crap , '' he called it -- coming from the teens ' SUV . So he asked them to turn it down .

What followed next depends on whom you believe . Dunn says Davis threatened him , and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango .

But prosecutors say it was Dunn who lost control , firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the SUV over music he did n't like .

After learning almost six hours later that he had killed Davis , Dunn testified that he became `` crazy with grief , '' experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap .

`` My intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , '' he testified . `` It just worked out that way . ''

Yet Rouer testified that Dunn had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun , a stick , a barrel or a lead pipe .

In fact , police found a basketball , basketball shoes , clothing , a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers ' Durango . There was no gun in the vehicle .

Dunn himself never called police . The first contact he had with them was at his home in Satellite Beach as he was being apprehended .

Arguing that he was n't in a rational state of mind , Dunn admitted , `` It makes sense that I should have -LRB- contacted authorities -RRB- . We did n't . I ca n't tell you why . ''

Ron Davis told ABC he wants another trial .

`` I want Michael Dunn to be tried and found guilty of killing my son , letting him know that it was wrong to kill my unarmed 17-year-old , '' Davis said . `` All the other 17-year-olds out there , they should n't have to fear the adults with the guns that are running around here shooting them at will . ''
