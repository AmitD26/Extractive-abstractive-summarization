-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button secured a McLaren one-two in a dramatic Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday as they took advantage of a collision between Red Bull pair Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel .

Polesitter Webber was leading when his German teammate tried to overtake him on lap 41 of 58 and succeeded only in crashing into him and going off .

Webber , who looked set for this third straight victory , had to pit to have a new nose cone , leaving Hamilton , who had been strongly challenging in third , to take the lead from Button , the reigning world champion .

The pair then engaged in their own private duel , with Button briefly heading his fellow Briton , before Hamilton took the lead for the final time to secure his first win of the season .

Webber completed the podium and the third place helps him maintain the lead in the title race , five points clear of Button , with Hamilton moving up to third place , four points further adrift .

The Mercedes pair of seven-time champion Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg finished a distant fourth and fifth with Robert Kubica sixth for Renault .

The Ferraris of Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso were seventh and eighth , hardly an auspicious performance to mark the 800th grand prix for the famous red cars .

German Adrian Sutil was ninth for Force India and Japanese Kamui Kobayashi completed the points scoring for Sauber in 10th .

To complete a disappointing afternoon for Red Bull , they lost the lead to McLaren by a single point in the constructors ' title race .

`` A big shame for the team -- and not an ideal scenario at all , '' said Webber as he recalled the disastrous incident with Vettel .

`` It can happen . He had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and ... well , that was it .

`` There was a long way to go and I was not guaranteed to win , but it was an interesting few meters on the track between us . ''

Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was not amused : `` It was very disappointing . I need to talk to both drivers . We did everything right as a team , but they should never have been there , where they were .

`` It is bad for the team and we have lost a lot of points . I always ask them to give each other room , but we have handed the points on a plate to McLaren now .

`` We saw Lewis and Jenson racing each other and giving each other space . That 's all we ask for . ''

It was the McLaren team 's second one-two of the season , with Button leading Hamilton home at a rain-hit Chinese Grand Prix on April 18 .

Hamilton was delighted to have secured his 12th career win and his first since Singapore last year .

`` I do n't know what happened , but they collided and we got past them and we had a bit of a battle -- a fair one , I must say - before the end , '' he said .

`` It was a great result for the team and I am happy to dedicate it to my dad for his 50th birthday tomorrow . ''
