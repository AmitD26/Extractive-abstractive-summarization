-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 29-year-old Somali man was found guilty Thursday of attacking a Danish political cartoonist known for his drawing of the Muslim prophet Mohammed with a turban shaped as a bomb , authorities said .

In a unanimous verdict , Mohamed Geele was found guilty of attempted terrorism , attempted manslaughter and attacking a police officer with a knife and an ax , said Danish Prosecutor Lene Lemt .

Geele was accused of trying to break into the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on January 1 , 2010 . He was shot in the right leg and left hand by an officer during the incident and hospitalized for his wounds .

At the time , Danish intelligence officials had linked him to an East African Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda .

Prosecutors are seeking 12 years in prison for Geele , who is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday .

Al-Shabaab , the militant organization with alleged ties to Geele , is waging a bloody battle against Somalia 's transitional government and is currently on a U.S. government list of terrorist organizations .

At a January 2010 news conference in the Somali capital of Mogadishu , al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said , `` We are very happy with the Somali national who attacked the house of the Danish cartoonist who previously insulted our prophet Mohammed . This is an honor for the Somali people . We are telling that we are glad that anyone who insults Islam should be attacked wherever they are . ''

Police had no indication that an attack was being planned on Westergaard , a police official said , though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist links .

Police said the suspect managed to crack the glass front door of Westergaard 's home . A home alarm alerted police to the scene , and they were attacked by the suspect , authorities said .

Westergaard , who was home with his 5-year-old granddaughter at the time of the break-in , hid in a `` panic room '' when he realized what was happening , authorities said . Westergaard is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home , but nobody was on guard at the house that Friday , the Security and Intelligence Service told CNN .

The cartoonist has said he wanted his controversial drawing to show that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terrorism . However , many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist .

Over the years , Danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against Westergaard 's life .
