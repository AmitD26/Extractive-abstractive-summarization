-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This fall , two student organizations at Duke University met to discuss a simple idea : Put a spotlight on reasons people might take offense to phrases and slurs used in everyday conversation .

The result of that conversation -- the `` You Do n't Say ? '' campaign , a photo project that points out language that marginalizes sexual and gender minorities -- has been sweeping across the Web and the Durham , North Carolina , campus .

It comes in the midst of several photo campaigns at colleges around the country . At Harvard , there was the `` I , Too , Am Harvard '' photo project that highlights the experience of its black students . In March at Georgetown , images of administrators in drag explored the issue of gender identity .

Duke sophomores Daniel Kort , Anuj Chhabra , Christie Lawrence , and Jay Sullivan co-founded the project . Kort is the president of the undergraduate LGBTQ group Blue Devils United , and Chhabra is the president of Think Before You Talk , a group aimed at bringing awareness to the implications of offensive language . Lawrence and Sullivan serve on Think Before You Talk 's executive board .

The students explained via e-mail why they got involved , and what they hope the photo campaign will accomplish . Their responses have been edited for clarity .

Anuj Chhabra on using the phrase ` That 's so gay ' :

I thought it was important to bring awareness to the implications that these words have because having used some of -LSB- these phrases -RSB- in high school , I quickly realized how differently other Duke students perceived me -LSB- when I commented -RSB- , `` That 's so gay . ''

One of my friends in particular would constantly question me : `` What do you mean by ` That 's so gay ? ' ''

I realized that using the word `` gay '' to describe a teacher who I did n't like or an unfavorable event really did n't make sense , and I began to change the habit .

Our intention was to use personal testaments to let people personally challenge themselves , as opposed to `` banning '' these words . Our desire to use the personal `` I '' stems from the fact that most people , after thinking about why it is so common in today 's society to equate something like `` dumb '' or `` unfavorable '' with `` gay , '' are quick to change their habits .

It is not necessarily homophobic or sexist people using such words and phrases , but largely just ordinary people .

Daniel Kort on why he participated :

Throughout elementary and middle school , I was consistently bullied by my classmates because of characteristics that others deemed `` gay . ''

I was constantly called `` fag '' and `` bitch . ''

At times , it felt as if my entire class was against me , and I can recall only one instance that somebody stood up for me .

I would cry to my mom during the car ride home , and my schoolwork and motivation suffered .

With help from the school counselor , I was eventually able to stand up for myself and disregard my bullies .

In my first year -LSB- at Duke -RSB- , I was called a `` fag '' by one of my hall mates in the first month of school . I was lucky to have my friends there to intervene , but I know that not all students are as fortunate .

I was motivated by the bystanders who were there for me that night , and this experience propelled my enthusiasm to work on the campaign .

Though I do n't have the same reaction nowadays in response to these words , I stand in solidarity with younger students who are marginalized by their classmates .

Christie Lawrence on how these terms impact her and others :

All of these phrases impact me , whether they directly address me or not . I think it is important to try to be as good of a person as you can , and through conversations with my friends , I have grown to recognize the hurt these words can inflict .

Even if I am not gay , I know that calling someone a `` fag '' or qualifying an expression of admiration with `` no homo '' attaches hurtful connotations to words that are directly connected to a certain identity .

Telling me to `` man up '' or not be a `` pussy '' tells me that you believe women are weaker , more emotional and lesser than a man . It tells me that you think a certain way to act is the right way and anything that does not fall under the umbrella of `` acceptable '' behavior or emotions is something to be put down . This attitude , that there is a correct way to have courage , be successful , or achieve happiness , is something that I believe hurts everyone in our society , including myself .

This campaign is not an attempt to ban words or invalidate someone 's right to free speech , but instead is an attempt to show how these words are hurtful for many . One comment on an article I read about our campaign explained it very nicely : You have the right to say these offensive phrases , but we also have the right to tell you why we think these phrases are hurtful .

Jay Sullivan on how language reflects values :

I am a Christian . That is the lens I bring to all the work that I do in the community here at Duke , in the local Durham community , and in my daily life .

When I was in high school , I was the leader of the my school 's small Christian Fellowship . I went to a private co-ed prep school in New Haven , Connecticut , called Hopkins School , and I distinctly remember during my junior year during the day of silence I was wearing an ally sticker in support of my friends who were silent . In class that day , an older friend came up to me and said , ' `` Look , Jay , I respect you but you need to take that ally sticker off man . You 're condoning their sinful actions . You ca n't support them and be the leader of a Christian organization . ''

I was quite taken aback , and after a short dialogue I took off the sticker to avoid any further conflict . That experience bothered me for a while , that I did n't take a stand to tell him , `` People are people and they deserve the same rights and freedom to live the way they want that you have , as well . God loves everyone regardless of any part of their identity that you may have deemed sinful or unworthy . ''

This campaign is not about language ; it is about what this language represents .

The way we talk is a reflection of our beliefs and perceptions of the world and it is vital , at least for me , to examine whether what I say is in line with my values and how I view the world .
