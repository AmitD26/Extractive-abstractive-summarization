ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was the music of rebellion and youth . Artists traded witty improvisations onstage chronicling the pain and the promise of being black in America , inspiring inner-city and rural Southern audiences alike in nightclubs and on street corners .

Atlanta-based Jaspects fuses rap with jazz in hopes of preserving both genres and appealing to young people .

That music was jazz .

Today , Jaspects , an Atlanta-based group of young musicians who were born in the hip-hop era , fuse rap and jazz melodies to introduce younger audiences to jazz and the broader ideas regarding African-American society .

For Jaspects , whose music has appeared in the movie `` Hustle & Flow '' and recently was featured in the CNN documentary series `` Black in America , '' the lessons of jazz go beyond its artistic merits to questions about the ownership and control of black music in general .

Veteran saxophonist Jimmy Heath , who has performed with nearly all the jazz greats of the last 50 years , says that the music called jazz today began as a voice of the repressed .

`` The history of jazz comes with the history of African-American people . Because whenever they were permitted , they always sang and played their music when they were in their own quarters , and eventually I think , when instruments were available , they started to play music on those instruments , '' Heath says .

Jazz was born a raw and energetic rebuttal of what was musically acceptable at the time , and became the voice of a generation of African-American youth . Watch as Jaspect fuses hip-hop and jazz ''

Terrence Brown , pianist and musical director for Jaspects , says hip-hop shares the same roots .

`` These people wanted to do more than just Bach and Beethoven . They did n't want to play history ; they wanted to make history , '' Brown says . `` I guess when jazz -LSB- and -RSB- the Harlem Renaissance began to give birth people really felt the need to express themselves and that is similar to how hip-hop was created . ''

As jazz started to gain popularity outside of black America in the 1940s and gained an international following , many say the music became distanced from its cultural origins .

In his exhaustive work on the African-American experience , `` Africana , '' Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes that while black musicians were the principal innovators during this era , white musicians often reaped the fame and benefits and that `` the black musicians who found greatest favor with whites were those with a happy-go-lucky air and a ready grin . ''

With the exception of groups such as Jaspects , jazz today is considered by Brown and some others to be a `` museum piece '' that aged instead of evolving . Brown says hip-hop is following a similar route , and he says a major reason is a lack of ownership of the music .

`` Hopefully , there will come a time where a lot of African-Americans who do have money and do have the resources ... take over some of these corporations ... and not just have the No. 1 hit record on the charts , because that in itself will allow the community to give back to itself , '' Brown says .

Rapper Nas , whose real name is Nasir Jones , made a provocative declaration with the release of his 2006 album , `` Hip Hop Is Dead , '' that the genre `` is dead because we no longer have the power . ''

At the same time , there has been a rise of prominent black music executives such as Sean `` P. Diddy '' Combs , Jay-Z , Russell Simmons and Jermaine Dupri . Jay-Z and P. Diddy , who earned $ 34 million and $ 32 million , respectively , in 2007 , were named hip-hop 's cash kings by Forbes magazine .

Dupri , owner of record label So So Def Records and producer of hits for recording artists TLC , Usher and Mariah Carey , disagrees that corporate ownership is affecting black music for the worse .

`` They -LSB- corporations -RSB- have their input , but if you let the money guide you then , that 's how you let them control you , '' says Dupri , who released his first book in 2007 , `` Young , Rich and Dangerous : The Making of a Music Mogul . ''

`` If you are driven by money , then the backers that are giving you the money tell you what to do . ''

Dupri says that there are not enough African Americans who are in control of the music business , and that education has a lot to do with it .

`` That 's a lot of the problem . It 's always been something that lot of people can get in quick without really doing anything , without learning , but you have to learn everything about it , '' Dupri says .

Brown says he 's hopeful that the rise of black leadership in music will have a positive impact on the community .

`` We need to get to a place where we own our own things as African-Americans and a place that the things we do generate money for our own communities , '' Brown says . `` Not only that , but that we generate a sense of culture , style and substance for our community . ''

Jaspects and groups like them are hoping to change things a little . Using hip-hop , the music of rebellion and youth in 2008 , they are introducing jazz to a new generation -- to tell its story , preserve its artistry and learn its lessons .
