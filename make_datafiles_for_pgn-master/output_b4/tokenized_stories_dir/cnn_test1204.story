Bogota , Colombia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos officially announced he will seek re-election , a decision that could affect the ongoing peace talks between the government and the FARC .

`` You elected me to strengthen the results that we had achieved in security , and we have delivered , '' Santos said in a televised speech Wednesday night .

Santos , who was first elected in 2010 on a platform of continuing an offensive against the leftist guerrillas that have been at war with the government for decades , instead followed a different path .

The hallmark of his presidency now is the peace process between the government and the largest rebel group , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC .

The peace process has been ongoing for one year , with progress coming slowly . This approach is controversial in Colombia , which in the past has been burned by failed negotiation attempts .

With a peace agreement unlikely to be in place before next year 's presidential election , its chances of success could be foreshadowed by the vote .

One of Santos ' rivals for the presidency is Oscar Ivan Zuluaga , who has called for an end to the peace talks and is against giving a political space to the rebels .

Zuluaga 's proposal is backed by former President Alvaro Uribe , a former ally of Santos who now favors someone with a hardline stance against the guerrillas .

Santos says he wants to be re-elected to finish the peace process he started .

`` We still have big challenges , but I 'm convinced that the way to confront them is not only through blood and fire , '' he said .

Santos ' current approval rating of about 30 % means his incumbency will not guarantee him a second four-year term .

`` He thinks that because of fragmentation among the political parties and that other political leaders also have n't consolidated supporters , he can be re-elected , '' political analyst Jaime Arango said .

Santos placed all his political capital on the negotiations with the FARC , so it 's natural that he is seeking re-election , another analyst , Vicente Torrijos , said .

Seeking a second term was his only option given that the peace process is still underway , he said .

`` So he is going to present himself to Colombians and the world as the peacemaker and of course this is his best calling card to aspire to this re-election , '' he said .
