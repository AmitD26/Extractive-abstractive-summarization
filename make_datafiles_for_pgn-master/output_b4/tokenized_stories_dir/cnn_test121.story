-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Omar Thornton , minutes after gunning down eight co-workers in Manchester , Connecticut , called state police and told them , `` I took it into my hands '' because he worked at a `` racist place , '' according to a recording of the call .

Thornton , 34 , told police , `` I wish I could have got more of the people . '' He also said , `` I 'm not going to kill anybody else . ''

The Hartford Distributors employee fatally shot himself Tuesday after the shooting spree that followed his resignation over theft allegations .

The gripping recording of Thornton 's four-minute 911 call was released Thursday , the same day the company said he never filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination , as his girlfriend Kristi Hannah asserted .

Thornton called police after 8 a.m.

`` You probably want to know the reason why I shot this place up . This place is a racist place . They treat me bad over here . They treat all the other black people employees bad over here , too . So I took it into my hands ... I wish I could have got more of the people , '' he said .

Two dispatchers spent most of the call trying to get Thornton to tell where he was , to remain calm and surrender . Police also wanted information on guns he had . Thornton , who killed himself in an office , had a single handgun left by the time of the call . He said the Ruger `` was one of my favorites . ''

Thornton said he thought police were going to kill him .

He declined to give his location in the warehouse . `` When they find me everything is going to be over , '' he said .

`` They treated me bad since I started here . A racist company , '' Thornton said at one point .

Toward the end of the call , Thornton said , `` Tell my people that I love them and I 've got to go now . ''

One of the dispatchers said , `` If you work with me we will get this to stop . ''

Police were closing in on the suspect by this point .

The conversation ended with the dispatcher saying , `` OK , Omar ? Omar ? Omar ? OK . ''

Another dispatcher said , `` Still alive . ''

The president of Hartford Distributors said Thornton never filed a claim alleging racial discrimination .

Ross Hollander , whose family owns the business , said there were no grievances filed with the company or Thornton 's union . `` I can state to you unequivocally no racism claim was ever alleged , '' Hollander said at a news conference at which he pledged the company would cooperate with any investigations .

Joanne Hannah , Kristi 's mother , said her daughter had watched a report on Thornton 's 911 call .

`` She 's devastated , back to bawling again , '' Joanne Hannah said . `` I ca n't even believe he did that . I guess you do n't really know people , its crazy . ''

Kristi Hannah told CNN Thornton first told her about racial harassment at work last summer .

Kristi Hannah said her mother told Thornton to take pictures of the alleged harassment with his cell phone . He took two pictures in the men 's bathroom at work , she said . She described one as his name written on a cartoon , and the other as a drawing of a hangman with a noose around its neck . Connecticut state police have the phone .

Hannah 's mother said Thornton heard a co-worker say he `` wanted that n **** r out of there . '' She said Thornton told his girlfriend he had reported harassment to a company supervisor and a union representative , but nothing was done about it .

Manchester police have said they have found no evidence of racial discrimination .
