-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Apple says a new software update provides tools to get rid of the so-called `` Flashback '' virus that has infected hundreds of thousands of Mac computers .

In a post on its support forums , Apple said the update to the Java software platform `` removes the most common variants '' of the Flashback malware .

Last week , a Russian security company reported that as many as 600,000 Macs , most of them in the United States and Canada , had been infected by Flashback , a Trojan horse virus that infiltrates computers , secretly giving someone else remote access to them .

Flashback was first discovered in September , disguising itself as an Adobe Flash Player installer .

Apple recommended the new update to all Mac users who have Java installed .

Throughout their history , Macs have been relatively free from most of the viruses and other malware that have targeted PCs , with cybercriminals preferring to go after the larger number of computer users on that system .

But the rise of Macs has also seen an uptick in the number of Mac users targeted .

`` Malware authors have targeted the Mac OS for quite some time ; however , the recent OSX.Flashback.K infections indicate a very significant shift to the current threat landscape , which is dominated by malware on the Windows operating system , '' Web security firm Symantec posted on its blog .

Symantec estimates that the number of computers still infected is down to about 270,000 , slightly less than half of the number that was reported a week ago .

Apple , which prides itself on keeping a safe environment for users , was criticized in some quarters for the amount of time it took to respond to Flashback .

`` Better late than never ? '' wrote Tony Bradley of PCWorld on Friday .

Bradley was more complimentary of the fix itself . While previous updates have closed the loophole that allowed the malware , the latest fixes the damage and is designed to protect Macs from similar attacks in the future .

`` Kudos to Apple , '' he wrote . `` It may be late to the game when it comes to helping users remove the Flashback malware from Mac OS X , but it has raised the bar for proactively protecting systems at the same time . ''
