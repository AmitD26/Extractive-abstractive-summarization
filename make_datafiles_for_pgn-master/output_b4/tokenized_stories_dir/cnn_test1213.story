LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling is writing a prequel to her best-selling series to be auctioned for charity -- but at just 800 words , it may lack some of the magic fans of the boy wizard might be hoping for .

Autographed copies of J.K. Rowling 's work have fetched millions of dollars at auction .

Rowling 's hand-written prequel , signed by the author , will be auctioned alongside works by other famous writers to raise cash for a dyslexia charity .

Despite the brevity of the piece , experts believe it could fetch big money , since other autographed works by the blockbuster author have sold for millions of dollars .

`` We never dreamed that J.K. Rowling would donate something so precious , and we 're incredibly grateful , '' said Gerry Johnson , managing director of Waterstone 's , the UK book chain organizing the auction .

`` I ca n't begin to guess how much it will raise at auction . ''

A previous 93-word storycard from Rowling , which referred to the book `` Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , '' sold in 2002 for $ 53,000 . Rowling later produced seven hand-written copies of a new work , `` The Tales of Beedle the Bard , '' one of which sold for $ 3.9 million in 2007 .

`` Given the enormous interest we have seen in recent times for autograph work by J.K. Rowling , the prospects for her storycard are good to say the least , '' said Philip Errington , a specialist at Sotheby 's auction house , which is helping to organize the sale .

The card on which the story is written -- measuring 14.6 by 20.9 centimeters -LRB- 5.75 by 8.25 inches -RRB- -- is signed `` JK Rowling 2008 . '' The author signs off with the message : `` From the prequel I am not working on -- but that was fun ! ''

Alongside Rowling , 13 other authors invited to contribute to the June 10 auction include Margaret Atwood , Sebastian Faulks , Nick Hornby , and Tom Stoppard . A book featuring all 13 cards will go on sale in August .

All profits from the book will benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN , a writers ' association , Waterstone 's said .
