-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ecuador international Christian Benitez , the top scorer in the Mexican league last season , has died suddenly at the age of 27 .

The striker popularly known as ` Chucho ' passed away in the Qatari capital Doha , one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish .

Having played at the 2006 World Cup as a youngster , Benitez had developed into an important component of an Ecuadorian side bidding to reach next year 's finals in Brazil .

His 24 international goals make him the third highest scorer overall for Ecuador 's national team .

Jose Chamorro , the player 's agent , told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital , where he had been taken after complaining of abdominal pains .

Manchester United star Antonio Valencia , an international colleague of Benitez who played with the striker at leading Ecuadorian side El Nacional a decade ago , was among those struggling to come to terms with the loss .

`` This pain -LRB- is -RRB- very strong my brother but we love you , '' the winger wrote on Twitter , where he also posted several pictures of the diminutive forward .

Despite being a footballer who failed to hit the heights in Europe , news of Benitez 's death trended on Twitter .

Ecuador 's interior minister Jose Serrano was among those who took to the micro-blogging site to comment , writing : `` Dear Chucho , thank you for your goals and your happiness . ''

Sunderland 's Craig Gardner , who played with Benitez at Birmingham City between 2009 and 2010 , was also moved to comment .

`` Ca n't believe Christian Benitez has died , '' Gardner wrote . `` I had the pleasure to play with him . He was a top bloke . My thoughts go out to his family . ''

Having only signed Benitez three weeks ago , El Jaish were forced to confirm news of his death on their website .

`` The club would like to offer its sincere condolences to the family of the player , '' a club statement said on Monday .

`` Benitez had recently joined the club from Club America for three seasons . The player participated for the first time with the team during yesterday 's match against Qatar Sports Club in the Sheikh Jassem Cup without complaining of any health problems .

`` His sudden departure is a big shock for each member of the technical and administrative staff . He was a player that over the short period he was here was regarded for his high moral character . ''

The son of former international Ermen Benitez , who is still the top league scorer in Ecuadorian football history , Christian made his name at El Nacional , a club where his father played with great success throughout the 1980 's .

After leaving the Quito side , who posted a tribute on their website to Christian on Monday , the South American plied his trade with such success for Mexico 's Santos Laguna that he alerted the interest of the English Premier League .

Joining Birmingham City on loan in 2009 , the Ecuadorian made his debut at Manchester United and scored his first goal at Liverpool .

Despite a bright start , his impact faded over the season , prompting Birmingham manager Alex McLeish to return Benitez to Santos Laguna in 2010 .

After leading the scoring charts , he joined rivals America in 2011 and helped the club win this year 's Clausura title -- finishing as top scorer along the way .

He was still contracted to the club until moving to Qatar this month , but America also paid respects to a key player of recent times .

`` Christian will always be present in our hearts and we will never forget you . Rest in peace , '' read the club website .

Benitez 's last international goal came when in a 4-1 World Cup qualifying win over Paraguay in Quito in March .

The Ecuadorians , who failed to qualify for the 2010 finals in South Africa , lie third in South American qualifying , with a quarter of the campaign still left to play .

The top four teams in the nine-team group will automatically qualify for the 2014 World Cup .
