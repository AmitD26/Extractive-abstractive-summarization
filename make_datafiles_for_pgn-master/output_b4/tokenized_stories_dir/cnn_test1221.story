Tijuana , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Tijuana 's Avenue de la Revolucion , street vendor and sidewalk philosopher Juan Ramon Rocha leaned on his coin and jewelry cart and waited .

But the tourists from across the border never rushed into the streets of T.J. , as it 's often called .

Rocha made one sale , to a local resident , in an hour .

`` The business , you can see for yourself , it went down 95 percent , '' he said . `` Please tell them , the Americans , it 's safe to come here . We are all Americanos , North Americanos . Do you see any problems here ? ''

A few yards away , there was a donkey painted like a zebra , hitched to a cart full of sombreros , a Tijuana photo opportunity . But no smiling tourists stepped into the picture frame .

Visitors have been scared off because at least 18,000 people have been killed in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon dispatched the army to fight the drug cartels in December 2006 .

Tijuana 's grisliest murders include decapitations , dismemberments , dozens of police killings and the deaths of three teenagers at school .

Fear of Tijuana 's streets seeps deep into California .

As groups of 240 students from Westmont College near Santa Barbara , California , drove down the coast to do missionary work in Ensenada , Mexico , none ventured to Tijuana .

The missionaries doing spring break volunteer projects in poor neighborhoods were given a simple edict : Do not stop in T.J.

Hanna Walker kneeled , pounding nails into shingles , on a rooftop of a small house taking shape on a dirt road high above Ensenada .

`` To be honest , I was a tiny bit nervous crossing the border , '' Walker said . `` I 've been to Mexico before , but not for service projects . But now that I have been here -LSB- Ensenada -RSB- a couple days , I am perfectly comfortable . ''

The Westmont students are taking precautions as part of their annual Potter 's Clay missionary work .

`` We are staying in a group , '' Walker explained . `` We are making sure that I am with someone all the time . When we went downtown for dinner , we just paired up and walked around in twos , the buddy system . We locked cars . We 're just being smart about it . ''

Ensenada welcomes any business it can get , as its tourism trade has also been choked off by concerns about border violence .

Fortunately , cruise ships still dock in Ensenada 's Bahia de Los Santos , a daily divine arrival that spills cash-carrying tourists onto shore .

But we saw just two visitors who said they drove over the border to visit Ensenada . All the other beer-carrying , trinket-buying tourists came from the ship .

`` People are afraid of driving by Tijuana , '' said Papas and Beer manager Cesar Marquez . `` That 's what 's hurting us -LSB- Ensenada -RSB- the most . ''

Later , in Tijuana , as the shadows stretched out with the dropping sun , we were approached by a man with an outdated nylon jacket . His cheeks were chipped by acne scars .

The camera was far out of sight .

`` I can help you find whatever you need , '' he said .

`` What do you want ? I help people find the good clubs and get dates and more . You pay me . ''

We told him we were journalists on a story and not interested .

`` Oh then pay me , and I will tell you a lot for your story , about everything that goes on here , '' the hustler said .

Everything -- did he mean drugs or guns , or both ?

We had no intent to find out , kept to our tight travel schedule and drove out of Tijuana to a border crossing just several cars deep .

More than five years ago , that vehicle line extended so far back into Mexico , a re-entry at San Ysidro , California , could take hours .

We zipped through the checkpoint in 10 minutes , another sign that Mexico 's border violence is frightening off American tourists .
