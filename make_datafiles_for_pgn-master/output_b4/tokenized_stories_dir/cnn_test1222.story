Athens , Greece -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Greek riot police fired tear gas to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators Tuesday , as thousands rallied to protest proposed austerity measures on the first day of a two-day strike .

Twenty-one police officers and one demonstrator were hurt , and at least five people have been arrested , police said . About 3,000 officers are deployed on the streets of Athens .

The protesters are rallying outside the Greek Parliament building in the center of the country 's capital , where lawmakers are set to vote Wednesday on a tough five-year package of tax increases and spending cuts .

The newly appointed head of the International Monetary Fund , France 's Christine Lagarde , used one of her first media interviews to appeal to the Greek opposition to overcome their political differences and join a national consensus on the reforms .

Speaking to French network TF1 , she urged Greece 's lenders to come to its aid and said Greece must take charge of its affairs in a responsible way , while looking after those people who had the least .

Her words came hours after European Council President Herman van Rompuy also urged lawmakers to pass the measures , for the sake of Greece and the wider economy .

`` There are decisive moments and the coming hours will be decisive , crucial for the Greek people , but also for the Eurozone and the stability of the world economy , '' he told the European Parliament in Brussels , Belgium , on Tuesday .

As the demonstration continued into the evening , thousands of protesters -- some newly arrived -- faced police in riot gear manning barricades outside the Greek Parliament , but the mood had quieted .

Earlier Tuesday , live television footage showed clouds of tear gas as police and protesters clashed , and black smoke from small fires billowing through the streets . A truck belonging to a mobile telecom company was also set alight .

Police appeared to be trying to force protesters out of Constitution Square , CNN reporters said , but some were returning and others gathered in side streets ready to move back in .

Drumming and music reverberated around the square , as well as shouted slogans .

One group of protesters chanted `` Bread , education , freedom , '' an old rallying cry from 1973 , when thousands of students clashed violently with police during protests against the military government .

The 48-hour general strike kicked off in the early morning hours of Tuesday , hobbling most of Greece 's transportation systems but freeing workers to participate in demonstrations .

Members of the Communist PAME labor union took to the streets first , waving socialist signs in front of the Greek Parliament . The main rally , a cooperative effort between two much larger , mainstream unions , launched later .

Cloth banners reading `` No sacrifices for plutocracy '' flapped in chorus with chants of `` Workers , you can live without a boss , '' and `` We want workers ' rights , not profits for the boss ! ''

Government offices , schools and courts had closed , the unions said . Hospitals were operating on skeleton staffs , according to Greek state television broadcaster ERT .

Transportation disruptions took place on land , on sea and in the air .

Air traffic controllers periodically stopped work and flight traffic , according to their union . Stoppages also disrupted sea travel in the maritime nation , which encompasses many islands .

Trains and municipal transportation also shut down , but Athens metro workers abstained from the strike , according to the country 's transportation union .

Train operators provided continuous service to demonstrators headed for central Athens . Bus drivers were on strike , keeping city buses off Athens ' streets .

Greece must pass the austerity measures if it is to win the last $ 17 billion portion of a $ 156 billion bailout package from other European nations that was granted in 2010 -- and also to clear the way for an additional potential bailout package to keep Greece afloat going forward .

Greece needs the bailout funds to avert a default on debt repayments that are due as soon as mid-July .

Such a default would send shock waves through the European banking sector and potentially dent global economic confidence .

European Union Commissioner Olli Rehn , the bloc 's lead negotiator on the bailout , warned Tuesday that Greece faced `` a critical juncture , '' as he pressed Parliament to pass the austerity measures .

`` Both the future of the country and financial stability in Europe are at stake , '' Rehn said in Brussels . `` I trust that the Greek political leaders are fully aware of the responsibility that lies on their shoulders to avoid default . ''

He warned that there was `` no Plan B '' to avert default , and insisted that economic reforms -- although challenging -- were a better alternative for the Greek people .

`` The European Union continues to be ready to support Greece . But Europe can only help Greece if Greece helps itself , '' he added .

Protesters lament that the cuts are being carried out on the backs of those who can afford it least .

`` With the policy followed since the bailout , we have seen people 's living standards going down . It is the workers and the pensioners who are paying the debt , '' said electrical engineer Ioanna Lagonika .

Lagonika , who marched in PAME 's demonstration , said , `` The PM -LRB- prime minister -RRB- has said that this is a new start for Greece , but to us it feels like this is our end . ''

Accountant Pericles Panagakis , who also participated in the Communists ' march , would rather see Greece go through bankruptcy . The austerity programs mean `` even tougher measures for the people and just for the people , '' he said .

Panagakis would also like to see Greece 's wealthiest make up for the government shortfalls . `` The solution is to take the money from people who have money , not from the workers , '' he said .

The parliamentary vote , which comes a day later than originally planned , will be followed by a meeting of European Union finance ministers on Sunday to approve the final part of funding from last year 's bailout .

The head of Deutsche Bank warned politicians Monday against taking steps that might lead the crisis to spread beyond Greece .

`` If it is Greece alone , that 's already big . But if other countries are drawn in through contagion , it could be bigger than Lehman , '' Josef Ackermann said , referring to the financial meltdown that followed the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment firm in the U.S. in 2008 .

International lenders have insisted Greece cut spending , lay off public workers , raise taxes and raise 50 billion euros -LRB- $ 71 billion -RRB- through selling off state-owned enterprises in exchange for a further bailout of the cash-strapped nation .

The latest demands follow austerity measures imposed last year that included pension cuts ; a sales tax boost ; excise taxes on fuel , cigarettes , alcohol and luxury goods ; and a rise in the average retirement age to 65 from 61 .

The economic crisis has inspired rioting in the streets of Athens in recent weeks , where protesters have thrown firebombs and clashed with armored police .

The Parliament plans to vote on the austerity package sometime after 1 p.m. Wednesday . All three unions that marched Tuesday have also planned rallies for Wednesday evening .
