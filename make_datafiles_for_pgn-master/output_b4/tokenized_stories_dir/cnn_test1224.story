-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An international music awards show announced a new Adele album Tuesday -- but nothing 's happening , says her label chief .

The confusion started with a tweet from the World Music Awards , an international contest that has been broadcast from such locales as Los Angeles , Las Vegas and Monaco .

In a tweet , the show said , '' #adele confirms 2015 Tour After The Release Of Her New Album ' 25 ' ! ''

Not so fast , said Martin Mills , who heads Beggars Group . Adele 's label , XL Recordings , is a subsidiary of Beggars Group .

There 's `` no truth in this , '' he told Billboard .

So what 's the deal with the World Music Awards ? It may have gotten attention for the tweet , but Billboard observed that the contest is `` something of a curiosity on the international awards calendar . '' The American broadcast of its 2014 show was supposed to run on NBC but did n't because of `` technical issues . ''

Adele herself has said little . She did hint in May that a new work could be in the offing , but her Twitter account has mostly been silent , with just three tweets since that May 4 post . -LRB- The most recent promoted an album by Example . -RRB-

Certainly , even a smidgen of Adele news is eagerly awaited by her fans -- and the music business , which would love to see any material equal the performance of the English singer 's last record , `` 21 . ''

That album sold 3 million copies through digital streaming alone , which set a record . Altogether , it 's sold more than 10 million copies and topped Billboard 's year-end sales list in both 2011 and 2012 -- the first album ever to do that .

Oh , and `` 21 '' won the Grammy for album of the year .

Since `` 21 's '' success , Adele has won an Oscar for best original song -LRB- for `` Skyfall , '' from the James Bond movie of the same name -RRB- and given birth to a son with her partner , Simon Konecki .
