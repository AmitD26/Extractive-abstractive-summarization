-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- French President Francois Hollande voiced anger Wednesday over the confession by his former budget minister that he had a secret Swiss bank account , and affirmed that the man had not been shielded from justice .

Jerome Cahuzac resigned as minister in March , two months after prosecutors launched a preliminary investigation into suspected tax evasion .

It was not until a meeting with the investigating judges on Tuesday that he finally confessed he held the undeclared Swiss bank account , a statement on his blog said .

Hollande said Cahuzac had made an `` unforgivable mistake '' that was an insult to the country .

`` Yesterday I was both stupefied and angry when I was informed of Jerome Cahuzac 's confession to the judges , '' the president said .

`` He misled the highest authorities of the country : the head of state , the government , the parliament , and through it the French people as a whole . ''

Hollande said the full truth will be established .

`` The judicial system will play its role to the end and with complete independence , '' he said . `` I hereby affirm that Jerome Cahuzac did not benefit from any protection apart from that of the presumption of innocence . And he left the government at my request from the moment a judicial inquiry started . ''

Hollande vowed that steps will be taken to bolster the independence of the judiciary , to help it `` fight mercilessly '' against conflicts of interest . He also promised tougher penalties for any elected officials found guilty of fraud or corruption .

The claims against Cahuzac , which he repeatedly denied , first came to light in a report by French investigative news website Mediapart in December .

The website obtained a recording of a conversation in which Cahuzac supposedly told one of his aides that it worried him to have an account in Switzerland , as UBS was not the most discreet bank .

` Spiral of lies '

The scandal dominated the headlines of French newspapers Wednesday .

Newspaper La Liberation plastered one word , `` Indigne , '' or `` Unworthy , '' across its front page , below a close-up image of Cahuzac .

It asks whether after `` months of lies , '' his confession could now trigger a political crisis .

The scandal is particularly embarrassing for the Hollande government because it has vowed to crack down on tax evasion through foreign bank accounts .

In his statement , Cahuzac apologized to Hollande , the government and the French people `` for the damage I have caused . ''

`` I was caught in a spiral of lies and I took the wrong path . I am devastated by remorse , '' he wrote . `` To think I could avoid facing a past that I wanted to consider as resolved was an unspeakable mistake . ''

Cahuzac said he had met with the two investigating judges Tuesday to come clean and will now `` face reality . ''

He had held the bank account for about 20 years but had not paid into it for about 12 years , the ex-minister wrote .

He said he had given instructions for the total sum held in the Swiss account -- about 600,000 euros -LRB- $ 770,500 -RRB- -- to be transferred to his bank account in Paris .

Hollande appointed Bernard Cazeneuve to serve in Cahuzac 's place following his resignation last month .
