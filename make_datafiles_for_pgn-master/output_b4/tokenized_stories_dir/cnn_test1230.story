-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Russian energy giant Gazprom has accused Ukraine of siphoning off gas intended for European customers as the standoff between them worsens .

Gazprom deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev has accused the Ukraine of siphoning gas .

Gazprom shut off Ukraine 's gas supply on Thursday after saying it owed $ 2 billion in missed payments .

Ukraine denies owing the money and is currently meeting its domestic needs with supplies from storage facilities .

Gazprom has reassured Europe that its natural gas supply , which runs through Ukraine , will not be affected by the dispute with Kiev .

However , analysts are concerned that if the two sides do not reach a new agreement there will be a supply cut in the next two weeks .

Poland reported a drop in its supply on Saturday .

Gazprom deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev said the Ukraine had `` declared , rather cynically , that it take gas from the export pipe . ''

`` Balkan states have already started to suffer from the moves of the Ukrainian side , '' he said .

`` In this respect , the Balkan states , if they consider themselves hit in this situation , should use legal means they have in the frames of the Energy Charter in order to prevent the escalation of these events . '' Watch a report on Gazprom 's threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine ''

Meanwhile , Gazprom spokesman Sergey Kupriyanov said Naftogaz Ukrainy , responsible for Ukraine 's gas payments , may have paid the amount it owed but it would not arrive until January 11 because of the holiday season .

`` This will settle the overdue penalties and part of the debt for gas supplies . The remaining debt for gas will be in this case $ 614 million .

`` The contract for this year has n't been signed yet . Naftogaz Ukrainy has withdrawn from the talks . The negotiating group is in Kiev and so far has n't expressed its readiness to arrive in Moscow . Due to the absence of a contract for gas deliveries to Ukraine , gas is n't being supplied , '' Kupriyanov said .

Meanwhile , a Ukrainian delegation is in Europe meeting leaders to seek help to end the crisis .

Russia is the world 's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies Europe with more than 40 percent of its imports -- mainly via the pipelines through Ukraine .
