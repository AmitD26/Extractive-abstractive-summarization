-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Huma , please say it is n't so .

That was the overwhelming sentiment of women I chatted with on Facebook , Twitter and over e-mail after I heard reports that Huma Abedin , wife of embattled New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner , might partly blame herself for her husband 's return to sexting .

An Abedin family member reportedly told People magazine that she blamed herself , in part , for ending couples counseling last year and focusing on her newborn son around the same time Weiner got back to his explicit digital contacts with women .

I checked in with women around the country , most of whom I interviewed last week about Abedin 's decision to stick with her husband , to take their pulse .

Weiner 's wife : Should Huma stand by her man ?

`` What a sad thing to hear , that Huma blames herself , but it 's not so unusual , is it ? '' said Jessica Dukes , a mom of two and freelance writer in Brooklyn , New York . `` When relationships hit the rocks , does n't everyone have those ` What did I do to deserve this ? ' thoughts . ''

Andrea Kristina says she knows exactly what Abedin is going through . She put up with her husband 's infidelities for years , she said , and that battered her self-worth .

`` When a woman 's self-esteem is already low , and she is already so insecure , it is easy for a man like this to bend her thinking in a way that makes her feel as if she is the one who failed somehow , '' the divorced mom of a teenager said . `` For so long , that 's how I felt . ''

Pam Selker Rak , a married public relations executive in Pittsburgh , said if she were Huma 's friend , she 'd tell her she feels terrible she is choosing to `` carry this burden on her own shoulders . ''

`` But this is not her burden to carry , '' she said . `` Her husband is an adult who made choices , and those choices resulted in actions that have impacted his family , his career and even himself . ''

Allison Kluger , a married mom of two in Palo Alto , California , believes Huma 's `` self-blame stance '' is `` very generous . ''

`` I do n't really believe that she believes this , but she is very brave in voicing that a relationship -- all the ups and downs -- involve two people , '' Kluger said . `` What saddens me , but does not make me think negatively of Huma , is that she seems to be making all the sacrifices to keep her family , her husband 's career and her career together . ''

It is not surprising and very common for women to blame themselves when a spouse or partner strays , says Dr. Thema Bryant-Davis , a Los Angeles-based psychologist and associate professor at Pepperdine University .

Women in these situations , says Bryant-Davis , are looking for hope , power or control .

`` If I acknowledge I am powerless to stop his behavior , that is very disheartening , '' she said . `` If I can figure out what I did wrong , I can figure out how to fix it , and if you tell me that I did n't do anything wrong , then what do I do with that ? ''

Bryant-Davis also said it can be very hard for a woman such as Abedin , who has been very successful in her career and is not accustomed to `` losing . ''

`` It can be very disorienting to say how is it that in every other area of my life , I 've been able to achieve , and now in this area it looks like a failure , '' she said , adding the best advice for women who are in Abedin 's shoes is to get individual counseling as well as couples therapy .

Meg Watt , a married mom of two , says she knows plenty of people who have blamed themselves for their significant other 's choices , and that she was also guilty of it in a past relationship .

`` But either you live in denial of reality or you eventually face the facts in the situation : she did n't make him seek something outside their marriage . He did that all on his own , '' she said .

We , as women , are wired to be fixers , Watt added . `` But the important thing is to realize that the only person who can ` fix ' infidelity is the one who chose to commit it . ''
