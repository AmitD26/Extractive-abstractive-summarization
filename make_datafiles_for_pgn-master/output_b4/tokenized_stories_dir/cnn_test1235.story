-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Professor Raffaello D'Andrea is n't short of admirers for his autonomous flying robots and the amazing tricks they perform .

Every week , he receives a flood of e-mails from excited people telling him how to use them , he says .

`` Folks have contacted me about using them to deliver burritos and pizzas , paint walls , do search and rescue , monitor the environment , flying cameras for movies ... It 's just endless , '' D'Andrea says .

`` I 'm not going to pass judgment on whether they are good or bad ... my role is to show people what is possible . ''

It appears those possibilities are growing by the day at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich -LRB- ETH Zurich -RRB- where D'Andrea leads a team of researchers at the Flying Machine Arena -LRB- FMA -RRB- .

Set up by D'Andrea five years ago , the arena offers a `` sandbox environment '' for testing a fleet of progressively acrobatic quadrocopters .

In the beginning , these four-rotor machines learned to flip through 360-degrees , `` dance '' to music and even play the piano . Today , increasingly complex flight maneuvers are being attempted as quadrocopters work together to build a six-meter tall model tower and juggle balls and poles . It is an extraordinary and slightly befuddling sight to behold .

Quadrocopters are controlled by varying the relative speed of each rotor blades , or pairs of rotor blades to generate thrust and control pitch , roll and yaw . They 've been around for a long time , says D'Andrea , but what 's making them so popular now as a creative tool is the shrinking size and cost of technology .

`` In order to fly these things you need gyros . Only recently have they become small , accurate , and cheap enough to put on these vehicles , '' he explains .

The tiny motors driving each rotor are also extremely powerful and cheap now , he says , as are the batteries .

Last month , ETH Zurich released video footage of their latest stunt showing a quadrocopter balancing a pole before tossing it to another quadrocopter which successfully catches and controls the pole .

`` We tried various catching maneuvers , '' said grad student Dario Brescianini , who D'Andrea and a colleague supervised during the research , `` but none of them worked until we introduced a learning algorithm , which adapts parameters of the catching trajectory to eliminate systematic errors . ''

It took Brescianini around three months to perfect the move , D'Andrea says , but the infrastructure behind the FMA has taken much longer to build up .

Draped in protective netting and crash mats , the FMA looks like a rather down-at-heal gymnasium on first inspection , but a closer look reveals a high-tech suite of equipment which is crucial to understanding how the ETH 's quadrocopters fly .

Atop the 10-meter cubed space sits a motion capture system -LRB- made up of eight cameras -RRB- which locate objects in the FMA at rates of more than 200 frames per second .

The data from this indoor GPS system is sent to computers where custom-built software sends commands to the quadrocopters via wifi .

`` Aerodynamics is a very complex phenomena to model properly . If we can create machines that learn and adapt what they are doing in aerobatics it pushes use towards more intelligent systems . It 's a great research challenge , '' D'Andrea says .

Within five years he expects to see a proliferation of flying machines being used in a variety of settings .

There are already companies exploring flying vehicles for inspection and for humanitarian purposes . In the case of the latter , he points to the efforts of Californian-based start-up Matternet .

Founded by Andreas Raptopoulos , the company have ambitious plans to build a network of autonomous vehicles delivering food and aid to inaccessible areas in developing countries .

In between in his other projects at ETH Zurich , which include developing balancing cubes and actuated wingsuits , D'Andrea is also looking for ways to commercialize the university 's innovations . He 's currently in the process of starting a company which aims to maximize the potential of their quadrocopters in the arts and entertainment industry .

If his previous forays into the business world are anything to go by then expect it to be wildly successful .

In 2003 , D'Andrea co-founded Kiva Systems , applying the knowledge learnt creating a team of soccer-playing robots at Cornell University .

The company , which provides automated robot systems for warehouses , was sold to Amazon for $ 775 million in 2012 .

`` When we were doing RoboCup -LRB- an international robotics competition -RRB- it did not enter my mind that the learnings I would take from my students I had trained could be used to build a company like Kiva Systems , '' he says .

`` Basically , my mode of operation is really to focus on creating things that have never been done before and push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can do . In the process , do great research and educate people on how to really make things work and the applications will come . ''

There seems no limit to what autonomous flying robots might be capable of in the future and their unstoppable rise is increasingly causing concern , particularly their use in espionage and warfare . Suppressing the technology is not an option though , D'Andrea argues .

`` I 'm a firm believer that if the military use this technology then it 's just a short step away from everyone using it , '' he says .

`` We do n't want the technology to be misused . The starting point is that our governments do n't misuse the technology . As a society , we should question how much of a role , if any , these robots have in warfare . ''

Efforts to outlaw weapon-carrying drones have been gathering speed and support in recent months . NGO Human Rights Watch published a report -LRB- Losing Humanity : The Case against Killer Robots -RRB- in November 2012 urging governments to pre-emptively ban autonomous weapons . Another campaign , `` Stop the Killer Robots , '' is being mobilized by the NGO International Committee for Robot Arms Control and is due to launch in April .

Far away from the social and political debates about the misuse of drones , D'Andrea is just keen to promote his teaching philosophy and how students should approach learning .

`` I think there needs to be more room for unconstrained creation . We need to provide ways for folks , especially at university , to push the boundaries of what technology can do without being concerned about the immediate commercial application , '' he says .

`` We should be more concerned about fulfilling our dreams as children . What was it we wanted to do as children ? We wanted to fly like birds . Well , why are n't we doing that ? ''
