-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Surveillance video shows Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner walking up to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at a constituent event and firing point blank at her face , the Washington Post reported Tuesday , citing two sources who have seen the videos .

The bullet from his 9 mm Glock entered Giffords ' head just above her left eye and exited from the back of her skull , the sources said .

Giffords is in serious condition at University Medical Center in Tucson . A second , unnamed victim is listed in good condition , the hospital said .

The videos showed that U.S. District Judge John Roll was killed while covering Giffords ' district director Ron Barber , who was one of 13 people wounded in the January 8 shooting outside a Tucson supermarket , the Post 's sources said . Six people , including Roll , were killed .

The sources told the Post that Loughner fired 32 rounds -- one more than his 31-round magazine held . Investigators believe the 32nd round was already in the weapon 's chamber when he loaded the magazine .

Legislation banning the kind of multiple-round ammunition magazine used shootings was introduced Tuesday evening in the U.S. House .

Democratic Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York introduced the measure banning `` large capacity '' ammunition magazines , defined as those that hold more than 10 rounds . Sen. Frank Lautenberg , D-New Jersey , will introduce similar legislation in the Senate later this month .

`` I know what it 's like to have tragedy brought to your life in a split-second by a madman with high-capacity ammunition magazines , '' said McCarthy , whose husband was killed and son seriously wounded by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad in 1993 . `` I 'm working to stop it from happening again . ''

`` This nation has come together before to support this simple , common-sense measure , and it is the law in several states right now , '' she said Tuesday afternoon . `` It is a small sacrifice that law-abiding gun owners can make once again in order to increase everyone 's safety . ''

The manufacture and sale of new large-capacity magazines were outlawed under the assault weapons ban that was in place from 1994 until 2004 , when Congress let it expire under President George W. Bush . McCarthy 's legislation would also apply to previously manufactured magazines .

The measure includes exemptions for law enforcement and security purposes .

`` High-capacity gun magazines are tools for murder , '' Lautenberg said . `` This common-sense legislation would make it more difficult for someone to carry out a killing spree . ''

The Washington Post report says that Loughner , 22 , shot Giffords from about two or three feet away and then turned to his left , firing on people -- not shown in the video -- who were seated or standing in line for the event . Then , the sources told the paper , he turned back to his right and shot Barber , 65 .

`` Judge Roll starts to push Barber down on the ground and lay on top of Barber , and they start to scamper under the table , but Roll is on top , '' one source said , according to the newspaper . `` At that point , you can see the suspect shoot Roll . Roll gets shot in the back , then he sort of appears halfway on the other side of the table . He starts to look over his right shoulder , and then he lays back down . It took out his aorta is what the autopsy showed . ''

The sources said that video ends at that point , but others show Loughner firing until he runs out of ammunition , when he was tackled by people attending the event .

Meanwhile , a law enforcement official said Tuesday that federal and local authorities have conducted more than 300 interviews with family members , friends , neighbors and others as part of the probe into the shooting .

The number of federal personnel deployed in the investigation hit a high of about 250 people , including agents , analysts and evidence response teams , the official said .

The FBI has substantial resources in Arizona and was able to supply about 200 of those people , the official said . An additional 50 people came from FBI offices in Washington , D.C. , and Quantico , Virginia , and also from other federal law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Marshals Service , the U.S. Capitol Police and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , the official said .

The total number has now dropped to less than 250 people , the official said .

Local law agencies had assigned about 130 people to the investigation as well , but the official did n't know the current figure .

The Washington Post reported the parents of alleged gunman Loughner have not been able to provide much information and have told authorities they had little recent contact with Jared . When asked about this , the official said the parents have been cooperative , but did not assess how useful their information has been in the investigation .
