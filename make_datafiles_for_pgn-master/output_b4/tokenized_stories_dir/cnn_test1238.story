-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Ugandans voted Friday in a presidential election that could extend the term of the incumbent , who has been in power for 25 years .

A new term would give President Yoweri Museveni five more years .

This is the third consecutive time opposition front-runner Kizza Besigye has run against Museveni .

Voters lined up early to cast their ballots at various venues including schools , government offices and churches . In the capital , Kampala , streets were calm and empty , with increased security forces patrolling in riot gear .

Besigye -- who was a former doctor for Museveni -- lost presidential bids in 2001 and 2006 .

His party said it anticipated rigging , and it plans to conduct its own tally as soon as the polls are closed . The government has dismissed the accusations and said the opposition is trying to undermine the election .

`` We plan to have our own tally and release it in 24 hours , '' said Margaret Wokuri , a spokeswoman for the opposition Inter-Party Cooperation . `` We can not trust an electoral commission that was appointed by the ruling party . We have to have our own check mechanism . ''

Museveni , leader of the ruling National Resistance Movement party , has led the country since a rebel group he was aligned with seized the government in 1986 .

He was once hailed for stabilizing Uganda and helping combat the AIDS epidemic , but has faced mounting criticism over corruption and lack of political transition in the country .

Parliament removed presidential term limits in the east African nation five years ago , essentially allowing the incumbent to run for office indefinitely .

About 14 million people are registered to vote in the presidential and parliamentary ballot .

There are a total of eight presidential candidates , Wokuri said .
