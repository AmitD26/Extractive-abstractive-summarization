-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Long Run edged outsider Captain Chris to reclaim the prestigious King George VI Chase crown at Kempton Park on Boxing Day .

The seven-year-old gelding , ridden by Sam Waley-Cohen , made a bad mistake five from home and trailed going over the final fence of the three-mile steeplechase before conjuring up a driving finish .

Long Run got up with two strides remaining to pip 16-1 shot Captain Chris , who had been given every chance by jockey Richard Johnson .

7-1 French shot Grand Crus finished a distant third on the grueling heavy ground .

The Nicky Henderson-trained winner was beaten by the now retired Kauto Star in last year 's edition of the festive classic .

Kauto Star was paraded before the large crowds at the racecourse in south-west London ahead of the feature race of the day .

His half-brother , Kauto Stone , looked to keep the King George title in the family , but finished out of the placings , clearly struggling in the slow going under jockey Ruby Walsh .

Long Run , who achieved the King George VI and Cheltenham Gold Cup double in the 2010-11 season will be looking to achieve the feat again after his courageous victory .

He is 7-1 with leading bookmakers to win at Cheltenham next March .

`` He was so brave , we wanted to take the sting out of everything else and I asked so much , but he was so brave , '' jockey Waley-Cohen told Channel 4 .

`` That was racing at its best to my mind , that 's why we do it . I ca n't put it into words - it 's an honor and a pleasure . ''

Long Run joined greats such as Kauto Star and gray hero Desert Orchid in regaining the King George title after relinquishing it the year before .
