-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Socks . They 're just not for feet anymore .

Apparently they make pretty tasty snacks too , if you 're not too discriminating and you happen to be a 3-year-old Great Dane .

Just do n't eat too many .

And by too many , 43 would be a good example .

`` We opened up his stomach and kept removing sock after sock of all different shapes and sizes , '' Dr. Ashley Magee at DoveLewis Animal Hospital in Portland , Oregon , told CNN affiliate KGW .

The super-sized pooch had shown a hankering for socks before , but the extent of the problem was n't apparent until he got sick and the X-rays showed the contents of his belly .

Oh , and those X-rays even impressed the experts . The vet clinic submitted them to the annual `` They Ate WHAT ? '' contest at Veterinary Practice News and won the $ 500 third prize , losing out to a frog who gobbled up 30 rocks from the bottom his cage and a German shorthaired pointer who swallowed a metal shish kabob skewer .

The Great Dane is doing just fine . He was home a day after his surgery .

So far , no reported sock incidents .

But should he return to his sock habit , his owners can only hope that this too shall pass .
