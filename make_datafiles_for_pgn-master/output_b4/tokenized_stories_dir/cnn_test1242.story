Jerusalem -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- British journalist Paul Martin was released without charge Thursday , a month after Hamas officials arrested him in Gaza , his lawyer and the British Foreign Office said .

Martin was at the British consulate in Jerusalem , the Foreign Office said . His family said they expect him to fly home to London over the weekend .

Ahmed Yousef , an adviser to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh , said the decision to release Martin was made as a `` good will gesture '' and was in response to the many calls they had received to let him go .

Yousef said many lawmakers , press organizations , and even South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu had been communicating with Hamas about his release .

Martin is a documentary maker who has worked for the BBC , ITN , and other broadcasters , and reported for the British newspaper The Times . He was arrested February 14 by Hamas on suspicions he was involved with Israeli espionage activity .

Hamas initially detained Martin for two weeks , but extended his detention for 15 more days . Officials from Hamas , the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza , suggested at the time of Martin 's arrest that he had been communicating with a Palestinian affiliated with the rival Fatah movement and whom Hamas had accused of collaboration with Israel .

Yousef said in the end , Hamas did not have enough evidence to push the case further . He said Martin , who also holds a South African passport , had been declared persona non grata in Gaza and that it would be `` dangerous for him to come back . ''

Martin 's wife , Anne , said the family was `` extremely relieved '' at her husband 's release .

`` Paul is an experienced and highly regarded foreign correspondent with 30 years ' experience , '' she wrote in a statement . `` He is an innocent man who went into Gaza to testify in the trial of a Palestinian whom he had interviewed for a documentary . Paul has maintained his innocence throughout this ordeal . ''

As Martin was leaving Gaza , a reporter asked him about the Hamas allegations . Martin replied , `` Ridiculous , ridiculous , '' before closing the door of the car and driving away .

British consular officials had been allowed to visit Martin while he was jailed and the British Foreign office had publicly called for his release . The Tel Aviv Foreign Press Association had also called on Hamas to release Martin , asking the group `` to respect the rights of every journalist on assignment , to work without fear of being arrested . ''

Before Hamas took over Gaza in 2007 , the kidnapping and abduction of foreign journalists was a frequent occurrence as part of the factional warfare in the territory .

Since that time , no foreign journalists have been abducted . BBC journalist Alan Johnston was being held by another group in 2007 , and was released shortly after Hamas took power .

Palestinian journalists are subject to various forms of restriction and intimidation by authorities in Gaza , but Martin 's case was the first time Hamas had arrested a foreign journalist .
