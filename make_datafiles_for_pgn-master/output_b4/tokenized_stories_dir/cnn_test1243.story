-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a condition practically unheard of in the United States and most Western countries . But in a culture where a woman 's status and dignity is decided by her ability to provide a husband with multiple children , it can be a fate worse than death .

`` Obstetric fistula '' is a mouthful . But to these women , it 's much more than just a physical injury . They see themselves as the walking dead , says Dr. Justin Paluku Lussy , head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at HEAL Africa Hospital in Goma , Democratic Republic of the Congo .

An obstetric fistula occurs when a woman withstands days of obstructed labor , when a baby 's head is constantly pushing against her pelvic bone during contractions -- preventing blood flow and causing tissue to die .

This creates a hole , or a `` fistula , '' between a woman 's vagina and her bladder or rectum . Her baby is unlikely to survive . If the mother lives , she is unable to hold her urine and , in some cases , bowel content , Paluku Lussy says .

A woman with a fistula , who is perpetually leaking urine and sometimes feces , is often rejected by her husband and shunned by her village because of her foul smell and inability to bear more children .

`` These women have so much shame and so much fear . They spend so much money on perfume trying to cover up the smell , '' says Alison Heller , a doctorate student at Washington University in St. Louis who is leading a research study of 50 women in Niger awaiting fistula surgery . The women range in age from 15 to 70 .

Tanzanian women find hope in corrective surgery

An estimated 20 % of Paluku Lussy 's fistula patients report feeling ostracized by their communities , and divorce is common , says the doctor , who started his residency in 2001 at HEAL Africa , a 155-bed tertiary hospital with a fistula repair unit .

`` People think fistula patients are witches and just have bad luck , '' he says .

Although an estimated 2 million women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with untreated obstetric fistula , according to the Fistula Foundation , it 's unlikely for these women to meet or hear of anyone else suffering from the same injuries , because of the lack of modern forms of communication and also the women 's reluctance to discuss the condition , Heller says .

In most cases , a woman with a fistula does n't know what a fistula is or that it 's treatable with surgery . And if she does , she is far from any hospital and does n't have money for -- or access to -- transportation , let alone the average $ 450 cost for repair surgery plus postoperative care .

One of the youngest in Heller 's study , a 15-year-old girl who was married off to her uncle at age 8 , spent eight months selling bags of candied peanuts in order to raise enough money to pay for a taxi so she could get to a fistula center .

Such concerns are foreign concepts to most Westerners , says Dr. Lewis Wall , a professor of obstetrics and anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis . That 's because obstetric fistulas were largely eradicated from the United States by the 20th century , with strides in prenatal care and the use of cesarean section .

But pregnancy complications and childbirth are among the leading causes of death and disability for African women , Wall says .

Mom 's death inspires doctor 's life work

Typical West African hospitals do not have the trained staff or resources to identify and treat fistulas , Heller says .

`` Habsu , '' one 32-year-old woman in Heller 's study , contracted a fistula in her ninth pregnancy and has had three previous surgeries , all of which have failed . During the latest pregnancy , she was in labor for several days at home in a rural village before receiving medical care . Like many African women , she was malnourished and her pelvic bones were too small for a natural birth .

After hours of unsuccessful labor and not knowing how to perform a cesarean , the doctors used a scalpel to sever the baby inside the woman 's birth passage . Over the next few days , the mother delivered her baby , piece by piece , Heller says .

Another West African woman in Heller 's study , `` Amina , '' also has a severe fistula but only leaks when she sits down . After the seated interview with Heller , Amina apologized , saying she would leak urine once she stood up .

`` It was as if a gallon of water was thrown to the ground , '' Heller says . `` She was so ashamed . ''

Many Africans -- both educated and uneducated -- believe there is no cure for fistulas , Paluku Lussy says . When he was in medical school at the University of Goma , he says , `` they used to tell us not to even try to fix them . ''

But , he says , that 's not the case . Fistulas can be repaired with delicate surgery , which has a fairly good success rate . However , surgeons must be well-trained in the principles of the operation , and good follow-up care is essential so the surgery wo n't fail . Patients with more severe fistulas may need multiple surgeries .

Too many mothers still dying

Although he is a full-time professor , Wall last year opened the Danja Fistula Center in Niger , a 42-bed hospital specializing in fistula repair surgeries with an operating room , outpatient clinic and hostel facilities for about 100 women .

Since opening the fistula center , Wall estimates the facility has taken on 50 fistula cases per month .

But it 's very difficult to get trained staff to run a fistula hospital , because of the lack of available education in Africa , he says . Fistula centers rely on donations and can not afford to hire American gynecologic surgeons .

But even they are n't ideal candidates for the job -- since they never see fistula in their own country , they have no experience with it , he says . It 's best to have the institution run by locals trained specifically in fistula repair surgery and care .

Those who want to help should focus on spreading the word -- awareness is key , he says . Thursday is the first International Day to End Obstetric Fistula ; the United Nations Population Fund will host a variety of events to raise awareness .

That 's true for Washington resident Olivia Bowen . She had never heard of obstetric fistula until she read a book featuring a detailed story of an African woman with the condition . Bowen was shocked at how affordable fistula repair surgery is , by Western standards .

Bowen started a fundraiser called `` One Week to End Fistulas , '' which raises money for repair surgeries for underprivileged women who otherwise lack access . She asks that participants practice yoga daily for a week and raise enough money for one woman to have fistula repair surgery .

`` I 'm not a runner . I do yoga . So it 's something that just came naturally to me , '' Bowen says .

So far , participants have raised about $ 2,250 , or enough to fund five surgeries .

Bowen , who is in the process of making the fundraiser a nonprofit organization , says she hopes to help women who have already developed fistula , while the bigger organizations tackle other issues such as poverty , maternal health and human rights . Ultimately , she says , fistula is not just a women 's issue ; it 's a human issue .
