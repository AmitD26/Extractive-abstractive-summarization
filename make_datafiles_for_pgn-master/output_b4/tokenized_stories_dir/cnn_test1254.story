-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A few decades ago , I remember grousing to a college friend that as an Asian American male , everyone I met assumed I was studying some kind of science or engineering -- as if the idea that I might want to pursue a career in the arts , humanities or communications was ridiculous . My friend responded that as a 6-foot-7 African American pre-med student , he would be ecstatic for someone to actually believe he had an interest in a STEM field , as opposed to , say , basketball . Back then , we laughed off the exchange as a sign of how the stereotype grass is always greener on the other side .

Well , the fact is , stereotypes are n't quite lies ; they 're more like distorted versions of the truth . And the diversity statistics that the tech world 's biggest firms have been shamed into releasing this year have been revealing : the numbers show that there are a heckuva lot of Asians working in America 's technology industry ... and very few African Americans and Latinos .

According to the reports , more than four out of every 10 engineering staff in these tech companies are Asian . That includes 23 % of Apple 's programmers and engineers , 34 % of Google 's and Twitter 's , 41 % of Facebook 's and a staggering 57 % and 60 % of Yahoo 's and LinkedIn 's respectively .

By contrast -- stark , painful contrast -- around 4 % of employees at these companies altogether is Hispanic and only about 3 % are black . In both cases , Apple is pulling up the numbers ; without the fruit company 's 7 % Hispanic and 6 % black engineering team , the numbers would plummet .

This is just embarrassing . To their credit , the tech companies understand this . Each of them revealed their numbers with sheepish blog posts that asserted the need to `` do better '' in recruiting black and Hispanic technologists .

But these same posts have failed to celebrate -LRB- or even address -RRB- what would appear to be a singular diversity highlight : The very large percentages of Asians in the engineering workforce .

Maybe that 's because these statistics are n't exactly what they seem . The numbers released for Asian engineers have lumped U.S. citizens and permanent residents together with foreign nationals working on temporary H-1B visas ; over 40 % of H-1B visa holders are Asian -LRB- India alone accounts for 25 % -RRB- , most of them employed by tech companies . Take out the H1-B visa employees , and the eye-popping numbers of Asian technologists drops by half .

There 's also the reality that being an Asian technology employee can be a professional dead end . A gilded one , to be sure -- the average salary for a computer programmer is around $ 75,000 a year -- but the statistics on leadership-level employees show that most Asians in the tech industry hit a ceiling well before they reach management status .

The percentage of whites , blacks and Hispanics who are executives is the same as their percentage in engineering roles . Asians , meanwhile , are about half as likely to be managers as they are to be coders and hardware hackers .

`` I 'd be lying if I said I did n't notice underrepresentation by Asians in Silicon Valley at the executive level relative to their presence at lower levels , '' said James Hong , a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who began his career at Hewlett-Packard and went on to co-found one of the early dot-com sensations , the portrait-rating site HotOrNot.com . Hong points out , however , that it 's not clear whether this is more likely to be evidence of racial bias or a byproduct of immigrant culture .

`` Were we on average trained as children to be overachieving bookworms who respect authority and avoid conflict , and do these traits inhibit our progression into the upper levels of management ? '' he asks . `` Did strict Asian parents restrict their Asian American children from socializing with their classmates , making them incapable of leading others ? ''

It 's a question I sometimes wonder about every time I double-clutch before raising my hand to share an opinion , or defer to a supervisor 's decisions even when I disagree . -LRB- And I 'm about as rash , unruly and outspoken a child of Asian immigrants as you 'll probably find , as my parents have concluded . -RRB-

The upbringing that gives you the skills you need to do well professionally does n't necessarily provide you with the mindset you need to excel professionally . This suggests that the encouragement of diversity needs to be a priority in a person 's life long before entry into the workforce .

Ensuring that we 're exposed to people of different backgrounds from a very early age does n't just encourage tolerance ; it also provides us with a rich array of cultural models to follow , helping to address the soft spots we face in our individual upbringing . It certainly did for me . I 'm not sure how I would 've turned out if I 'd lived and grown up in a monocultural environment . I imagine I 'd probably be a doctor or engineer -- a mediocre and unhappy one .

The tech industry is trying to address its workforce shortcomings now , because it realizes that diversity is n't a burden , it 's a secret weapon . A diverse enterprise has the wherewithal to buffer collective strengths and bridge individual weaknesses , to zig when others zag and to respond fluidly regardless of shifts in the business environment and consumer landscape .

And that 's even truer for America as a whole than it is for the tech industry . If the future belongs to the United States , it wo n't be because we invented Facebook and Google . It will be because we 're the only nation in the world where Asian journalists and black doctors and Hispanic coders live and work side by side .
