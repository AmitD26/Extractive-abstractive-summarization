-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israel 's military said Tuesday it shot down a Syrian warplane over the Golan Heights amid what it described as growing tensions in the border area .

According to the Israel Defense Forces , the plane `` was identified while attempting to infiltrate Israeli airspace in the Golan Heights . ''

Israel used a Patriot anti-aircraft missile to bring it down , the IDF said .

Military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the aircraft shot down was a Russian-made Sukhoi-24 and that both the pilot and co-pilot ejected into Syria .

The plane penetrated roughly a kilometer -LRB- more than half a mile -RRB- into Israeli airspace , he said .

Syrian state TV also reported that Israeli forces had shot down a Syrian warplane .

Defense Minister : We will act strongly

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a London-based activist group , said the Syrian fighter jet was targeting the countryside around the Syrian town of Quneitra , where the only border crossing between Israel and Syria is located .

Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area , the group said .

Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the Syrian fighter jet `` came close to Israeli territory on the Golan Heights in a threatening manner , and even crossed the border line . ''

He said Israel would use whatever means were necessary to protect its citizens .

`` We have made it clear , and we are making it clear now as well : We will not allow any factor be it a country or a terror organization , to threaten our security and violate our sovereignty . We will act strongly against all attempts even if it is a mistake or intentional . ''

Border area called ` Highly unstable '

An IDF statement posted online said the Israel-Syria border had been `` highly unstable '' in recent months .

`` As the civil war rages in Syria , IDF forces have experienced combat in the region , both from targeted strikes and errant fire , '' it said .

The incident came as the United States and a number of Arab allies began bombing ISIS targets in the Syrian town of Raqqa , far to the northeast .

U.N. forces withdrew last week from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights , a little more than two weeks after Islamic militant fighters took some peacekeepers hostage and besieged others .

Al-Nusra Front freed 45 U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji in good condition earlier this month , while forces from the Philippines escaped after exchanging fire with militant fighters , according to media reports .

The incidents occurred after Syrian rebel fighters took control of the border crossing in Quneitra in late August .
