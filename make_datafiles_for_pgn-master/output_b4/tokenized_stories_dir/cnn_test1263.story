NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 49-year-old woman collapsed and died on the floor of a waiting room at a Brooklyn psychiatric hospital and lay there for more than an hour as employees ignored her , according to the New York Civil Liberties Union , which on Tuesday released surveillance camera video of the incident .

Surveillance video shows a woman lying on the hospital floor for almost an hour before anyone helped her .

Esmin Green was involuntarily admitted to the psychiatric emergency department of Kings County Hospital Center on June 18 for what the hospital describes as `` agitation and psychosis . ''

Upon her admission , Green waited nearly 24 hours for treatment , said the civil liberties union , which was among the groups filing suit against the facility last year seeking improved conditions for patients .

The surveillance camera video shows the woman rolling off a waiting room chair , landing face-down on the floor and convulsing . Her collapse came at 5:32 a.m. June 19 , the NYCLU said , and she stopped moving at 6:07 a.m. . During that time , the organization said , workers at the hospital ignored her .

At 6:35 a.m. , the tape shows a hospital employee approaching and nudging Green with her foot , the group said . Help was summoned three minutes later . Watch the surveillance video ''

In addition , the organization said , hospital staff falsified Green 's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance .

`` Contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospital 's video cameras , the patient 's medical records say that at 6 a.m. , she got up and went to the bathroom , and at 6:20 a.m. she was ` sitting quietly in waiting room ' -- more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor . ''

The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation , which oversees the hospital , released a statement Tuesday saying it was `` shocked and distressed by this situation . It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care . ''

After a preliminary investigation , the corporation said it suspended or terminated six employees , `` including staff involved with the direct care of the patient as well as managers of security and clinical services , '' the statement said .

A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said it was aware of the discrepancies in Green 's record when it began the preliminary investigation on June 20 . That information is now in the hands of various investigatory agencies , she said .

The corporation pledged to put `` additional and significant '' reforms in place in the wake of the incident .

The civil liberties group and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service filed suit against Kings County in May 2007 in federal court , alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy . Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or floors covered in urine , feces and blood while waiting for beds , the groups allege , and often go without basic hygiene such as showers , clean linens and clean clothes . The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile .

The hospital , the suit alleges , lacks `` the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness , space , privacy , and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons . ''

The video sent the organizations back into court Tuesday , demanding immediate reform .

`` What 's happening in Kings County Hospital is an affront to human dignity , '' New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman said in a written statement . `` In 2008 in New York City , nobody should be subjected to this kind of treatment . It should not take the death of a patient to get the city to make changes that everyone knows are long overdue . ''

The Department of Justice recently initiated an investigation into conditions at the hospital , the organization said , prompting the facility to improve some of its problems . `` But the culture of abuse and neglect remains and , as evidenced by the June death , the situation is too dire to wait for the Justice Department to act , '' the group said .

Among the reforms agreed to in court Tuesday by the hospital are additional staffing ; checking of patients every 15 minutes ; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward , officials said . In addition , the hospital said it is expanding crisis-prevention training for staff ; expanding space to prevent overcrowding ; and reducing patients ' wait time for release , treatment or placement in an inpatient bed .

On Monday , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was appalled by the surveillance video .

`` Look , I saw the film like everybody else did and I was -- horrified is much too nice a word . Disgusted I think is a better word . I ca n't explain what happened there . ''

Green , a native of the island of Jamaica , lived alone in Brooklyn 's Brownsville neighborhood . She had no close family in the United States , and her neighbor Beatrice Wallace described her as a quiet woman who had few visitors and spent most of her free time at church .

The medical examiner is withholding autopsy results pending further study and investigation into the precise cause of death .
