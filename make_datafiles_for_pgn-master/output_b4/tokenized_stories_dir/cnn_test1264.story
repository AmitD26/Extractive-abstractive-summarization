-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Canadian town slipped out of a tense fear and into mourning overnight with the arrest of a man suspected of killing three police officers and wounding two others .

` I 'm done , '' suspect Justin Bourque yelled as he gave up , a nearby resident who watched the 24-year-old 's arrest through a window told CNN partner CBC .

He was unarmed , although police found weapons nearby , said Marlene Snowman , a superintendent for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .

Authorities offered no explanation for the rampage in the town of Moncton , New Brunswick . Charges against him would be filed later , Snowman said .

RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown identified the slain officers as Constables David Ross , 32 , Fabrice Georges Gevaudan , 45 , and Douglas James Larche , 40 .

`` On Wednesday night , we lost three incredible members of our organization , and I ca n't dig deep enough to explain the sadness that we all feel , '' Brown said , his voice breaking at times .

Shortly after Bourque 's arrest , barricades tumbled as residents on lockdown since the shooting slowly gathered on the streets .

`` It 's hard to imagine that we can go back and turn the page without having a sense of the great loss we 've suffered , '' Mayor George Leblanc of Moncton told CTV .

`` Moncton is such a beautiful , warm community ... I know this community has a tremendous spirit , and we will get through this . ''

Arrested in a backyard

Michelle Thibodeau told CBC that the suspect was captured near her home in Moncton .

`` There were trucks going by really slowly as well as cop cars surrounding my house , so we knew they were looking directly around my house , '' she said . `` Suddenly , one of the SWAT trucks stopped and unloaded officers , and they proceeded to go to my backyard . ''

While there , they yelled for the suspect to surrender . He was hiding behind a row of trees , Thibodeau said .

`` They were screaming for about five minutes and they had their guns loaded . And eventually Justin came out with his hands up and he yelled , ` I 'm done . ' And they collected him and brought him to my front yard , where he lay sprawled out . ''

Police surveyed her yard for weapons before taking him away , she told CBC .

`` My heart dropped in my stomach . We were all shaking and panicky . It was a very scary situation . ''

Her parents , brother , his girlfriend and a dog all watched the scene unfold from a window .

At the time of his arrest , the suspect was wearing the same camouflage uniform shown in the pictures , according to Thibodeau .

The only difference was his hair was `` dripping wet , '' she said .

Last social media post ?

A Facebook page purported to belong to Bourque has many posts with pro-gun photos and a few anti-police memes .

There is also a photo where two men pose with shotguns in the snow . It was posted on February 25 , six days after the Facebook page was created , and is used as the profile picture .

In what appears to be his final post , the page 's author used the words of a song by the metal group Megadeth .

You say you 've got the answers , well who asked you anyway ?

Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way ?

Do n't try to fool us , we know the worst is yet to come .

I believe my kingdom will come .

Rare shootings

Moncton has 140,000 people and is 150 kilometers -LRB- 93 miles -RRB- northeast of Saint John .

`` It 's a lot . Especially for a city like this , where you would n't expect something to happen like this , '' resident Jonathan Hurshman told CTV . `` You see it all in the States , and you think , ` No , that could never happen here ' -- and sure enough , it happens here . ''

There were no homicides in Moncton in 2011 and 2012 , and the average number of homicides per year between 2006 and 2011 was one .

In 2012 , the homicide rate in Canada was 1.6 per 100,000 . In the United States , it was 4.7 per 100,000 , according to United Nations statistics .
