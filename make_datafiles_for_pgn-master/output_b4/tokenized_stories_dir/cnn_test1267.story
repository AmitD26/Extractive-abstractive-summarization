-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Robert Molnar has a vision : an ocean race from New York to the Canadian Pacific city of Victoria , via the Arctic .

`` Because of climate change , we can do this race , '' Molnar told CNN .

He pictures oceangoing sailboats hugging the Atlantic coast up through Halifax to western Greenland , then heading west through the Northwest Passage to Tuktoyaktuk on Canada 's Arctic coastline , before rounding Alaska to Dutch Harbor and , at last , Victoria .

In 2017 , Molnar plans to make this a reality in the form of the Sailing the Arctic Race , or STAR .

`` The Arctic is the big attraction . There is a romanticism about it , '' says the 66-year-old , who spent decades working in advertising while nursing his passion for sailing .

`` Crossing the Atlantic has been done so many times , going around the world this way , that way .

`` Crossing the Arctic by sail ? That 's only been done by a few people , and only six people have done it twice , '' he claims . `` More people have been on the moon . ''

In the age of sail , the Arctic Ocean took hundreds of lives as explorers fought to navigate and conquer a vast , deadly stretch of water littered with sea ice and rocks .

Earlier this week , Canadian authorities announced the discovery of a wreck from one of the most celebrated early , doomed voyages -- Sir John Franklin 's 1845 expedition , during which all 129 crew members died .

Sea ice conditions are much more favorable to shipping in the 21st century , and that makes Molnar confident his race can work .

`` My job is , number one , safety , '' he insists . `` I do n't want anyone to get hurt .

`` The race is n't easy because of the climate , the ice , but we can take care of that . Our route is designed with the recommendations of people who were captains there all their lives , looking over our shoulder .

`` But it is dangerous . It is definitely an extreme sport . ''

Extreme sailing is a major industry with the Volvo Ocean Race , a round-the-world event lasting nine months , one of the sport 's signature contests .

Molnar tells CNN he has Volvo Ocean Race participants prepared to take part in the inaugural race through the Northwest Passage , scheduled to begin in June 2017 and end in late September or early October .

`` We already have more people willing to attend than there are spaces for boats , '' he adds . `` I want to go with 20 to 25 boats and the good thing is we have so many people wanting to go .

`` That means we can pick who is the best-financed and who is the most experienced and , by doing so , we reduce the danger of trouble . ''

Richard Haworth , director of High Latitudes -- a company working with yachts to guide them through remote Arctic waters -- has reservations about the concept of an Arctic sailing race .

`` All the races in the Southern Ocean currently , interestingly , have waypoints which keep them away from the main danger of icebergs , '' notes Haworth . `` This race , clearly , wo n't be able to do that . So that 's a different safety philosophy .

`` It 's doable , but it will persuade people to push the limits a bit more . One of the things you do n't do when you go up there is push the limits .

`` You have to understand there is not so much help and assistance around . I would be surprised if that race happened without someone pushing the limits a bit too far and needing some assistance . Sooner or later , the Canadian authorities are going to get upset . ''

Mario Pelletier represents those authorities . As assistant commissioner of the Canadian Coast Guard , he shares Haworth 's concerns .

Pelletier is currently overseeing an intense and tricky Arctic shipping season which has forced a number of vessels to abandon planned crossings of the Northwest Passage . In his opinion , even planning a race three years from now is ambitious .

`` If we 're talking the Northwest Passage , the ice conditions we 're seeing -- with multi-year ice coming down from the high Arctic -- it would be a huge challenge for 2017 , '' says Pelletier .

`` It 's certainly not something , with the conditions we see today , that is likely to happen . And that is the first I 've heard of it . ''

Molnar dismisses the suggestion his race will not go ahead , claiming the contested ownership of high Arctic waters is providing the political clout to push the event forward .

`` It will happen , 110 % , '' he says . `` There is no way around it . The support is surreal , I 'm astonished . There is a lot of political will to make this happen .

`` Canada wants to say , ` the Northwest Passage belongs to us . ' There is a reason the Canadian prime minister , Stephen Harper , was just there . He wants to make sure this is part of Canada .

`` We will do that without the military . We will do that with sport . ''

The project is self-financed for now , though Molnar adds `` quite a bit of federal , provincial and local sponsorship '' has been secured .

His ultimate ambition , he says , is for the race to educate the world about the fragility of the Arctic .

STAR 's plans call for children at each stopover destination on the race route to engage in up to six months of related schoolwork prior to the race 's visit , culminating in presentations to local political and industry leaders .

`` This is almost the most important part of the race , '' says Molnar .

`` The kids can tell those leaders they are messing stuff up now , big time . They are drilling , they are fracking , they are breaking stuff . Those kids do n't want to clean that up .

`` The kids will put propositions on the table for alternatives , under huge scrutiny , presented to the whole world .

`` I do n't think we will save the planet , but we can show people how beautiful this place is -- and just do n't mess it up . If you go there , go there gently . ''
