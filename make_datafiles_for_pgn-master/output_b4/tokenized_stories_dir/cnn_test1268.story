-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The chilling sound of multiple gunshots shattered the relative quiet of the school day at Sandy Hook Elementary School at around 9:30 Friday morning -- children screaming , then silence , as teachers did their best to protect their students and keep them quiet , hoping desperately the shooter would not find them .

This is a morning no one in this small town in Connecticut will ever forget ; the morning a gunman forced his way into the school and killed 26 people -- six adults and 20 children , all under the age of 10 ; the last morning some Newtown , Connecticut , parents would see their kids alive .

As the community reels , organizations are setting up ways to help through donations and support .

An official fund for victims ' families , and the community as a whole , has now been established : The Sandy Hook School Support Fund , set up by the United Way of Western Connecticut will provide support services to families and the community . All donations to this fund will go directly to those affected .

The Red Cross has also been on the ground , offering food and water to affected families and first responders , and providing more than 50 units of blood to Danbury hospital where some of the victims were transported . They have set up a center for emergency grief counseling - and more than 100 Red Cross workers , including mental health professionals , are on the ground in Newtown helping to support the community . The Red Cross stresses it has what it needs to support efforts in Newtown , and is asking that those wishing to donate to families and the community , direct their contributions to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund .

In addition , the nonprofit mental health clinic Newtown Youth and Family Services is providing counseling for families , community members and school staff . They say no appointments are needed and those needing help may walk in . All donations made to them at this time will go to helping those impacted .

The Newtown Parent Connection has also pledged to try and bring in extra counselors to help parents cope .

Some private funds have also been set up in the wake of the tragedy to help victims . The Newtown Memorial Fund is taking donations for the families and community affected , and is also actively recruiting volunteers and offers of help of all kinds . Facebook pages and websites have also been set up to help the families of Emilie Parker -LRB- 6 -RRB- , Olivia Rose Engel -LRB- 6 -RRB- , Noah Pozner -LRB- 6 -RRB- , and Daniel Barden -LRB- 7 -RRB- , who were killed at Sandy Hook .

The band OneRepublic has also started a fund to raise money for those affected . You can find details on how to donate to OneRepublic 's fund here .

The organization ` Lutheran Church Charities ' has sent a team of ` comfort dogs ' to the community . Chewie , Barnabas , Hannah and others will be visiting schoolchildren , attending funerals and memorial services , and will be at the memorial area . You can donate to help support the dogs ' visit to Newtown here .

For families from the Newtown area , and even beyond , a pressing problem will be how to help children cope with the aftermath of this tragedy -- and indeed how to give parents space to grieve , knowing their children are being looked after . To that end , Save The Children has opened a `` child-friendly space '' in Newtown to give kids a place to play and express themselves while parents seek support or counseling . The space is located in Newtown 's Reed Intermediate School , where students of Sandy Hook elementary go after graduating .

In addition , Save The Children has released 10 tips for parents wondering how to help their children deal with their feelings about such a traumatic event , such as spending extra time with your kids , and limiting TV time .

A number of other organizations , such as the National Association of School Psychologists , and the American Academy of Pediatrics , have released recommendations for parents and teachers as to how to support children if they want to talk about what happened .

The US Postal Service has added a PO Box for those who wish to send letters of condolence to the residents of Newtown . Please address mail to : Message of Condolence , PO Box 3700 , Newtown , CT 06470 .

You can also send words of support and messages for families affected in an evergram here . They will be collated and given to the families in the future .
