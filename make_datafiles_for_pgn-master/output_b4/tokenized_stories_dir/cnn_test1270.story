-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When the Economist Intelligence Unit released its most recent Worldwide Cost of Living Survey , the spotlight , as ever , fell on the world 's most expensive cities .

Tokyo came in on top of the pile of places that drain the color from your wallet , while Osaka and Sydney were second and third .

World 's most expensive cities

But what about the other end of the spectrum -- how about a holiday where you can live it up without hemorrhaging cash ?

The world 's cheapest city is Tehran , Iran , followed by Jeddah , Saudi Arabia . Both have rich heritages , but Iran and Saudi Arabia are better known for generating controversial headlines than attracting tourists .

In third place , however , Panama City popped up . The Central American country is best known for hats and a canal -- now we 've got a reason to make sure our passport is up to date !

Over the past decade , Panama has enjoyed the fastest growing economy in Latin America .

As a result , new hotels and restaurants have sprouted across the capital . Healthy competition is keeping standards high , and Panama City has a plethora of top-quality , luxury experiences for cut prices .

Logistics

Before stepping foot outside the airport , you 've started saving . All tourists arriving at Tocumen International Airport are given travel insurance for 30 days . It is granted by the Panamanian Tourism Authority ; the government has provided the service since it signed an $ 8 million deal with Assicurazioni Generali .

Next up : cash . The Panamanian balboa is linked with the dollar and the two currencies are interchangeable , so there 's no paying a commission for changing currency .

As for airport transfers , a standard taxi to the city center costs $ 25 . You could arrive in style with a Panama Luxury Limousine for $ 88.50 . The same service would cost $ 145 in Rio de Janeiro , or $ 427 in Tokyo .

More cents can be saved -LRB- and you can do your bit for the environment -RRB- by avoiding bottled water . Tap water in Panama City is safe to drink , not a given in the region .

Hotels

Waldorf Astoria Panama

Latin America 's first Waldorf Astoria hotel opened in March 2013 .

Book early and rooms start from $ 159 .

Located on Calle Uruguay , aka `` restaurant row , '' the 248 rooms have metallic , glass and crystal decor designed by Miami-based Ba-Haus/KNF .

A stay here certainly does n't feel like skimping . The outdoor swimming pool is covered in gold tiles , there 's a swanky spa and each guest is given a personal concierge .

Overseen by head chef Kalych Padro Alvarado , four restaurants include a sushi bar and a French brasserie .

Waldorf Astoria Panama , 47th and Uruguay Streets ; rooms from $ 159 ; +507 294 8000

Casa del Horno

Founded in 1501 , Panama was a Spanish colony for three centuries . Known as Casco Viejo , the historic part of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

Casa del Horno -LRB- Oven House -RRB- sits on a colorful cobbled street in Casco Viejo . Surrounded by churches and plazas , it 's one of many colonial buildings to be renovated in recent years , making Casco Viejo feel like Cartagena in neighboring Colombia .

Built in the 1850s , the eight-room hotel was originally a bakery . Stone walls remain , alongside art deco wooden furniture and all the modern fixtures , including LCD TVs and iPod docks .

The hotel 's cafe and restaurant are reached via the pavement , avoiding the clinical feel that can befall hotel restaurants .

Casa del Horno , Avenue B and Eighth Street ; +507 212 0052 ; rooms from $ 250 for two-person suite

Tantalo Hotel

The year-old Tantalo Hotel has 12 rooms , each designed by a different Panamanian artist . Designs range from gentle and flowery to seductive , with red-and-black walls and silver ceiling studs .

Downstairs , a `` living wall '' is made from 900 lush plants . The restaurant dishes up Panama-style tapas , such as octopus with lemongrass and ginger . Cocktails , wine and several dishes to share will cost around $ 30 a head .

Each month , paintings in the communal areas change .

`` The idea is for the fourth floor to be like an art gallery that you can wander around with a drink , '' says assistant manager Catalina Bermudez .

The big , buzzing rooftop bar has panoramic views and hosts events including a monthly Cuban music evening .

Tantalo , Avenue B and Eighth Street ; +507 262 4030 ; rooms from $ 120

Canal House

Canal House is a creaky 19th-century mansion in Casco Viejo , and checking in feels like staying with a stately aunt . With just three suites set around a large wooden staircase , this high-end guesthouse is owned by two sisters and loved for its quirky charm and homemade cooking . It was called `` the finest accommodation that exists in Panama , '' by Panama 980 magazine .

Canal House , Calle 5a Este ; +507 228-1907 ; rooms from $ 195 , suites from $ 320

Dining and nightlife

Restaurante Angel -LRB- Via Argentina No. 6868 , El Cangrejo ; +507 263 6411 -RRB- is the city 's special occasion Spanish restaurant . You 'll get impeccably prepared seafood , beef , lamb and rabbit in an elegant setting with crisp service for around $ 20-25 per person , not including drinks .

There 's big food and big atmosphere for reasonable prices at Las Bovedas -LRB- Plaza Francia ; +507 228 8058 -RRB- , a French restaurant set in the arched vaults of a 300-year-old fort in Casco Viejo . Fresh seafood , steaks , snails -LRB- it 's a signature dish -RRB- and great service are the hallmarks at this dressy classic .

Panamanian food is a mix of European , Asian and African tastes . The best way to experience the fusion is at Maito -LRB- Calle 50 , Coco del Mar ; +507 391 4657 -RRB- . It 's not often you order plantain hash with fried ceviche and come out smiling . Then there 's the ropa vieja main of shredded beef with a goat cheese sauce . Panamanian chef Mario CastrellÃ ³ n trained in Barcelona and returned to his hometown with a mission to start a `` new gastronomy '' inspired by the canal -- the idea being that the waterway literally brings these different influences to the city .

For the indecisive gourmand , Manolo Caracol -LRB- Avenida Central and Calle 3 , +507 228 4640 -RRB- serves a set nine-course tasting menu for $ 36 per person . Busy and smart , yet relaxed , the open kitchen churns out seafood , meat and vegetable dishes made with local ingredients , the majority of which come straight from chef Caracol 's farm . Highlights include seafood bisque , corn tortilla with chorizo , and coconut fish curry with yuca tortillas .

Not exactly luxury but tasty and cheap all the same , Mercado del Marisco seafood market -LRB- Avenida Balboa and Calle Eloy Alfaro -RRB- is a great place to wander . When Anthony Bourdain came to Panama , this was his first stop . Here you 'll find rows of al fresco stalls selling ceviche for $ 1.25 a cup . There 's also an upstairs restaurant with a larger menu with hearty fish stews and filleted sea bass .

New Casco Viejo coffeehouse Bajareque sells the world 's most expensive coffee , Geisha , for a reasonable $ 6.50 a cup . Panama is the world 's only producer of this rare coffee , which typically retails for $ 172.50 per kilo . Fitting for its name , Geisha coffee mainly sells in Japan and costs $ 50 a cup at Tokyo coffee shops like Horiguchi Coffee .

The primary nightlife spots are Calle Uruguay and Casco Viejo , both of which are lined with places to sample Panama 's four national beers , Panama , Balboa , Suarana and Atlas , for a couple of dollars .

In Casco Viejo , Habana Panama -LRB- Calle Eloy Alfaro y Calle 12 Este ; +507 212 0152 -RRB- , is n't just the hottest dance spot in the city , it 's an atmospheric salsa hall that recalls the elegance of old Cuba and Ricky Ricardo style . Live bands typically do n't hit the stage until midnight . For a typical $ 10 cover you 'll find fewer better shows -LRB- or more fun -RRB- anywhere .

Then there 's Barlovento -LRB- Calle 10 A ; +507 6613 4345 -RRB- , a tropical-style rooftop bar where the beautifuls hang . With views over Casco Viejo -LRB- rather than the Panama City skyline over at TÃ ¡ ntalo -RRB- and a DJ playing a mix of electronic music and Latin beats , the place is pumping on the weekends . Again there 's a $ 10 cover charge -LRB- if you 're male that is ; women enter free -RRB- but you 'd easily pay a $ 25 cover for the same deal in Mexico City .

Attractions

Panama Viejo

The oldest section of the city , Panama Viejo was burned to the ground in the late 17th century by British pirate -LRB- or privateer , depending who you ask -RRB- Sir Henry Morgan .

The crumbling remains of towers , forts and houses run along the coast waiting to be explored . The visitors center has a model showing the city before Morgan showed up .

Panama Viejo ; +507 226 8915 ; $ 3 for museum , $ 4 for ruins , $ 6 for both ; open Tuesday-Sunday , 9 a.m.-5 p.m.

Panama Canal

The Panama Canal took 250,000 people more than 10 years to build -LRB- not counting the original failed French-led effort -RRB- , transports 40 boats each day -LRB- taking eight to 10 hours per transit -RRB- and costs an average of $ 85,000 per vessel .

Luckily , tours are a little less , and a partial transit with Canal & Bay Tours costs $ 135 per person , including breakfast , lunch and transfer though two sets of locks .

The Panama Canal celebrates its centenary in 2014 , and to mark the occasion it 's undergoing a $ 5.25 billion modernization and expansion .

Progress is best viewed from above . Air Charter Panama arranges one-hour helicopter tours covering the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the canal from $ 749 for three passengers in a Robinson R44 .
