-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was an election night like none other , in every sense of the phrase . In addition to the obvious -- the selection of the nation 's first black president -- Tuesday night 's coverage on CNN showcased groundbreaking technology .

CNN 's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York .

`` I want you to watch what we 're about to do , '' CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer told viewers early in the evening 's coverage , `` because you 've never seen anything like this on television . ''

And he was right . Cue CNN political correspondent Jessica Yellin .

`` Hi Wolf ! '' said Yellin , waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network 's New York City studios . Or at least , that 's the way it appeared at first glance .

In reality , Yellin -- a correspondent who had been covering Sen. Barack Obama 's campaign -- was at the now president-elect 's mega-rally along the lakefront in Chicago , Illinois , more than 700 miles away from CNN 's Election Center in New York .

It looked like a scene straight out of `` Star Wars . '' Here was Yellin , partially translucent with a glowing blue haze around her , appearing to materialize in thin air . She even referenced the classic movie on her own , saying , `` It 's like I follow in the tradition of Princess Leia . It 's something else .

Jay Leno has poked fun at the hologram , and mash-up spoofs that replace Yellin 's voice with Carrie Fisher 's lines from the movie already are making their way around the Internet .

But the million-dollar question on everyone 's mind now : How 'd they do it ?

CNN dubbed it a `` hologram '' -- a three-dimensional image that 's been reproduced . And it 's the brainchild of a few people . A hologram creates an image using coherent light , such as lasers ; CNN 's technique used conventional cameras to capture multiple images from different angles .

`` About a dozen years , I 've been trying to do it , '' David Bohrman , CNN 's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief , said to Blitzer on `` The Situation Room '' on Wednesday . `` I 've basically been a crazy mad scientist trying to get it done . ''

The technology involved placing a subject -- in this case Yellin , and later in the evening , musical artist Will.i.am -- in the middle of a bright-green circular room inside a large tent at Obama 's Grant Park victory celebration .

The subject was then filmed with 35 high-definition video cameras , barely larger than average point-and-shoot cameras , which ringed the wall of the circular room . The video cameras were 6 inches apart and at eye level , 220 degrees around the subject .

Chuck Hurley , the Washington bureau 's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the `` hologram , '' called it simple chroma-key technology that 's been taken `` to the Nth degree . '' Watch the hologram on air ''

`` Weathermen have been standing in front of green screens for years now , but that 's -LSB- with -RSB- one camera , '' Hurley said . `` Now we can do that times 35 , so you can send all the way around the subject . ''

Hurley said the tiny cameras `` talk '' to the New York studio 's cameras , meaning that when a New York camera moves , it `` tells '' the cameras in the tent which direction it 's moving and keeps the subject in the correct proportions .

On Tuesday night , Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio . Technicians placed a round piece of red laminate on the studio floor where she was `` beamed in '' so that Blitzer would know where to look .

The technology in play was originally developed by Israeli-based company SportVU -LRB- pronounced `` sport view '' -RRB- as a new way of filming soccer games .

Gal Oz , a SportVU designer who came to the United States to work with CNN on the endeavor , said it was originally designed `` to create a matrix effect in sports '' -- in other words , to provide 360 degrees of perspective for instant replays .

But it has n't been used for its intended purpose yet . Instead , for the past three months , the company has been perfecting it for CNN 's election coverage , Oz said . Tuesday night 's live interview of Yellin was essentially the technology 's world debut as well .

Hurley and Oz agree that as good as the image looked on television Tuesday , it can look even more realistic . Hurley said the blue glow around Yellin and Will.i.am was added intentionally to avoid confusion .

`` We could have had a much crisper , more realistic shot , almost to the extent where the viewer at home would have had no idea even that the person was n't really there , '' Hurley said .

`` You do n't want to have the effect where it looks so good that for every future live shot , you have people on the blogs saying , ` Oh they 're not really there -- they 're in a studio , faking the moon landing . ' ''

Hurley said considering it was CNN 's first real `` test launch '' with the high-end gadgetry , they were `` beyond thrilled . '' That 's not to say there were n't setbacks .

For all the preparation that went into the tent and green room in Chicago -- a location CNN staffers dubbed `` Casper '' after the friendly cartoon ghost -- there was an equally elaborate setup in Phoenix , Arizona , site of John McCain 's election night rally . CNN correspondent Dana Bash was ready there for her turn in the portal as well .

But because the Arizona site did n't go through as much testing in the final hours , and because the election was called in Obama 's favor earlier in the evening than many expected , Chicago 's `` Casper '' was the only `` hologram ' venue put to use .

Hurley and Oz both said they could n't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology . But could this become a staple of future TV news ?

`` We 'll see . It was a little ornament on the tree , '' Bohrman said . `` But television evolves , and how we do things evolves , and at some point -- maybe it 's five years or 10 years or 20 years down the road -- I think there 's going to be a way that television does interviews like this because it allows for a much more intimate possibility for a remote interview . ''

The day after her virtual appearance in New York , Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining , even when it 's presenting important political stories .

`` We do serious journalism , but we also have fun . This is fun . This is about what we can do , about pushing the envelope and pushing the boundaries , '' she said . `` Someday when this is even more advanced , having a fuller visual field for interview subjects could give viewers even more of a sense of people . ''

Now , in hindsight , Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better `` Star Wars '' joke .

`` I was thinking of making an Obi-Wan Kenobi joke -- Obi-Wolf Kenobi , '' she said , laughing , `` but I could n't figure out the pun . ''
