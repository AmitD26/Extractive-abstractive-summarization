-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Sunday a bill that prohibits most teenagers from getting bronzed in tanning beds , making the Golden State the first to do so .

State Sen. Ted Lieu said he first tried , and failed , in 2007 to make it illegal for people between the ages of 14 and 18 to walk into a facility and use ultraviolet beds to tan . Four years later , his effort finally paid off .

`` I feel great , '' Lieu told CNN of the bill 's passage . `` I believe it will help save lives and prevent unnecessary suffering . ''

Previously , those between 14 and 18 could use tanning beds if they had a parent or legal guardian 's permission . That is no longer allowed , though the use of `` a phototherapy device ... used by or under the direct supervision of a qualified physician or surgeon '' and certain services offered at tanning facilities , like spray tans , are still legal for young people .

While most states regulate how minors can use tanning facilities , California 's recently enacted restrictions go further than any other state , according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . Some counties also address the issue , with the same organization noting that Howard County , Maryland , was the first jurisdiction to ban indoor tanning for all under age 18 .

Governments in other countries have taken similar actions , with Brazil banning tanning beds altogether .

Such steps come after the International Agency for Research on Cancer , which is part of the World Health Organization , in 2009 classified `` UV-emitting tanning devices as ` carcinogenic to humans . ' ''

The determination was made after reviews of more than 20 epidemiological studies found that one 's skin cancer risk increases 75 % when a person starts using a tanning device before they turn 30 , the agency noted on its website .

Lieu explained that excessive tanning at an early age can be especially perilous because tanning and its negative effects are `` cumulative . '' But he said that one concern is how tanning salons market such services .

`` They often say come in -LRB- and get -RRB- the package deal , where you can tan a lot over a -LRB- relatively -RRB- short period of time and do intense damage , '' said the Democrat from Torrance .

Still , he said that at least in some circles -- including the MTV reality show `` Jersey Shore , '' where `` gym , tanning and laundry '' is a way of life -- he believes the message about the danger of tanning beds may be getting through .

`` I know that Snooki on the ` Jersey Shore ' has changed to spray tanning , '' Lieu said . `` Spray tanning has no known harmful effects , and you can get tans from lotions or cream . There are safe ways to get that brown look . ''
