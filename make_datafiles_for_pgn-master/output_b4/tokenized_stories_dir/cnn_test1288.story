-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brazil 's national football team may have been smoked on the pitch by Germany , but now government officials are claiming a 2014 FIFA World Cup victory of another sort .

According to figures released this week by Brazil 's federal government , the World Cup was a triumph for the country 's transportation and tourism industries .

`` We lost the trophy , but Brazil won the World Cup , '' said Aloisio Mercadante , Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff 's chief of staff , in a statement .

`` Brazil showed that they know how to win , lose , host and celebrate peace with respect and a ` make yourself at home ' atmosphere that won the world over . ''

According to government figures , 1 million foreign tourists visited Brazil during the month-long event , far exceeding its pre-Cup projection of 600,000 visitors coming to the country from abroad .

About 3 million Brazilians traveled around the country during the event , just short of the expected 3.1 million .

Additionally , according to the government , of the million foreign visitors , `` 95 % of them said they intend to return . ''

`` We were saying that we would host the World Cup of World Cups , '' said President Rousseff in a statement . `` Indeed , we staged the World Cup of World Cups .

`` We had one problem , our match against Germany . However ... we beat the pessimistic predictions and hosted the World Cup of World Cups with the immense and wonderful contribution of our people . ''

Not everyone on board

The government 's assessment of the World Cup 's impact on travel was significantly more enthusiastic than a report last week in the Wall Street Journal that called the event `` a bust for Brazil 's domestic travel industry . ''

Citing figures from the Brazilian Airline Association , that story projected total air travel in Brazil falling 11 % to 15 % during the World Cup compared with the same period in 2013 . The story blamed hiked-up prices and large crowds for scaring off domestic tourists .

Economists who study the impact of large sporting and other events on local and national economies tend to be less sanguine than the governments that host them .

`` Every time you get a World Cup tourist you get one less regular tourist , '' Dr. Andrew Zimbalist , a sports economist and economics professor at Smith College in Massachusetts , tells CNN .

`` Generally speaking , the World Cup does not benefit the host 's tourism industry . ''

Zimbalist says it 's doubtful Brazil 's international tourism profile will experience long-term positive impact as a result of the World Cup .

He points to heightened media coverage around the event that focused on `` unsavory conditions '' facing the country , such as violence , poverty , pollution and social unrest , as illustrated by public demonstrations against the huge amounts of public funds spent on new infrastructure .

Furthermore , he said , the World Cup wo n't provide sustained promotion for the smaller of the event 's 12 host cities .

The Amazonas city of Manaus is an example .

Zimbalist cited public money spent on a stadium that will eventually become underutilized . Rather than inspire coverage of the beauty of the surrounding Amazon , media reports tended to focus on the new facility and the conflict that surrounded its construction .

`` It 's very hard to see how that 's going to promote tourism in Manaus , '' says Zimbalist .

More where that came from

Turning mega-sporting events such as the World Cup and Olympics into proxy tourism campaigns remains an uncertain enterprise .

Some cities continue to reap the benefits of hosting .

Barcelona has seen a tenfold increase in tourist numbers since it hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics .

Meanwhile , a decade after hosting the 2004 summer games , Olympic venues in Athens have become decaying ghost towns .

For now , it 's unlikely there will be enough time to assess the long-term economic impact of the World Cup on Brazil 's economy in advance of the country 's next huge event -- the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
