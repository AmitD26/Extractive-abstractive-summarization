-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was deemed arguably the greatest sporting comeback of all time as Oracle Team USA won the America 's Cup in September last year .

And now the Australian skipper of that venture , James Spithill , who spearheaded his crew to overcome an 8-1 deficit to win the next eight races and take home the 162-year-old trophy , has effectively won sailing 's Oscars .

The 35-year-old , named ISAF World Sailor of the Year at a glittering awards ceremony in Palma , Mallorca on Tuesday , told CNN : `` I 'm accepting this on behalf of the team . It 's a fantastic group of nominees of more individual performances and this could not be further from that .

`` It was a team effort and it 's just a real highlight to be here and accept it on behalf of the team . ''

Spithill 's team had looked dead and buried when they trailed by seven in the first-to-nine contest against Emirates Team New Zealand before pulling off a remarkable overhaul .

Looking back , he recalled : `` I was in fear of letting down my teammates and they were in fear of letting down each other , more so the guys on the shore . ''

In winning the individual award , he once again denied New Zealanders , this time Peter Burling and Blair Tuke , along with British nominee Giles Scott , American Bill Hardesty , and fellow Aussies Mat Belcher and Will Ryan .

In the female category , Brazilian duo Martine Grael and Kahena Kunze showed that age is no barrier as they picked up the award at the tender age of 23 . They beat fellow nominees Steph Bridge , from Britain , and France 's Charline Picon in the process .

Grael and Kunze have been the star attraction in the 49erFX class this season with a myriad of victories and the end-of-season No. 1 spot in the world rankings in a year capped by their recent World Championships win .

Grael 's father Torben is a former sailor of the year , picking up the award in 2009 .

Launched in 1984 , the awards are recognized as the pinnacle for individual competitors in the sport globally .
