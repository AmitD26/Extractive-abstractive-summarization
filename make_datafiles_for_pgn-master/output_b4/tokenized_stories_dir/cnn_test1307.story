-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If Paul Revere had owned a pair of sneakers , he undoubtedly would have laced up and gone on a midnight run instead of a midnight ride through the streets of Boston .

Boston is sneaker city , especially this year , on the heels of the Boston Marathon bombing anniversary . Everybody is a runner -- in reality or in spirit .

Turn a corner in this handsome , historic town , and you 'll stumble upon at least one -- usually a pack -- of neon-garbed runners navigating their way through Boston 's cobblestone streets and parks .

You can improvise and create your own running route or follow one of these five running pathways -- some for nature lovers , others giving a nod to Boston 's storied past .

Whichever route you choose , you 'll be swept up by `` Boston Strong '' -- the slogan for a proud town with running in its DNA .

Boston is also a town that likes to celebrate its running , so we have suggestions later for where to hoist an after-run brew .

On your mark , get set , go

The Charles River/Esplanade : This popular running route loops around the Charles River , taking in Cambridge and Boston . You 'll have opportunities to cross several footbridges and other spans , including the BU Bridge , the Longfellow Bridge and the Mass Ave Bridge , depending on how far you want to run .

On the Cambridge side of the river , you can dash by the Museum of Science , cross over the Longfellow Bridge and run along the Esplanade , passing the Hatch Shell where the Boston Pops perform on July 4 . For a 4-mile loop , cross the Mass Ave Bridge to Cambridge , run along the Charles , cross over Longfellow Bridge , back along the Esplanade in Boston . Or , go for it , and run the entire 17-mile path all the way out to neighboring Watertown .

Emerald Necklace : Frederick Law Olmsted of Central Park fame designed this gem , a lanky chain of nine green parks that stretches for more than seven miles covering 1,200 miles of parkland , including the flowery Arnold Arboretum .

The Emerald Necklace begins at Boston Common in the heart of downtown , and dangles to Franklin Park -LRB- home to a zoo -RRB- . Along the way , expect plenty of shade from tree-lined paths , some hilly , mostly paved . Run the whole stretch or just sections ; the `` T '' , Boston 's subway , has stops along the way . -LRB- emeraldnecklace.org -RRB-

Castle Island : This South Boston -LRB- Southie -RRB- loop has a lot going for it -- historical Fort Independence , ocean breezes and views of Boston , the Boston Harbor Islands and planes coming in for a landing at nearby Logan Airport .

The run is a 3-mile loop or , for a 7-mile loop , include a run around the ` Sugar Bowl '' -LRB- manmade Pleasure Bay -RRB- , which is connected to Castle Island .

Chestnut Hill Reservoir : Another beauty designed by Olmsted , this 1.6-mile trail hugs the reservoir in Cleveland Circle , on the outskirts of Boston , and is a nature nut 's nirvana -- serene water vistas , wildlife and inspiring sunrises and sunsets .

If you 're ambitious , run up nearby Heartbreak Hill , the appropriately named hill that 's a game-changer for many runners in the Boston Marathon . To get here , take the `` T '' to Cleveland Circle .

The Freedom Trail Run : Sightseeing with a twist , this 5K run begins at Boston Common and takes you along the famed Freedom Trail , stopping at 16 sites along the way including Paul Revere 's house and the Granary Burial Ground -LRB- John Hancock , Samuel Adams , Revere and other notable Bostonians are buried here . -RRB-

An easy , breezy way to get in your run -- and see the sights , too . The run ends at Charlestown Navy Yard where runners get a complimentary sports drink and board the inner harbor ferry for a ride back to Boston . -LRB- freedomtrailrun.com -RRB-

A leg up on after-run refreshments

Aw , Shucks : Belly up to the oyster bar at Union Oyster House , Boston 's oldest restaurant , where Paul Revere and the Founding Fathers tied one on and slurped oysters . Or , head upstairs to settle into a booth . True , this is a tourist 's bucket list spot , but also a fun spot to channel history and grab a post-run beverage , oysters and a meal . -LRB- unionoysterhouse.com -RRB-

Home run : One of Boston 's many Irish pubs , McGreevy 's is especially popular for sports fans and music lovers -LRB- it 's home base for Celtic punk band , Dropkick Murphys . -RRB- Expect a fun-loving scene , with floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto Boylston Street in nice weather .

If you love baseball as much as running , this bar has a huge Red Sox following -- after all , it claims to be 1,200 steps from Fenway Park and channels Red Sox history with memorabilia . -LRB- mcgreevysboston.com -RRB-

Run and a pint : Another Irish pub , not far from MIT in Cambridge , Asgard is a popular runner 's cool-down bar , especially after a nearby Charles River run . Sit at one of the wooden communal tables or pull up a seat on the outside patio . -LRB- classicirish.com -RRB-

Jog your memory : You 've exercised your body , now grab a beer and flex your mind at Mass Ave Tavern . Casual and friendly , with an entire wall of board games -LRB- Scrabble , anyone ? -RRB- , this downtown location is a popular spot for runner group meet-ups .

Bonus : After a weekend run , push the limit and take the all-you-can-eat Uncle Buck Pancake Challenge . -LRB- massavetavern.com -RRB-

These pretzels are making me thirsty : Harpoon Brewery & Beer Hall , located in the Seaport district , near South Boston , is a popular post-run drinking spot -LRB- think communal tables , pints and handmade pretzels with fun dipping sauces . -RRB-

Harpoon serves about 20 beers , including a Harpoon IPA and , just in time for summer , the UFO Big Squeeze , a grapefruit Shandy . The brewery also sponsors the annual Harpoon 5-Miler running race . -LRB- harpoonbrewery.com -RRB-
