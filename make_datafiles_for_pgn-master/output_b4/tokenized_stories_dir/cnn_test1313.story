Mogadishu , Somalia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Islamist militants killed one Somali lawmaker and wounded another in a drive-by shooting in the capital on Thursday morning , the third assassination of a Parliament member this year , police and a legislator said .

Mohamed Mohamud Hayd and a security guard were shot and killed near a hotel by gunmen riding in a speeding minivan in Mogadishu 's Hamarweyne district , lawmaker Hussein Arab Isse said .

Another federal lawmaker , Abdullahi Ahmed Hussein , also known as `` Onka , '' was seriously injured in the shooting and taken to a hospital for treatment , authorities said .

In a statement posted on a pro-militant website , the al-Qaeda-linked Islamist group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility . It said the attack was a `` beginning of Ramadan offensive , '' referring to the start of a monthlong fasting period for Muslims .

The attackers were wearing Somali army uniforms , Isse said . They drove away after the shooting , police Capt. Abdalla Jama said .

Al-Shabaab 's aim is to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state , though it has carried out attacks in other African countries , as well . The group carried out the mall attack in Nairobi , Kenya , in September that left at 67 people dead .

Hayd `` was a man who served his country and his people , '' Somali government spokesman Ridwaan Haji Adbiwali said .

`` We condemn this and any other murders , especially during the holy month of Ramadan , '' Abdiwali said . `` Islam does not support the killing of innocents , brothers slaying brothers and criminal acts . ''

Hayd 's death comes more than three months after the assassinations of two other lawmakers , and almost six weeks since a bloody attack on the parliament headquarters .

On April 21 in Mogadishu , a hidden bomb exploded in a car containing Parliament member Isack Mohamed Ali , popularly known as Isack Rino , killing him , officials said .

The next day , gunmen shot and killed lawmaker Abdulaziz Isaak Mursal as he drove to work from his home in Mogadishu 's Dharkenley neighborhood , police said .

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for both killings .

On May 24 , al-Shabaab militants attacked Parliament headquarters with guns and explosives in a siege that lasted more than three hours . At least 10 people were killed and 11 others injured , witnesses and officials said . Security forces killed some of the attackers , and other militants died by blowing themselves up , police said .

Al-Shabaab , designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States , has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years . The two groups effectively merged in 2012 , according to CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen .
