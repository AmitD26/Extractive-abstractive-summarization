-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities launched an international manhunt Thursday for a Canadian man suspected of dismembering an acquaintance and mailing body parts to political party headquarters .

Canadian police believe Luka Rocco Magnotta , 29 , who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov , has fled the country , prompting Interpol , the global police agency , to add his name to its most wanted list .

The self-described porn star posting a video of the killing and dismemberment online .

`` We believe he filmed himself , '' said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere . `` It 's gross . ''

`` This is a very deranged person , '' he said . `` He is looking for attention and he got it but not in a positive way . ''

Magnotta knew the victim , whom Lafreniere said he could not identify . He said the headless body was too mutilated to make any immediate identification .

Magnotta had no prior police record but his name and photos were all over the Internet . Animal rights activists accused him of being a serial kitten killer and launched a campaign to find him .

Magnotta had what appears to be his own website , on which he says he was the victim of cyberstalkers .

Lafreniere said police found evidence suggesting he had fled Canada . He once wrote online about how to disappear after committing a crime .

Police have reason to believe he might have gone to eastern Europe , given his Russian alias and writings on his Web page . Lefreniere said there was a possibility he might have re-entered Canada under another name . He said Magnotta was good at disguising himself .

Police were first alerted to the grisly act when a severed foot in a package arrived by mail at Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa . Police Sgt. Steve Hodgsontold reporters that staffers had begun to open the package before calling police .

`` The odor coming from the package was just horrible , and I 'm sure many of us will never forget it , '' Conservative Party spokesman Fred Delorey told Canada 's CBC news .

A severed hand turned up the same day at a postal distribution center , where it was intercepted . It was addressed to the Liberal Party .

On Wednesday , a third body part -- a torso -- turned up behind a Montreal apartment building , where the suspect was a tenant . It had been stuffed into a suitcase . The foot and hand belong to the same victim , Lafreniere said , and police believe the torso does as well .

`` We are still missing pieces of this puzzle in terms of body parts , '' he said .

Two people associated with the beige brick apartment building where Magnotta lived noticed the suitcase outside the building .

`` I had my eye on it , because it looked like a nice suitcase , '' resident Richard Payette told CBC . But something about it struck him has odd .

Later , a janitor made the shocking discovery , and police were alerted .

Arriving officers cordoned off the area . The scene inside the apartment was no less disturbing .

`` I 've been a police officer for more than 20 years now , and I met officers that were doing an investigation for more than 30 years , and they said they never saw a scene like that , '' Lafreniere said .

Dried blood stained the table , the bed , the bathtub and the refrigerator of apartment 208 .

Police say they have found a video online of Magnotta committing the murder in Montreal .

His image and information related to him were later recovered from a `` very graphic '' website , Lafreniere said . At least one of the websites examined by authorities was pornographic .

Magnotta also was notorious among animal rights activists who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used the carcasses in sexual acts .

He was dubbed the `` Vacuum Kitten Killer '' by a Facebook group started in December 2010 to track down the man responsible for posting a video on YouTube of the kitten deaths .

`` We are patiently waiting for more information on the case and have faith in the Montreal Police , '' the website said Thursday .

`` Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual , who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed . Information gathered by group members was passed onto the authorities in Canada , and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals . ''

Lafreniere said police were aware of the animal allegations .

On what appears to be his own website , Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking .

`` Once and for all I will set the record straight , '' he wrote . `` Many hoax websites are created using my image and name , posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website -LRB- sic -RRB- have , I feel I do n't need to list them specifically but people need not be told , not to believe what they read and to take it as fact . ''

The website has writing in Arabic and Russian and images of Magnotta , half naked and with lips pouted .

Several Canadian newspapers also reported that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka . Lafreniere said he could not confirm any links and that she was not part of the investigation .

Police described him as being 5 feet 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds with black hair and blue eyes .

They said they are asking the public for help in finding Magnotta , after a `` coast-to-coast '' warrant was issued for his arrest . Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he 's apprehended .

`` We need to bring him to justice , '' Lafreniere said .

CNN 's David Ariosto , Jake Carpenter , Paula Newton and Matt Smith contributed to this report .
