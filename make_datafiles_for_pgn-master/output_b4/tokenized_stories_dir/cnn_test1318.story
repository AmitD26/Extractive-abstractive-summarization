-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The killing of 16 unarmed Afghan civilians is , as President Barack Obama has said , heartbreaking . Families have lost children , mothers and fathers in a rampage that has left Afghanistan reeling .

For Afghans it is the latest in a pattern of disrespect and dishonor : the burnings of the Quran that ignited protests , video of U.S. soldiers urinating on Taliban corpses , kill teams in Kandahar .

The horror of the killings offers a public relations victory for the Taliban and leaves Afghans wondering whose side they should be on . Is this the kind of `` peace '' they should believe in and rely on ? Both hearts and minds have been shattered and lost .

And , devastatingly , another casualty of this rampage is the quiet voices of men and women who risk their lives each day to fight for the progress of their country . Human rights activists , midwives , high school principals , doctors , entrepreneurs and young students crowding on to Facebook like kids everywhere else in the world . Their voices pleading for patience and calm are lost in the violence , mistrust and misunderstanding of the last few months .

These warriors for progress are rarely heard in the media , but the jeopardy in which they place themselves is very real : Since 2011 , Kandahar 's mayor was assassinated in his home , the city 's police chief was assassinated and an educator in Logar province was shot and killed for the crime of educating girls . The killings in Kandahar by insurgents are another strike against people who simply want to live in a secure country where they can support their families and send their children to school safely .

The bloodshed thus far in 2012 bolsters those in the United States and Afghanistan who say that a swift international exit from Afghanistan is the only answer . On the other side are those who argue the United States must stay the course militarily .

Stuck in between are the country 's women , who have fought since the Taliban 's departure to strengthen their own rights to go to work and to school and to lead their communities . More than 2 million girls are now in school . Women make up a quarter of the Parliament . And nearly 3,000 midwives go out each day to save women 's lives in a country that Save the Children rated the deadliest for expectant mothers .

Women I speak with feel caught in a political ambush . They enjoy little protection from their own government , they are under fire and constant threat from anti-government insurgents and now troops sent to protect them are contributing to the violence . Women who fear deeply for the erosion of their own rights if the Taliban return are told by some in their community : `` Would you rather have this ? Is this alternative any better ? Is this peace ? '' And their push for progress this past decade is tied by their opponents to an international effort increasingly seen as drenched in disrespect .

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been balancing for political survival on a tightrope between the international community on one side and his country 's most conservative elements on the other . The more peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar become a reality , the further the Karzai administration seems to tilt in favor of the conservatives : Recently , Karzai signed off on a code of conduct for women released by clerics on the Ulema Council that said women should not travel without a male guardian or mix with men in offices or schools .

Women activists say they do not want troops in their country forever . But they worry what the international community will leave behind as it hurries for the exits . Timelines seem to determine events on the ground rather than the other way around .

As parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi told me in the wake of the Quran protests , `` If the international community decides to leave tomorrow , women will be the first victim of the Talibanization of the government . ''

No one is championing endless war in Afghanistan . For Americans , too much national treasure has been spilled and the treasury has been depleted . Drawdown plans leading to 2014 are well under way and will continue to unfold in the coming days . But how the international community gets out matters . And so does what it leaves behind .

We have trapped ourselves in an all-or-nothing conversation . The military alone can not end the war in Afghanistan -- and U.S. military officials are the first to say this .

But after `` drawdown , '' two other `` Ds '' are critical . Diplomacy -- talks about Afghanistan 's future that involve all Afghan sides and regional players and include women . And development dollars -- funds that help local government and civil society keep schools open , clinics functioning and midwives working after 2014 has come and gone .

Already an orphanage I know is facing funding problems as it works to keep boys and girls off streets and out of trouble . A withdrawal of troops should not mean an abandonment of Afghanistan .

This is not simply about American altruism . This is about leaving behind a state stable and secure enough that American forces will never have to go back . Afghan women are not a pet project taken up by the international community . They are a stability indicator whose involvement in their own societies is in the best interest of lasting security . Any agreement that leaves them out will simply be a short-term deal , not a durable peace .

Women 's involvement in their own country 's future is a must-have for the U.S. president to get what he has said he wants : a `` responsible '' end game for America 's longest war .
