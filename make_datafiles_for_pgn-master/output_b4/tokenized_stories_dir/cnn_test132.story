-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lebanon says it deployed troops near its border with Syria Sunday after artillery shells hit a Lebanese border village .

One person was killed after shells from Syria hit the town of Qasr , the Lebanese Army said in a statement .

Several homes were destroyed , and three people were injured , the military said .

`` Subsequently , army units were deployed widely across the area and took measures in the field necessary to protect people and respond to the source of the attack as appropriate , '' the statement said .

The Lebanese military did not release additional details about the incident .

Lebanon 's National News Agency reported that a 13-year-old was killed when rockets from Syria hit the region Sunday .

Lebanese President Michel Suleiman condemned the violence , saying in a statement on his website that rockets had fallen near Qasr 's mosque .

`` These kinds of acts have only resulted in the deaths of innocent Lebanese who have nothing to do with the ongoing conflict taking place outside their country , '' he said .

The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters , partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region , began demonstrating for more freedom .

That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad , who was appointed president by Syria 's parliament in 2000 after his father died . The government responded with a brutal crackdown .

In February , the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people had been killed in the fighting .

At least 124 people were killed in violence throughout Syria on Sunday , the Local Coordination Committees opposition network said .

CNN can not independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria .
