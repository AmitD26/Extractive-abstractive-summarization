-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Basking in the glory of winning back the fabled Ashes from traditional rivals England , Australia 's cricketing fans turned up in world record numbers Boxing Day in Melbourne to see their side continue its domination of the series .

England closed on 226 for six wickets , with only Kevin Pietersen , undefeated on 67 , suggesting they might post a challenging first innings total .

Two late wickets with the second new ball for paceman Mitchell Johnson swung the initiative Australia 's way to leave the majority of the 91,092 crowd at the MCG celebrating .

The attendance broke a previous world best for attendance at a cricket match set 52 years ago in the same vast stadium .

`` In years to come Melburnians will remember Boxing Day 2013 as the day their city created sporting history , '' Cricket Australia 's CEO , James Sutherland , told Cricket Australia 's website .

England 's loyal band of cricket supporters -- nicknamed ` The Barmy Army ' -- also helped boost the figure , but with their team 3-0 down in the best of five-match series they came more in hope than expectation .

Until Johnson 's late first day burst , removing Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow , who had replaced the out-of-form Matt Prior as England 's wicketkeeper , the visitors had held their own , although the scoring rate was pedestrian .

Put in to bat by Australia 's captain Michael Clarke , England made it to lunch for the loss of his counterpart Alastair Cook to Peter Siddle .

Cook 's opening partner Michael Carberry went after the interval , again failing to capitalize on a solid start to be bowled by Shane Watson for 38 .

That brought Pietersen to the wicket and he looked determined to atone for earlier failures in the series , which had led some to question his place in the side .

He enjoyed a slice of luck , hooking a short ball from the excellent Ryan Harris in the direction of substitute fielder Nathan Coulter-Nile , who could only carry the ball over for a six .

On 41 , Harris almost had him again , but George Bailey could not hold a sharp chance at midwicket .

Pietersen found support from Joe Root and Ian Bell , but both departed after starts to Harris , both caught behind by Brad Haddin , the Australia wicketkeeper .

Stokes and Bairstow were unable to cope with the 90mph plus pace of Johnson , a key figure in Australia 's three earlier wins .

It left Pietersen at the wicket with Tim Bresnan and just the England tailenders to come .

Bell , who starred for England in the summer when they beat Australia 3-0 in a home series , still held hope that Pietersen could lift them into a good position on the second day .

`` With Kev not out it 's a good sign for us , '' Bell told Sky Sports .

`` A lot of us got starts and are disappointed not to get scores . We would have liked a few more runs as well , '' he admitted as the pattern of the earlier matches continued .

`` We need big runs and we 've not got them , but if Kev and Bres -LRB- Tim Bresnan -RRB- can hang around , maybe we will get 300 plus and put some pressure on Australia . ''

But with Johnson fired up , Australia will look to quickly remove the remaining England batsmen at the start of the second day and post a big score of their own in their bid to achieve a humiliating series whitewash of their oldest rivals .

Meanwhile in other Test match action Thursday , India reached 181 for one wicket on the first day of the second Test against No. 1 ranked South Africa in Durban .

Indian batsmen Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara were sharing an unbeaten century partnership for the second wicket before bad light stopped play .
