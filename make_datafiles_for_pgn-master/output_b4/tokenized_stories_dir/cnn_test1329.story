When Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates advised President Barack Obama in late April 2011 that sending a Navy SEAL team into Pakistan to capture or kill Osama bin Laden was not worth the various risks that this operation entailed , John Brennan , the president 's top counterterrorism adviser , urged the president to authorize the raid .

It 's that kind of call that has made Brennan the president 's go-to guy since the beginning of Obama 's first term on all matters related to terrorism and has also thrust him into a broader policymaking role in the Middle East and in South Asia .

From his windowless office deep in the bowels of the West Wing a few steps from the Situation Room , Brennan has been at the center of every important decision in the war against al Qaeda .

Brennan is a serious , taciturn man who grew up in New Jersey and attended Fordham University in New York , where at one point he contemplated becoming a priest . Instead , he joined the CIA and spent more than two decades in the shadows , rising to take on important positions such as Bill Clinton 's intelligence briefer and CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia .

Three years after 9/11 , Brennan became the first director of the National Counterterrorism Center , which shapes overall strategy against al Qaeda and its allies across the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community .

After he retired , Brennan went into the private sector , where he played an early role in advising the Obama campaign in the run-up to the 2008 election .

It 's this long history with Obama and his depth of experience in the intelligence community that have made Brennan the president 's pick to run the CIA .

Facing tough questions

On Thursday , Brennan will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee , a milestone on the road to what is shaping up to be a contentious confirmation to be CIA director .

At his confirmation hearing , Brennan will be asked some tough questions about the administration 's policies on CIA drone strikes , policies that he has played a key role in formulating .

Taking even the most conservative estimate of casualties during Brennan 's time as Obama 's top counterterrorism adviser , CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have killed 1,577 people , 143 of whom were identified in credible news reports as civilians , according to a count by the New America Foundation .

Brennan will also likely be asked to discuss the still-classified Senate Intelligence Committee 's three-year investigation into the CIA detainee program and the extent to which coercive interrogations of some of those CIA-held prisoners elicited useful information .

The head of the committee , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , has said that coercive interrogations did not provide key leads in tracking down bin Laden , while a number of retired senior CIA officials have claimed that they did .

Undoubtedly , this discrepancy will be something that the committee will want to delve into with Brennan .

Opinion : Bring drones out of the shadows

Role in the raid

Perhaps more than any other official , he played a key role in what has surely been the Obama administration 's greatest success overseas : tracking bin Laden to an obscure city in Pakistan and then formulating the overall plan that led to the death of al Qaeda 's leader .

In August 2010 , CIA Director Leon Panetta went to the White House to brief the president and a handful of his top national security advisers , including Brennan , that the CIA had a promising lead that suggested bin Laden could be living in a compound in the northern city of Abbottabad .

The case that bin Laden was living there was entirely circumstantial and was based on the fact that residing at the Abbottabad compound was a longtime al Qaeda insider and that he and the other people living in the compound were taking elaborate measures to deceive their neighbors about their identities .

One of the mysterious residents at the compound was a man who never left the compound 's grounds and could be seen by U.S. satellites occasionally taking a quick walk in the garden . He would come to be nicknamed `` the pacer . '' However , the CIA could never get a photograph of the pacer 's face , nor was there any other definitive intelligence that bin Laden was living at the compound .

Brennan , who had spent almost all of his working life at the CIA , met regularly with the analysts working on the bin Laden case . According to senior White House officials , Brennan pushed the analysts to come up with intelligence that disproved the notion that bin Laden was living in the Abbottabad compound , explaining , `` I 'm tired of hearing why everything you say confirms your case . What we need to look for are the things that tell us what 's not right about our theory . So what 's not right about your inferences ? ''

The analysts working on the bin Laden hunt came back to the White House one day and started their intelligence update , saying , `` Looks like there 's a dog on the compound . ''

Denis McDonough , Obama 's then-deputy national security adviser , remembers thinking , `` Oh , that 's a bummer . You know , no self-respecting Muslim 's gon na have a dog . '' -LRB- Many Muslims believe dogs to be `` unclean . '' -RRB-

Brennan , who had spent much of his career focused on the Middle East and speaks Arabic , pointed out that bin Laden , in fact , did have dogs when he was living in Sudan in the mid-1990s . -LRB- Indeed , when al Qaeda 's leader was living in the capital of Khartoum , he had taken an interest in training police dogs . -RRB-

Creation of the `` Red Team ''

In addition to pushing the CIA to refine its analysis of the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad , two weeks before Obama made the final decision to launch the Navy SEAL raid , Brennan authorized the formation of a `` Red Team . '' It was made up of four intelligence analysts who had had no prior role in making the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad .

The role of the Red Team was to see if there were alternative explanations that could explain the `` pattern of life '' of the mysterious residents of the Abbottabad compound . For instance : Could they be the retinue of some drug lord who was keeping a low profile ? Or might they be on the fringes of al Qaeda but unrelated to bin Laden himself ?

On Thursday , April 28 , 2011 , during the final National Security Council meeting to discuss what to do in Abbottabad , the Red Team briefed the president and his top advisers .

One of the Red Team analysts put the odds that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad at 40 % , which was discomfiting to some .

Brennan recalls : `` Some of us thought , ` Whoa ! We thought the prospects were higher that he was in there . ' And the president recognized that when people were saying , ` Well , there 's only 40 % of a chance , ' that some people were going to get a little bit soft on this . ''

Was it too risky ?

The uncertainty that bin Laden was even living in Abbottabad contributed to the advice that Biden and Gates gave Obama during this final National Security Council meeting : Do n't authorize the SEAL team raid . It 's just too risky .

By now , Brennan had come to a very different conclusion .

He had already told the president privately the CIA officials who had developed the intelligence on Abbottabad were `` the people that have been following bin Laden for 15 years . This has been their life 's work , this has been their life 's journey , and they feel it very much in their gut that bin Laden is at that compound . I feel pretty good , if not certain , that bin Laden is at that compound . ''

Brennan urged a go on the raid .

As the SEAL raid unfolded in Abbottabad on May 1 , 2011 , Brennan was as anxious as anyone else in the White House Situation Room : `` Might there be a quick reaction force that bin Laden may have had , security that we did n't know about ? '' he recalled thinking .

The raid , of course , succeeded .

When photos of the dead Osama bin Laden were passed around the Situation Room , Brennan nodded and said , `` It 's bin Laden . ''
