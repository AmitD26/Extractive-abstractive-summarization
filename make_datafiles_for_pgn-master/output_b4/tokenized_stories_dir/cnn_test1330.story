-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jose Mourinho 's Chelsea had the last laugh on London rival West Ham to keep up its relentless pace at the top of the English Premier League with a 2-0 Boxing Day home win .

The pre-match build up had centered on Mourinho 's remarks after the corresponding fixture last season -- when peeved by the West Ham defensive tactics in a 0-0 draw -- he said manager Sam Allardyce and the team had been playing `` football from the 19th century '' -- amid other sharp criticism .

Mourinho backtracked on these remarks and has paid compliment to West Ham 's fine form in the current campaign , in fourth place ahead of the latest round of games , but it did not prevent the Hammers ' official Twitter feed from posting a witty rejoinder before the match .

It featured a tweet with a sepia-colored picture of a horse and cart , accompanied by the caption : `` The West Ham United team coach -LRB- and horse -RRB- has arrived at @chelseafc for today 's game # 19thcenturyfootball '' .

In truth , once the match got underway there was little the visitors could do to stem the tide of almost constant Chelsea attacks , with very little in reply .

Eden Hazard , recovered from the knock he received in the 2-0 win over Stoke Monday , was a strong influence again for the Blues , who went ahead when John Terry reacted quickly to a Diego Costa header from a Cesc Fabregas 's corner .

It was the former England international 's second goal in two games and his team might have been further ahead but for Adrian producing a fine save from Nemanja Matic and top scorer Costa shooting over .

Hazard was nearly on the score sheet early in the second half , but it was the Belgian international who turned provider as he played Costa through to finish clinically for this 13th of the season just after the hour mark .

Further goals might have followed with the table toppers in confident mood , although West Ham came close to cutting the deficit when substitute Morgan Amalfitano hit the post with a shot .

`` We played a very good game against a very difficult opponent . When we scored , we had the game always under control , '' Mourinho told Sky Sports . `` I am really happy . We are doing very well . ''

Later , defending champions Manchester City kept the gap on Chelsea to three points with a fine 3-1 win at West Bromwich Albion , while third-placed Manchester United eased past Newcastle 3-1 , with Wayne Rooney scoring twice .

Southampton won 3-1 at Crystal Palace to leapfrog West Ham into fourth spot , the defeat the last match in charge for home boss Neil Warnock .

He was sacked by the south London club Sunday with Keith Millen coming in as caretaker boss .

Tottenham Hotspur took closer order to the Champions League spots with a 2-1 win at bottom club Leicester .

In the Boxing Day late game , Alexis Sanchez saw his penalty saved by Rob Green then put Arsenal ahead in a 2-1 win over QPR at the Emirates .

The Gunners had Olivier Giroud sent off for a headbutt on Nedum Onuoha , but added a second through Tomas Rosicky . A Charlie Austin penalty reduced the deficit but the 10-man home side hung on as Arsenal went sixth .
