Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Hillary Clinton is a New Yorker . And an Arkansan . And an Illinoisan . And at times also even a Pennsylvanian .

While the question -- Where is Hillary Clinton from ? -- may seem simple , the answer was made harder as Clinton traveled the country over the last six months stumping for Democratic candidates during the midterms and peddling her memoir . People from at least four states like to lay claim to Clinton , and the former secretary of state never shied away from those signs of citizenship .

Born in Park Ridge , Illinois in 1947 , Clinton rose to prominence during her 20-year stay in Arkansas from 1974 to 1992 . After living in Washington , D.C. , for eight years as first lady , Clinton moved to Chappaqua , New York and represented the Empire State for eight years in the Senate .

Geographical identity politics are a core part of the American campaign trail from local offices all the way up Pennsylvania Avenue -- just ask Dick Lugar or Scott Brown -- and having home roots that are considered authentic by voters is a key part of messaging for any presidential hopeful , and that includes Clinton .

At times , she plays up her Arkansas roots and slight southern accent . In other forums , she is the former senator from New York and resident of Chappaqua . And when she is anywhere in the Midwest , Clinton is the Chicago Cubs-loving child from Park Ridge , Illinois .

The Clintons currently maintain their primary residence in New York and another home in Washington , D.C.

Clinton 's returning to one of these `` home '' states this weekend -- Arkansas -- for a 10th anniversary celebration of the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock .

Here is how Clinton is linked to four states -- Illinois , Arkansas , New York and Pennsylvania -- and why it matters .

Illinois :

In Chicago , Clinton is heralded as a native daughter .

Giving her an introduction at an October event in Chicago , Lester Knight said he was `` welcoming her home . '' Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in June that Clinton `` still and will forever be a Chicagoan at heart . ''

Clinton spent her first eighteen years of life in Park Ridge , Illinois , a middle class neighborhood a few miles from downtown .

Clinton , however , left the state in 1965 to attend Wellesley College in Massachusetts and since then has not lived in Illinois for any considerable time .

Clinton maintains a small group of Park Ridge friends to this day . When she visited the city in June , she had a small dinner with many of them and reminisced about their years in at school and in their Methodist church group .

`` It is always great to be back in Chicago , '' Clinton said in October . `` This is where I was born , where I grew up . Where I made so many life long friends and it is wonderful to be part of an extended community such as Chicago represents . ''

Arkansas :

More than any other state , the Clinton family is most closely associated with Arkansas .

Hillary Clinton moved to Fayetteville , Arkansas in 1974 to marry Bill Clinton , a native son of the state and rising political star . For the next 18 years , the Clintons came to dominate the state 's political scene . Bill Clinton served one term as Attorney General before serving five terms as governor .

Hillary Clinton was a high profile first lady in the state , but Arkansas was never really home for her . Even her closest friends acknowledge that Hillary was never in love with Arkansas and was at times put off by how women were viewed .

Hillary Clinton does , however , occasionally returns to the state , as she did when she spoke at two Little Rock events in July . And longtime Democrats in the state still lay claim to the former first lady .

`` Hillary Clinton 's roots in Arkansas run deep , and many Arkansans still consider her their hometown girl , '' said Adrienne Elrod , a former Clinton aide from Arkansas . `` As a native Arkansan , I could not be more proud to call her one of us . ''

New York :

When Hillary Clinton decided to run for Senate in 2000 , she had no connection to New York . And Republicans knew it was a weakness .

`` Name me three things Hillary Clinton has ever done for the people of New York , '' Sean Hannity , then a New York radio host , proclaimed regularly during his show at the time .

Aware of the challenges , Clinton traveled the state on a `` listening tour '' and talked with voters in schools , labor halls and community buildings . She also established residency in the Empire State by moving to Chappaqua , the small hamlet that the Clintons still consider home today .

`` I think I have some real work to do , to get out and listen and learn from the people of New York and demonstrate that what I 'm for is maybe as important , if not more important , than where I 'm from , '' Clinton told the New York Times in 1999 .

Clinton even played up her sporting allegiances to become closer to New York .

`` I am Cubs fan , '' she told an audience in Chicago before noting that because she `` could n't stay hitched with a losing team '' she `` became a Yankees fan . ''

Clinton 's supporters argue she was a Yankees fan as a child and photos from 1992 published in her 2003 memoir `` Living History '' show the first lady in a New York hat .

`` I 'm wearing the hat of my lifelong favorite American League team , '' says the description under the photo .

Today , Clinton identifies most with New York . She lives there , votes there and her office is in Manhattan .

Pennsylvania :

Of the states that have laid claim to Clinton , Pennsylvania is the most random .

Clinton 's father -- Hugh Rodham -- was born in Scranton , a city in the Northeast corner of the state . The Rodham family has deep ties to the region and even after moving to Chicago , Hillary and her family would spend summers at a rustic cabin on Lake Winola on the city 's outskirts . -LRB- If Scranton sounds familiar , that 's because it 's also from where another potential 2016 Democratic hopeful Vice President Joe Biden . -RRB-

`` The rustic cabin had no heat except for the cast-iron cook stove in the kitchen , and no indoor bath or shower , '' Clinton wrote in her memoir `` Living History . '' `` To stay clean , we swam in the lake or stood below the back porch while someone poured a tub of water onto our heads . ''

So when Clinton campaigned for Pennsylvania Democrats in 2014 , many used those roots to tie her with the state .

Tom Wolf , the governor-elect of the state , said , `` coursing through -LSB- Hillary Clinton 's -RSB- veins is blood that 's tinged with Pennsylvania values and Pennsylvania ideas . ''

At the event , Clinton also played up those roots and talked about her father 's side of the family , their interest in politics and her time on the lake .

`` I spent every summer of my growing up years traveling on the turnpike going up to Scranton and often times during Christmas coming back , '' Clinton said . `` The state has been very good to my family and to my husband and to me . ''

Clinton 's ties to the state also came in handy when Clinton ran for president in 2008 . Because Clinton was able to better identify with the hard scrabble , predominately white Democrats of central and North East Pennsylvania , she won the state 's primary .

`` She 's tough , '' Christopher Doherty , Scranton 's mayor at the time told the New York Times . `` That 's a real Scranton trait . ''
