The man on the voicemail is flirty and clearly asking for a date . But it 's the name on the message that 's raising red flags .

`` Hi , it 's your newly favorite congressman , Bob Filner . You know , the one who fell in love with you at your last speech , '' he told Eldonna Fernandez .

He also asked her out to dinner in the message .

`` I do n't want to wait 'til you come back to have dinner with you , '' he said .

That message was left a year ago , while Filner was serving his 10th term as a U.S. congressman . He had met Fernandez at a National Women 's Veterans Association of America `` Healing and Hiring Fair . ''

When Fernandez got the message , she immediately deleted it . But when sexual harassment allegations against the now-San Diego mayor began to surface a few weeks ago , she remembered the `` creepy '' message and was surprised to find it still sitting in her iPhone 's voicemail trash .

`` Ugh . It creeps me out , it creeps me out , '' Fernandez said . `` The guy 's got problems . ''

But the unwanted voicemail is n't the real problem for Fernandez . It 's where and to whom he made inappropriate advances .

Dogged by sex scandal , Filner to enter counseling

Fernandez , along with Army veteran Gerri Tindley , joins 11 other women who have publicly accused Filner , 70 , of making unwanted advances , from groping to verbal passes .

They are also among at least eight female veterans and members of the National Women 's Veterans Association of America -LRB- NWVAA -RRB- in San Diego who have made accusations against the mayor . Almost all of the women say they were victims of sexual assault while they were in the military .

The women , like Fernandez , say the former chairman of the House Veterans ' Affairs Committee used his significant power and credentials to access military sexual assault survivors , who they say are less likely to complain .

Fernandez is a retired master sergeant from the Air Force . She served 23 years in the United States and was deployed to the Middle East after 9/11 .

Secrets that women of San Diego no longer keep about its mayor

She said she was raped three times during her service . Like many victims of military sexual assault and rape , she suffered in silence , believing the system would never support her .

In civilian life , Fernandez now speaks openly about her assaults and is an active member of the NWVAA , which supports victims of military sexual assault .

Fernandez was speaking at an NWVAA event in August 2012 when she exchanged business cards with Filner .

`` He looks at my card . He looks at me . He says , ` Fernandez . Are you married ? Do you have a husband ? ' Very quick , very direct . I said , ` No , I 'm divorced . ' ` Well , you 're beautiful , and I ca n't take my eyes off you , and I want to take you to dinner . ' I was really shocked and I was like , ` Uh , OK , ' '' Fernandez said .

Then came the phone call and voicemail , which Fernandez never returned .

Another veteran : Filner was rubbing me

At the same NWVAA event where Fernandez spoke , Army vet Tindley gave a speech about her violent rape , which she said happened during her eight years of service . She bore a son from the sexual assault .

Filner , who was running for mayor of San Diego at the time , was also scheduled to speak . In the green room , he asked Tindley about her rape .

`` He got as close as he could to me . His jacket was touching my jacket , '' Tindley said . `` I was bent down . He was bent down with me , rubbing like he cared , like he was consoling me . ''

Tindley said she felt uncomfortable as Filner moved closer and closer . So close , she said , that she nearly fell off the couch trying to move away from him .

`` I felt very weird , '' she said .

When asked if she said anything , Tindley replied , `` What am I gon na say ? You 're a congressman . What am I gon na say to you ? What am I gon na say to his man ? Can he destroy my life , can he stop me from moving forward ? ''

Lawyer : Mayor never got harassment training

A series of complaints

Three weeks ago , as women began to step forward to reveal instances of sexual harassment , the veterans at the NWVAA began to compare notes .

Tara Jones , the president of the group , said she 's spoken to seven to eight women who had varying encounters with Filner at the women 's veteran events , from groping to unwanted requests for dates .

`` He went to dinners , asked women out to dinners , grabbed breasts , buttocks . The full gamut . Everything that is complete violation of what we stand for , '' Jones said . `` He 's a sexual predator . And he used this organization for his own personal agenda . ''

Jones , who says she was raped while she was in the Navy , formed the NWVAA as a safe haven for military sexual assault victims . She invited Filner into her group , lavishing praise on his service to veterans while he was a congressman in Washington . She even stumped for him as he campaigned to be San Diego 's mayor .

Jones remembers Filner 's speeches , where he has often called for a zero tolerance of sexual abuse in the armed forces . She said she feels not only outrage but also a deep and familiar sense of being victimized by a man of power .

`` He preyed upon people who were vulnerable , who he knew nine times out of 10 would not speak up , that did n't have enough strength in them to speak up , '' she said . `` It 's not OK . You need to not be in office . You need to be out of office . You need to not have the ability to prey on others . ''

That 's a sentiment that Fernandez shares .

`` We 're all victims of military sexual assault . It appears to me that he was targeting the organization and hitting on the women of this organization because they were easy prey , '' Fernandez said . `` He 's part of an organization that 's against sexual assault and sexual violence against women and sexual harassment . And he 's doing the very thing that we are fighting to make stop in our service and in our country . ''

Tindley questioned why Filner was in public office .

`` How can you be a representative , take an oath , and be a predator ? Do you know how damaging that is for women who are truly victims of military sexual trauma or rape in general ? Who can we trust to help us ? '' she asked .

Filner checked into a two-week therapy program Monday to help him deal with his behavior . Calls to his spokeswoman were unreturned .

Lee Burdick , Filner 's chief of staff , dodged CNN 's questions and would not answer to the latest allegations from the female veterans .

Filner 's attorney Harvey Berger had no comment .
