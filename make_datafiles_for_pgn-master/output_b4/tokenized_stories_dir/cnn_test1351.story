Being a highly productive , contributing member of society demands effort and commitment . It requires sacrifice and a passion for teamwork .

Basically , I 'm not interested .

On the other hand , I 'm wildly enthusiastic about napping . Which does literally nothing for the betterment of the world , unless you take solace in the fact that at least I 'm not walking around touching things .

But I really do enjoy my regularly scheduled naps . So much so , in fact , that my close friends know not to call between 2 and 4 p.m. on the weekends . The `` baby '' is sleeping .

And that 's why I was rather excited this week to discover all the social media buzz over the amazing new Ostrich Pillow . Essentially , it 's a soft , padded tube in which you can bury your entire head to take a nap , so long as you do n't mind burying your entire head in a soft , padded tube . Of course , there 's really no way you should already know whether this is something you like .

`` What ? You have n't tried ? ''

The creators actually call it a microenvironment , but I think that sounds a little too much like they 're describing the inside of my colon . Which is a little unsettling . You know , as opposed to a soft ... padded ... tube . OK , so it 's pretty much the same thing .

Regardless , I did some serious soul searching -- I pictured myself wearing it in public situations like at an airport or a bris -- and decided that , yes , I 'm totally down for living in this tube . It 's so stupendous !

Seriously . It really is . And as a bonus , in addition to the small face opening for breathing , the hand holes at the top kind of make you look like Admiral Ackbar from `` Star Wars . ''

`` It 's a nap ! ''

The Ostrich Pillow was conceptualized by the European design duo kawamura-ganjavian , who wanted to find a creative way to provide people with the health and productivity benefits commonly associated with power napping . Power napping is a lot like normal napping , only when you 're done with a power nap , you 're expected to actually do stuff .

When you wake up from a normal nap , it 's completely OK to glance around the room , confirm that John Hodgman riding a unicorn was just an amazing dream , and then roll over to fall back asleep .

But the Ostrich Pillow is specifically designed for those shorter periods of rest -- the power naps -- and the creators boast that their invention allows you to sleep anytime , anywhere by creating a `` little private space within a public one , to relax and unwind . ''

Right now , the product is in the middle of a one-month run on the crowd-funding website Kickstarter , where the creators were hoping to raise $ 70,000 to get the project off the ground . The current haul is more than $ 130,000 . Which according to my calculations is ... more .

Perhaps this says a lot about people 's attitudes toward napping and the importance of taking a little siesta during the busy workday . The official sales pitch for the Ostrich Pillow even claims that a 20-minute power nap can increase productivity by 37 % .

Amazing ! I can only dream of all the things I would get done at the office if I actually worked at 37 % productivity . And to think , all I need is a quick nap as soon as I get to my desk .

`` Let 's start the morning meeting . Where 's Bellini ? ''

`` Wearing his tube , mentally preparing to give us slightly less than 50 % . ''

By and large , the Ostrich Pillow seems like a great idea . It 's dark . It 's cozy . It has a place for your hands . But the big question is whether people will actually wear it in public . And we really ca n't say yes or no based on what I would do , since a better assessment would come from somebody who actually has the ability to feel shame .

Nevertheless , I 'm still hoping to get my hands on one of these to give it a proper test drive . But , until then , if you need me , I 'll be sleeping under my desk .

`` Let 's start the morning meeting . Where 's Bellini ? ''

`` Who cares . ''
