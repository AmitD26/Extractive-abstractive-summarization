The UK has become one of the latest Western countries to enter the coalition fighting ISIS , with Parliament voting Friday to endorse British military engagement in Iraq through airstrikes .

The vote came shortly after Prime Minister David Cameron 's speech during the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday , in which he emphasized the threat posed by ISIS to the UK and endorsed military action based on `` careful preparation '' while saying `` no to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan . ''

In doing so , the UK appears to want to redeem itself after the blunders of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 . Yet entering the conflict through airstrikes in Iraq is in itself an indication of the lack of a clear plan on part of the UK in particular and the anti-ISIS coalition as a whole . As it currently stands , the coalition 's plan carries a high risk of backfiring .

The UK is basing its involvement in Iraq on the legitimacy granted by the democratically elected Iraqi government 's request for international intervention to aid it in fighting ISIS , a scenario that can not be duplicated in Syria .

But ISIS has set roots in both Syria and Iraq , and has erased the border between the two countries in areas under its control . To limit any action against ISIS , whether military or otherwise , to Iraq alone is therefore meaningless .

Focusing on airstrikes as a key method of military engagement is also ineffective . ISIS knew very well that no Western country would want to commit boots on the ground in Syria or Iraq , and prepared to defend itself accordingly .

Before the coalition 's campaign began , ISIS bases in Raqqa and elsewhere were evacuated and the group 's members went underground . The raids that have been conducted to date have led to little actual damage to ISIS ' military capability , according to one of my informants on the ground there . If anything , they have played right into the hands of its strategy .

This strategy is based on engaging in a defensive , asymmetrical war , which , as the examples of Hamas and Hezbollah have shown , is a good bet for militant groups with limited capabilities confronting larger conventional armies .

ISIS also invited military action against it in order to legitimize its narrative of fighting a war against `` crusades . '' This narrative has now been strengthened , especially with many of those killed during the strikes being civilians . The more civilians die , the higher the resentment against the coalition , and the more attractive ISIS becomes to potential recruits .

Airstrikes will not sever people 's ties with ISIS . The attraction of ISIS to its recruits is not merely ideological . It is based on seeking revenge for economic , social , and political grievances as well as the pursuit of power and money , but also a sense of belonging to a grand project , which is the establishment of a Caliphate .

Now that a Caliphate has been declared , even in rudimentary form , the most airstrikes can achieve is the containment of ISIS through limiting its ability to expand geographically , but not its eradication .

Without a political and economic plan tackling the motivations driving ISIS sympathizers within Syria and Iraq and globally , limited military action will keep ISIS alive and open the door to retaliation . With an increasing number of ISIS jihadists hailing from the UK , British involvement in the air raid campaign translates into increased threat to UK security . The risk of retaliation extends to all countries involved in the anti-ISIS coalition .

Although the anti-ISIS coalition has been crystalizing for some time , what it 's pursuing is far from a carefully planned strategy . In addition to the risks highlighted above , a glaring gap is a political strategy for Syria that would prevent the country from descending into the kind of chaos witnessed in Libya . Also absent is a regional security strategy for neighboring countries like Jordan and the Gulf states , which have entered the coalition nervously and are worried about their own stability now that they are in direct confrontation with ISIS .

There were several measures -- from diplomatic pressure to strengthening the Syrian opposition adequately -- that the international community could have taken two years ago , that would have prevented the Syrian crisis from escalating to the alarming level witnessed today .

Military action as currently planned would have been much more effective back when ISIS was still in its infancy . Now that military action is a reality , instead of merely jumping on the bandwagon , the UK should use its position as a major European country and a key ally of the United States to push the coalition towards formulating a long-term strategy that is indeed comprehensive and that offers a realistic plan for what happens in Syria and Iraq the day after ISIS is eradicated . This would bolster the UK 's international standing , better secure coalition countries , as well as prevent the coalition from repeating the mistakes of the past .
