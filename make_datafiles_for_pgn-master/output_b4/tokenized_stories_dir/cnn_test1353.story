A voice on the intercom woke Danielle Miller and told her to put on her life jacket and run to a deck . Not knowing what the emergency was , she nervously woke up her roommate and did just that .

The emergency , as she and other passengers would learn , was a fire that started in the rear of Royal Caribbean 's Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship about 2:50 a.m. Monday while it was heading to the Bahamas , sending guests to the decks under the night sky .

Though it never lost power , the ship was diverted to Freeport in the Bahamas , and the fire , which began in a mooring area , was extinguished just before 5 a.m. , the company said .

The ship 's 2,224 guests and 796 crew members initially were headed to CocoCay , Bahamas , but the ship was redirected to Freeport for evaluation , Royal Caribbean said .

Miller said it was a scary race topside .

`` We probably ran up to that deck faster than we ever ran before , '' Miller said by phone from Freeport on Monday afternoon , a few hours after the ship docked . `` We were terrified , though , and a lot of people were just crying and freaking out . ''

Two guests were treated after fainting , and medical staff also responded to reports of high blood pressure and an ankle sprain , Royal Caribbean said .

Five things we 've learned about cruising

Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Cynthia Martinez said she did n't have further information about the medical reports , `` but the ship has told us that there are no medical emergencies onboard . ''

The fire started on an aft mooring deck and spread to the fourth deck at the crew lounge area before it was extinguished , U.S. Coast Guard spokeswoman Marilyn Fajardo said . Information on the fire 's cause was n't available , she said .

Miller and the rest of the passengers will be flying home from Freeport because the company canceled the rest of the voyage Monday afternoon .

Royal Caribbean said it was arranging flights to get passengers back to Baltimore , where the ship left port on Friday on a seven-night cruise . The first flight carrying cruise guests from the Bahamas left Tuesday morning , and flights will continue throughout the day , Royal Caribbean said .

All passengers will receive refunds for this cruise and a certificate toward a future cruise , Royal Caribbean said .

The company apologized for the stress to passengers and thanked them for their `` patience and cooperation in dealing with this unfortunate situation . ''

After a bad cruise , can you cruise into court ?

Cruise goers will miss scheduled port calls at CocoCay and Nassau in the Bahamas . CocoCay is Royal Caribbean 's `` private island paradise '' in the Bahamas , according to its website .

Video captured by Miller and her friend , Katie Coleman , shows guests gathered on a deck , seemingly calm , wearing orange life jackets and listening to instructions .

`` We 're on deck right now , 3 a.m. , in our life jackets . Not a drill , not a joke , '' a narrator in Miller 's video says .

The ship arrived at Freeport about 10:15 a.m. , Royal Caribbean said . Throughout , the power , propulsion and communications systems were uninterrupted , the company said .

Cruise passengers get bill of rights

`` In an abundance of caution , the captain deemed it necessary to muster all guests at their assembly stations during the incident , '' the company said in a news release . Everyone aboard was accounted for , and guests have been allowed to return to most staterooms and public areas , it said .

The company 's president and CEO , Adam Goldstein , and other officials with Miami-based Royal Caribbean headed to Freeport on Monday morning to meet guests , she said .

Two U.S. Coast Guard cutters escorted the Bahamian-flagged cruise ship to Freeport , the Coast Guard said . The service said that it , the National Transportation Safety Board and Bahamian officials would conduct a joint investigation to determine the fire 's cause .

Miller said she did n't know initially why guests were being gathered on deck .

`` Before we went to bed , there was a pretty bad storm , and the ship was really rocking , so our first thought was that we were sinking , because they said ` life jackets ' and run , '' Miller said . `` We got up to the deck , and we see the lifeboats being lowered down . ... We did n't know what was going on for about a half-hour , when they made an announcement that there was a fire . ''

Spate of fires poses problems for cruise industry

She said the crew handled the situation well .

`` Even though it was terrifying , they tried their best to make everyone comfortable . They 're so well-trained that I felt confident that we would be OK , '' she said .

The 916-foot-long ship was launched in December 1996 and refurbished in May 2012 , the company said .

Several cruise ship incidents have made headlines in the past year and a half .

In January 2012 , 32 people died when the Costa Concordia capsized off Italy 's coast .

In February this year , an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph adrift in the Gulf of Mexico , with passengers reporting overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship .

In March , the Carnival Dream cut short a Caribbean cruise , with Carnival reporting that the ship 's emergency generator failed . And this month , authorities say , a man and a woman on the Carnival Spirit went overboard off Australia 's coast ; they are presumed dead .
