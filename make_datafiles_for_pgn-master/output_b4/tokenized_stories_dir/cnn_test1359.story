-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I recently met a woman , the mother of three black teenagers . She told me that after the Trayvon Martin shooting , she forbade her boys to wear hoodies . She warned them never to walk around with their hands in their pockets . She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed .

This is one hell of a thing to be afraid of . I do n't think parents of white kids ever really feel this terror -- not in this way .

I defended the man who shot Trayvon Martin , and I believe that the verdict the jury returned was correct and just . But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years , I know her fears are not without foundation . The shooting of Michael Brown -- an unarmed 18-year-old African-American in Ferguson , Missouri -- reinforces her fears , and it gives me a dull , empty feeling in my gut .

We 're hearing conflicting stories about how the Brown shooting happened . Some witnesses say the teenager had his hands up in surrender when an officer opened fire on him . The Ferguson police chief says the officer was attacked in his cruiser , and the first shot was fired inside the car . It 's possible both accounts are true , but we do n't know .

Here 's what we do know : A police officer and a black man interacted , multiple shots were fired , and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him . Soon we should know how many times the officer shot Brown , from how far and from what direction . These factors will be critically important in determining whether the shooting was justified or not . Black or white , an officer must be in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm before using deadly force , just like the rest of us .

What we know about Michael Brown 's shooting

If Brown was shot from far away , or if he was shot in the back , it would provide strong evidence that he was retreating -- that the officer was not in imminent fear -- and that the shooting was not justified . What we must acknowledge is that we do n't yet know enough to be convinced one way or the other .

Now there are cries of `` no justice , no peace '' as evening vigils turn violent , with rioting and looting . `` Justice , '' it seems in this context , can only be found if the officer is convicted of murder . If facts show the shooting to be justifiable , it will not be seen as justice by those making the demands .

Whether my client is black , white , Latino or something else , here is how I want justice defined : Two sides , well-represented , present their cases in an adversarial system ; the law is followed and a just result is inevitable . Brown 's case will have the added benefit that it will be tried in the ever-watchful view of intense public scrutiny .

Citing death threats , police wo n't identify officer in Michael Brown shooting

For many in the black community the reality of the criminal justice system does n't measure up to the ideal . Many believe that the criminal justice system , from first police interaction to verdict , is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined . I have long argued in court that such a bias exists ; that probable cause did n't exist for this car stop ; that hanging on a street corner or sitting on a stoop is not loitering ; that `` attitude '' is not resisting without violence .

While the bias does exist , it 's not simply a black and white issue . It 's rare to find an overtly racist cop , or an overtly racist judge . The bias is nuanced ; it 's woven into the system , and it builds with each interaction with the system until , at last , it results in unequal justice .

Consider the very first interactions : A cop and young black male interact on the street , and both give the other a bit of attitude . The officer gives some attitude because he 's tired of getting attitude from other young men , and the young man gives some attitude because he 's tired of getting attitude from other cops . Now , who 's at fault ?

This , as simple as it sounds , is how it starts . Once the infection begins , it grows quickly . If you want to say the cop 's at fault because he 's the adult with training , you are right . And if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop 's authority , you are right .

Missouri teen shot by police was two days away from starting college

If both sides refuse to move toward the middle , we will all just keep going down this path , and another black family will plan another funeral . Or we can agree that we , each of us , will be better off accepting responsibility for an infection that we can not defeat individually .

Who makes the first step ? The police must . Many police agencies have community outreach programs that are successful . Police officers are in the position of authority , and they have the power to send a message that when they serve a community , they serve all the people of the community equally , regardless of race . To break this cycle , police must recognize there is bias in the system , and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect .

In return , we must recognize the risks law enforcement officers take to protect our communities . We must respect their authority . And we must understand the grave reality that the way we engage a police officer can affect whether we walk away , whether we are driven away in handcuffs , or whether we are taken away on a stretcher . This is true for people of every race , from every community -- and unfortunately , with the current bias , it may more true for some of us than for others .

For those who say that talking about this now is an insensitive way to blame Michael Brown for his own death , nothing could be further from the truth . No matter what turns out to have happened that Saturday afternoon , Brown was killed by the infection , by this insidious cycle . Let 's see what we can accomplish if we focus on breaking that cycle .
