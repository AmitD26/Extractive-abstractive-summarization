-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Nichelle Nichols has spent her whole life going where no one has gone before , and at 81 she 's still as sassy and straight-talking as you 'd expect from an interstellar explorer .

`` I do n't have enough sense to keep my mouth shut , '' says the legendary Star Trek actor with a hearty laugh . `` Whatever comes up , comes out . ''

`` I ca n't help myself . ''

As the startlingly beautiful and fiercely intelligent Lt. Uhura on the hit 1960s TV series , Nichols was a revolutionary figure at a time when the only African-American women you saw on U.S. TV were usually playing servants .

Indeed , Star Trek was reportedly the only program Martin Luther King Jr would let his children stay up late to watch .

When Nichols was considering leaving the show to pursue a career on Broadway , King Jr personally implored her to stay , saying she was a powerful role model for black people across the country -- and the world .

`` That was the greatest thing , '' says Nichols . `` That was greater than anything else , to be told that by Dr. Martin Lurther King , because he was my leader .

`` So I stayed and I never regretted it . ''

NASA ambassador

As the original series drew to a close at the end of the decade , a real-life space race was gathering pace -- and this time it was Nichols calling for auditions .

The United States landed a man on the moon in 1969 -- but our astronauts need n't be limited to white males , said Nichols .

`` There were no women , and there were no minorities in the space program -- and that 's supposed to represent the whole country ? '' she says , her voice rising incredulously down the phone from her home in Woodland Hills , California .

`` Not in this day and age . We just absolutely can not have that . I ca n't be a part of that , '' she said at the time .

The glamorous sci-fi celebrity was soon enlisted by NASA to recruit the country 's first female and ethnic minority astronauts .

She traveled the length and breadth of the United States calling for promising astronauts to come forward -- among them was Sally Ride , the first American woman in space , and Charles Bolden , the current NASA administrator .

`` As a matter of fact , Sally called me to tell me that I was the way she had heard about the space program , '' says Nichols .

`` I was somewhat of a celebrity in their eyes . I had gone on television and in several interviews spoke of why they should get involved , and they took it up and said ` she 's absolutely right . ' ''

The kiss

Nichols was n't just a TV celebrity -- she was a TV revolutionary , locking lips with William Shatner in one of the small screen 's first interracial kisses , in 1968 .

Though at the time , she did n't quite see what all the fuss was about .

`` I come from an interracial family , and so it was kind of boring for me to be talking about something I experienced every day , '' she says . `` It was not new to me , because I lived it .

`` But I realized it was new on TV , and I had the opportunity to bring it to the world . ''

The scene -- in which Lt. Uhura and Captain Kirk are controlled by humanoids who force them to embrace -- received a huge response from the public , largely positive .

Society today has much to learn from the crew living on board the `` Enterprise '' in the 23rd century , says Nichols .

`` Star Trek is about the freedom to be who you are , and be respected for who you are , '' she says , her warm native Illinois accent raspy round the edges .

`` It demands that you respect everyone else equally . It 's as simple as that . ''

Stars in her eyes

Born in the small town of Robbins , outside Chicago , in 1932 , Nichols came from a family that defied convention .

Her grandfather was a white Southerner who married a black woman , and in doing so was ostracized by his wealthy parents . Nichols ' father was a factory worker who also served as town mayor .

A talented dancer and singer , Nichols started performing Chicago clubs at 14 , meeting one jazz legend who would change her life forever -- Duke Ellington .

`` He was the greatest name in music , black or white or any other thing , '' says Nichols . `` Everyone at every level had the greatest respect for him . ''

She later toured with the successful composer , despite other people 's reservations about what was expected of schoolgirls at the time .

`` You went to school and it was like ` girls did n't do that . ' But I was like ` c'mon . ' So I just jumped on this opportunity with both feet , '' she says .

Enduring wonder of space

As a child , Nichols was also told that `` girls were n't supposed to like science '' -- not that she took much notice .

`` Science is not a boy 's game , it 's not a girl 's game . It 's everyone 's game . It 's about where we are and where we 're going , '' she says , and you can almost picture the serene figure of Lt. Uhura in red uniform , speaking at the controls .

`` Space travel benefits us here on Earth . And we ai n't stopped yet . There 's more exploration to come . ''

It seems Star Trek 's legendary communications officer has a real-life message for us all .
