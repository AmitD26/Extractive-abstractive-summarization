-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One goal in eight matches for new club Liverpool , and dumped by the Italian national team .

Perhaps the man known as `` Super '' Mario Balotelli is n't feeling quite so super at present .

Offloaded by Italian giants AC Milan prior to the start of the season , the 24-year-old is already onto the fourth high-profile club of his fledgling career .

And until the striker , painted as a maverick and a trouble maker in the press , proves he can ' `` carry '' a club , his enormous potential may go unfulfilled , according to Milan director Umberto Gandini .

`` Probably Mario has not made the transition yet from being just a fantastic athlete to a great player , '' Gandini told CNN of one of the most talked about players in world football .

`` The expectation was probably bigger -LRB- at AC Milan -RRB- , and I think also his expectations , and he has not reached the status yet where he can carry the club .

`` Until he will do that he wo n't be able to fulfill his promises . ''

Balotelli has struggled to adapt to life back in the English Premier League , scoring just one goal in eight matches for Liverpool since his $ 25 million move in August .

Even his new manager Brendan Rodgers admitted signing the former Inter forward was a `` calculated risk '' given his checkered past , saying the player himself knows this is probably his last chance .

Not helping him is the shadow of the man he replaced on Merseyside -- Luis Suarez , now at Spanish club Barcelona .

The Uruguayan achieved cult status at the club , scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances , and 31 times last season as the Reds came agonizingly close to a first Premier League title since 1990 .

And while there are similarities in the way the pair have courted controversy in the past , Balotelli is yet to offered any hint of the potency that punctuated Suarez 's stay at the club .

He is yet to get off the mark in the Premier League and whether he will play alongside Daniel Sturridge on Sunday against QPR , the England striker having returned to fitness , remains to be seen .

Tales of Balotelli 's private life dominated his last stint in England and Milan president Silvio Berlusconi , the former Italian prime minister , this week said the striker was signed against his advice , calling him a `` bad apple . ''

But that is at odds with Gandini 's assessment -- that Balotelli is far more professional than he is portrayed -- though he does acknowledge the player is energized by conflict .

`` He is much , much better than he is portrayed and his lifestyle was much better than portrayed in England , '' Gandini added . `` He is a fantastic kid , he is humble , and recognizes a lot of values that football has given to him , and life in general .

`` I think he loves the fight . He loves to fight with something or somebody -- on the pitch , in life . He 's always trying to take the stance .
