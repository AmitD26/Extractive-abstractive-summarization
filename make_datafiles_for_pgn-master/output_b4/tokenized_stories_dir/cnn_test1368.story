The 43 Mexican students who disappeared in southern Mexico in September were abducted by police on order of a local mayor , and are believed to have been turned over to a gang that killed them and burned their bodies before throwing some remains in a river , the nation 's attorney general said Friday .

This is the conclusion that investigators have reached , Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said , though he cautioned that it can not be known with certainty until DNA tests confirm the identities .

This will be a challenge , he said , as the badly burned fragments make it difficult to extract DNA .

`` I have to identify , to do everything in my power , to identify , to know if these were the students , '' Murillo said .

Parents of the college students reacted immediately , some saying the evidence is inconclusive and insisting that their children are alive .

`` We are not going to believe anything until the experts tell us : You know what ? It is them , '' Mario Cesar Gonzalez , the father of one of the students , told CNN en Español .

Another parent , Isrrael Galindo , said the government is getting ahead of itself in an attempt to get protests over the disappearance of the students to stop and the public to stop demanding answers .

`` The government is trying to resolve things its way so that to rid itself of this great problem it is facing , '' Galindo , who lives in California but whose wife and children are in Mexico , told CNN en Español .

`` My son is alive . My son is alive . My son is alive , '' he repeated .

The parents have been highly critical of President Enrique Peña Nieto for his administration 's handling of the investigation .

A cell phone video from a closed-door meeting with the President , released on YouTube , shows family members accusing Peña Nieto of being out of touch with who the students are . One family member on the recording suggests the President should resign if he ca n't deliver answers .

Describing the federal investigation as one of the most complex in recent times , Murillo outlined what he said befell the students from a rural teacher 's college in Ayotzinapa , Guerrero state .

Police linked to disappearance

The victims were men mostly in their 20s studying to become teachers at a college in rural Ayotzinapa . On September 26 , they traveled on buses and vans to nearby Iguala for a protest about lack of funding for their school . They have n't been seen or heard from since .

Three men arrested in connection with the disappearance of the students admitted to having killed a large number of people believed to be the students , Murillo said .

Murillo said police officers handed the victims to the three men , who he said belong to the Guerreros Unidos gang .

Authorities have arrested Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca , called the `` probable mastermind '' in the mass abduction , and his wife , Maria de los Angeles Pineda . They were captured while hiding out in Mexico City earlier this week .

The school the missing students belong to has a history that dates back more than 80 years and is known as a bastion of the Mexican left . Its students are known for their activism .

Officials have said that when the mayor and his wife learned the students ' protest would disrupt one of his events , the mayor ordered then-Iguala police Chief Felipe Flores Velasquez to stop the demonstration . The former police chief remains a fugitive .

Shortly after Murillo announced the latest in the investigation , President Peña Nieto said the findings `` outrage and offend all of Mexican society . ''

`` With firm determination , the government will continue the efforts for a full accounting of the incident , '' Peña Nieto said . `` The capture of those who ordered it is n't enough ; we will arrest everyone who participated in these abominable crimes . ''

So far , 74 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of the students , the government said .

Officials : Men burned at dump

Murillo on Friday repeated the claim that the order to abduct the students came from the mayor . The police confronted the students twice on their journey , killing three in one confrontation , and forcibly taking all of them to a police station the second time , the attorney general said .

The students were then moved to a location where they were handed over to members of the Guerreros Unidos gang , he said .

The gang members transported the students in various trucks to a garbage dump , Murillo said .

Some were dead already , and those who were alive were questioned by gang members about their alleged involvement with other gangs , Murillo said .

There is no evidence to show that the students were involved with gangs , he said .

The attorney general identified the three gang members who confessed as Patricio Reyes Landa , Jhonatan Osorio Gomez and Agustin Garcia Reyes .

The suspects told police they do n't remember exactly how many people they killed , but they were told by their leaders that there were more than 40 , Murillo said .

The abducted men were then burned at the dump in a fire that was kept alive for at least 14 hours by adding diesel fuel , tires and debris , the attorney general said .

The next day , the gang members were ordered to further break up the remains and place them in black garbage bags that were tossed into the San Juan River , Murillo said .

Scuba divers searched the river and found pieces of the bags and remains . One bag was found intact , with human remains inside , the attorney general said .

`` I know the huge pain this information gives the families , a pain that we all share in solidarity , '' Murillo said .

The Iguala incident has sparked protests all across Mexico , some of them violent . There have been multiple acts of vandalism in Guerrero state . Protesters have blocked roads and tollbooths in cities like Chilpancingo , the capital . They have also blocked access to shopping malls in the beach resort of Acapulco .

The protests spread to the capital , where tens of thousands marched this week demanding that the missing students be found alive .

The governor of Guerrero state -- criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions -- has taken a leave of absence .
