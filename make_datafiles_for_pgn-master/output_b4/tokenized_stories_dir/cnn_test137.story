-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A late Sergio Ramos goal earned Real Madrid a 2-1 win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Saturday as the La Liga leaders slumped to a second consecutive El Clasico defeat .

Five days after being dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Jose Mourinho 's side , the Catalan club were once again forced to play second fiddle to their archrivals .

Karim Benzema put the hosts ahead in the sixth minute , slotting home after Alvaro Morata had crossed from the left before Barca equalized 12 minutes later -- Lionel Messi collecting his 18th goal against Real Madrid and his 50th of the season .

Cristiano Ronaldo came on as a sub in the second half and livened up proceedings , but it was Sergio Ramos who scored the winner eight minutes from the end , rising highest to head home Luka Modric 's corner .

Barcelona thought they should have been awarded a penalty in the final minute when , at the other end , Ramos appeared to trip Adriano but the referee did n't agree . An angry protest by Victor Valdes after the final whistle earned the goalkeeper a red card .

The result takes Real to 55 points and within one point of second-place city rivals Atletico -- who travel to Malaga on Sunday .

Despite the loss -- just their second in the league this season -- Barca are still way out ahead of on 68 points , but not in an unassailable position just yet , as the match winner Ramos pointed out .

`` In the league 13 points is better than 16 . We have reduced the distance and whilst it is still possible mathematically we are obliged to fight , '' Ramos said .

But thoughts are already turning to Tuesday 's last 16 Champions League match up against Manchester United at Old Trafford .

Defender Pepe believes back-to-back wins over Barcelona can inspire Real to victory in the second leg with the tie evenly poised at 1-1 .

Athletic Bilbao move up to 14th after a 1-0 win against Osasuna .

Meanwhile in Serie A , Giampaolo Pazzini scored twice as AC Milan overran 10-man Lazio 3-0 at the San Siro on Saturday .

Lazio 's chances of getting anything from the game were dealt a fatal blow when Antonio Candreva was shown a straight red after 17 minutes for a foul on Stephan El Shaarawy .

Milan proceeded to dominate and two quick-fire goals at the end of the first half -- Pazzini in the 40th minute and Kevin Prince Boateng four minutes later -- effectively killed the contest .
