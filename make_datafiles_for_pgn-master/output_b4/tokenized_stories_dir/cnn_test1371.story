Boston Fire Chief Steve Abraira , whose deputy chiefs criticized him over his handling of the Boston Marathon bombings , has submitted his resignation , the Boston Fire Department said Monday on its official Twitter account .

Abraira 's resignation is effective Friday .

In an April 26 letter to Boston Mayor Thomas Menino , 13 deputy fire chiefs said they had no confidence in Abraira , asserting that he failed to assume command responsibility or show any leadership at the scene .

`` At a time when the city of Boston needed every first responder to take decisive action , Chief Abraira failed to get involved in operational decision-making or show any leadership , '' the letter read .

CNN obtained the letter from a deputy chief who signed it but requested anonymity .

In the letter , the deputies describe an e-mail that Abraira sent to all department members , saying that when he arrived at the scene , `` it was clear that our Command Officer had the incident well in hand and that our department was fully active in a support role with our law enforcement partners . ''

The deputies call Abraira 's argument `` illogical '' and `` mere rationalization to justify his behavior , '' saying that when Abraira arrived , the Boston Fire Department was `` still heavily involved in the incident '' because of the possibility of `` second explosions , '' `` additional suspicious packages '' and `` structural stability concern of buildings , '' among other issues .

But Abraira defended his actions to CNN .

`` In their estimation , they believe that if you do n't assume command , you do n't have responsibility there for what goes on , '' he said . `` I tried to explain to them , if I 'm on the scene , I 'm still responsible . That 's it . But they do n't believe it . ''

The chief told The Boston Globe that he was comfortable with the way his commanders were handling the incident .

`` The nationally accepted practice is that you only take command -LRB- as chief -RRB- if there 's something going wrong or if you can strengthen the command position or if it 's overwhelming for the incident commander , and none of those things were in fact happening , '' he told the paper .

Two bombs exploded at the finish line of the marathon on April 15 , killing 3 and injuring more than 260 others .

One of two bombing suspects , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , died after a gunfight with authorities four days later . After much secrecy and protest , he was buried in a rural Virginia cemetery .

Police took his brother , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , into custody on April 19 after finding him hiding in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown , Massachusetts , home .

He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and malicious destruction of property causing death and is in federal custody .
