Morten Storm , a Danish double agent who says he worked with the CIA and Danish intelligence to track down American-born al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki , says the Danish intelligence agency PET tried to buy his silence after he stopped working for them earlier this year .

Storm claims the Danish intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5 m Danish Krone -LRB- $ 260,000 -RRB- over a five-year period .

He told the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten that PET had offered him the money tax free , after the agency became aware that he was considering going public with his story . But he said he rejected the offer because PET had broken a series of promises to him , including providing permanent residence status in Denmark for his foreign wife .

Instead he told Jyllands-Posten his extraordinary story -- which spanned five years and several trips to Yemen as a double agent -- as well as a close relationship with CIA officers , according to Storm 's account .

The revelations , backed up extensive corroborating evidence , have sent shock waves through Denmark , and led to calls for greater oversight of the country 's intelligence services . Danish law prohibits the security services from being involved in assassinations .

`` We have documented clearly that the Danish secret service took part in mission to locate Anwar al-Awlaki and that raises the question because , it was known at the time the U.S. was ready to kill him if they had the chance , '' Jyllands-Posten editor Pierre Collignon told CNN .

The disclosure Sunday by Storm of the cash offer has heightened the political controversy in Denmark , and led to allegations Danish authorities were trying to cover up illegal activity .

Storm had previously provided Jyllands-Posten an audio recording from this summer in which one of his Danish intelligence handlers appeared to hold out the possibility of payments .

`` What annoys me about is the way you treated me last year with Anwar , '' Storm is heard saying on the recording . `` Yes , yes . But that 's it , -LSB- we 're -RSB- trying to make up for -LSB- it -RSB- now , '' his handler replied , according to Jyllands-Posten .

PET director Jakob Scharf two weeks ago said that his agency `` did not contribute during the military operation that led to the killing of al-Awlaki in Yemen . ''

PET and CIA have neither confirmed nor denied Storm worked for them . PET has made no public comment on Storm 's latest allegations .

There is firm evidence that Storm , a former biker and petty criminal , moved within jihadist circles after converting to Islam in the late 1990s -- becoming known as Murad Storm .

Storm , who befriended al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2006 , claims he approached Danish intelligence later that year after becoming disillusioned with radical Islam , and subsequently worked with them and the CIA to locate and target the cleric .

Storm detailed three attempts by the Western intelligence agencies to locate and target al-Awlaki .

The first came after Storm met with al-Awlaki in a desert camp in Yemen in September 2009 . He said that after he passed on details of al-Awlaki 's location to his Danish and American intelligence handlers , Yemeni forces carried out an assault on the house al-Awlaki had been staying in , killing the owner .

But al-Awlaki had already left .

The second attempt , Storm told Jyllands-Posten , was the planting of a tracking device in the luggage of `` Aminah '' a Croatian convert to Islam , when she traveled to Yemen to marry al-Awlaki in June 2010 .

Storm said he arranged the match after al-Awlaki had requested he find him a Western bride during a previous meeting . Though Storm said he was paid $ 250,000 by the CIA for arranging the match , the operation failed after the AQAP operatives told Aminah to repack her luggage before traveling from Sanaa to Yemen 's southern tribal areas to marry al-Awlaki .

The third and successful attempt , in September 2011 , according to Storm , involved him arranging the handoff of a USB thumb drive with a secret tracking device to an al Qaeda courier taking messages onto al-Awlaki .

Storm said he felt betrayed after a CIA agent claimed to him , during a meeting that he recorded , that a different operation had netted al-Awlaki , and this was a significant factor in his decision to go public .

Magnus Ranstorp , one of Scandinavia 's leading counterterrorism experts , told CNN that Storm 's decision to go public was likely a source of significant embarrassment to his handlers .

`` It is so rare that two services completely mishandle , misjudge him , and he is able to come to meetings and he has a phone and he is able to record them , '' Ranstorp , the research director at the Swedish National Defence Academy , told CNN .

`` It also exposes the very secret , the very essence of intelligence services and that is means and methods , they never discuss means and methods , '' Ranstorp told CNN .

Al-Awlaki 's Croatian bride 's ` identity revealed '

The Croatian newspaper Vecernji List , in articles published Wednesday and Thursday , claimed it had unveiled the true identity of the Aminah , the Croatian women Storm arranged for al-Awlaki to marry in the hope she would lead the CIA to his location .

The newspaper identified Aminah as Irena Horak , 35 , who had previously worked in a care home in Zagreb and had converted to Islam in 2008 , and it posted several pictures of her .

The paper reported -- according to close friends -- Horak , a cheery athletic blonde from a small town in central Croatia converted to Islam after falling in love with a Muslim lawyer from London she met at a wedding in summer 2008 . Horak had been brought up Catholic .

The two started a long-distance relationship , but after throwing herself into her new religion , Horak came to feel her boyfriend was not sufficiently devout because he drank alcohol and failed to wake up for morning prayers . That resulted in her leaving him , according to the newspaper .

`` She changed her life habits completely and way of dressing , '' and spent all her time in the mosque one friend told the newspaper .

`` She was looking for someone more radical and found him in al-Awlaki , '' the newspaper reported .

Family and friends of Horak told Vecernji List they had been shocked by the news that she had traveled to Yemen to marry al-Awlaki . She had told them she was going overseas for language study .

Storm told Jyllands-Posten he first came into contact with Aminah , the Croatian convert , in late 2009 through Facebook , and that she soon warmed to the idea of marrying al-Awlaki .

At a meeting in Vienna in spring 2010 , Storm showed Aminah a short video recording made by al-Awlaki , who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif .

`` This recording is done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request ... I pray Allah guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter . And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal , '' al-Awlaki said , in a section posted on the Jyllands-Posten website .

Storm said Aminah burst into tears when she heard these words .

She then recorded two short videos for al-Awlaki . In the first video , she wore a full black veil with just her face visible . Speaking in heavily accented English , she said : `` I will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that I have chosen and Inshallah Allah will help us . ''

In the second video , Aminah took off her veil and said : `` Brother , it 's me without the scarf , so you can see my hair ... I hope you are happy with me , Inshallah , '' according to Jyllands-Posten .

`` When I watched these tapes of video marriage proposals between her and the al Qaeda leader , and this woman 's answers , I thought well this story is impossible to deny , '' Collignon , the editor of Jyllands-Posten , told CNN . The Vecernji List report appears to further buttress Storm 's account .

Aminah and al-Awlaki married shortly after Aminah arrived in Yemen in June 2010 . Al-Awlaki sent Storm a message thanking him for arranging the marriage . She had not only lived up to expectations , al-Awlaki wrote in a message seen by Jyllands-Posten , but was '' ... . much better ! ''

After al-Awlaki 's death in September 2011 , Aminah continued to communicate with Storm through encrypted messages , unaware that he had been working with Western intelligence . A few months ago , she said she was working on Inspire , the online magazine of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , or AQAP .

She also suggested she wanted to be involved in a terrorist attack , according to Jyllands-Posten .

`` I would be making a martyr operation , but Sheikh Basir -LRB- al Wuhayshi , the emir of AQAP -RRB- said that the sisters so far -LRB- can -RRB- not carry out operations because it will mean a lot of problems for them ... so I can not perform operation . ... I want to be killed the same way as my husband was ... Insha'Allah , '' she wrote .

Aminah 's whereabouts today are unknown . CNN has been in touch with Storm , who is in hiding after several death threats from militant Islamists who were once his comrades .
