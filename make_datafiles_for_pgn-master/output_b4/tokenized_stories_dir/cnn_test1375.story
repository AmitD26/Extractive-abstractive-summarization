-LRB- CNN -RRB- Britain 's Princess Anne and 10-time major winner Annika Sorenstam are among the first women members to be admitted to the Royal and Ancient Golf Club , it was announced Tuesday .

The club , which is renowned as the home of golf , voted last September to end its male-only membership rule , breaking with a 260-year tradition .

Princess Anne , who is also a member of the International OIympic Committee , and Sweden 's Sorenstam , were granted honorary membership status .

The other five to be honored , Britons Laura Davies and Belle Robertson , Americans Renee Powell and Louise Suggs and Lally Segard of France , have played and enjoyed success at the highest levels of competitive golf .

`` This is a historic day for golf , '' George Macgregor , the captain of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club -LRB- R&A -RRB- , told its official website .

`` They are extremely worthy additions to our roll of honorary members and will become ambassadors for the club as they have been for the sport of golf throughout their careers . ''

Princess Anne , the only daughter of reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth II , joins three other members of the British royal family in becoming an honorary member of the R&A .

The club , founded in 1754 , organizes golf 's oldest major , the British Open , and also administers the rules of the sport from its famous headquarters in St Andrews in Scotland .

It was also announced Tuesday that an unspecified number of lay women members had also been granted membership with more set to follow in the coming months .

The R&A had come under increasing pressure to admit women members , with former British prime minister Gordon Brown among leading public figures to voice their concerns on discriminatory grounds .

It eventually followed the lead set by the exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in the United States , which admitted its first two female members , former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and business leader Darla Moore in August 2012 .

In the R&A vote last year , 85 % of its members backed the move to admit women members in an historic ballot .
