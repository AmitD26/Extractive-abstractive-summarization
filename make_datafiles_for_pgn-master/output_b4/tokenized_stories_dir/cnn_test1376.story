`` The first time you do it you feel a bit nervous , but after two or three times , it becomes normal , like rugby or boxing or any sport . ''

Fidael Beaf could easily be describing bungee jumping .

But the 44-year-old Vanuatuan is talking about something far more terrifying than bouncing on the end of a piece of elastic .

Every year from April to June , the Vanuatuan island of Pentecost hosts one of the most spectacular and death-defying cultural ceremonies ever conceived .

Known as the Nagol , it sees men climb flimsy 100-foot wooden towers and dive headfirst into empty space , with nothing to break their fall but vines tied their ankles .

My journey to meet Beaf and his fellow land jumpers begins on a stifling hot Saturday morning as I board a 17-seat Chinese turboprop in the capital Port Vila .

The flight to Pentacost is n't for the easily rattled , though passengers are rewarded with epic views of Benbow and Murim , active volcanoes on the island of Ambryn .

An hour later , the pilot touches down at Lenorore , a small runway squeezed between the jungle-clad mountains and volcanic beaches of Pentecost 's west coast .

Ours is the first of the day 's five planes , all bringing in tourists to land at what 's more of a concrete bunker than an airport .

Organizers say a maximum of 50 tourists are allowed to attend the weekly ceremony to prevent over-commercialization .

A portion of every ticket helps pay for children 's school fees and church programs .

Dysfunctional marriage

Ironically , European missionaries banned land diving on Pentecost in the early 20th century , but the priests never reached the rugged southeast corner of the island , where the ritual was passed on to successive generations .

The ritual is said to have its roots in a legend about a dysfunctional marriage .

So the story goes , a woman decided to flee into the jungle to escape daily confrontations with her spouse .

Hotly pursued by her husband , she ran up a tree then tied a vine around her ankle and jumped from the top , landing safely .

The husband followed suit but without the aid of the vine he hit the ground with a fatal splat .

Inspired by the woman 's act of defiance , the women of Pentecost began land diving for fun .

But uneasy with seeing the women dangling from trees in compromising positions , the island 's men called an end to their fun and stole the activity for themselves .

Over time , land diving moved from trees to purpose-built towers .

It 's also been transformed into a ritual rife with religious symbolism -- the success of the all-important yam harvest is said to depend on the courage of the previous year 's divers .

After the last plane touches down , we 're shepherded to a clearing in the jungle where the impressive tower known as a `` Nagol Adi '' stands upon a treeless slope .

Held together by vines without a single nail or screw , this outwardly phallic shrine takes 30 men up to a month to build .

Deadly mistakes

At its center is a lopped tree surrounded by a crisscross of pole scaffolding lashed together and anchored into the earth by vines .

Protruding from its face are a dozen diving planks , the lowest of which is for boys who start diving from the age of five .

The highest is reserved for the most accomplished , with a successful jump -- one that does n't cripple or kill the diver -- delivering wads of social capital .

Despite its primitive appearance , the Nagol Adi is a marvel of intelligent design .

The diving boards are designed to snap and hinge downward to absorb much of the divers ' G-force , the wood is freshly cut to ensure strength and vines are carefully tailored to each diver 's weight and height .

Diving is only permitted in the two months following the wet season to ensure the vines contain the water that lends them elasticity and strength .

Adherence to religious customs is also considered essential to a diver 's safety .

While the tower is being constructed , divers live together in men-only huts and avoid contact with women -- a ritual said to clarify their minds .

As belief in sorcery is widespread in Vanuatu , divers are also prohibited from asking witchdoctors to supply them `` love potions '' during this period .

On a few occasions when the rules have been bent , it has cost lives .

When Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II visited Pentecost in February 1974 , a diver died when his vine snapped during an out-of-season Nagol held in her honor .

In 2008 , Vanuatuan cameraman Hardy Ligo was killed when a poorly constructed tower collapsed under his weight during a Nagol that some said had been held too close to the yam harvest .

Breaking wood

The moment the Nagol begins , it becomes apparent why people come from all corners of the world to see it .

On a terrace cut into the hill behind the tower , a troupe of about 100 men and boys wearing only penis sheaths begin chanting in Sa , the language of Southern Pentecost .

Without warning they break into a dance , stomping their feet intently into the ground as women in grass skirts emerge from the trees , adding their voices to the melee .

One of the dancing men emerges from the group , scampers up the tower and finds his way to the lowest diving board .

Minutes pass as the frayed ends of two vines are tied around the volunteer 's ankles .

Below , the chanting and dancing intensifies .

Once the vines are secured , the diver spreads his arms wide and calls out for emotional support from the dancers .

The crowd 's yelps and whistles reach fever pitch , the diver crosses his arms against his chest and makes an incredible leap of faith , trying to put as much distance between himself and the sharp edges of the tower .

Braver than bungee

When the vines go taut , the sound of breaking wood cracks through the clearing , as the plank gives way .

Instead of bouncing in the air like a bungee jumper , the diver plummets to the ground , skimming his chest on earth that has been heavily tilled to absorb impact .

Assistants rush in , pull the diver to his feet and confirm he 's in one piece .

The crowd roars with approval .

Happily , all 12 land divers emerge unscathed on this day -- an unusually good safety record .

But the divers remain well aware of the risks .

Among them , 33-year-old Michael Olul scornfully dismisses comparisons with thrill seekers who use elastic ropes .

`` Bungee is not so brave , '' he says .

Few who have seen the Vanuatu land divers in action would argue .
