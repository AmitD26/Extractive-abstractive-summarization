-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just out of high school , my young developing mind could n't resist the temptation of the Marine recruiters : They promised challenge and hardship , in comparison to the other armed services , which promised money and travel as their main recruiting incentives .

So , on September 24 , 2003 -- my 18th birthday -- I enlisted in the Marine Corps while my parents were away on vacation , a trip they promptly returned from upon hearing the news .

My time in the Marine Corps offered an escape from the isolated Midwest upbringing that I 'd experienced . Once my training was completed , I found myself stationed in Okinawa , Japan 's sacrificial prefecture to the American Empire .

My initial two-year tour of duty in Okinawa was regularly marked with frequent physical and mental abuse at the hands of noncommissioned officers within my unit , several of whom exhibited signs of post-traumatic stress .

On a regular basis I found myself the target of homophobic and racist comments from those entrusted with my well-being and training , often times in front of those I was in charge of leading .

My time on Okinawa came to an end when I received orders to Iraq . I happily reported to my new unit , hoping deployment would offer a welcome escape from the physical and verbal harassment , degradation and humiliation that had become daily life .

The harassment I 'd experienced in my previous unit gave way to trust and camaraderie , though this , too , would soon fade .

The enemy within

Weeks before leaving Okinawa for the sands of Iraq , I found myself pinned down , fighting off a sexual assault by a fellow Marine : a noncommissioned officer I was about to deploy with , who I was supposed to trust my life to .

I still remember the laughter as I fought back . This would occur twice , both times by the same Marine . The feelings of helplessness , powerlessness , guilt and shame would grow over the years . I felt weak , unable to protect myself .

Like thousands of sexual assault survivors in the military , fear of victim blaming and feelings of shame and guilt prevented me from reporting what happened .

After my first deployment I was experiencing emotional detachment . The world felt mundane . I was emotionally numb . Empathy escaped my being . I felt myself not participating in the world around me , observing from a distance . I found no place in the society I had returned to . I became violent at the slightest cue , and began drinking heavily .

Depression and anxiety swept through me . Though I can now articulate the emotional context of my experience , at the time every emotion , fear , hurt , shame , guilt , was externalized through anger , rage and violence .

I was blinded to the reality of what I was experiencing .

My anger was simply the intensity that a Marine required . Emotional detachment and numbness cultivated the objectivity needed to evaluate and execute the mission . My drinking seamlessly blended with the would-be frat-house Marine barracks culture .

I reported symptoms of PTSD to my command via a pencil and paper questionnaire known as a Post Deployment Health Assessment , at the discouragement and warning of a Corpsman , yet no offer of treatment was extended . My subsequent deployments would only serve to compound the trauma I had experienced , as I was on guard not only for the so-called enemy , but like so many of my sisters-in-arms , for my fellow Marines as well .

After completing my second deployment to Iraq , I separated from the Marines to attend Auburn University . I believed at the time I was leaving an old life behind me to begin a new life as a college freshman , but I soon discovered that stepping back out into the world would not be the seamless transition I had come to envision .

My struggles in the Marines had come to a close . Little did I know that my battle with Veterans Affairs was on the horizon .

From suicidal thoughts to long waits and lots of pills

As self-isolation became my preferred method of treating my anxiety , my relationships with my parents and my partner deteriorated . I felt distanced from those around me and those I cared about , which fed my anger .

My anger fed into guilt , then isolation and then anger . This became my every day . After nearly three years , my anger and depression drove my partner to leave .

Losing the only relationship I 'd managed to maintain deepened my depression . Life felt superficial . I began imagining how I would take my life .

The Uncounted : War 's impact on military families

With the barrel to my temple and my finger on the trigger , I began to wonder what the moments between the gun firing and my death would be like . In my questioning I realized that what I wanted was not to die , but to reclaim agency of my life and live it instead of simply survive through it .

While I had no desire to harm myself , more than anything , I desired relief .

On the verge of suicide and struggling to stay in school , I began to seek treatment at the VA Clinic . This task was , in the truest sense , easier said than done . Wait times for appointments ranged from three to six months . Spending an hour on hold was the norm , and being hung up on was common practice .

My first appointment requesting mental health treatment was December 2011 . My first appointment with a therapist was October 2012 , a 10-month gap . In those 10 months , according to the VA estimates , more than 6,000 veterans took their own lives .

Long before I would ever see a therapist , the VA would cycle me through half a dozen medicines in less than three months , though this was far less than the buffet of lithium and opiates many other veterans are prescribed .

Upon graduation , I relocated to Denver and immediately enrolled in the local VA system , looking to continue the treatment I had fought so hard to receive before . After my initial intake , every mental health appointment I scheduled would be involuntarily canceled and pushed to a later date , only to have them , too , be canceled .

During this time , news broke that delays in care had been a problem at VA clinics nationwide . I eventually gave up on the VA and began managing symptoms of my PTSD using medicinal cannabis and Vipassana meditation .

It was clear to me that the VA was there to placate , not to heal veterans .

Gingrich : We owe vets real change

Amazonian discovery

It was my search for true healing that led me to Peru . I traveled there as part of a study conducted by Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies . I had been following the association 's MDMA PTSD treatment research for years , and regularly advocated for MAPS in my daily discussions with fellow veterans .

In Peru , I met other veterans who had also become disillusioned with the cold , sterile , institutionalized treatment they had received when they returned home from combat .

When we arrived at the Phoenix Ayahuasca Center in Iquitos , Peru , I was unsure what to expect . I had read about ayahuasca , and listened to firsthand accounts from other veterans of its healing effects , but never imagined I myself would have the opportunity to experience it firsthand .

I participated in three ayahuasca ceremonies , all conducted alongside other veterans . Each ceremony lasted approximately four hours . Before each ceremony we would come together and discuss our intention or focus would be for the ceremony that evening . We sat by candlelight , as one by one we drank our cup of medicine , then in darkness as we waited for the medicine to come up through us .

Ayahuasca allowed me to examine myself from a new perspective , progressively deeper with each ceremony . I was able to recall trauma and remember parts of my experiences that had previously been blocked out .

I was able to process not only experiences from the military , but also from throughout my entire life and see how they synthesized into the person I had become .

I felt a love and acceptance like never before . Negativity and pain lifted from my shoulders and released from my body in what felt like what I can only describe as a psychedelic baptism .

Since returning home to Colorado , I 've become an even more vocal advocate for psychedelic treatment .

With the advent of the legalization of medicinal and recreational cannabis , I believe it is important that we continue on in the fight against the drug war .

Psychedelics including MDMA , LSD and psilocybin should be rescheduled to allow research into their medicinal benefits and let the facts speak for themselves .

America 's veterans are returning from over a decade of perpetual war , only to find themselves on the front lines , this time battling the government that sent them to fight , for their right to heal .

Enlightenment is on the horizon , and as with all America 's battles , its veterans will lead the way .
