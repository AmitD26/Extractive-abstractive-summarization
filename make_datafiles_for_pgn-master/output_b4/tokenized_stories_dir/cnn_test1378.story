-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was a woman 's raw , bleeding hands that led Jock Brandis to make a promise .

Jock Brandis shows some African men how to use a device that shells nuts , helping make more money for the village .

In 2002 , Brandis was helping a friend repair a water treatment system in a Mali , Africa , village . There , he encountered a woman whose hands were bleeding from shelling peanuts to support her family -- and this was not uncommon .

In Africa alone , women spend 4 billion hours a year shelling peanuts by hand , according to the Peanut Collaborative Research Support Program .

`` A sun-dried peanut is like a little rock . It 's that hard , '' says Brandis . `` Cracking the shells takes hours of effort for the village women who traditionally do the chore , and it often leaves their hands bloody . ''

Brandis promised the women in the village he would return in a year with a machine to speed the shelling . That turned out to be easier said than done .

`` When I went back to America , it did n't exist , '' recalls Brandis .

So he started asking around .

`` I did n't know much about peanuts , so I guess I did what any Canadian with a question about peanuts would do . I wrote Jimmy Carter , '' Brandis said .

Through former President Jimmy Carter 's library , Brandis tracked down an expert who suggested he look at a sketch from a Bulgarian scientist . Brandis attempted to replicate the sketch , but it did n't work . Having tinkered and toiled with `` gizmos '' as a former gaffer in the film industry , Brandis set out to make a peanut sheller himself .

After fiddling , cranking and grinding his way through a number of prototypes in his Wilmington , North Carolina , studio , Brandis developed a simple machine that could shell nuts up to 50 times faster than by hand . Designed with a simple , durable hand crank , the `` universal nut sheller '' could be built with $ 28 worth of materials .

To give this `` gift to the world , '' Brandis joined forces with a group of former Peace Corps volunteers and co-founded the Full Belly Project in 2003 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to designing and distributing technologies like the universal nut sheller . Brandis travels with others to developing countries to show local shellers how to use and make the machines themselves . Watch Brandis show one of the most efficient peanut shellers ''

`` It makes their work less tedious and increases productivity up to 50 times , '' says Brandis . `` One machine will work for an entire village , so when we 're talking about 100 machines , we 're not talking about 100 families -- we 're talking about 100 villages . ''

Not only does Brandis refuse to patent the device , but designs for the shelling machine also are available online for anyone to download , assemble , duplicate or improve upon , which Brandis encourages .

`` One of the great things that happened is that when this machine went out , we started getting word back from all over the world saying , ` Oh , we do n't use it for peanuts . We use it for shea , for jatropha , for coffee , ' '' he says . `` It 's now become much bigger than just being a peanut sheller .

The Full Belly Project works on four continents in 17 countries . Hundreds of machines are in use or being produced locally at minimal cost in the Philippines , Uganda and Guatemala , resulting in health benefits and increased family incomes , according to the Full Belly Project .

`` I get up in the morning and there 's an e-mail from a total stranger and a picture , '' says Brandis . `` It 's a happy person standing beside their machine with a big grin . That 's the -LSB- moment -RSB- I live for . '' E-mail to a friend
