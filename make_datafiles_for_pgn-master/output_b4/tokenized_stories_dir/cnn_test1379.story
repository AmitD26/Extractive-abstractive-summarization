`` I 'm gon na tag you in this hideous photo and then unfriend you if you do n't stop oversharing and poking me . ''

If you said this to someone 10 years ago , they 'd look at you like you were speaking Klingon . Nowadays , you just sound like an active user of social media .

This is how much Facebook has changed how we talk . In the decade since its birth in February 2004 , the social network has introduced numerous terms and phrases to the language of modern life .

Most are common words that Facebook refitted with new meanings . Some have stuck , while others have been forgotten . A few have even been recognized by dictionaries as official pieces of the 21st century lexicon .

Here are nine of the most memorable .

Friend

Until Facebook came along , nobody used the word `` friend '' as a verb . Now it 's not uncommon to ask a new acquaintance to spell their name so you can friend them on Facebook .

Everyone likes to feel popular . That 's why some Facebookers , especially in the site 's early days , hoarded friends like poker chips -LRB- never mind that most of these `` friends '' were rarely seen co-workers , distant relatives or vaguely remembered classmates from junior high -RRB- . Nobody really has 583 `` friends . ''

Facebook 's `` friend '' also was the precursor to Twitter 's `` follower , '' which makes a user 's social contacts sound like members of a cult .

Unfriend

Facebook giveth , and Facebook taketh away . Are you tired of your uncle 's political rants ? Unfriend him !

By adding an `` unfriend '' option , Facebook created new shorthand for aborting a friendship or an acquaintance . It 's a lot easier to say , `` I unfriended Bob '' than `` I 'm not going to be friends with Bob anymore because he annoys me with his daily musings about his toenails . ''

Unfriending someone is considered a more drastic step than simply tweaking your Facebook settings to block or minimize their posts .

The term was officially welcomed to the digital-age vernacular by the New Oxford English Dictionary , which named `` unfriend '' its Word of the Year for 2009 .

Status update

Years ago , `` status '' was a measure of someone 's social or professional standing . Then Facebook began asking users to post updates on their thoughts or activities , and `` updating your status '' suddenly meant more than just moving to a better neighborhood .

To prompt updates , Facebook first asked users , `` What are you doing right now ? '' When that produced too many mundane reports -- `` Sally is eating toast ! '' -- Facebook changed the update question in 2009 to the broader , `` What 's on your mind ? ''

Like

Few things have sparked more debate on Facebook than the `` Like '' button , which debuted in 2009 and soon spread to partner sites . Suddenly , with a quick click you could endorse your friends ' updates , jokes and cute-kid pictures .

Cynics , lamenting what they saw as Facebook 's forced cheerfulness , unsuccessfully asked for a `` Dislike '' button .

Instagram , Pinterest and other social networks also adopted the Like model for favoring posts , although they used a heart symbol instead of a Like thumb . -LRB- You Like me right now ! You Like me ! -RRB-

All this made `` Like '' a noun as well as a verb , as users began collecting Likes as a measure of engagement and popularity . As in , `` I ca n't believe my cute picture of Fluffy in her Easter bonnet got only three Likes . ''

5 ways Facebook changed our lives , for better or worse

Poke

The weird Poke feature was sort of a thing in Facebook 's early days . Nobody knew what it was for , exactly -- even Mark Zuckerberg once said of the Poke , `` We thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose . ''

Some saw it as a flirty invitation to an online chat or real-world hookup . But the obvious sexual innuendo made it awkward to use in conversation . `` I poked Aunt Betty '' just sounds all kind of wrong .

Amazingly , the Poke function is still active on Facebook . But nobody uses it anymore unless they 're being ironic .

Share -LRB- and overshare -RRB-

Sharing used to be something we did in school when there were n't enough textbooks to go around . Then came Facebook , and everyone -- not just the generous -- became sharers . Or over-sharers . Soon it was n't enough to just experience a memorable moment in our daily lives : We had to share it with everyone , RIGHT NOW !

Share buttons popped up all over the Web . Share this ! Tweet this ! Pin this ! Snap this ! Sooo much sharing .

The word `` share '' has always implied a selfless , charitable act . But the more we share our every move and thought on social media , the more self-centered we can tend to sound .

Not me , of course . Other people .

Wall

For years , Facebook encouraged visitors to a friend 's profile to `` write on their Wall . '' It sounded sort of illicit , like an invitation to scribble graffiti .

The idea of a digital `` wall '' seemed odd at a time when other social networks were promoting pages . Maybe that 's why it never really caught on . In 2011 , Facebook replaced the Wall with the current Timeline format , which displays updates chronologically .

It 's complicated

This ambiguous answer to Facebook 's `` What 's your relationship status ? '' could apply to almost any romantic entanglement between `` single '' and `` married '' and is more interesting than either . It 's become a common response to the `` How 's your love life ? '' question and even inspired a 2009 romantic comedy with Meryl Streep .

Tag

Tag , you 're it ! No , you 're it ! What was once just a child 's game is now a way to get people to notice your posts , or to embarrass them by flagging them in unflattering photos . Come to think of it , maybe Tag is the new Poke .
