The whisky glows like a candle in the bottom of the glass . Its aroma is rich , deep , musky , inviting . But dare I take a sip ?

This is the new Balvenie 50-year-old , which carries a price tag of £ 25,000 -LRB- $ 40,800 -RRB- a bottle . Which means that the single dram I am holding is worth about £ 830 -LRB- $ 1,350 -RRB- .

Slowly , I raise it to my lips .

I am standing in the whisky room at the luxurious Cromlix hotel in Dunblaine , Scotland -- which incidentally is owned by local boy tennis star Andy Murray -- along with a select group of journalists .

We have been invited to the exclusive launch of the new 50-year-old , which is only the fourth time the distillery has released a whisky of this age .

`` A 50-year-old Macallan featured in -LRB- the film -RRB- Skyfall , but whiskies of this age are extremely unusual , '' says Sam Simmons , global brand ambassador for The Balvenie , who is introducing us to the latest release .

`` Nobody 50 years ago knew that people would care about Scotch the way they do in 2014 . Nobody planned to leave this whisky for so long . Its existence is a bit of a miracle . ''

We tilt our glasses . The butter-colored liquid is rich with notes of cloves , summer flowers , dried fruits and marzipan , underpinned by the woody polish of an old gymnasium .

`` It tastes like soap , '' somebody says .

`` You 've eaten soap ? '' Simmons replies .

There is a pause .

`` It reminds me of the inside of a grand piano , '' ventures someone else .

`` Whisky of this age has a natural alcohol level of below 50 % , '' Simmons explains . `` That 's when very unpredictable chemical reactions happen between the spirit and the wood . That 's the magic time . It creates whisky that is unique , quirky and unpredictable . ''

Whisky collectors are making big money

As extraordinary as this whisky is -- it is exceptionally long , with flavor lingering for several minutes after each sip -- one question is in the back of everyone 's mind . Who would pay £ 25,000 for a bottle of whisky ?

The answer is people like Mahesh Patel , a whisky collector and building tycoon from Atlanta , Georgia , who once bought a Dalmore Trinitas 64-year-old for £ 100,000 -LRB- $ 166,000 -RRB- .

`` I have about 5,000 bottles , including a lot of old , one-off , high-end whiskies , '' he says . `` Over the years , I 've spent about $ 2 million on it . The collection is worth about $ 6 million now . I keep it at different locations all over the world , for security reasons . ''

Patel is one of a breed of whisky collectors that have found that their passion for the drink has led to great financial gains . Distilleries first hit on the idea of limited editions and special releases in the early Nineties , such as the famous Black Bowmore that came in a wooden presentation case .

Collectors like Patel bought the bottles largely for the love of them . But over the decades , their value started to appreciate to the extent that unusual bottles started to be seen as cash cows .

Fast-forward to 2014 , and the market is booming . According to the Investment Grade Scotch index that is compiled by UK-based Whisky Highland , the top 100 whiskies appreciated by an average of 440 % in the last six years .

Last month , a 50-year-old bottle of Japanese Yamazaki single malt sold for £ 20,000 -LRB- $ 33,000 -RRB- . In January , Sotheby 's sold a six-liter decanter of Macallan M for £ 387,000 -LRB- $ 631,000 -RRB- .

These transactions are becoming relatively frequent , if not commonplace . Indeed , Whisky Highland expect 30,000 bottles to be sold at auction this year , a 50 % increase on the 20,211 that were sold in 2013 .

By contrast , the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index increased by 31 % in the same period , and the Live-ex Fine Wine 100 Index dropped by 2 % . If you 're a drinks investor with money to spend , it is something of a no-brainer .

Is whisky for collecting or drinking ?

But most people in the whisky world see collecting purely for the sake of investment as something of a taboo .

`` You have to start by drinking the product and enjoying the product , '' says Patel . `` Buy two bottles , one to drink and one to collect . Otherwise you 're going against the spirit of the industry . ''

Andy Simpson , the founding director of Whisky Highland , agrees -- but only to a point .

`` There are three types of buyers : drinkers , collectors and investors , '' he says . `` I know one person , who shall remain nameless , who is teetotal , and buys whisky only to invest .

`` Some people think that this is a crime and whisky should be set free . But from my perspective , people can choose how to spend their money . It 's supporting the industry and that 's a good thing . ''

Simpson , a former corporate banker , is launching a new business called Rare Whisky 101 , which he describes as `` consultants , brokers and valuers '' .

`` Whisky has always been collectable , but there were no market figures before Whisky Highland came along five years ago , '' he says . `` There were no indices , charts , graphs , nothing . Rare Whisky 101 will have the world 's largest online database of whisky auction sales , so investors can accurately follow the market . ''

This is the latest contribution to the digital revolution that has transformed the secondary whisky market .

Physical auction houses like Bonhams and Sotherby 's have traditionally tended to charge 25 % commission , and hold auctions just a few times a year . By contrast , sites like Scotch Whisky , Whisky Online , Just Whisky and Whisky Auctioneer run online auctions regularly , and charge a commission of just 10 % .

`` Those sites have added liquidity into a traditionally illiquid market , '' says Simpson . `` They are part of the reason why whisky is booming , and the growing value of whisky is starting to usurp the experience of opening and drinking it . ''

Whisky investment funds : too good to be true ?

The market is gradually showing signs of maturity . In June , the world 's first whisky investment fund was set up by Rickesh Kishnano , the CEO of Platinum Wines in Hong Kong ; another has been established in Singapore .

But many seasoned collectors -- who themselves have made millions through buying and selling whisky -- are skeptical about whisky funds , and suggest that potential investors tread carefully .

`` They worry me because genuine whisky experts are few and far between , and there is nobody credible behind these funds , '' says Sukhinder Singh , founder of the Whisky Exchange , who boasts a `` handsome '' private collection of 6,000 bottles that he keeps in his boardroom .

`` They are run by people from the wine industry , but you need a lot of knowledge specifically about whisky to make good investments . It 's not about just buying old whisky . I 've been collecting for 30 years and I know everyone who is good . How many whiskies have these guys tried ? Fifty ? A hundred ? That 's not enough . ''

There are lots of hidden pitfalls , he says . For example , if you invest in a whisky that is not `` amazing to drink '' , demand may remain low even if it is a limited edition . And while some bottles go up , it is common for others to lose value .

For example , the Royal Wedding limited edition Macallan whisky , which marked the marriage between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011 , rose from £ 150 to £ 1,650 by 2013 . These days , however , after the distillery lost many fans by removing age statements from its bottles , it has depreciated to about £ 900 .

By contrast , however , the iconic Macallan Private Eye whisky , which was released in 1996 to mark the 35th anniversary of the British satirical magazine , has appreciated from £ 35 to about £ 1,500 , and shows no sign of falling from grace .

Telling the difference between these two whiskies requires significant expertise .

The importance of loving your whisky

According to Singh , when it comes to whisky collecting , there is no substitute for genuine passion . He still vividly remembers the first bottle in his collection .

`` I visited a man in Scotland , and noticed a special bottle on his mantelpiece , with a beautiful , intensely colorful label , '' he says . `` It was an original bottling from a distillery called Kirkliston , which had closed in the early 1900s .

`` I knew I had to have it . It took me half an hour to persuade him to sell it to me , for £ 700 , which was a lot of money at the time . It 's worth about £ 20,000 now , but I 'll never sell it . ''

What advice would he offer an aspiring collector or investor ? `` The whisky market is on fire at the moment , it really is , '' he says . `` But you ca n't become an expert overnight .

`` As a rule of thumb , buy limited edition bottles from iconic distilleries . But most importantly , learn about whisky , meet the experts and talk to them , and drink as much as you can . ''

Back in the honeyed presence of The Balvenie 50-year-old , Sam Simmons is inclined to agree . `` Ultimately , whisky is about loving the mystery of the drink , conversation and friendship , '' he says .

`` Whisky is to be drunk and enjoyed . However high the stakes get , you can never lose sight of that . ''
