Six months ago , the finish line of the Boston Marathon was a scene of smoke , blood and death .

On Saturday , tragedy became triumph when the victory parade of the World Series champions Boston Red Sox crossed the same line surrounded by crowds , which were expected to reach 1 million people over the entire celebration route .

What the Red Sox mean to Boston

In a crowning moment , Red Sox player Jonny Gomes rested the World Series trophy on the finish line , draped with a team jersey whose back declared `` Boston Strong 617 , '' the slogan created to overcome April 's terror attacks .

Led by an announcer , the team and crowd sang `` God Bless America '' at the line , which remains painted on the street .

The championship parade marked the restoration of a city 's soul , darkened during bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others who gathered last spring to watch the marathon near the finish line .

But on Saturday , the pall cast over that line was vanquished .

A great American city found its spirit returned . And it rejoiced .

`` The last time I was standing on the streets of Boston was the day of the marathon , and I 'd just like to say thank you to the Red Sox for bringing all these people back to the streets for something so great to celebrate , '' said parade attendee Laurie Delaney of Dedham , Massachusetts .

In fact , on the day of the bombings six months ago , Delaney was on Boylston Street where the explosions occurred , and earlier that day , she was at a Red Sox game .

Saturday 's celebration was emotional , she said .

Every Bostonian attending the parade remembered where they were the day of the bombings . Ryan Sedlacek was in his Boston home less than a mile from the finish line .

`` It does n't fix what we went through , but it helps cover it up , '' Sedlacek said of the collective rejoicing .

What made the moment doubly triumphant was how the Boston Red Sox finished in last place in 2012 .

In a city passionate about its baseball , the team went from worst to first , despite the attacks on the city . The Red Sox won the World Series on Wednesday night , defeating the St. Louis Cardinals . The team won it at home , in Fenway Park , the first time they 've done so since 1918 .

The victory seemed a godsend .

`` It feels like it should have happened , '' Sedlacek said .

The Red Sox team met with bombing survivors over breakfast , just before the fanfare of vehicles and about two dozen amphibious duck boats began the motorcade at the team 's stadium at 10 a.m. Saturday , said Heather Abbott , one of the survivors who attended the gathering .

The parade ended in the Charles River when the duck boats took to the water and motored along the shore .
