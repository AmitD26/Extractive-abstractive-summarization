When I read about the rape of a 23-year-old photojournalist in Mumbai , I thought , here we go again . On December 6 , 1992 , when I was a 29-year-old reporter covering the demolition of a mosque in northern India , I was attacked . I was n't raped , but my attackers sexually assaulted and then tried to kill me .

Someone dragged me to a trench outside the mosque and pulled my shirt off . But a passerby jumped in , fought off my attackers and saved me .

When I appeared in court to testify against the attackers , their lawyers asked me questions that implied I was responsible . How could the daughter of a good family have gone to cover the demolition ? Did I smoke ? What kind of clothes was I wearing ? Did I believe in God ?

The judge did not stop them . It was a demoralizing and toxic experience , but one that is not unknown to women in India who choose to speak out against sexual attacks . They are silenced by a process that heaps shame , fear and guilt on them .

Indian women feel sorrow , anger at U.S. student 's harassment

In rural Rajasthan in 1992 , a judge dismissed charges filed by a low-caste , or Dalit , grassroots social worker , Bhanwari Devi , who said she was gang raped . She had been campaigning against child marriage . A judge said , `` a middle-aged man from an Indian village could not possibly have participated in a gang rape in the presence of his own nephew . ''

A judgment like this not only deters other women from testifying against their rapists , it also emboldens the attackers , who know that they will get away with it .

Most women say they would never tell the police about an attack , afraid that they would be ignored or even abused by the cops themselves .

Keeping chivalry alive in India : Men respond to rape crisis

In June , 13 anti-rape protesters were arrested outside the home of the West Bengal chief minister and detained for more than eight hours . Ironically , they were protesting the lack of police protection for women in the state following the rape and murder of a 20-year-old college student whose body was found lying near a river near the outskirts of Kolkata , and that of a 14-year-old girl who was raped and killed in the town of Gede , 90 miles away , only three days later .

Few women want to appear in court only to be stigmatized and traumatized -- unlike treatment of the suspects . While India 's legal framework has improved for women over the past 20 years , the people implementing it are mostly male cops and lawyers who live in a deeply patriarchal society .

Incidents of rape have gone up by 873 % in India in the past 60 years . On average , each day , three Dalit women are raped in some part of our country . The conviction rate for rape cases in 2011 was 25 % -- although some estimate only one in 10 rapes is reported . The conviction rate for men accused of raping Dalit women is almost nil .

The National Crime Records Bureau 's annual report of crime statistics also reports disturbing findings : A woman is raped somewhere in India every 20 minutes , and the number of children raped has increased by 336 % in the past 10 years .

This culture of impunity is certainly one of the reasons rape has too often become the weapon of choice for frustrated young men who blame women , increasingly visible in the workplace , for their unemployment , and who hope to regain jobs by frightening women back home through sexual violence .

The desire to blame women is fed by a cult of masculinity promoted by corporate and political leaders who serve as role models for the rest of society .

Harassment in India : ` The story you never wanted to hear '

In the course of my work with Apne Aap Women Worldwide , I have seen the steady creeping of a rape culture into the fabric of India . We work to organize women in prostitution to resist their own and their daughters ' rape . The biggest challenge we face is the attitude of politicians , senior police officials , heads of foundations and even policy makers who view rape as a normal part of society . Many have told me : `` Men will be men . ''

Recently , when National Crime Records Bureau pegged West Bengal as the state with the highest incidence of crimes against women , the chief minister contested the bureau 's statistics rather than tackling the problem .

Continually , budget allocations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development are reduced . Debates to ensure equal power sharing between the sexes through the Women 's Reservation Bill have gone nowhere .

But no amount of violence and intimidation is going to force women back into their homes . In fact , homes are often the places where females are in the most danger -- from the time they are conceived to old age . An average Indian female could likely be a victim of foeticide , infanticide , malnourishment , dowry , child marriage , maternal mortality , domestic servitude , prostitution , rape , honor killings and domestic violence -- simply because she is female .

Equipped with better education , women are courageously taking their place in the public sphere as doctors , lawyers , journalists , bankers , politicians , farmers , teachers and more . They are signing up for social justice movements to end the growing inequality and unemployment in our country .

As yet another gang-rape victim suffers in a Mumbai hospital in India , we have to recognize the need to overhaul the criminal justice system .

In December 2012 , India and the world were shocked by the brutal gang rape and beating aboard a moving bus of a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern , who later died of massive internal injuries . It prompted desperate calls for reform , protests and close examination of India 's attitudes toward rape .

But after the initial outrage , it seems that the law has only changed on paper . The rape in Mumbai might not have happened if the culture of rape was truly overcome and sexual assaults were taken seriously .
