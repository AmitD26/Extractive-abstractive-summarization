-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` This is not what I planned , '' Paris Hilton told Piers Morgan in reference to the infamous sex tape that the CNN host said `` catapulted '' the heiress `` into the celebrity stratosphere '' when it was released back in 2003 .

The heiress , socialite , TV personality , model , singer , fashion designer and one woman brand is a guest on Tuesday 's `` Piers Morgan Tonight . ''

`` I did n't want to be known as that , '' continued Hilton . `` And now when people look at me they think that I 'm something I 'm not just because of one incident one night with someone who I was in love with .

`` People assume ` Oh , she 's a slut ' because of one thing that happened to me and it 's hard because I 'll have to live with that for the rest of my life and explain it to my children . And it 's something that 's changed my life forever and I 'll never be able to erase it . ''

Hilton told Morgan that she was in Australia when the tape was released and that she was `` in shock '' when she saw a clip of the video which had actually been filmed in 2001 , two years prior . Paris called the incident `` the most embarrassing , humiliating thing that has ever happened to me in my life . ''

Hilton 's mother , Kathy , who joined her daughter on the show , recalled that Paris did not leave the family 's New York home for three months after the tape was leaked , and during that time the family underwent therapy .

When Morgan asked Hilton what she thought about the people who put the tape out there -- specifically her ex-boyfriend , Rick Salomon -- Hilton said she `` just felt so betrayed . This was not some random guy . This was someone I was with for a few years . '' Later in the interview , she confided that she thinks Salomon is `` a very bad person . ''

Hilton was 20 when the tape was made and recently turned 30 . She told Morgan that she feels like she 's `` really grown in the past couple of years . '' She said she hopes her new show on the Oxygen network , `` The World According To Paris , '' will clear up the `` many misconceptions '' people have about her .

`` This show is all real , '' she said . `` I was finally ready to show who I really was , and I 'm really honest in the show , and there 's a lot of things in the show I ca n't even believe I 'm going to let air . But I want it to be as real as possible and people to get to know me . ''

When Morgan asked the hotel heiress about people 's misconceptions , she replied , `` Just having the last name Hilton , people assume that everything was handed to me and I 've never had to work a day in my life . But in reality , I 've worked so hard , I 've done this all on my own and I do n't take anything from my family . I do everything by myself .

`` Just growing up , my parents never spoiled us . They always made us want to do something on our own . I think I have a name where I have a lot to live up to and I did n't want to just be known as the Hilton granddaughter . I wanted to build my own empire and do something on my own and I think it 's just something that runs in my blood , wanting to be creative and do big things . ''

The CNN host asked whether she said playing the fame game was worth the price .

`` I 've really grown a thick skin over the years and I 've had so many things said about me , and it 's hard , '' Hilton said . `` But I feel like what else could happen at this point . Everything bad that could happen to a person has happened to me . ''

Morgan asked Kathy Hilton whether she would have stopped her daughter from pursing fame if it meant avoiding the pitfalls she has been through .

`` If she did n't have to go through what we had just talked about , yes , obviously , '' she said . `` I mean , I did think she was going to be a veterinarian . ''

Kathy Hilton told Morgan that her daughter was a tomboy as a child , and that `` she did n't even care about clothing or any of that until we moved to New York . ''

Paris Hilton said she does n't think she would be the success she is today without her family 's love and support .

`` I am so fortunate that my parents have been together forever , '' she said . `` They 're so supportive , they 're there for me , they love me ... If I did n't have my parents , I do n't know where I 'd be today . ''

Aside from her new series and recording an album , Hilton told Morgan , `` I have 17 different product lines , so I do everything from fragrances , handbags , clothing , shoes , sunglasses , pet products , stationery , bedding . I do everything . I just launched my 11th fragrance . ''

While Hilton made it clear that she feels uncomfortable discussing money , she did disclose that her brand amasses her more than $ 10 million a year .

`` I do very well for myself , '' said Paris . `` I 'm very proud of what I 've done . ''

Hilton said her brand personifies `` fashion , fun , excitement and amazing products . ''

`` I really am passionate about every single thing I do ... and I 've worked really hard to achieve all this . ''

Hilton , who has been dating businessman and entrepreneur Cy Waits for over a year , told Morgan she has `` never been happier . ''

He just makes me feel so safe , '' she said of Waits . `` He 's so loyal and he 's my best friend . He 's an incredible man . I 'm honestly lucky . ''

While Hilton would n't say whether an engagement is in the immediate future , she said she could n't imagine herself with anyone else , and that `` I 'd love to have a family and children in the next couple of years , definitely . ''

Asked how she wanted to be remembered , she told Morgan , `` as someone who made people smile and one who enjoyed life to the fullest and was a good person with a good heart . ''
