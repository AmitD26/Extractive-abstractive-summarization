In an intensive care unit in Memphis , a virus ravages the body of a 7-year-old who 's in heart and kidney failure . He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil .

In a cabinet in Durham , North Carolina , there 's a drug that could likely help Josh Hardy , but the drug company wo n't give it to him . They 're adamant that spending the time to help Josh and others like him will slow down their efforts to get this drug on the market .

Helping Josh , they say , means hurting others .

When asked how he will feel if Josh dies -- and he 's in critical condition , so sadly that could happen soon -- the president of the company that makes the drug does n't hesitate to answer .

`` Horrible , '' said Kenneth Moch . He would feel horrible and heartbroken .

But still , he said there 's no way he 's going to change his mind . There 's no way he 's going to give Josh this drug .

` We 're begging them '

It 's called `` compassionate use , '' but sometimes it feels anything but compassionate .

Here 's the way it works : According to the Food and Drug Administration , if someone has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease and has tried and failed other available treatments , they can ask a drug company for an experimental drug , one that they 're still studying and has not yet been approved by the FDA .

Companies often say yes : The FDA approved 974 compassionate use arrangements in fiscal year 2013 .

In cancer drug battle , both sides appeal to ethics

But pharmaceutical companies often say no , as they did to Josh Hardy .

`` Our son will die without this drug , '' said Todd Hardy , Josh 's father . `` We 're begging them to give it to us . ''

So now , like many families , the Hardys have turned to the media , Facebook , and change.org to pressure the drug company to change its mind .

Countless members of `` Josh 's army '' have responded with angry tweets to @chimerix , telling them to `` open their hearts , '' asking the executives how they can sleep at night .

`` Everyone is watching , '' one tweeter warned the company . Others have tweeted out the e-mail addresses of the company 's board members . Chimerix executives say they 've received physical threats .

Moch , the company president , has read these tweets and said he is heartbroken , but the issue is complex and unsuitable for a 144-long character debate .

At its very simplest , this is it : Chimerix is going full speed ahead to get the drug on the market hopefully by the end of 2016 , and if they spend time and money on compassionate use cases , it would greatly hinder their effort to get the drug , brincidofovir , on the market and available to everyone .

The company would have to dish out $ 50,000 per compassionate-use patient , since insurance does n't usually pay for experimental drugs , Moch said . And perhaps even more important than the money , it would divert manpower in this 50-person company , since they 'd have to handle the requests and then get the patient 's records and follow up with them , as required by the FDA .

`` If this were just one patient wanting this drug , then this would be a very different question , '' he said . `` But it 's yes to all or no to all . ''

From 2009 to 2012 , the company did give out the drug under compassionate use to 451 patients , Moch said , but at least at that time , the information gleaned from those 451 compassionate use patients was helpful to the Chimerix study and helped move the science along . But currently doctors do n't really learn very much , if anything , from compassionate use patients , so the patients do n't help get the drug to market .

Beat cancer four times

Josh 's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old . Over the years , cancer turned up in his thymus , lung , and bone marrow , and each time Josh beat it .

But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system , and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body .

They gave him an antiviral drug , an intravenous form of brincidofovir , but it ravaged his kidneys .

His doctors at St. Jude 's Children 's Research Hospital said not to give up hope . Since they 'd been part of the brincidofovir studies , they 'd seen how in sometimes just a week or two , the the oral form of the drug could get rid of an adenovirus without damaging the kidneys . Now all they had to do was ask the company that makes brincidofovir : Chimerix , Inc. .

On February 12 , the St. Jude 's doctors called a Chimerix executive , Dr. Marion Morrison , and asked for permission to use brincidofovir . She said no .

On March 5 , the doctors asked again . Two days later they got an answer by e-mail from another executive , Dr. Herve Mommeja-Marin , who said the company was not `` in a position to provide drug for this and other subjects in similar circumstances due to a limited inventory and our limited resources . ''

` He holds our son 's life in his hands '

Moch wants you to know that he has children of his own , and if his child had an aggressive adenovirus like Josh , he 'd be doing the same thing as Todd and Aimee Hardy .

`` There are no words to express our compassion for this young boy and his family and what they 're going through , '' he said .

Art Caplan , a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center , said he feels for both the Hardys and for Moch .

`` We ca n't ask the company to turn into a philanthropy or their investors will back out , '' he said .

It 's not just the $ 50,000 per patient that might make investors squeamish , Caplan said , but compassionate cases can make a drug look bad . By definition , compassionate use patients are extremely sick , and might not do well with the drug . Companies have to report that poor outcome to the FDA in its application to market the drug .

Perhaps there 's another way to handle compassionate use requests , Caplan suggests . Perhaps a company like Chimerix could agree to give the drug only to the very most dire cases , and put a cap on the number of patients they help .

`` They might want to open the door a little more broadly , '' he said . `` They might want to show a little compassion . ''

But right now , Chimerix stands firm that their compassionate use program is almost completely over .

`` We 've had employees who ask for the drug for family members who are close to death , and the answer has been no , '' said Mommeja-Marin , the Chimerix executive .

But that 's not good enough for the Hardys .

`` He holds our son 's life in his hands , '' Todd Hardy said . `` This is just beyond belief to me . ''
