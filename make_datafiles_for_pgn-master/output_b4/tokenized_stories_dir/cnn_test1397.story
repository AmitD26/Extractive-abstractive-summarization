You can roll it , ferment it , dry it and put holes in it .

It can be stinky enough to be banned on public transport , crawling with maggots or hard enough to break your teeth .

Cheese is savored all around the world -- even if some of it is an acquired taste .

Casu Marzu -LRB- Italy -RRB-

Like caviar , Casu Marzu is enjoyed only by a select population .

That 's because it 's served with live maggots .

It does have a fan base in Sardinia , where sheep farmers for centuries have made pecorino cheese and left it to rot and attract flies .

When the flies ' eggs hatch the transformation takes place and the cheese becomes Casu Marzu .

It 's then consumed with relish or perhaps trepidation -- it has an aftertaste that lasts for hours .

Gordon Ramsay called it `` the most dangerous cheese in the world . ''

Where to try it : Casu Marzu contains live insects so it ca n't be imported . Sardinia is therefore still the best option at associations such as Agugliastra in Lanusei , Sardinia ; www.agugliastra.it .

Milbenkase -LRB- Germany -RRB-

Just when you thought the Italians took the proverbial cheese for their maggots , along come the Germans with their mite excrement variety .

Produced in Wurchwitz from quark , it sits among dust mites for several months , with some rye for them to nibble on .

The mites excrete an enzyme to ripen the cheese that turns it progressively yellow , red-brown and then black , at which point it 's eaten , mites and all .

Bitter and zesty , the cheese is said to have curative effects for allergies to house dust .

If you 'd like some cheese with your mites , there 's a mite-shaped memorial in Würchwitz -- in the hollow base there 's some Milbenkase left for passersby to try .

Where to try it : Locally in Wurchwitz , Germany .

Yak cheese -LRB- Tibetan communities -RRB-

Imagine sucking and gnawing a piece of cheese-flavored resin for several hours and you 'll get an idea of how hard this cheese is -- it could in fact break your teeth , although there are softer varieties .

The cheese is made by wrapping the curd from yak 's milk in cloth and pressing it to get rid of the water .

When it dries out it 's cut into pieces and allowed to dry , often over a wood fire .

It 's earthy and tasty .

The yak is the male of the species and does n't produce milk , so it really should be called nak cheese after the female .

Where to try it : Markets in Tibetan areas of China , India , Nepal and Bhutan .

Airag cheese -LRB- Central Asia -RRB-

Airag cheese , or horse milk cheese , is common in Central Asia where the horse is still integral to life in many places .

To make airag , a mare is milked during foaling season and the milk left to ferment with an agent such as last season 's airag .

It 's either suspended next to the ger/yurt entrance so anyone passing can stir it or it 's tied to a saddle to achieve the same effect over a day 's riding .

The airag is then added to boiled milk to curdle it , filtered through a fabric bag and pressed .

It can be eaten fresh or dried .

The dry variety is a popular snack out on the steppe , softened by soaking it in tea or soup .

Where to try it : Out on the Central Asian steppe in the ger/yurt of a nomadic family .

Camel 's milk cheese -LRB- Ethiopia , Mauritania , Sudan and Bedouin communities -RRB-

Nomadic herders across Africa have been milking their camels for centuries .

Not only are the resilient beasts a more viable alternative to cows in dry climates , but their rich , earthy milk has more fat and protein .

However , making cheese from camel milk is a more difficult process , so herders use camel rennet from pieces of the animal 's stomach to coagulate the milk and create curds .

This may account for its sour taste and pungent aroma .

To enjoy camelbert options you 'll have to visit supermarket shelves in Nouakchott , the UAE and Saudi Arabia .

It 's also found in Kazakhstan .

Where to try it : Supermarket shelves in Nouakchott , the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia ; Costa Coffee in the UK ; Starbucks in Dubai .

Human milk cheese -LRB- New York -RRB-

When the freezer of New York chef Daniel Angerer started to overflow with his wife 's breast milk , he decided to experiment with it rather than throw it out .

He blogged about the process online with photos of mother 's milk with beets and romaine , dehydrated porcini mushroom and onion chutney .

For those feeling queasy , rest assured the cheese was never produced in his restaurant or sold .

As for commercial opportunities , lactating mothers ca n't produce anything like the quantity of breast milk needed to make large quantities of cheese .

Where to try it : Not yet commercially available .

American cheese

In a country that celebrates National Grilled Cheese Day , it should come as no surprise that American cheese remains a staple on grocery shelves -- the texture and meltability are perfect for toasted sandwiches and burgers .

Technically , of course , American cheese is n't even real cheese -- ingredients include milk , whey , milkfat , salt , gelatine , milk powder , dyed orange , artificial flavors and oil .

The odd concoction is blended with a generic processed cheese to form the smooth , creamy and super-melty slices that are either loved , tolerated or abhorred around the United States .

Where to try it : McDonald 's , American food supermarkets .

Lichen cheese -LRB- Canada -RRB-

When a small Quebec company found out the Inuit once ate a fermented lichen from the stomach of caribou that tasted like blue cheese , they decided to try it for themselves .

Using Quebec goat 's milk and lichen , the company creates a mold from roasting and boiling the lichen , then lets it rest and ferment .

The cheese is still in its experimental stage .

Where to try it : Société d'Orignal , Montreal , Canada .

Deer milk cheese -LRB- New Zealand -RRB-

Reindeer milk cheese has been produced among the Sami communities in Finland for years .

Now , cheese from the humble red deer may soon become a hallmark of New Zealand .

The combined work of scientists and a cheese maker have resulted in the first cheese from the Kiwi bambi .

At $ 100 per liter , the rich deer milk is n't cheap , but with half of the world 's farmed red deer production in New Zealand , farmers are getting excited about the possibility of having a product to sell beyond venison .

Where to try it : Buy it from Whitestone cheese company , North Otago , New Zealand .

Alpaca and llama cheese -LRB- Andean communities -RRB-

Life on the harsh Altiplano would be a struggle without the alpacas and llamas that give their dung for fuel , hide for leather , wool for clothing and milk for cheese .

Comical though they may appear -- they even give the occasional spit and unusual noise -- they 're a little tricky to milk .

Once extracted , though , their whole milk can be made into a long-lasting cheese that 's salty , rich and heavy in texture .

This finds its way into markets and local food like empanadas , though most travelers come across it only when visiting locals .

Where to try it : Local markets , Andes region , South America .

Donkey cheese -LRB- Serbia -RRB-

At the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve , 50 kilometers out of Belgrade , you can get your hands on pule , or donkey cheese .

While healthy -- it has 60 times more vitamin C than cow 's milk -- donkeys only produce 200 ml of milk a day .

About 25 liters are required to make just one kilogram of cheese .

That means the white , crumbly pule is both limited and costly .

Currently it goes for about € 1,000 a kilo , or $ 576 a pound .

The reserve also makes soap , a liquor and facial cream from the milk .

Cleopatra claimed her beauty was due to bathing in donkey milk .

Where to try it : In the Zasavica Special Nature Reserve , or buy it online at www.zasavica.org.rs .
