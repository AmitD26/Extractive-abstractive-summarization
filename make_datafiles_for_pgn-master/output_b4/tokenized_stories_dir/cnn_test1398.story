Finding the most famous chimpanzees in the world is a task that would test the most intrepid of explorers .

Reaching the picturesque hinterland of Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania is just the start .

A two-hour boat ride across the vast waters of Lake Tanganyika follows . Finally , we disembark and begin to trek through the dense forests of Gombe for a further hour before the chimps in question are finally glimpsed .

Peering through branches towards the canopies , we spy a mother and her two young boys feasting on palm nuts .

It was close to this spot in 1960 that the Jane Goodall , the British primatologist widely regarded as the world 's foremost expert on chimpanzees , began her near 55-year study of one specially selected chimp family .

Goodall , now 80 years old , would sit for hours and observe the complex social structures and interactions of her subjects .

The research of that one family and the subsequent generations it has spawned continues to this day , providing ever more fascinating insights into the behavior of the closest living relatives of human beings .

The magic of Gombe

`` The magic of Gombe is two factors , '' said Emily Boehm , a PhD candidate at the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center , here to study the chimps .

`` It 's the opportunity to be here with a well-habituated group of chimpanzees , to come into the forest every day with knowledgeable field assistants . It 's -LRB- also -RRB- the long term data , because Jane Goodall started this study in the early 60s . ''

`` We have this incredible opportunity to know the chimps here now , and also their mothers and fathers and their grandmothers and all this incredible information that we have on them . ''

Researchers like Emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at Gombe .

There are an estimated 100 chimpanzees there today , broken up into three different communities . The group Goodall studied has the most , with around 60 members .

Meat eaters

Even after 50-plus years , researchers are still surprised by what they learn . Before the program began , chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat .

This is a trait we observe as we watch a group of chimps track Colobus monkeys swinging in the trees above them . We also see another industrious bunch fashion tools to try dislodge termites from beneath a mound .

According to senior researcher at the Jane Goodall Foundation , Dr Anthony Collins , activities like these display a high level of intelligence .

`` They 're so much like humans . There are so many similarities in what they do , the relationships they have to each other , just all kinds of ways , there are subtle communications between them , '' Collins said .

He points to the example of how chimps will look to reconcile and embrace one another after a fight or confrontation . `` They have reassurance and forgiveness of things which go wrong , '' he said .

Human threat

Despite the behavioral and genetic similarities , however , the chimps proximity to rural human settlements can often be problematic and detrimental to their own well-being .

`` In some places that they live , there are lions , leopards , pythons . But on the whole , probably their main enemy is something like me , humans , '' Collins continued .

'' -LRB- Some -RRB- people hunt chimps for eating , some places they get bits of chimps for cures , even witchcraft , and for a while there was a trade in baby chimps for their medical research and things like circuses and zoos . ''

In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe , chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior .

But that 's not always the case in other sectors of the Tanzanian bush where large swathes of land have been transformed for agricultural purposes .

This has resulted in a huge number of trees being cut down that would otherwise offer shelter for communities of chimpanzees . Sadly , the best habitats for chimps are often also the best habitat for the likes of nomadic herders .

Sustainable farming

Recognizing these problems , the Jane Goodall Institute is working to teach the local population about sustainable farming so the forest is preserved .

Through the Gombe-Masito Program , they aim to show villagers that sustainable agricultural techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species .

Preventing deforestation also has the knock on effect of ensuring sediments from the forest continue to run into Lake Tanganyika , maintaining the finely balanced ecosystem beneath the water and the trade of the fisherman in lakeside communities as a result .

These deep environmental connections are enough to convince some that chimpanzees are key to the future of rural Tanzania .

`` In my opinion , chimps are important for the country 's economic growth , '' said Aristides Aloice Kashula , a Gombe-Masito Program forest officer . `` They can be used as a national symbol for tourist attraction into this area of Tanzania , generating income which should later be used for sustainable development of the communities . ''

`` They are also important in that their habitat , if well conserved , can act as good vegetation covering for the forest . ''

`` But also again , chimps are a global species , so they have to be kept for generations and generation to come . ''

That 's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse .
