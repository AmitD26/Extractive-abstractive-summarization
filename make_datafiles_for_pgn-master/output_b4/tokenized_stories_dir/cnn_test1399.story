A real protest , a fake Google employee , a viral video and some shiny buses have brought attention to the growing tensions between San Francisco 's moneyed tech-sector workers and the city 's working poor and middle class .

Private bus lines snake through San Francisco , transporting employees in climate-controlled , Wi-Fi-enabled , cushioned comfort to their jobs at large Silicon Valley companies . Offered as a free employee perk by Google , Facebook , Apple , Yahoo and other companies , the large buses have become a symbol of income inequality here and a lightning rod for resentment .

On Monday , organizers staged a protest at a Google bus stop in San Francisco with signs that read `` Warning : Two-Tier System '' and `` Public $ $ $ $ , Private Gains . '' A video taken at the scene showed a confrontation between what seemed to be a protester and a Google employee who yelled , `` Why do n't you go to a city that can afford it ? This is a city for the right people who can afford it . ''

Only , in a very San Francisco twist , the Google employee was a fake , played by union organizer and sometime Occupy protester Max Alper , who described the stunt later as `` political theater to demonstrate what is happening to the city . ''

Some skeptics on Twitter immediately detected that something was off about the confrontation , saying the so-called Google employee 's rants were too perfectly aligned with the stereotype of the spoiled , overpaid techie . But the clumsy stunt spread online has called national attention to the issue .

Critics claim that the buses block bike lanes and traffic , and frequently squat in existing public bus stops . They also say the money that companies sink into the lines could be spent on improving existing public transportation for everyone .

It 's similar to the private-vs . - public school argument in many cities . People who can afford to segregate themselves do so at the expense of the public institutions that depend on the support of people from all income levels .

Residents who do n't work for cash-rich tech companies are left to take San Francisco 's less-reliable 101-year-old public transit system , MUNI , with its mix of older buses , trains and trollies that link up with the BART and Caltrain train networks .

As rents rise , people who ca n't afford to stay in the city are pushed farther out , and their dependance on reliable public transportation to get to their jobs increases .

That 's no small percentage of the city 's population . In San Francisco , 23.4 % of residents are below the poverty threshold , according to the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality .

In fairness , the buses are not evil on wheels : They 're meant to keep cars off the road to minimize congestion and pollution .

`` The private shuttle buses are a visible symbol of economic inequality , so they are a convenient place for people to vent their frustration . But they are not the problem , '' said Gabriel Metcalf , executive director at Bay Area urban policy organization SPUR . `` The problem is that our public transit system is n't good enough and that , for historical reasons , many of the tech companies are located in suburban campuses that do n't have transit . ''

Google actually has showed a great interest in solving transportation problems and is working on a driverless car that also aims to reduce traffic . But , like with private buses , the technology will mostly benefit those who can afford it .

Transportation is just one of a number of issues related to the tech industry that have inflamed tensions in the city . Soaring housing prices and gentrification , also blamed on the influx of high-paying tech jobs , have longtime residents worried that the city will be overtaken by the newly wealthy , pushing out middle - and working-class residents .

They worry that without its communities of artists , activists and immigrants , San Francisco 's unique character and history will be paved over for new condos with perks like dog-washing areas and music rehearsal rooms .

`` A city without its nurses , its teachers , its artists , its waiters , its bus drivers , its cops , its musicians and writers and grandmothers as residents is a monoculture -- as sterile as a forest of a single commercial tree species , '' Timothy Egan wrote in a recent New York Times opinion piece .

San Francisco 's potential for growth is stunted by bodies of water on three sides . According to the U.S. Census Bureau , 825,863 people live in San Francisco County , compared with 8.3 million in all of New York City , which has about twice the landmass .

Low vacancy rates and surging demand have increased the median rental rate in San Francisco to $ 3,414 . Home prices in the area have risen 22 % in the past three years .

The recent demand for housing is heavily fueled by the influx of high-paid technology employees . Software engineers make an average of $ 127,143 a year at Google , $ 121,507 at Facebook and $ 124,630 at Apple , according to Glassdoor.com .

These young workers need someplace to live , and many choose to reside in vibrant San Francisco and commute to their sleepy company headquarters farther south on the peninsula .

Matters are made worse when people associated with the industry voice controversial opinions about the class divides .

A couple of days after the bus protest , the masses got the blabbermouth , tone-deaf techie they craved when Silicon Valley entrepreneur Greg Gopman posted his thoughts on the city 's homeless population to Facebook .

`` There is nothing more grotesque than walking down market st in San Francisco . Why the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy , homeless , drug dealers , dropouts , and trash I have no clue , '' he wrote in the rant .

Gopman went on to compare the homeless to hyenas and call them a disgrace .

`` There is an area of town for degenerates and an area of town for the working class . There is nothing positive gained from having them so close to us , '' he said . He has since taken to his Facebook page to apologize .

These types of outbursts happen every so often on social media and blogging platforms like Medium . In August , entrepreneur Peter Shih included the homeless in his list of 10 things he hates about San Francisco , along with unattractive women and bad public transit .

Obviously , these individual entrepreneurs do not speak for the Bay Area 's entire population of tech workers . But their outbursts are the sort of attitude Silicon Valley would prefer not to be associated with .

The buses may be the most visible and convenient targets for anti-gentrification activists , but the underlying problem wo n't be fixed if buses stop blocking traffic .

Some potential solutions include getting tech companies to relocate nearer to public transit and getting the city to invest in improving the current transportation system , according to Metcalf . Other improvements he suggests include raising the minimum wage , adding housing for all income levels and improving education so the people growing up in the city can compete for those big-money jobs nearby .

Metcalf is optimistic that the fast-growing economy can benefit all of San Francisco .

`` We just need to take the next steps and make sure we do everything possible to connect everyone with this growing economy and to make a new round of investments in infrastructure , which will lay the foundations for the future , '' he said .
