More federal prisoners serving sentences for non-violent crimes can apply for clemency after the Justice Department announced new rules Wednesday .

Deputy Attorney General James Cole announced that the department would broaden the criteria for clemency , a move that is expected to lead to thousands of prisoners -- most serving drug sentences -- filing applications to President Barack Obama seeking to commute their sentences .

The changes are part of a broader effort by the Obama administration to modify sentencing laws , allowing for use of rehabilitation and other alternatives to deal with non-violent drug offenders and those who previously faced tough mandatory minimum sentences .

Attorney General Eric Holder previewed some of the changes Monday by announcing plans to assign more lawyers to handle an anticipated flood of clemency requests .

Crack cocaine at heart of once-common sentencing disparity

`` We are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates , candidates who have a clean prison record , do not present a threat to public safety , and were sentenced under out-of-date laws that have since been changed , and are no longer seen as appropriate , '' Cole said at a news conference .

The clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions : they must be low-level , non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today . They must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison , with no history of violence before or during their prison term .

The pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort Holder calls `` Smart on Crime , '' which also seeks to remedy the once-common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine , based on guidelines first enacted by Congress more than 25 years ago .

Of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system , some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners . But the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications .

The Justice Department says it does n't know how many people will end up qualifying because it depends on the applications and how they fit the new criteria . The President has final authority to decide who gets clemency .

Obama has been criticized by some civil rights groups for being stingy with his pardons and commutations . But many praised the Justice Department 's decision as a good initial step , including a coalition of groups working on sentencing guidelines .

The announcement `` marks the beginning of the end of the age of mass incarceration , '' said Jerry Cox , president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers . `` We must seize this historic opportunity to start the process of remedying decades of cruel and unnecessarily harsh sentencing policies . ''

Cole also announced the appointment of Deborah Leff to lead the department 's Office of the Pardon Attorney , which has come under fire for being slow to review a backlog of applications .

Cole said the department was setting up an online application system and working with pro-bono attorneys who will assist prisoners in their applications .

Mary Price , general counsel for the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums , which advocates for changes to drug sentencing laws , welcomed Cole 's announcement . `` The doors of the Office of the Pardon Attorney have been closed to petitioners for too long . This announcement signals a truly welcome change ; the culture of ` no ' that has dominated that office is being transformed , '' she said .

The push to relax sentencing laws has the support of some conservative Republican lawmakers , who believe it is a way to reduce spending on federal prisons and to use alternatives to incarceration to deal with drug problems . However , lawmakers want the changes to be made through Congress rather than through the president 's executive power .

`` I hope President Obama is not seeking to change sentencing policy unilaterally . Congress , not the President , has authority to make sentencing policy . He should continue to work with Congress rather than once again going it alone , and I 'm willing to work with the President on these issues . '' Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , said this week .

Cole , in his remarks Wednesday , said the issue is one of fairness . `` Older , stringent punishments that are out of line with sentences imposed under today 's laws erode people 's confidence in our criminal justice system , and I am confident that this initiative will go far to promote the most fundamental of American ideals -- equal justice under law , '' Cole said .

Three years ago , Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act to address the larger issue of drug sentencing disparities . Sentencing guidelines provided for a 100-to-1 ratio between the penalties for crack cocaine offenses versus those for powdered cocaine , but the fair sentencing law reduced the disparity to 18-to-1 .
