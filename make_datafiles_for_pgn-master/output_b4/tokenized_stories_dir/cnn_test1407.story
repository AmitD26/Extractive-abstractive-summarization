By 2030 , the top cancer killers in the United States will be lung , pancreas and liver , according to a new report published Monday in the American Association for Cancer Research 's journal .

Lung cancer is already the top killer overall , but pancreatic and liver cancer will surpass the cancers currently considered the second and third leading causes of death , researchers say . Right now , second most dangerous is breast cancer for women and prostate cancer for men ; and third is colorectal cancer for both men and women .

Researchers looked at trends in cancer incidence and death rates between 2006 and 2010 , and used that data -- combined with expected U.S. demographic changes -- to predict numbers for 2030 .

Overall , the cancer-related death rate has been decreasing , researchers say , as a result of improved screening and treatment options . Yet while deaths from breast , prostate and colon cancers are projected to drop , deaths caused by liver , pancreatic , bladder and leukemia cancers are expected to increase .

In fact , liver and pancreatic cancers will surpass breast and prostate to become the second and third-leading causes of cancer-related deaths , the researchers say .

`` We 've been able to turn the tide in other cancers , with an investment in -LRB- research -RRB- , '' said lead author Lynn Matrisian , vice president of scientific and medical affairs at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network , which funded the study . `` We 're hoping that with increased effort ... we will be able to impact and change those projections . ''

The rate of pancreatic cancer has been slowly increasing for the past 15 years , says Dr. Otis Brawley , chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society . Some of that rise can be attributed to the prevalence of obesity and diabetes .

`` Many Americans are not aware that the combination of obesity , high-caloric intake and lack of physical activity is the second-leading cause of cancer in the U.S. , '' Brawley said . `` It is linked to at least 12 types of cancer , of which these are two . This is an American problem ... the rise in pancreatic cancer is not as severe as in Europe where obesity is less of an issue . ''

Obesity may affect cancer patients ' outcomes

Overall , the number of cancer cases is expected to increase over the next 16 years , due to the rapidly aging population . In 2010 , the United States had about 1.5 million cases of cancer ; in 2030 , researchers expect that number to reach 2.1 million .

`` We 're living much longer in the United States , so the number of people 65 age and older will be much greater , '' Matrisian said . `` And that 's , of course , one of the biggest risk factors for cancer : Age . ''

Lung , breast , prostate and colorectal cancers are currently the most common in the United States . Known as the `` big four , '' these cancers have the highest incidence rates and receive the most research funding from the National Cancer Institute .

This is unlikely to change by 2030 , the researchers say , except for colorectal cancer , which is expected to be surpassed by thyroid , melanoma and uterine cancers in total number of cases .

`` The decrease in colorectal cancer , falling from the top four incidence and top two in deaths , seems to be primarily the result of advances in colorectal cancer screening , '' the report authors write .

The dramatic increase in thyroid cases is not a new epidemic , they say , but simply an increase in the number of cases being diagnosed . And while thyroid cancer has a 98 % five-year survival rate , only 6 % of pancreatic cancer patients are alive five years after diagnosis .

The pancreas is difficult to scan with current imaging technologies , Matrisian says , because of its location in the body . And pancreatic tumors are often surrounded by dense tissue that render drugs useless . Surgery is the only treatment known to cure pancreatic cancer , but less than 20 % of cases are operable , the report says .

`` If we want to change the death rate for these diseases , it is necessary to increase the investment in understanding them and identifying early detection strategies , '' the report says .
