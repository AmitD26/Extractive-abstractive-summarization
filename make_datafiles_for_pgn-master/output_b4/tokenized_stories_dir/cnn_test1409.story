The Instagram picture , believed to have been taken at Phuket nightlife hotspot Bangla Road , was captioned `` Look who was talkin dirty to me ! '' and `` liked '' by more than 230,000 viewers .

Thai authorities react swiftly

Officials in Thailand quickly went on the defensive when outrage over Rihanna 's loris image spread .

The government ordered the Ministry of Natural Resources and local Phuket officials to urgently investigate the matter , reported local website Phuketnews.com .

Sunday night , a raid on suspected touts led to the arrest of two men , aged 16 and 20 , who were taken to a local police station and presented to the media .

`` It is very difficult to do the raids because the touts have spies , '' Awat Nithikul , leader of the patrol officers , told The Phuket News .

`` If someone hears that the police are coming their way , there will be a person who calls the touts and tells them to move . But this is a big deal because it might affect Thailand 's reputation . ''

The newspaper says the two arrested touts are waiting to be bailed , and the two lorises in their possession will be returned to a national park in the nearby province of Phang Nga .

Rihanna 's X-rated experiences

It was n't just the loris issue that stirred up controversy during Rihanna 's visit .

Rihanna 's tweets about her X-rated experiences relating to some of the country 's more infamous tourist attractions also led to red-faced explanations by embarrassed officials .

According to the Bangkok Post , an English-language daily newspaper , Rihanna 's tweets led to one official saying , `` Sex shows were completely against the law . ''

`` The authorities and law officials have surveyed the area to arrest and fine those involved -LSB- in staging sex shows -RSB- , '' he said . `` But the shows still happen . ''

On the flip side , some of the photos posted during Rihanna 's holiday will likely be appreciated by the local tourism industry -- including multiple shots of her in bathing suits that show off the area 's gorgeous scenery -- given she does have more than 9.7 million Instagram followers .
