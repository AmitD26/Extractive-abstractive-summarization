Followers of the Paleo Diet may go prehistoric on U.S. News & World Report this week . The publication has ranked the controversial diet last on its `` Best Diets Overall '' list for 2014 .

Each year , U.S. News & World Report asks experts to rank various nutrition plans to help consumers make informed decisions . This year the panel evaluated 32 of the most popular diets .

To be top-rated , a diet has to be relatively easy to follow , nutritious , safe , effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease .

First popularized in the 1970s , the Paleo Diet asks people to follow a diet similar to those who lived during the Paleolithic era , between 2.6 million and 10,000 years ago . This means eating like hunters and gathers -- consuming lots of produce and animal protein , while avoiding sugar , grains , legumes and dairy altogether .

`` If the cavemen did n't eat it , you should n't either , '' U.S. News & World Report summarized .

The diet has gained a significant following in recent years , especially among the CrossFit crowd . `` Paleo Diet '' was the most searched diet term on Google in 2013 .

Being last on the Best Diets list does n't mean Paleo is the worst diet ever -LRB- the `` Cookie Diet '' did n't even make the list -RRB- . But U.S. News & World Report 's experts said the Paleo Diet was too restrictive for most people to follow long term , and that it limited some essential nutrients . They also cited a lack of research proving the Paleo Diet 's cardiovascular health and weight loss benefits in their ranking .

The Paleo Diet tied for last place on the list alongside the Dukan diet , which is also a high-protein , low-carbohydrate approach .

For the fourth year in a row , the DASH Diet Eating Plan was named the best overall diet . DASH , or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension , was developed by the National Institutes of Health for people with high blood pressure . But it is also effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing a person 's risk for heart disease , stroke , kidney stones and diabetes , its website states .

Unlike many diet plans , DASH does n't cut out or extremely restrict certain foods . Its focus is on limiting daily sodium intake . The meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day , four to six servings of vegetables , four to six servings of fruit , two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes .

The diet 's only downfalls , the expert panel said , are that it takes some `` grunt work '' to adhere to , and that it may cost more than a diet based on `` processed , fatty , sugary foods . ''

Following DASH on the best overall list was the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet , which also was created by the National Institutes of Health . Next in line were the Mayo Clinic Diet , the Mediterranean Diet and Weight Watchers -- all tied for third place . This is the same as last year 's ranking .

U.S. News & World Report also published several other lists , including best weight-loss diets , best diabetes diets , best commercial diet plans and easiest diets to follow .

Weight Watchers topped the best weight-loss , best commercial diet plan and easiest to follow lists . Also high on several lists were the Jenny Craig plan and `` The Biggest Loser '' plan .
