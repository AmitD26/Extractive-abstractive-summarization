So , Justin Bieber has done something stupid again . This time , he made the headlines by allegedly smoking pot on a chartered airplane and being rude and verbally abusive to the crew on a flight to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey .

Is he just another rich teen idol blowing off a little testosterone ? Sure . But seriously , his bad behavior is getting a bit out of control .

For those who may never have flown aboard a charter , think of it like a bigger , swankier limousine where the passengers in the back are pretty much free to do whatever they want .

In a regular airplane , the line in the sand is a bit clearer when it comes to passenger conduct . Unruly behavior is not tolerated on airlines like Delta or American Airlines . Get rowdy and obnoxious enough and most captains would tell the passengers they were landing the airplane at the nearest airport if they did n't calm down .

On the chartered airplane that carried Bieber , his father and 10 friends , the flight attendant was verbally abused so much so that she took refuge near the cockpit , according to a police report . The report also said that the captain asked the Beiber entourage more than once to stop smoking marijuana , but those demands were ignored .

Worried that the intoxicating fumes would eventually make their way to the cockpit , the pilots donned their emergency oxygen masks . Luckily , all went well and the airplane landed safely .

In the great rulebook of flying , this easily qualifies as interference with the flight crew . However , even though the plane was met by Customs agents and the police upon landing , and the cabin still smelled like marijuana , none of the crew members wanted to press charges . Who has the resources to sue a pop star who can hire the best lawyer money can buy ?

Bieber got off easy in this incident . But it could have been a disaster .

What if the crew of the chartered jet , trying to be nice to this unruly bunch of well-paying customers , had n't put on the oxygen masks ? What if the fumes had gotten them high before they put on those masks ? Instead of a bunch of crazies arguing with the flight crew , you could have a flight crew impaired as well .

Imagine a now-impaired flight crew approaching some of the busiest airspace in the world . Could they have managed to get the airplane down on the ground in one piece ? Maybe . But maybe not , because when you 're impaired your thinking is off .

Or , what if one of the passengers , already high as a kite , had wandered up front and distracted the pilots -LRB- chartered planes do n't usually have the same secure doors as airliners -RRB- ... just enough that they missed an important radio call or failed to notice another nearby airplane ? If you were on an airliner headed for Newark or LaGuardia , how would you feel knowing the guys in some nearby business jet are loopy ? Or imagine if the airplane had slid off the runway during landing , or sailed through the airport fence because the crew was n't really in control ? The profit the charter company made carrying the Bieber entourage would not even cover the attorney 's fees in a lawsuit .

The flight attendant on the flight said she 'd never fly with these passengers again , and good for her . The charter company should never carry the Bieber entourage again , either , because these people do n't belong in an airplane where they can hurt someone else .

Most captains I know would have put the safety of the crew , the passengers and the people on the ground above everything else . Should any company fly Bieber after this ? I hope not , but a wealthy pop star usually gets his way .
