The man accused of killing a dozen people in a shooting rampage at a Colorado movie theater had offered to plead guilty if authorities would spare his life .

But the prosecutor denied that request Monday , announcing that he will seek the state 's highest punishment for shooting suspect James Holmes : the death penalty .

`` It is my determination and my intention that in this case , for James Eagan Holmes , justice is death , '' Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said .

Speaking directly with dozens of victims ' family members , Brauchler said , helped inform his choice .

Many of them watched the prosecutor announce his intentions in court Monday .

Bryan Beard , whose close friend was killed in the massacre , said one thought ran through his mind : `` Thank goodness . I am so happy this is happening . ''

`` The only way death will receive justice when somebody murders somebody else is death , '' Beard told CNN Denver affiliate KMGH-TV during a break in Monday 's court proceedings . `` I guess you fight fire with fire . ''

Beard told reporters that if Holmes is executed , he wants to attend .

`` I 've already said , give me a front-row ticket . ''

New trial date

But the legal wrangling in the case is just revving up , and Holmes ' trial wo n't begin until next year .

The trial was originally scheduled for August , but a judge Monday pushed back the start date to February 3 and said it could be delayed further . Once it starts , the trial is expected to last four months .

Public defender Tamara Brady argued that it is important to provide enough time to present arguments in the case .

`` Your honor , this case is the most important matter this courtroom and this courthouse will ever hear , '' she said . `` They 're trying to execute our client . ''

Last week defense attorneys filed documents saying Holmes had offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life behind bars in exchange for avoiding the death penalty .

Prosecutors took the defense to task for publicly offering it , saying they had n't been given enough information to even consider such a deal .

`` Not only improper , but grossly improper , '' prosecutors said in a Thursday court filing . `` For the intended purpose of generating predictable publicity . ''

The case against Holmes

Attorneys on both sides are under a gag order , leaving case watchers to divine tactics from court documents .

Federal agents have said the 25-year-old former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months .

Authorities said Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives , then traveled to the movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , armed with weapons , tear gas and body armor . He planned to ambush audience members during a screening of `` The Dark Knight Rises , '' authorities said , and he did .

Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater , shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats .

At the end of the July 20 rampage , 12 people were dead and 58 were wounded .

Tom Teves , the father of shooting victim Alex Teves , told CNN 's Piers Morgan Live Monday night that he thinks Holmes should get the same mercy he showed his victims .

`` I have no interest in understanding him , '' he said . `` My interest would be to see him exterminated . ''

Attorneys prepare an insanity defense

Holmes faces 166 counts of murder and attempted murder for the shooting .

Last month , a judge entered a standard plea of not guilty for Holmes .

His parents sat among reporters in the courtroom during Monday 's hearing . As the prosecutor announced his plans to pursue the death penalty , Holmes ' father put his arm around his mother . Both of them rocked back and forth .

Eerie sounds of cell phones amid disaster

Holmes ' attorneys have suggested they intend to pursue an insanity defense .

In the documents filed last Wednesday , his attorneys said they were still exploring a mental health defense , `` and counsel will vigorously present and argue any and all appropriate defenses at a trial or sentencing proceeding , as necessary . ''

Peter Burns was outraged at the possibility of an insanity defense .

His friend , Jessica Ghawi , was among those killed in the movie theater shooting . Holmes ' distracted appearance in court , he said , does n't jibe with the details investigators have revealed about a man who they said created and executed a detailed , deadly plan .

`` I think this is an act , '' Burns told CNN Monday . `` I think this coward that shows up every day in court with this aloof look in his eyes that he 's just spaced out -- well , I ca n't imagine somebody pulling off something like this to be in that case . I think as soon as he knows he goes into the courtroom , he knows exactly what 's going on . ''

Burns said he wanted Holmes to receive the toughest punishment possible , but he questioned whether the death penalty -- with the lengthy court proceedings and appeals that come with it -- was the right approach .

`` We want justice , but at the same time we want closure , '' he said . `` Do we ever really get closure 17 years down the road ? ''
