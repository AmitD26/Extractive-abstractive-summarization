Editor 's note : You can follow the Bilsons ' progress on CNN American Morning 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. through February 4 .

Mary Bilson tries to contain her autistic daughter Marissa 's tantrum , as Marissa 's brother Brendan looks on .

Seal Beach , CALIFORNIA -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Bilson family is like many other families : three kids , a cat , and a small , lovely home with lots of family photos and carved wooden wall signs with sayings like `` Live , Laugh , Love . ''

But step inside their house after 4 p.m. most weekdays and you 'll want to cover your ears because of the noise -- the screaming , to be exact . These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance . This is the high-pitched , ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl . More accurately , it is the sound of a frustrated , irritated , very loud teenager with autism .

Marissa , the middle Bilson child , was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler . Her mother , Mary , a nurse , knew something was n't right early on , when young Marissa 's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted .

But during the first few years , doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass . They were wrong on both counts .

Marissa 's behavior has not passed ; it has , in fact , become worse . According to Bilson , Marissa and her tantrums rule the household . `` I do n't want to hear her screaming and tantruming , so we pretty much let her do what she wants , '' Bilson says . `` We '' means Mary , her husband , John , and their two other children , Brittany , 15 , and 6-year-old Brendan .

Keeping the peace means that , when it comes to Marissa , the rules are different . She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer . She is allowed access to her siblings ' rooms and possessions . She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table . Watch part one of the Bilsons ' journey ''

But before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons , and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line , consider one thing : They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities .

`` Do you think people who do n't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them ? '' CNN 's senior medical correspondent , Elizabeth Cohen , asked Marissa 's mom in a recent interview .

`` No , '' Mary Bilson replied . `` And I do n't see how they could . ''

She 's right -- we ca n't , because many of us have never seen autism in action , day in and day out . Learn more about autism ''

Autism is described on the National Institutes of Health Web site as a `` developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life , and affects the brain 's normal development of social and communication skills . '' According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , autism and related disorders affect about one out of every 150 babies born each year .

Autism manifests itself in many different ways . Although there are some common threads , like language issues , repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others , specific behavioral patterns are largely unique to the individual . `` Children with autism are all different ; they are like snowflakes , '' explains Dr. Ronald Leaf , co-director of the group Autism Partnership .

The one thing that Leaf believes they all have in common is that `` they are not expected to do enough . '' Leaf insists we have set the bar too low for what we think children and adults with autism can do . `` They are highly teachable , '' he says . `` You just have to have a good teacher . ''

A good teacher is exactly what Bilson was looking for to help her with Marissa . The family had already tried various programs , starting when Marissa was a toddler -- but nothing completely worked for her . And as Marissa entered her teen years , her behavior grew worse . Mary knew that her daughter needed to be reined in , and it needed to be done now .

`` She is getting older . She 's 13 and her tantrums are louder and longer than they used to be . It 's just so inappropriate . It was OK when she was much younger , but now that she 's going to be an adult soon , she ca n't be behaving this way , '' Bilson says with tired resignation .

But what could the Bilsons do ? This family does n't have a lot of extra money , and most programs either are n't covered by insurance or have long waiting lists . The costs are staggering , according to the Web site FightingAutism.org . Families with autistic children can expect to spend $ 30,000 annually to provide proper medical , educational and other assistance necessary for dealing with an autistic child .

Enter Autism Partnership , or AP . This group , founded in 1994 , offers extensive therapeutic services to children and adults with the disorder . One of its most unique programs is an intensive one-on-one , at-home intervention service that is similar in scope to what happens on the television show `` Nanny 911 . '' It 's not cheap -- about $ 2,500 per day , typically for a five-day period -LRB- with additional days on an `` as needed '' basis -RRB- .

Most of AP 's work is grounded in a behavior modification technique known as Applied Behavioral Analysis or ABA . Essentially , the method breaks down behavior patterns , rewarding proper behavior while being careful not to encourage improper responses .

And that is exactly how AP therapist Rick Schroeder hopes to reshape Marissa Bilson 's worst behavior . The group , which met Marissa while working in her school , offered the Bilson family a free week-long intervention with the proviso that CNN be allowed to record the process .

The week started off with a day of observation -- a day with lots and lots of screaming and tantrums , that left Schroeder stunned . He had observed Marissa at school where , he says , she was much less demonstrative .

But Schroeder is still eager and ready to tackle the challenge .

`` I think the family is starting to realize something needs to change , and that 's very good , '' he says after his day of observation . `` As far as Marissa 's behavior goes -- and the level that she is capable of going to -- she 's pretty much out of control , for sure . ''
