The number of new Ebola cases is growing faster than the ability of health officials to handle them , the head of the World Health Organization said Friday .

`` In the three hardest hit countries , Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , the number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in the Ebola-specific treatment centers , '' said Margaret Chan , the WHO director-general . `` Today , there is not one single bed available for the treatment of an Ebola patient in the entire country of Liberia . ''

This week , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will donate $ 50 million to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa .

At least 2,400 people have died in Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone , where the outbreak has been concentrated , Chan said . Cases have also been reported in nearby Nigeria and Senegal .

The foundation says the money will be used to enable international aid organizations and national governments `` to purchase badly needed supplies and scale up emergency operations in affected countries . ''

This is considered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history . The World Health Organization said Monday the rapid spread of the virus in Liberia shows no sign of slowing .

`` The number of new cases is increasing exponentially , '' the WHO said , calling the situation a `` dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions of human suffering . ''

Taxis packed with families who fear they 've contracted the deadly virus crisscross the Liberian capital , searching for a place where they can be treated , the WHO said .

`` As soon as a new Ebola treatment facility is opened , it immediately fills to overflowing with patients , '' the U.N. group said .

To help ease some of the burden on West Africa 's already overtaxed medical system , the United States announced Tuesday it will send $ 10 million in additional funds . That 's in addition to the $ 100 million Washington has already sent to help fight the outbreak . USAID also announced it will make $ 75 million in extra funds available .

The new funds will pay for transportation and support to send 100 more health care workers to help fight the epidemic . The WHO and several nonprofit agencies on the ground have repeatedly called for the international community to send additional trained help .

USAID funding has already provided 130,000 sets of personal protective equipment , 50,000 hygiene kits and 1,000 new beds .

USAID has created a website where trained nurses , physician assistants and doctors who want to help can sign up .

On Sunday , President Barack Obama said the Ebola outbreak needs to be a `` national security priority . '' He told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the U.S. military could help set up isolation units and provide security for public health workers .

`` If we do n't make that effort now , and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world , there 's the prospect then that the virus mutates . It becomes more easily transmittable . And then it could be a serious danger to the United States , '' he said .
