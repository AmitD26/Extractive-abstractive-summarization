-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serena Williams shook off any rustiness after a month-long break from competitive tennis as she launched her quest for a sixth Miami title with a straight sets victory over Italian Flavia Pennetta .

The world No. 1 has n't played since losing to Victoria Azarenka in the final of the Qatar Open on February 17 but made light work of her unseeded opponent winning 6-1 6-1 .

Williams , a 15-time grand slam winner , pulled out of the Dubai Tennis Championships after her defeat in Doha complaining of a back injury but looked in good touch as she raced to victory in just under 80 minutes .

`` I think I missed a few shots , but only because I think I was off footwork-wise , '' she told reporters . `` But it 's always just good just to win a match and stay in the tournament and keep going .

`` I felt like I should be putting the balls away for my opponent but she was so quick and she was running every ball down . ''

As for coming into the tournament as the world 's best player she said : `` It always feels better when you 're No. 1 . There 's nothing like when they announce you and they say , the No. 1 player in the world .

`` It definitely gives you a little bit more confidence ... a little more pep in your step . I have a lot of matches to play . If I can just stay relaxed -- I really feel like I can do it , but , you know , I 'm sometimes my own worst enemy . ''

Defending champion and No. 4 seed Agnieszka Radwanska , from Poland , breezed into round three with a 6-3 6-2 victory over Taiwan 's Hsieh Su-Wei .

`` I was happy to have a quick match , '' Radwanska was quoted as saying on the WTA Tour 's official website . `` The first match is always a little bit tough and tricky , especially after Indian Wells , where we had a little bit of different conditions .

`` It was a really special tournament for me because I was really playing a lot of good matches against top players and not even losing a set .

`` I definitely have great memories from here . And the final was a very good match . Hopefully I can play the same level of tennis this year . I will do everything to hold the trophy again . ''

China 's Li Na , seeded fifth , was also making a return after spending six weeks on the sidelines with an ankle injury but she eased past Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens 6-3 6-1 .

`` I was n't nervous before the match today , I was excited , '' Li told the WTA Tour website . `` For the last six or seven weeks I have n't played any tournaments so I was happy to win my first match after such a long time .

`` There were a lot of fans there to support me today , I was like , ` Wow ! ' My game was pretty good today , I followed the plan of what I should do . I just had to believe in myself that I could do it . ''

Petra Kvitova , the 2011 Wimbledon champion defeated China 's Peng Shuai 5-7 6-2 6-2 .
