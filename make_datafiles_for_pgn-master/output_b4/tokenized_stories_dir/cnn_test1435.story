Wall Street is more than 10,000 miles away from Melbourne , but 24-year-old Australian Alex Gard felt a kinship to the outrage expressed on the streets of Manhattan .

`` It 's great that people are finally standing up against the privileged few people who want to rule together , '' Gard said . `` I wanted to stand together and say , ` Enough is enough ' . ''

Gard is one of the organizers of `` Occupy Melbourne , '' a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square . Similar calls have sprung up around Australia : `` Occupy Brisbane , '' `` Occupy Perth , '' and `` Occupy Sydney . ''

`` We are inspired by what 's happening on Wall Street and loosely liaising with each other , but it 's not organized in any central way , '' said Gard , who works as a mechanic on cargo ships .

Gard and the planned Australian spin-offs of `` Occupy Wall Street '' are not alone . There are Facebook calls for a global demonstration on October 15 in cities in more than 25 countries stretching from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires , Dublin to Madrid .

Some protest pages show only a few dozen will attend ; others have thousands . Protest pages in Spain and Italy -- two countries hard hit by the financial crisis and subsequent European Union debt woes -- have the largest Facebook attendees so far , with 42,410 and 20,568 , respectively .

`` Occupy Wall Street '' began on September 17 and is now spreading to cities across the U.S. . The demonstrations , inspired by the Arab Spring protest movement , are against economic inequality and power vested in the top 1 % income earners . Its rallying cry , `` We are the 99 percent , '' is now being picked up by groups around the globe .

`` Occupy the London Stock Exchange '' -- referring to Europe 's largest bourse and the world 's fourth largest exchange outside of New York and Tokyo -- has more than 6,000 followers .

`` It 's time that we too say , enough is enough . Bankers have got off scot-free whilst the people of this country are being punished for a crisis they did not create , '' said the group 's Facebook invite page . The event , which so far has 2,300 signed up as attending , plans to occupy Paternoster Square from 4 p.m. October 15 to December 12 .

`` What we have in common is that we are the other 99 % , that we want people over profit , that we are making our voices heard against greed and corruption and for a democratic and just society , '' London organizer James Alexander Fancourt told the Telegraph newspaper . `` And we are doing that in a non-violent and peaceful way . ''

In Melbourne , `` some demonstrators are planning to camp for days , maybe weeks , '' Gard said .

While the Australian economy -- driven by strong commodity sales of iron ore and coal -- escaped the brunt of the 2008 financial crisis , Gard said many Australians do n't feel they 're sharing in the wealth .

`` Look , Australia 's not the worst place in the world , but we 're seeing banks recording record profits , rental has been crazy , housing prices are going up and up , '' Gar said . `` Indigenous people are being moved off their own land for the sake of mining companies ... everything is building up to a boiling point .
