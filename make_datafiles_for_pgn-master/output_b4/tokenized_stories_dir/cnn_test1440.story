-LRB- CNN -RRB- Nigerian forces fought off Boko Haram militants in the northeastern city of Maiduguri , military officials said Monday , but the extremists seized another town in the same state .

Hundreds of Boko Haram gunmen launched a predawn attack Sunday on Maiduguri , the capital of Borno state .

Soldiers repelled the attacks , and officials have since eased a curfew imposed as a result , said Col. Sani Usman , a military spokesman .

But a simultaneous attack on nearby Monguno town was a different story .

The Islamist militants captured the town , together with its military barracks , a Nigerian military officer said .

It 's unclear how many people were wounded or killed during the battle for the two cities .

`` Our soldiers initially repelled the terrorists but they mobilized more fighters and came back in full force . They overwhelmed our troops and forced them to retreat , '' the military officer said . He asked not to be named because he 's not authorized to speak to the media .

Monguno is about 135 kilometers -LRB- 85 miles -RRB- from Maiduguri . The former has a population of 100,000 while Maiduguri has about 600,000 .

Both cities are near the Chad and Cameroon borders , which would give the militants an entry point into those countries .

Monguno and its military post served as a buffer to keep the militants away from Maiduguri . Its fall leaves Maiduguri vulnerable and puts the extremists in a better position to seize the city .

Boko Haram had been confined to the fishing town of Baga since its fighters seized it on January 3 . Thousands were feared killed in that attack , which lasted days .

Borno Gov. Kashim Shettima said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants .

`` So long as we have the resources , we will continue to regard the efforts to reclaim peace our No. 1 area of commitments , '' he said .

'' I want to reassure the good people of Borno State that we will never abdicate from our responsibility as those they entrusted with leadership . ''

The attack came a day after President Goodluck Jonathan made a campaign stop in Maiduguri ahead of the February 14 presidential election . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was also in the nation Sunday to call for peaceful elections .

Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009 , attacking police , schools , churches and civilians , and bombing government buildings . The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria , which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south .
