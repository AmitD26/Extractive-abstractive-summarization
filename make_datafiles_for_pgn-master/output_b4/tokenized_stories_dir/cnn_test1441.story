The engineer who was involved in Sunday 's New York train derailment apparently `` was nodding off and caught himself too late '' before the accident that killed four people and injured 67 others , a union representative who has been meeting with the man told CNN on Tuesday .

Anthony Bottalico , the union representative , said engineer William Rockefeller Jr. recognizes his responsibility in the incident .

`` I think most people are leaning towards human error , '' Bottalico said .

Rockefeller 's lawyer , Jeffrey Chartier , characterized what happened as `` highway hypnosis . '' He said his client had had a full night 's sleep before the crash , and that Rockefeller had no disciplinary record .

In a brief conversation with investigators , Rockefeller said that moments before the derailment of the Hudson Line train in the Bronx he was `` going along and I 'm in a daze . I do n't know what happened , '' according to a law enforcement official familiar with that conversation .

Asked by investigators what he was thinking when he said he was dazed , the engineer said he could n't say . Rockefeller spoke to Metropolitan Transportation Authority and New York Police detectives at the crash site before he was taken to the hospital Sunday .

National Transportation Safety Board member Earl Weener told a news conference that Rockefeller would have had a chance to get the necessary sleep prior to his 5 a.m. shift the day of Sunday 's accident , echoing comment from Rockefeller 's lawyer .

According to NTSB representatives , results from alcohol breath tests for the train engineer were negative , and both the brake and signal systems in the deadly Metro-North accident appeared to be working . Other toxicology results have not yet come back .

Fatigue is a factor being investigated , according to a separate New York law enforcement source . But Rockefeller also told investigators on site that the brakes had failed , as CNN reported previously . Officials noted the train had been able to stop nine times at stations ahead of the crash .

Weener told reporters that the train was equipped with a `` dead man 's pedal , '' designed to stop the train if the engineer becomes incapacitated . But it was unclear whether that emergency system was activated .

`` We do n't know what that sequence was at this point , '' Weener said . `` It 's too early to comment on that . But yes , there was a dead man 's pedal . ''

Late Tuesday , the NTSB said the rail union has been kicked out of its investigation of the derailment for violating confidentiality rules .

The agency specifically cited Bottalico 's comments as a violation .

Additional safety system urged for years

Railroad safety officials have long pushed for a system known as positive train control technology , which combines GPS , wireless radio and computers to monitor trains and stop them from colliding or derailing . But the railroad industry has opposed the technology because of the high cost .

Steven Harrod , a University of Dayton professor and expert on railway operations , said the transportation safety board has urged railroads to install PTC in some form since 1970 . In 2008 , Congress ordered rail lines to adopt the technology by December 2015 .

`` PTC would have sounded an alarm as soon as the train exceeded the speed limit , '' said Harrod . `` Technology will help . PTC will help . But there will be some other thing in the future , other ways that somebody will find to defeat the system or screw up . ''

On Tuesday , Weener said it 's possible that PTC could have prevented a derailment involving a high-speed train such as the Metro-North accident .

`` What I can say is that for more than 20 years the NTSB has recommended the implementation of PTC technology , '' Weener said . `` These systems provide a safety redundancy by slowing or stopping the train that is n't being operated in accordance to signals , speed limits or other operating rules . PTC is proven technology that can prevent train-to-train collisions , over speed derailments and incursions into work zones . ''

Salvatore Arena , a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the agency began work to install PTC on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad in 2009 , budgeting nearly $ 600 million for PTC installation , including $ 428 million last month for a system integrator . Full implementation is estimated at $ 900 million .

But , Arena said in a statement , implementing PTC by the 2015 deadline will difficult because much of the technology is still under development , untested and unproven on commuter railroads the size of Metro-North and LIRR .

`` The MTA will continue its efforts to install PTC as quickly as possible and will continue to make all prudent and necessary investments to keep its network safe , '' Arena said .

The locomotive and all seven coaches jumped the tracks while barreling into a curve at 82 mph , nearly three times the 30-mph limit for the curve , according to the NTSB .

Expert : `` Twilight '' common among train crews

Harrod said the early hour of the derailment , along with the decreased rail traffic on the post-Thanksgiving weekend , also could have played a role in Rockefeller 's `` daze . ''

Harrod called it a `` twilight '' of inattention or distraction common in transport crews on late-night and early-morning shifts .

`` If he was dead , dead asleep , his hands would have come off the controls and ... some of the ` dead man ' stuff would have come into play , '' said Harrod , referring to `` dead man '' mechanisms that automatically stop trains when the engineer is incapacitated . `` But if it was kind of that twilight where you 're just there and still kind of gently holding onto to things but not quite really aware , which in my mind is still sleeping . That 's still sleeping . ''

In the culture of railroad workers , Harrod said , admitting to falling asleep at the controls is almost as bad as admitting to being drunk or on drugs .

`` It 's very realistic that he , in fact , really did fall asleep , '' he said . `` Falling asleep at the controls of a locomotive is a horrible evil . You 're not supposed to do that . He really does n't want to come out and say , ` I fell asleep . ' It 's emotionally embarrassing . It 's not just a rules violation . There 's a psychological component . If you come out and say , ` I fell asleep , ' it 's just purely beyond embarrassing . It 's a violation of the sacred understanding of what a train crew should do . ''

Rockefeller is not working or getting paid , according to Meredith Daniels , MTA spokeswoman .

`` He is out of service . This is an unpaid status , '' said Daniels , adding that Rockefeller is presumed innocent until disciplinary procedures are completed .

NTSB officials would not comment on Rockefeller 's reported comments , but they have said fatigue is routinely investigated as a possible cause in such cases .

`` We do n't have the work history at the moment , '' Weener told Wolf Blitzer Monday on CNN 's Situation Room .

`` We will be developing what we call a 72-hour timeline , so that we have a good understanding of what sort of activities preceded this accident . That 's part of our normal investigation . ''

Harrod said the rail and signal hardware date to World War II and , if Rockefeller was dazed or momentarily distracted , there was no system in place to alert him that he was traveling at 82 mph .

`` It 's a perfect-storm kind of thing , '' he said . `` You can look back in the history books of railroad accidents and there are plenty more where this came from . Events and things that happen that in and of themselves are not supposed to be bad but they turn into bad things . ''

Engineer cooperating with authorities

The train was about 10 miles short of its destination , Manhattan 's Grand Central Terminal , when it derailed on the approach to the Spuyten Duyvil station in the Bronx .

The NTSB 's interview Monday with Rockefeller was cut short because of his emotional state , Weener told CNN . The interview resumed Tuesday and was expected to continue Wednesday .

`` I think it was basically emotional issues with the engineer , '' Weener said . The crash , which took four lives , was `` a very traumatic experience for him . '' Weener said Rockefeller was cooperative but was `` not up to it . ''

NTSB officials said it is not unusual for those who have survived fatal accidents to be emotional during interviews . Nor is it unusual for the board to allow participants additional time to complete the interview .

Botallico said Rockefeller is cooperating .

`` There 's a lot of quotes coming from him , but when you 're in a crash like this , anything you say in the beginning has to be taken with a grain of salt , '' Botallico said . `` Bill is very distraught . I 've been with him , and he really has n't had a lot of sleep and he 's just crushed by everything . I know how sincere he is and he 'll be very forthcoming very shortly . ''

`` Billy is fully cooperating with the NTSB , '' Botallico added . `` He needed to get some rest . He 's very traumatized by the loss of life . It 's best that it comes from him what happened . He 's a quality human being . I know him personally . I 've been a conductor and representative , and I 'd be proud to have him as my engineer . ''

Botallico said Rockefeller started out as a janitor at Grand Central and `` worked his way up . ''

`` He 's been in operations for quite a while , '' he said . `` He used to change the time of the trains in Grand Central . He was volunteer fireman . He 's just a guy who 's always gone out of his way for everyone else . It brings me to tears because the loss of life is something that -- it 's the hardest thing to deal with . When you lose life it 's difficult for all . ''

Said Harrod : `` This engineer , I 'm sure , as the evidence comes out , I think we 're really looking at a sad , really basic kind of inattentiveness . Nothing fancy : No alcohol , no drugs , maybe not even a cell phone . Just plain vanilla inattentiveness . ''
