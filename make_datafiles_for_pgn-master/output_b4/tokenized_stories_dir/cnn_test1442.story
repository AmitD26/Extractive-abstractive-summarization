-LRB- CNN -RRB- Yes , New York City got a lot less snow than forecast . Yes , if we had known there would be this little snow , things probably would n't have needed to get shut down as much as they were . But most of the complaining -- about either the forecast or the decisions by local and state governments -- is misguided .

First of all , taking a look at the big picture , this storm was forecast pretty well . The forecast was that a big storm would develop rapidly and cause heavy snow across much of the coastal northeast , from New Jersey up through New England , as well as high winds and coastal flooding . All that happened . The peak snow accumulations are coming in as high as advertised , just not in New York City .

There were very sharp gradients in the snow accumulations . That is , big differences over short distances . So a small eastward shift in the track of the storm was enough to take away most of our snow . Just 10 or 20 miles east of the city , in Long Island , snow totals are much higher .

The reality is that weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain . Forecasters are looking at a range of possibilities , as spelled out in different model simulations . They have to choose among them , or split the difference in some way . But there is no perfect way to know which is right , and there never will be . The science tells us that that is the nature of weather prediction : The information is inherently uncertain . That 's just how it is .

Some meteorologists apologize

The right way to communicate uncertain information , really , is through probabilities . The models showed a sharp gradient in snowfall , but showed New York City on the snowy side . However , it was also clear that if the track were wrong , the city might avoid the worst of the snow . That uncertainty was n't fully communicated . That suggests that if this storm points to a failure , it 's really a failure not of the specific forecast , but of the format and language that is used to communicate all forecasts , an approach that fails to clearly spell out uncertainties and the difficulty of picking one of a number of potential storm tracks .

Of course , that has nothing to do with the complaints about the transit shutdowns , because those decisions could -- and perhaps should -- have been made regardless . But it 's important to remember that despite the uncertainties , decision makers have to make decisions , and being under-prepared for a storm that turns out to be worse than the forecast can lead to serious loss of life and property . Being over-prepared , in contrast , merely leads to lots of griping on the Internet .

In the face of uncertainty , the right thing to do is almost always going to be to assume the worst-case scenarios . Maybe some decisions could have been different given what was known at the time -LRB- in particular , the subway shutdown might have been unnecessary even if the snow totals had come in as high as forecast -RRB- . But it 's still way too easy for those of us with no responsibility to play Monday morning quarterback . And overall , given the uncertainty of the different models -- and the fine line between the correct call and an inaccurate one -- the authorities look to have taken the right approach in being proactive .

Good weather forecasts and well-informed , proactive emergency preparation and management save lives and property . Those are great benefits to society , and if people take them for granted most of the time , that 's OK . But it 's also important to understand that the unavoidable cost of enjoying these benefits is that sometimes , the problem wo n't be as bad as forecast , and so some decisions might seem unnecessary after the fact .

So next time there is a forecast of a big storm , do n't be tempted to disbelieve it just because you think this one was overblown . After all , there are many people in parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island right now who will be very glad indeed about the weather forecasters ' -- and their elected officials ' -- caution .
