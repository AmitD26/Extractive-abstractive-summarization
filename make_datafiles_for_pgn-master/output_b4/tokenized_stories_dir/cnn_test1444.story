U.S. Vice President Joe Biden asked Ecuador `` to please reject '' the request for asylum from self-avowed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden , according to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa .

Snowden was n't in Ecuador on Saturday , but if he does arrive there , the country will make a decision based on sovereignty , taking into account U.S. input , Correa said in his weekly broadcast on state TV .

Ben Rhodes , deputy director of the U.S. National Security Council , confirmed that Biden spoke with Correa about Snowden and the bilateral relationship , but Rhodes declined to provide details .

In a telephone conversation with Biden on Friday , Correa told him `` what was the Ecuadorian position '' and that Ecuador `` ca n't even proceed with the request because Mr. Snowden is not in Ecuadorian territory . ''

Correa said Ecuador would be cautious about processing any asylum request from Snowden .

`` We have to act very carefully but with courage , without contradicting our principles but with a lot of care , responsibility and respect of course towards the U.S. but also respect for the truth , '' Correa said .

The president said that he does n't want `` to harm his country '' but is `` not going to give up on the principles and the sovereignty '' of Ecuador .

`` We need to be very realistic . We use the U.S. currency . We are extremely vulnerable . We should n't make any false assumptions , '' Correa said .

Snowden , 29 , faces espionage charges in the United States for allegedly leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs .

Correa said that the first ones to be consulted `` would be the U.S. as we did in the Assange case with England . '' He was referring to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who 's been residing in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for almost a year .

Ecuador granted asylum last year to Assange so he could avoid extradition to Sweden , where he is sought for questioning in two alleged sex crimes that he denies . Assange fears ultimately being transferred to the United States , he said .

Earlier this month on CNN 's AC360 , Assange spoke from the embassy and urged Snowden to go to Latin America because it has `` a long tradition of asylum . ''

Correa said neither he nor officials in Quito authorized travel documents that diplomats in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London issued to Snowden .

The document `` was issued without our knowledge , '' and he blamed the consul in London , Correa said .

`` They think I 'm such an idiot that I ordered our consul in London to issue a document so an American citizen can leave China and travel to Russia . This consul will face the necessary sanctions , '' Correa said .

Biden made his phone call the day after Correa and other top Ecuadorian officials said they would n't bow to U.S. pressure about Snowden .

Ecuador is turning down trade benefits given by the United States as part of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act , Ecuadorian officials said .

On Thursday , Correa gave a fiery speech .

`` In the face of threats , insolence and arrogance of certain U.S. sectors , which have pressured to remove the preferential tariffs because of the Snowden case , Ecuador tells the world we unilaterally and irrevocably renounce the preferential tariffs , '' Correa said . `` It is outrageous to try to delegitimize a state for receiving a petition of asylum . ''

The South American country is now in the international spotlight as a global manhunt continues for Snowden , a fugitive who has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs .

Snowden worked as a security guard at the U.S. National Security Agency , then in a computer security job with the CIA , and then as an NSA analyst with government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii .
