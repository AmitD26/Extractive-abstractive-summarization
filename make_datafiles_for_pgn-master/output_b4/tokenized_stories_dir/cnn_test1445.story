She had a 1-year-old child inside and apparently was unarmed .

Instead , the motorist 's black Infiniti , according to authorities , itself became a weapon Thursday afternoon , first striking a security barrier and U.S. Secret Service officer near the White House before hurtling down some of the capital 's most famous streets , police cruisers in pursuit .

Dramatic video taken minutes later near the U.S. Capitol showed the vehicle backing into a police vehicle before the chase resumed . Gunshots rang through the traffic circle . The motorist was shot by police just a few blocks away .

The woman died . The child was safe and in protective custody . Two officers were injured . Police vehicles were damaged .

And a city heretofore fixated on a partial government shutdown was left with unanswered questions .

Why did this happen ? Why did the woman drive away from the White House and toward Capitol Hill ?

While U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said there appeared to be no evidence of terrorism , Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier said , `` This does not appear to be in any way an accident . ''

Officials , who called it an `` isolated incident , '' were tight-lipped about the suspect and did not name her at an evening briefing .

The early hours of the investigation turned northward Thursday night .

A task force prepared to execute a search warrant at the woman 's Stamford , Connecticut , residence , law enforcement sources said . Police and bomb squad units surrounded an apartment complex .

Authorities wanted to speak with the suspect 's relatives in Brooklyn , New York , but were turned away , federal law enforcement sources told CNN .

The chase created a chaotic scene of blaring sirens , locked-down lawmakers and bystanders hitting the dirt .

House and Senate sessions were immediately suspended , with legislators ordered to take cover and keep away from windows . Police also closed Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House .

The chase began near the White House .

A U.S. Secret Service source said when the woman drove up to a barrier at the 15th and E street checkpoint , she was approached by Secret Service officers who did not recognize her car .

The motorist hurriedly tried to drive away , executed a three-point turn , struck the barrier and backed into an officer before driving away , the source told CNN .

Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol , where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle .

Frank Schwing , a Washington resident who was near the area , said officers `` came out with their guns drawn '' and approached the suspect 's vehicle .

`` At that point , the driver slammed into reverse , slammed into a cruiser , did a 180 -LRB- degree turn -RRB- , took off , '' Schwing told CNN , adding , `` at that point , there were a half dozen or so shots fired , '' apparently all by small arms from police .

Video footage by other witnesses showed the black vehicle then careening around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then headed away . Shortly afterward , the car crashed into security barriers a few blocks away , witnesses said .

Lanier said more shots were fired after the vehicle stopped , and the woman was hit several times . The driver was later pronounced dead , Lanier said .

According to multiple sources , there was no reason so far to believe that the woman fired any shots or even had a weapon . Officers did not know a child was inside during the chase , officials said .

Lanier , citing the lengthy pursuit , rammed vehicles and an attempt to breach two security perimeters , said the driver 's actions did not appear to be accidental .

Security perimeters at the White House and Capitol worked , Lanier told reporters .

`` They did exactly what they were supposed to do , '' she said .

A Capitol Police officer whose vehicle crashed during the chase also was hurt , authorities said . The officer was released from a local hospital Thursday night . The Secret Service did not release information about its injured agent .

Authorities lauded the action of police -- some of whom are n't being paid -- who responded to the incident .

Because of the government shutdown , U.S. Capitol Police are n't receiving a paycheck , although they will receive checks once appropriations are restored .

In Congress , a Capitol Police bulletin said reports of gunshots required `` all occupants in all House office buildings to shelter in place . ''

`` Close , lock and stay away from external doors and windows , '' the bulletin said . Authorities later lifted the lockdown , with police saying they believed the incident was isolated .

President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation , which occurred on the third day of a government shutdown due to a stalemate in Congress over government funding .

`` The timing on this was really kind of scary , '' said Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas . `` Capitol Hill police are at a lower personnel level because of the shutdown . ''
