-LRB- CNN -RRB- While it 's a form of transport few of us see , shipping packs a punch as a polluter .

According to a recent study , shipping accounts for around 3 % of global CO2 emissions . Not surprising when you consider that the engines of the world 's estimated 90,000 cargo ships are in use 24 hours a day while traveling .

Futuristic concepts for container ships powered by alternative energy range from windmill-powered propellers to banks of vertical metal sails . Even though most are still on the drawing board , one concept is starting to be viewed seriously by the shipping industry .

Airfoil design

Called the `` Vindskip , '' the Norwegian design uses the high sides of its container ships as sails , turning the whole vessel into a wind-assisted airfoil .

Designed by Lade AS , the Oslo-based company says the hybrid merchant ship -- which would still have a liquefied natural gas-powered engine -- could achieve fuel savings of 60 % and reduce emissions by 80 % .

It 's the brainchild of Terje Lade , who used his skills as a speed sailor to develop his aerodynamic design . He says the futuristic container ship works more like an airplane than a conventional sailing ship .

He said : `` In the era of Christopher Columbus , for example , he would have used what became known as trade winds but his ship was quite different from the VindSkip because he would have been sailing with the wind -- he could n't sail into the wind .

`` VindSkip can almost sail into the wind ; in this way it 's more like an airplane .

`` It uses apparent wind , or the sail wind , to generate pull in much the same way that an airplane will take off when it reaches a certain speed . ''

The ship would be able to point as high as 18 degrees into the wind , the vacuum created on the lee side of the vessel -LRB- the side sheltered from the wind -RRB- enough to propel the ship forward .

Computers critical

Critical to the design is computer software being developed by Germany 's Fraunhofer Center for Maritime Logistics and Services , which calculates the optimal sailing route based on the weather and prevailing winds .

`` With this software , you input when you want to leave and when you want to arrive , the weather forecast is loaded into the program and then it calculates the best route , '' Lade said .

`` This would be dynamically updated every day . At each waypoint it would check with the time arrival and tell the crew whether to speed up using the engines or slow down ; it makes it very easy for the crew . ''

The algorithms in the software also calculate the best angle to the wind to gain the maximum performance from the design .

`` With our weather routing module the best route can be calculated in order to consume as little fuel as possible . As a result costs are reduced . After all , bunker -LRB- ship fuel oil -RRB- expenses account for the largest part of the total costs in the shipping industry , '' said Laura Walther , researcher at CML in Hamburg .

Sulfur -- the game changer

Changes to regulations in the sulfur content of marine heavy fuels are set to make the price of bunker fuel -- typically among the heaviest and dirtiest of fuels in the distillation process -- more expensive .

Shippers traditionally favored polluting residual bunker fuels because they were cheap , with large ships having the space to transport the pre-heaters necessary to make the fuel volatile .

But all that is about to change .

Current international regulations cap sulfur content at 3.5 % but this is expected to drop to 0.5 % by 2020 .

`` This makes things quite dramatic , '' said Lade . `` There are not many good solutions to this . At the moment they can wash the exhaust with scrubbers but on big ships this is very complex and very expensive .

`` This is where the ` Vindskip ' comes in -- due to the low fuel consumption it can run on LNG which means there is no sulfur at all . ''

One of Norway 's biggest shipowners , Wilhelmsen , has already entered the project on a technical basis and , while Lade is quietly confident the world 's first Vindskip will slip into the water by 2019 , he says the global shipping industry had been slow to respond to his design .

'' -LRB- But -RRB- the big driving force in the Vindskip project will be these new regulations on sulfur levels , '' Lade said .

`` The big problem with sulfur is that it acidifies the sea and this means that shrimps and crabs ca n't form their shells , '' said Lade , adding that acidification was impacting the entire marine ecosystem . `` It 's very bad . Something has to be done -- it ca n't go on this way . ''

The Danish shipping line Maersk told CNN that it was pursuing innovations in energy efficiency as a solution in the `` here and now . ''

`` In general , we do not believe that wind-assisted designs will play any significant role within the container shipping industry in the foreseeable future , '' said Maersk head of sustainability Signe Bruun Jensen .

`` The technology remains unproven at both commercial and operational scale . ''

She said that Maersk was developing its Triple-E vessels which used ultra-long stroke engines , efficient vessel shape and advanced waste heat recovery systems to improve CO2 efficiency by 50 % per container .

`` If you look at the technology already on-board our vessels today , it 's remarkable just how far we 've come , '' she said .
