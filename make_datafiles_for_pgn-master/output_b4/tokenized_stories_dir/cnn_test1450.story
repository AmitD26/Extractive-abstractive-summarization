Human remains found in two plastic bags near a beach in southwestern Mexico have been identified as those of Harry Devert , a New Yorker who left his job as a trader in finance for a transcontinental motorcycle journey from the United States to Latin America , Mexican authorities said .

Devert , 32 , vanished six months ago after sending his girlfriend an ominous text message from a troubled region in Mexico , describing how he was being escorted from `` an area too dangerous for me to be . ''

Mexican authorities , acting on tips , last week located his green Kawasaki motorcycle in a shallow grave in the state of Guerrero , along with the badly decomposed remains of a man in two bags .

On Thursday , DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Devert , a representative of the Guerrero state attorney general 's office not authorized to speak to the media told CNN .

The investigation was turned over to federal prosecutor because of the nature of the crime and the fact that it involved an American tourist , he said .

Mother has been looking for information

Devert 's mother , Ann , traveled to Mexico last weekend after identifying the vehicle identification number on the motorcycle found in the shallow grave . A day earlier she provided a DNA sample to police in New York to match against the remains , said Darren Del Sardo , an attorney for Devert 's mother .

Del Sardo said Mexican authorities informed Ann Devert of the findings late Thursday . She is considering having a private lab conduct DNA tests , he said .

`` This is horrible , '' he said . `` The major component now is to try to find out who is responsible for this and hope that the Mexican authorities bring them to justice as soon as possible . ''

The discovery of the remains and the motorcycle was made nearly 300 miles southwest of where Devert was last heard from in January .

Del Sardo said Ann Devert spent time in Mexico after her son 's disappearance , meeting local authorities and residents in the western Mexican state of Michoacan in an attempt to find him . There was hope with unconfirmed tips that he was being held at a ranch . Last week , she learned of the remains and the bike in the shallow grave .

Mexican authorities said the motorcycle was found along a road leading to La Majahua beach in Guerrero . The statement said `` 10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics -LRB- marijuana and cocaine -RRB- '' were found near the motorbike and body .

Del Sardo said Ann Devert was told that the remains may have been moved to the shallow grave .

Devert , 32 , had not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in New York since January 25 . That day he sent girlfriend Sarah Ashley Schiear a text message via the WhatsApp messenger app .

`` Just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be , '' the message said . `` Stopping for lunch and ... voila Internet . ... Gon na get back on the road soon . Apparently there 's another military escort waiting for me in some other town ... I 'm running way late because of the crazy military stuff ... hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when I -LRB- hopefully -RRB- finally arrive . ''

He had checked out of a bed and breakfast in Michoacan and planned to travel to a beach in Zihuatanejo , on the Pacific Ocean , that was in the final scene of the film `` The Shawshank Redemption , '' according to friends and family .

Friends had hoped Harry Devert would surface

Ann Devert last heard from her son January 23 . The phone connection was poor . He told her he 'd be out of cell phone and Internet range for a few days .

She told CNN earlier this year that he would call every January 29 , his late father 's birthday , `` and when he did n't , I felt a misgiving but I thought maybe it would take a couple of days , '' she said . `` He did n't call . ''

Then , Ann Devert heard from a friend who recently returned from Michoacan , where vigilante self-defense groups in numerous communities have engaged in deadly confrontations with the Knights Templar drug cartel .

After vigilantes threatened to descend on a key cartel area last month , the Mexican government sent in thousands of troops and police to try to keep the peace . The government has even joined forces with the vigilantes as the Knights Templar become further entrenched in the agricultural state .

Ann Devert had been in touch with both the American and French embassies in Mexico . Her son , born in France , has dual citizenship .

Devert 's friends and family were hopeful that his disappearance was only temporary , another story to recount from his wild travels around the world -- from Pamplona , Spain , to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , and beyond .

`` I 've been chased with a gun in Colombia , chipped my tooth on a gun that was shoved in my mouth in Venezuela and shot everything from a bazooka to a machine gun , an M16 to a Colt .45 , '' Devert wrote in his travel blog , A New Yorker Travels . `` I 've been in some of the poorest and some of the most dangerous parts of the world and to many of the finest , and I still ca n't tell which I liked more . I think that life is a pilgrimage . ''

In an October 19 post , Devert described his latest journey on a type of vehicle he had no experience using .

`` I 've never ridden a motorcycle , '' he wrote . `` Mostly , naturally , because I do n't know how . So tomorrow I 'm going to go to the DMV , get my motorcycle permit , buy a bike and hopefully figure out how to ride it home without crashing . Which I 'm sure will be an adventure in itself . ''

He added , `` Then in the next 2 or 3 weeks I 'm going to drive it across America , through Central America , down to Brazil for the World Cup , and eventually south to Ushuaia , which as far as I can tell from a map is about as far south as one can get on the continent . ''

He purchased a green 2002 Kawasaki . Ann Devert said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying YouTube videos on how to survive falls from bikes .

But the fact that he had never driven a motorcycle concerned her , she said . He promised not to travel faster than 55 mph , yet he took a nasty spill while speeding in Florida , Ann Devert said . He emerged unscathed .

Friends and family created the Help Find Harry page in Facebook , with more than 25,000 likes .
