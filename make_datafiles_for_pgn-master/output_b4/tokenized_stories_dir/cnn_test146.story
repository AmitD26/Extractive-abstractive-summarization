-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dealing with Merion is turning out to be tough enough . But Tiger Woods is also battling an injury at the U.S. Open in Pennsylvania .

Woods revealed that he hurt his left arm while winning The Players Championship last month , which would explain why he grimaced noticeably on several occasions in the first round .

The world 's top-ranked golfer was back in action in the second round Friday and shot a level-par 70 to complete two rounds at three-over-par 143 .

Asked to provide more details about injury , Woods did n't elaborate .

`` Well , it is what it is , '' Woods said .

Woods is bidding to win his 15th major but first since 2008 at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines .

Back then he had to deal with seemingly a more serious injury -- a broken leg . He memorably beat Rocco Mediate in a playoff .

Given the challenging conditions at Merion , Woods suggested his total might not be so bad heading into the final two rounds .

Storms caused delays of more than four hours Thursday -- Woods had to complete his first round Friday -- and play was eventually suspended due to darkness . Windy conditions added to the degree of difficulty at Merion 's shorter East Course .

Woods , Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott made for a dream pairing and while Scott struggled , Woods and McIlroy -- the second-ranked golfer -- fared better .

Seen chatting amicably during the round , the duo compiled identical scores in the first two rounds .

Beginning at the 11th hole , Woods birdied the 13th for a good start . Two bogeys , however , on the 14th and 18th , meant he had work to do on the first nine .

He hit birdies on the second and fourth , although with a one-under-par in sight , he bogeyed the seventh . Americans Billy Horschel and Phil Mickelson , a five-time U.S. Open runner-up , co-led through two rounds with a one-under-par 139 .

`` I played well , '' Woods said . `` I just made a couple of mistakes out there .

`` But I really played well . Maybe I could have gotten one or two more out of it , but it was a pretty good day . ''

McIlroy , who has n't hit peak form in 2013 , hit four birdies and four bogeys .

`` I got through that tough stretch from 14 to 18 in only one over which was a pretty good effort , '' he told Sky Sports . `` I played solid . It felt like every time I made a birdie I made a bogey straight away .

`` It 's a course where you sort of feel like you can shoot a score but where they put the pins ... it 's just tricky and tough . I 'm right there for the weekend and I 'm happy about that . ''

Scott bettered Woods and McIlroy in the first round , shooting a 72 . But he came undone nearing the end of his second round , hitting four bogeys in a row from the third to the sixth hole .

`` I just lost my rhythm early this morning when it was a bit cold and windy and just fought with it all day long , '' Scott said . `` The putter kind of cooled off .

`` I would have liked to make some putts and then you 're always happy . ''
