If you blink during the video , you might miss the moment an explosion destroys what is said to have been the tomb of Jonah , a key figure in Christianity , Judaism and Islam .

The first few frames show the revered shrine towering over its landscape . Then comes a sudden burst of dust , fire and smoke .

Then , nothing .

Militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , or ISIS , planted explosives around the tomb and detonated them remotely Thursday , civil defense officials there told CNN .

The holy site is said to be the burial place of the prophet Jonah , who was swallowed by a whale or great fish in the Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions .

CNN could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video , which was posted to YouTube .

The tomb was inside a Sunni mosque called the Mosque of the Prophet Yunus , which is Arabic for Jonah .

ISIS is waging war against the Iraqi government and has taken over several cities . It is seeking to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses parts of Iraq and Syria and has begun imposing Sharia law in the towns it controls .

ISIS is part of a puritanical strain of Islam that considers all religious shrines -- Islamic , Christian , Jewish , etc. -- idolatrous .

Biblical scholars are divided on whether the tomb in Mosul actually belonged to Jonah . In the Jewish tradition , he returns to his hometown of Gath-Hepher after his mission to Nineveh . And some modern scholars say the Jonah story is more myth than history .

Still , the story of Jonah is told often in the Christian tradition and has special resonance for that faith , scholars Joel S. Baden and Candida Moss write in a piece on CNN 's Belief Blog .

`` In Christian tradition , the story of Jonah is an important one , '' they say . `` Jonah 's descent into the depths in the belly of the great fish and subsequent triumphant prophetic mission to Nineveh is seen as a reference to and prototype of the death and resurrection of Jesus . ''

Baden is professor of Hebrew Bible at Yale Divinity School . Moss is a professor of New Testament and early Christianity at the University of Notre Dame .

They refer to the destruction of Jonah 's tomb as `` an attack on both those Christians living in Iraq today and on the rich , if little-known , Christian heritage of the region . ''

The book of Jonah tells the story of him balking at first when God tells him to go to Nineveh to preach . Instead , Jonah sails in another direction , where he encounters a great storm and winds up being swallowed by a great fish . He spends a few days in the belly of the fish before emerging alive to follow God 's instruction to go to Nineveh .

Mosul , the second-largest city in Iraq , is near Nineveh , once a powerful city of the ancient world .

Christian families fled Mosul this month after the al Qaeda splinter group issued an ultimatum to Iraqi Christians living there : Convert to Islam , pay a fine or face `` death by the sword . ''

ISIS has blown up several Sunni holy sites in the last few weeks in Mosul .

Last month , it destroyed seven Shiite places of worship in the predominantly Shiite Turkmen city of Tal Afar , about 31 miles -LRB- 50 kilometers -RRB- west of Mosul , Human Rights Watch has reported , citing local sources .
