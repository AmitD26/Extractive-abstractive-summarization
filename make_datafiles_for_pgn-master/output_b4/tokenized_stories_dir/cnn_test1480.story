-LRB- CNN -RRB- Once again , the lure of ISIS may have ensnared another group of foreigners -- this time , medical students suspected of traveling to Syria to work in ISIS-controlled hospitals .

The group of 11 people includes seven Britons , an American , a Canadian and two Sudanese , Turkish lawmaker Mehmet Ali Ediboglu told CNN on Sunday .

Ediboglu , an opposition lawmaker , told The Observer that he had spoken with the students ' families , who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS , and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria .

`` They have been cheated , brainwashed . That is what I , and their relatives , think , '' Ediboglu said , according to the newspaper .

But he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle .

`` Let 's not forget about the fact that they are doctors , '' he told The Observer . `` They went there to help , not to fight . ''

In a joint statement , the students ' and doctors ' families said their children are humanitarians who went `` to Turkey willingly to offer voluntary medical help to those refugees who are in need of medical care on Turkey 's borders . ''

They have since `` disappeared , '' the statement said .

`` We have heard from the British , Turkish and Sudanese authorities that we have so far met , but we hope that the respectable governments of these countries would enforce , speed up and coordinate more effective measures to ensure the safety of our children wherever they are and bring them back to us as soon as possible , '' the statement said .

Eight of the group are medical students who 've just graduated , and the three others are in their final year of medical school , he said . They 'd been studying in Khartoum , Sudan .

At least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border , pleading for their return , according to The Observer .

In an interview published Monday in Turkey 's HÃ¼rriyet Daily News , the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children .

Dr. Maumoon Abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter , Lena , who is one of the students .

`` I know you want to help people and be of use . But you can do this in another way , '' he told the newspaper . `` There are many who need your help . But this is not the way . Please , come back . ''

British officials said they are aware of the report .

`` We are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the Turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts , '' the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office said in a statement .

Officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join ISIS ' ranks . Estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by .

Last year , a 19-year-old Colorado woman was arrested at Denver International Airport as she was about to start a journey to an ISIS camp , where she hoped to be a nurse .

CNN 's Jomana Karadsheh , Nimet Kirac and Radina Gigova contributed to this report .
