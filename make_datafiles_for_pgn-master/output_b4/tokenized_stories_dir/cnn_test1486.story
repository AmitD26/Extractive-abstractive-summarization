Boston -LRB- CNN -RRB- She knew something awful had happened . It was smoky and all she could hear were muffled screams . Her foot was turned sideways and her legs would n't work right . And her good friend , Krystle Campbell , was just lying there on the ground .

Karen Rand -- she 's Karen McWatters now -- dragged herself across the pavement . She wanted to get closer to Krystle so they could talk and take comfort from each other in the midst of so much chaos .

`` I got close to her , '' she recalled . `` For some reason , I got close to her head and we put our faces together . ''

Krystle said that her legs hurt . They were the last words she 'd speak . The two women held hands until Krystle 's went limp .

McWatters was the fifth witness of the first day of the terror trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , who is accused of detonating pressure cooker bombs with his brother to punish the United States for policies they believe inflict suffering on Muslims .

Three people were killed in the blasts : Campbell , a 29-year-old manager for a restaurant chain ; Martin Richard , an 8-year-old boy ; and Lingzi Lu , a 23-year-old grad student .

More than 250 others were injured . And the first day of the trial -- after opening statements -- revolved around a number of survivors of the attack , who recounted in detail the chaos of that day . Prosecutors called them to the stand to paint a picture of the havoc and pain the bombings inflicted . Tsarnaev 's attorneys chose not to cross-examine any of the survivors .

McWatters fought her emotions as she looked at a photograph that showed her and her friend of eight years lying amid a heap of dazed and broken people .

Their two faces , side by side , stand out among the jumble of limbs . Krystle 's mouth is open , but she is very pale .

`` I was really scared , '' McWatters testified , `` and I remember screaming for someone to help us . Everybody was screaming , everybody was screaming for help . It seemed like a long time before help got to us , but it probably was n't . ''

By the time first responders reached Krystle , it was too late . `` They were doing CPR on Krystle and I started to think she did n't make it , '' McWatters said . She grabbed her friend 's cell phone and tucked it in her pocket . By the time she arrived at the hospital , shock had set in . She was confused .

For a while , that phone led hospital staffers to believe she was Krystle Campbell . When Krystle 's parents rushed to her bedside and saw she was n't their daughter , they were heartbroken , McWatters said . Krystle 's boyfriend recognized her and called her parents .

Two days later , doctors told her they were taking her leg . Her body was broken , and it hurt like crazy , she said . But not as much as losing her friend .

Campbell 's death was the first to be described in detail at Tsarnaev 's trial . But descriptions of the other two deaths at the marathon and the death of a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will come soon .

There were runners conquering a 26.2-mile feat nearby , but Noah 's attention was elsewhere , playing with rocks and pretending to be a scientist .

The 5-year-old thought it was a very cool idea to handle the rocks , his mother , Rebekah Gregory , told jurors .

Gregory recalled that she thought it lucky that Noah was happy playing scientist .

The next thing she remembers is being hoisted and thrown back .

Other witnesses used similar phrases : Blown through the air , deafening explosion , cries for help .

Shane O'Hara , the manager at Marathon Sports , a running store near where the bombs went off , said it sounded like a loud cannon , followed by an instant cloud of smoke that covered the windows .

O'Hara recalled stepping outside to the smell of gunpowder and burning hair .

The decisions about whom to aid first -- those among the injured needing help before others -- still haunts him , he said .

There were cries , sirens and screams , he said in answer to prosecutors ' questions .

He sniffled as a photo of the blown-out storefront was shown in the courtroom . He told the jury the plea he heard : `` Stay with me , stay with me . ''

Outside , Gregory tried to sit up , but could not rise much .

`` My first instinct as a mother was where in the world was my baby , where was my son , '' Gregory said .

She could n't see her legs , but she saw her bones lying next to her on the sidewalk , she testified .

`` At that point I thought that was the day I would die , '' she said . Gregory lifted her arms and her bones were sticking out of her flesh .

Somehow , over the cacophony , she heard Noah calling for her .

She was n't imagining it .

Colton Kilgore , who was also part of Gregory 's group and another of Wednesday 's witnesses , remembered the terrified boy looking for his mother .

Boston Marathon bombing timeline

The day 's testimony was dramatic and emotional , most likely as the prosecutors wanted it .

Anyone who follows the news has seen footage of the bombings and read accounts of what happened . The power of the survivors ' testimonies in the courtroom was in the details that made what some would call an unimaginable crime into something very real .

They shared small memories , like what people said in the immediate aftermath of the attack .

Gregory told the jury about how she knew Noah was being cared for .

Then she focused on the tourniquet that was being twisted on her leg by aid-givers .

`` We have an amputee , '' she saw one of them mouth .

What they told her aloud was something along the lines of `` This is really , really bad , but we will help you . ''

Another survivor , Sydney Corcoran , testified that after the blasts -- which left her ears ringing `` just like leaving a concert '' -- she was hurt but did n't know that she was severely injured .

She limped to a railing , grabbed it , and passed out , she said .

Eyes open again shortly afterward , she found herself on her back , with a group of men applying pressure on her thigh , trying to figure out where she was bleeding .

`` I remember a man putting his forehead to my head and telling me I 'd be all right , '' she said .

Corcoran was a senior in high school . After the one man told her she would be OK , another said he could see her eyes going white .

`` I could feel my body going tingly and I was getting increasingly cold . I knew I was dying , '' she testified .

In court , she was asked if she knew why she was feeling cold .

`` I was dying . The blood was leaving my body . I was bleeding out , '' she answered .

It felt like she was sliding into sleep .

Almost peaceful , Corcoran said . Like she was going to go to sleep and fade away .

Doctors saved the teen , but her life was not spared the pain of the attack .

Corcoran awoke in a hospital and saw her father , she testified .

Because she was intubated , she motioned for a pen and a paper and wrote a question for her father . Was her mother alive ?

`` Once he looked at what I 'd written he started to cry , '' Corcoran told jurors . The father responded : `` She 's OK , but her legs are gone . ''
