-LRB- CNN -RRB- Nick Gordon , Bobbi Kristina Brown 's boyfriend , says he hates her father , singer Bobby Brown .

The conflict is one of many revelations in a newly released promo for an upcoming episode of `` The Dr. Phil Show . '' In the clip , Gordon cries and laments missing Bobbi Kristina and her mother , the late Whitney Houston .

`` I miss Krissy and Whitney so much , '' a tearful Gordon says . `` I want them back . ''

Brown was found unresponsive in a bathtub on January 31 at her home in Roswell , Georgia . She has remained hospitalized after doctors placed her in a medically induced coma . Police have said they are treating her case as a criminal investigation .

Gordon , who tweeted that he gave Brown CPR after finding her in the tub , has complained via social media about not being allowed to see her .

`` Let me be very clear , Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit , '' Bobby Brown said last month in a statement through his lawyers . The terms were not revealed .

`` In an effort to do all he can to visit , Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person , rather than through lawyers , '' lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement . `` Those offers have also been rejected . We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart . ''

Gordon began living with Houston and her daughter after the superstar singer took him in when he was a teen . After her death , he and Bobbi Kristina became romantically involved .

In a Facebook post on Friday , Bobbi Kristina 's aunt Leolah Brown wrote an open letter to Dr. Phil , claiming that Gordon is being investigated by the police regarding what happened to her niece .

`` If Nick Gordon does not have the courage to speak with my brother Bobby Brown and/or law enforcement about what happened the day my niece 's body was found in a bathtub , he does not deserve to have a platform to speak to anyone of your caliber until this investigation is concluded , '' she wrote .

Gordon appears with his mother in the `` Dr. Phil '' clip , and the talk show host questions his sobriety .

`` You 've been drinking a lot though , right ? '' Dr. Phil asks before telling Gordon , `` I want you to go straight to rehab . ''

According to People , Gordon did check into rehab after filming . The episode is scheduled to air Wednesday .
