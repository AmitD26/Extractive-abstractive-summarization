-LRB- CNN -RRB- The terror that came to Tunisia on Wednesday -- the deadliest attack on tourists in the Arab world since the 1997 massacre in Luxor , Egypt -- was a long time coming .

Tunisia has been widely seen as the only success story of the Arab Spring with a new progressive constitution , a freely elected secular President and Prime Minister , and a moderate Islamist opposition so far committed to democratic principles .

But economic progress has lagged well behind . High unemployment has created frustrations among the young and a significant number have looked for answers in radical Islam .

Political opening in Tunisia has given radicals more breathing room , their numbers swollen by the release hardened Islamist militants during the 2011 Tunisian revolution that swept away decades of autocratic rule .

One of those who was freed from jail was Seifallah ben Hassine -- also known as Abu Iyyad -- a veteran Tunisian Jihadi who worked with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1990s and founded the Tunisian Combatant group . Soon after he was released he founded Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia , a pro-Jihadi movement which has up to 40,000 followers .

The group has a similar outlook to its namesake in Libya which the United States says carried out the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11 , 2012 , and according to Geoff Porter , a terrorism expert at North Africa Risk Consulting , there are real and fluid links between the two groups .

Three days after the Beghazi attack , Ansar al Shariah in Tunisia organized a mob attack outside the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia which put American lives at risk . According to the U.S. government , the group has also been responsible for several other attacks , including attempted suicide bombings at Tunisian tourist destinations .

In October 2013 , a Tunisian suicide bomber blew himself up outside a beach hotel in Sousse , killing only himself . Another was arrested in Monastir before he could blow up his device . The two had reportedly tried to travel to Syria but had been persuaded enroute by Jihadis in Libya to bring Jihad home .

In 2013 two secular Tunisian politicians were assassinated by Islamist extremists . The United States said Ansar al Shariah was implicated in the attacks .

In the last two years , Tunisian security forces have increasingly cracked down on Ansar al Shariah , but the movement still has a significant following . Ben Hassine fled to Libya where he is now believed to be based .

The Syrian Jihad has been the single biggest factor in the worsening security situation in Tunisia . Over 3000 Tunisians have flocked to fight Jihad in Syria and Iraq , many of them joining ISIS . And about 500 are believed to have returned stretching the resources of security services .

In December 2014 ISIS released a video calling on Tunisians to pledge allegiance to ISIS and carry out attacks , including assassinations .

The Tunis museum attack took place just days after a Tunisian Jihadi tweeted that a pledge of allegiance by Tunisian Jihadis to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi was coming soon , according to the SITE intelligence group .

The Tunisian Jihadi who posted the message Sunday claimed to belong to `` Jund al-Khilafah in Tunisia . '' In December , a grouping by the same name had pledged allegiance to ISIS . But the earlier pledge appears not to have fully registered with ISIS . An ISIS fighter in Raqqah , recently appeared in a video questioning why Jihadis in Tunisia had not pledged fealty . The Tunisian Jihadi replied `` Wait for the glad tidings of what will bring you joy . ... The delay of the public pledge of allegiance was for the sake of preparation . ''

The statement raises the possibility that the museum attack could be ISIS 's debut on the Tunisian stage , timed to precede a pledge of allegiance from Tunisian Jihadis for maximum impact .

While pro-ISIS twitter accounts lit up in celebration after the museum attack , there had been no credible claims of responsibility as of late Wednesday .

Tunisian security officials are worried about spillover from an increasingly chaotic Libya . ISIS has taken advantage of a simmering civil war in Tunisia 's neighbor to rapidly expand . It is now the dominant force in Derna in eastern Libya and controls parts of the town center of Sirte , the hometown of former Libya strongman Moammar Gadhafi . And it has built an increasingly significant presence in Tripoli itself , carrying out a gun attack on the Corinthia Hotel in January .

A number of Tunisians are also believed to be training with ISIS in a half dozen training camps the group operates in the Green Mountains between Benghazi and Derna in eastern Libya .

In late 2012 al Qaeda 's North African affiliate AQIM set up a branch in Tunisia called the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade , a 60-strong Jihadi outfit composed of Tunisians , Algerians , and some Libyans . The group is believed to include fighters driven out of Mali by French forces .

The Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade has been responsible for a string of attacks on Tunisian security services in mountainous Djebel Chaambi region along the Algerian border .

`` They have been the most active terrorist organization in Tunisia to date , '' Porter told CNN . `` It is rumored , but not confirmed , that they are getting additional personnel from Algeria because members of AQIM in Algeria have been fleeing intensified Algerian military operations . ''

Andrew Lebovich , a North Africa security analyst based in New York told CNN that the Uqba ibn Nafi Brigade issued a statement late last year threatening to attack Tunis . `` Most of their attacks have been in the Djebel Chaambi region but it 's possible they have extended their operations closer to the capital , '' he said .

The museum attack is the biggest crisis faced by Tunisia since the revolution . It is likely to significantly impact Tunisia 's tourism industry , worsening the economic outlook and increasing the sense of frustration on which extremists thrive .

There is also concern Tunisian security forces , traumatized by the attack on the capital , could once again embrace repression in their struggle to contain the Jihadi threat .

`` The Parliament was debating tougher anti-terrorism laws when the museum attack took place . The worry now is that Tunisia 's security services will crack down hard on Islamists increasing tensions and making the problem far worse , '' Lebovich told CNN .
