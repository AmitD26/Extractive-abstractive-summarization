Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- Grieving women carried her coffin high on their shoulders in scenes many said they had never witnessed before in the Afghan capital .

Men are traditionally pallbearers in Kabul , where days earlier a mob of male attackers beat and kicked 27-year-old Farkhunda before tossing her off a bridge , setting her body on fire and throwing it in the river . Like many Afghans , Farkhunda used only one name .

Early reports suggested that Farkhunda was mentally ill , but her tearful father , Nadir , told CNN affiliate TOLOnews she was a religious teacher who taught the Quran to children . He said there was no way his daughter would burn pages of the holy book , which has been cited as the motive for the horrific attack .

Twenty-six people have been arrested in connection with the brutal killing , Afghanistan 's Interior Minister Noorul Haq Ulumi said Monday in a statement before parliament .

Farkhunda 's parents said the killing was instigated by a local mullah of the Shah-e-Do Shamshera Mosque in the city 's center , who had been angered by Farkhunda 's accusations that he was distributing false tawiz .

Tawiz are pieces of paper containing verses of the Quran which are sometimes worn as pendants to ward off evil and bring the wearer good luck .

TOLOnews reported that `` in order to save his job and life , '' the mullah reportedly began shouting accusations that Farkhunda had burned the Quran .

Witnesses said a crowd gathered and hauled Farkhunda into the street .

`` We were asking the people to stop beating her and let us ask what religion she belongs to , '' one witness told TOLOnews . `` But the people did n't listen to us and kept beating her . ''

Afghanistan 's Ministry of Hajj and Religious Affairs said it had found no evidence Farkhunda burned the Quran . Meanwhile , Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing as `` heinous '' and ordered a commission to investigate it fully .

Farkhunda 's father said those guilty of killing his daughter should face justice : `` I do n't want blood of my daughter go in vain . ''

Thirteen police officials have been suspended in connection with the attack , according to Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi . He earlier confirmed 11 people had been arrested .

`` We 're very interested particularly to see what happens in terms of the investigation of the police behavior , '' said Patricia Grossman , Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch .

`` That was , for us , one of the most troubling aspects of this case -- that the police did not intervene adequately and properly to save her when there was an opportunity to do so . ''

On Sunday , as they watched Farkhunda 's casket being carried to her grave , the crowd shouted `` Kabul police officials should be fired , '' according to Afghan human rights activist Ramin Anwari .

Government officials , ministers , journalists and civil society members were among the thousands of people who attended her funeral , Anwari said . Many of them are expected to attend a large rally planned for Tuesday outside Afghanistan 's Supreme Court in Kabul to call for justice for Farkhunda , he said . A Facebook page has been created in support of the cause .

On Friday , the United Nations issued a statement condemning the killing `` in the strongest terms . ''

`` We are encouraged by initial reports of the arrest of several suspects , but call on the authorities to investigate this incident fully and bring to justice all persons who actively participated in the killing , or aided and abetted it , '' said Elzira Sagynbaeva , the representative in Afghanistan for UN Women . She said the rise in cases of violence against women and girls in Afghanistan had become a `` major concern '' and must not be tolerated .

Grossman of Human Rights Watch said the attack was unusual because it took place in public and in the capital . However , she added , `` Violence against women is rampant in Afghanistan . That 's the kind of thing we 'd like to see people address beyond this particular case . ''
