WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A day after New Jersey banned executions , newly released figures show that capital punishment dropped this year to a 13-year low .

The Supreme Court will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols .

Forty-two people have been put to death this year , according to the Death Penalty Information Center -LRB- DPIC -RRB- , a Washington-based group that opposes the practice . That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999 , when 98 inmates were executed .

Next year 's figures are expected to drop further . The Supreme Court is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional . See how the rates have dropped ''

The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September , when they decided to review a Kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal `` cocktail '' of chemicals represents `` cruel and unusual punishment , '' since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort .

Stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed .

If the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional , it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection . And even if the method is declared acceptable , it would be months before new execution dates could be set .

Ten states carried out executions this year . Outside the South , Arizona , South Dakota , Indiana , and Ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection . Learn about states ' death penalty policies and statistics ''

Texas continues to lead the nation , with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year . Overall , 86 percent this year were in the South .

No more executions are scheduled this year .

`` The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years , '' said Richard Dieter , executive director of DPIC .

`` Two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty . ''

Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment , even in the face of rising big-city crime rates .

`` I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions , '' said Kent Scheidegger of the Sacramento-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation .

`` I think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive . I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted . ''

New Jersey 's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and Gov. Jon Corzine signed the measure into law Monday . At the same time , he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state 's death row . The move was largely symbolic , since no executions have occurred there since 1963 .

Similar bills in Nebraska , New Mexico and Montana failed this year in the legislature . State lawmakers in Maryland , Colorado , North Carolina , Tennessee and California are also considering abolishing the death penalty , but no bills have been introduced .

The Supreme Court on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Louisiana inmate Patrick Kennedy , sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter . The state 's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate .

The justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape , but 19 years later , Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12 . State lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to `` adult women . '' E-mail to a friend
