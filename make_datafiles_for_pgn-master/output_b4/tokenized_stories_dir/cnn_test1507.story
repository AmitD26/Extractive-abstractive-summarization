ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Genarlow Wilson , freed last week from a Georgia prison , said he 's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors , even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier .

Genarlow Wilson tells CNN on Sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future .

The 21-year-old , who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal . He had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said Sunday .

`` It might 've been lesser time , but then again , I would have nowhere to go because I would have no home , '' Wilson said during a CNN interview scheduled to air Monday at 8 p.m.

`` I would n't be able to stay with my mother because I have a little sister . You know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . Basically , I ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? '' he asked .

In 2005 , a jury found Wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 New Year 's Eve party . Wilson was 17 at the time of the party . Watch Wilson say why he rejected the plea deal ''

The conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation .

According to Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker , prosecutors in Douglas County , Georgia , offered Wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record .

Defense attorney B.J. Bernstein said in June that Wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence .

The state Legislature last year amended the law under which Wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors . However , the Legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on Wilson 's sentence .

Now 21 , Wilson was released Friday after the state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the young man 's sentence `` constitutes cruel and unusual punishment . ''

Wilson said Sunday he feels no `` negative energy '' toward District Attorney David McDade , who fought efforts to have Wilson 's sentence reduced . Instead , Wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies .

He wants to major in sociology , he said , `` because I feel like I 've been living my major . ''

The new Genarlow Wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said .

`` When it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it 's all gone , and I know what it feels like to be without and I do n't want to ever feel like that again , '' said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king . `` I do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period . ''

Though he called his sentence `` absurd , '' Wilson said he understands that prosecutors `` were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law . ''

Wilson also said he knows what he did was foolish .

`` I was young then . I did some idiotic things in my teen years , but you know , every average teen does , '' he said . `` I do n't think any of us made very wise decisions , but I do n't think that any of us can go back then and change what happened . '' E-mail to a friend
