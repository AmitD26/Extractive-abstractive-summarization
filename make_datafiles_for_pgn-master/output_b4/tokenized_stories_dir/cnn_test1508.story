THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT . THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Thanks for checking out our latest summer edition of CNN Student News , where today 's show , all about tech . I 'm Carl Azuz . A college professor has found a way for his students to listen to his lectures even when they 're not in the classroom . And we talk to students and experts to find out some of the ways technology is being used in schools .

First Up : Gadget Gifts

AZUZ : It 's better to give than to receive . You 've probably heard it a hundred times . But when that gift is for a techie , there 's a gaggle of gadgets to go through . So how do you know which present to pick ? Reynolds Wolf is here to help with the breakdown on some cool tech toys .

REYNOLDS WOLF , CNN REPORTER : Are you searching for that perfect gift , but you are just a little bit stumped ? Well , no worries . Brian Cooley from CNET.com is here to help us out , steer us clear and hopefully give us some great ideas . And I know you have some great ideas for us .

BRIAN COOLEY , EDITOR-AT-LARGE , CNET.COM : Look at these beauties . First of all , for gaming , you know the Nintendo Wii is hot , but you ca n't find one ? The Nintendo DS Light is a pretty good placeholder . The dual screen that it 's known for , they 've slimmed it down from its original DS . And of course that great legacy of all those great Nintendo games . And pretty cheep . For $ 130 or less you can get one of these . That 's very affordable .

Check out this music player , Reynolds . It 's gon na be the next kind of iPod . It 's from SanDisk . It 's called the Sansa Connect . That little bump is a WiFi antenna . This can connect wirelessly to the Internet or to other devices like it to share music , download music and stream Internet radio . That is really the future of iPod-like devices .

If you want to give a phone , but you also want to give a music player , this one does both . NOKIA 's 5300 Music Express is a great music player . It 's not an iPod , but it 's not bad . Transport controls and volume buttons out here tell you that it 's something different .

And then for a camera , I like this very flat Sony T100 . It 's pocket-size , which is very hot these days . Nice slide-down door . 8 mega pixels , image stabilization and a great big screen for sharing photos .

WOLF : Brian Cooley of CNET.com , thank you so much .

COOLEY : You bet .

Shoutout

GEORGE RAMSAY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! When did the first iPod debut ? If you think you know it , shout it out . Was it : A -RRB- 1997 , B -RRB- 1999 , C -RRB- 2001 or D -RRB- 2003 ? You 've got three seconds -- Go ! If you guessed C , you 've got the right tune . The popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001 . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Tech in the Classroom

AZUZ : Whether it 's an iPod , Sony , Samsung or Zune , it seems like you ca n't go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of MP3 player . And if you 're on a college campus , you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music . But do n't be fooled . They could just be studying up for class .

AZUZ : Walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere . But sometimes the playlist is n't quite what you 'd expect . Lectures on Computer Science instead of American Idol . Not so much Sum 41 as History 101 .

Some teachers have used the audio iPod in their lessons , but at the Georgia Institute of Technology , Professor Jim Foley hopes to transfer his visual Web lectures to the video iPod .

PROFESSOR FOLEY , USER INTERFACE DESIGN TEACHER : The students who did Web lectures earned grades that were about 10 % better -- we did that three years ago .

AZUZ : As MP3 players become essential parts of students ' lives , they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom . With a graduate student 's help , Foley records lectures before class , so that students can raise questions when they arrive . Students from Foley 's User Interface Design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient .

KATHY PHAM , STUDENT IN PROFESSOR FOLEY 'S USER INTERFACE DESIGN CLASS : It takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus . And to be able just to download the mp3 to my iPod and just walk across campus , would be very beneficial .

SCOTT GILLILAND , STUDENT IN PROFESSOR FOLEY 'S USER INTERFACE DESIGN CLASS : A lot of people ca n't get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures , and it 's nice to be able to take them with you .

AZUZ : Although students show enthusiasm towards MP3 players , there are limitations because they 're small .

FOLEY : The screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer I just use the mouse . With the iPod I have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around .

AZUZ : Like the laptop , the MP3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information . Regardless of what teachers decide to use , players and laptops will remain allies . Besides , you need a laptop to operate an iPod and vice versa .

Podcast Promo

AZUZ : And if downloading lectures is n't enough , we 've got another cool thing you can do with an MP3 player : watch CNN Student News ! That 's right , you can download our Podcast at CNNstudentnews.com or at iTunes . So you wo n't miss out on the news when you 're on the go .

Now and Then

RAMSAY : With cell phones , thin is in . But you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor . An iPod can hold your whole music library . But a vintage Walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time . Microchips keep getting smaller and smaller . But old school computers took up a lot more space . And game controllers have buttons for every possible move . But the retro version ? One button , one joystick , tons of fun .

Learning with Technology

AZUZ : It 's not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers . Advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time . And one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools . So we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO CLIP -RRB-

TRINA DAVIS , PRESIDENT , INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION : We started off , when we were first starting to integrate technology , kind of at that basic level .

MATTHEW LEWIS , JUNIOR , GREENSIDE HIGH SCHOOL : We of course use laptops and computers . Each teacher is assigned a laptop . And also , we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside .

DON KNEZEK , CEO , INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION : Certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment does n't necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning .

AMMARAH MAHMOUD , JUNIOR , SALEM HIGH SCHOOL : I think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology , so it 's important to learn that in school

KNEZEK : So you ca n't convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment .

MAHMOUD : I do n't think schooling should be technology dependent , because I think that , at the same time , we should n't rely on something that does n't have a mind of its own .

KNEZEK : You can certainly abuse technology . You can abuse the printed word . You can abuse access to external resources . Certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies , then we 're in fine shape .

LEWIS : I can see people in the future having something where you just scan , and all of your , you know , personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen , and I think that 's really cool .

DAVIS : Customization , very innovative , lots of gaming , lots of 3-dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners .
