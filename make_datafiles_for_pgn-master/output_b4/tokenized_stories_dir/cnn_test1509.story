BUCHAREST , Romania -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- France has agreed to send a battalion of troops to eastern Afghanistan , a NATO spokesman has said .

Canadian NATO-led soldiers walk patrol near Kandahar , Afghanistan .

James Appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help NATO meet Canada 's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of Kandahar , where Canadian troops are based .

Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar .

There is a `` clear unity in the alliance '' that the mission in Afghanistan must succeed , Appathurai said .

Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces , the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S. , Canadian , British and Dutch troops .

Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but , he said , the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not `` whether , but when . ''

Further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume Thursday , he said .

U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance .

However , Russia -- which is not a NATO member -- has expressed concerns about the former Soviet republics joining NATO , which has already made members of other former Soviet countries Latvia , Lithuania , and Estonia .

Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia 's bid , because of Greece 's objections .

Greece has threatened to veto Macedonia 's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name . Athens has long argued that the name Macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace , also , of Greece 's most revered ancient warrior , Alexander the Great .

The name issue must be resolved by the two countries , Appathurai said . E-mail to a friend
