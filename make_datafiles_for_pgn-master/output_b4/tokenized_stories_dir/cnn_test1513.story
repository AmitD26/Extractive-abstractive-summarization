LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- There 's no question `` Tropic Thunder '' takes chances .

Ben Stiller , left , and Robert Downey Jr. are among the stars of `` Tropic Thunder , '' a Hollywood satire .

Tom Cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed , foul-mannered movie executive ? Check . Mockery of action heroes , Method actors and gross-out comedians ? Check . Challenging stereotypes at every opportunity ? Absolutely .

But casting Robert Downey Jr. as a black man ? Well , that might be a bit much .

Or maybe not .

In `` Tropic Thunder , '' a comedy about self-absorbed Hollywood types making a `` Platoon '' - style war movie , Downey plays Australian actor Kirk Lazarus , a multiple Oscar-winning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them . He 's a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art .

So , cast as a black man in the war movie , Lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically .

Downey -- no slouch as an actor himself -- has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles . That kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive , said Ben Stiller , who directed , co-wrote and stars in `` Tropic Thunder . ''

`` I give all the credit to Robert , '' Stiller told CNN . `` I felt he really was so committed to that character , the guy that was playing that guy , that as an audience you bought his sincerity . Very few people , I think , could pull that off . ''

Brandon Jackson , who plays hip-hop star turned actor Alpa Chino -LRB- say it fast -RRB- , agreed .

`` Robert was black the whole time . My mom came on the set and she thought it was Don Cheadle , '' he told CNN . `` I 'm serious . That 's how black he was . '' Watch Jackson talk about working with Downey ''

The movie , which also stars Stiller as struggling action star Tugg Speedman and Jack Black as gross-out king Jeff Portnoy , features some testy altercations between Downey 's Lazarus and Jackson 's Chino . Lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when it 's clear filming has wrapped for the day , he sticks with it -- which irritates Chino to no end .

`` To me the most important thing was Alpa Chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what he 's doing is crazy the whole time , '' Downey said . `` Otherwise it 's just demeaning to Brandon 's character . And if it 's demeaning to an actual black man in the movie ... I would have run for the hills . ''

Jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive . But , he said , `` Tropic Thunder '' is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes . Since then , he said , the playing field has leveled : The Wayans brothers played `` White Chicks '' in the film of the same name , and Eddie Murphy has played several ethnicities in his films , including Jewish and Chinese characters .

`` If we 're all gon na play ball , let 's all play ball , '' Jackson said . `` I believe in fairness . If we can punch you , punch back . And funny is funny . '' iReport.com : Will you see ` Tropic Thunder ' ?

Stiller , of course , is no stranger to testing comedy limits . The actor , writer and director , known for films such as `` Meet the Parents '' and `` Zoolander , '' has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful -- and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line .

He co-wrote `` Tropic Thunder '' based on an idea he had in 1987 , when many of his friends were making war movies , he recalls in the film 's production notes . While Stiller was making `` Empire of the Sun , '' his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles -- and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if they 'd become part of a real military unit .

`` This sort of self-important , self-involved thing seemed funny to me , '' he said in the notes . `` I just could n't figure a way to make that into a movie . ''

Not immediately , anyway . But after several years , Stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors , but filmmaking in general . In `` Thunder , '' after the studio threatens to shut down the big-budget production , the frustrated director -LRB- played by Steve Coogan -RRB- refuses to stop , and takes his cast deep into a Southeast Asia jungle to shoot `` guerrilla style . '' There they encounter danger in the form of drug lords .

`` Tropic Thunder , '' which already has received praise from Newsweek 's David Ansen and The Hollywood Reporter 's Kirk Honeycutt , has also earned its share of knocks . The most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled , which are planning to picket Monday 's Los Angeles premiere .

In the film , Speedman has made a bid for an Oscar by playing `` Simple Jack , '' a developmentally disabled character . Other characters in `` Tropic Thunder '' dismiss Speedman 's attempt to play what they refer to as a `` retard . '' Representatives of the Special Olympics , the Arc of the United States , the National Down Syndrome Congress , the American Association of People with Disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film , but DreamWorks did not make any changes .

`` We are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population , '' said Peter Wheeler , a spokesman for the Special Olympics , according to Reuters .

In a statement Sunday , Chip Sullivan , a DreamWorks spokesman , said the movie was `` an R-rated comedy that satirizes Hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations . ''

In the statement , Sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that DreamWorks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future .

In junket interviews for the film , Stiller said that screening audiences definitely found `` Tropic Thunder '' funny . `` You go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think you 're doing , of what you think is the right idea , '' he said . `` If people are accepting it the way that you intended , and you feel that from a general audience ... then stand behind it . ''

Downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive , audiences will accept the film 's satire -- his role in particular .

`` I just hope at this point , with whatever little we 've done to brand ourselves as entertainers , that you give us a little slack , '' he said .
