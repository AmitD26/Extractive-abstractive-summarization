-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In `` Street Kings , '' Keanu Reeves ' bad-boy cop Tom Ludlow may not play by the rules , but the film sure does .

Keanu Reeves , second from left , and Forest Whitaker are shifty cops in `` Street Kings . ''

The movie is textbook Cop Noir . Directed by David Ayer , who wrote `` Training Day '' and directed `` Harsh Times , '' from a script that originated with `` L.A. Confidential '' novelist James Ellroy , it 's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again .

Too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world , betrayal , disillusionment , retribution , all that jazz -- is n't told with much originality this time around .

As Ludlow , a detective with a special LAPD vice squad , Reeves shoots first and asks questions much , much later . In his field the bad guys are easy to spot , and if Tom has to get his hands dirty , well , then he 'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in . He works from the gut .

We have Ludlow 's number from the beginning : He wakes up , vomits , cleans his gun , and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka . Then he crashes a kidnappers ' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what 's hit them .

`` Do n't worry , '' he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back . `` I 'm a cop . ''

It 's probably superfluous to add that he 's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago . It 's also probably superfluous to mention that Internal Affairs -LRB- headed by Hugh Laurie -RRB- is beginning to sniff around Ludlow 's unit . In particular , IA is talking to his ex-partner Washington -LRB- Terry Crews -RRB- , a revelation that sends Ludlow reaching for his baseball bat .

Before he can put Washington straight , though , his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks . Can Ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers ?

Hell , yes , even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he 's through .

Reeves does n't do much `` acting '' as such , but he does n't need to : His performance is clean and spare , in synch with Ayer 's clipped economy , and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly na√Øve character . Alcoholism does n't appear to have thrown off Ludlow 's aim any , but it must have dulled his reasoning . A broody , intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching , but Ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead . -LRB- I guess he 's not a James Ellroy fan . -RRB-

But what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination , not to say blood-lust . In a neat touch , when it 's time to cool off his public profile for a spell , the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory , and , obviously , an utterly pointless occupation .

Forest Whitaker boosts the energy level as Ludlow 's paternalistic mentor , boss , and No. 1 fan : `` You 're the tip of the spear , '' he tells him . `` Who else is going to hold back the animals ? ''

Violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined , `` Street Kings '' ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of `` a necessary evil , '' or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself , but ultimately it ca n't conceive of a better alternative . After all , the rest is politics , a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter .

And , besides , he 's seen it before .
