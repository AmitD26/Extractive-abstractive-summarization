LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Krishna Rajarman 's classmates and friends remembered him Tuesday as a mentor and scholar who preferred to go home on weekends to spend time with his younger brothers than party on campus .

Krishna Rajarman , a Fulbright Scholar and honors student , was a junior at UCLA .

`` We asked him , ` Why not stay a weekend because we might do something fun ? ' '' said Ashwin Bhongir , Krishna 's roommate and childhood friend .

`` He said , ` I want to be here for my brothers . I like to spend time with my brothers , it 's important . ' ''

Krishna , a 19-year-old junior at UCLA , a Fulbright Scholar and an honors student , was found Monday fatally shot at his parents ' home in suburban Los Angeles .

Police said his father killed the teen , his two younger brothers , ages 7 and 12 , his grandmother and mother .

Karthik Rajaram , a 45-year-old unemployed financial services expert , then killed himself , police said .

The six bodies were discovered in their neatly tended home in an upscale suburb 20 minutes outside Los Angeles on Monday . A neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job .

Inside the house , police also found letters from the father explaining that mounting financial pressure had led him to kill .

Fraternity member Vim Mahadev remembered Krishna as a devoted L.A. Lakers fan who occasionally mentioned family problems , but nothing unusual .

`` Nothing ever came up serious , '' said Mahadev . `` It was mostly his dad , about financial problems . But most of the time it was how he was his hero because he was intelligent and he always knew the right decisions to make .

`` It 's just so ironic . ''

Krishna 's friends Bhongir and Nahel Patel grew up around the Rajaram family and told CNN they never saw signs of family turmoil during their teenage years . `` I knew his family very well , and every time I went there , it was one of the most welcoming homes I 've ever been to , '' said Bhongir . `` It was always a fun loving place to be . '' `` He was one of the most promising friends that I ever knew , he was literally the smartest person I 've ever known , '' said Bhongir . `` He was going to make it . ''

Bhongir and Nahel , both business economic majors at UCLA , said Krishna 's father was a role model to them . Krishna had wanted to follow his father 's footsteps in studies and career .

The father received his MBA from UCLA in 1987 , according to UCLA spokesman Phil Hampton .

Police said he went on to work in a financial holding company and for major accounting firms , such as Price Waterhouse .

As a freshman , Krishna joined the campus co-ed fraternity Delta Phi Beta , organized by South Asian students .

Fraternity member Natasha Parikh said she was one of Krishna 's closest friends . `` I just talked to him on Wednesday , and he was so excited about the new recruits we were having , '' she said . `` He was so excited about this year , and it 's so painful that he ca n't be here to experience the rest of our time at UCLA . ''

`` He really did n't talk about his personal life ; I always saw him as a happy guy who never once said he was going through any major difficulty , so this has come as a complete shock . ''
