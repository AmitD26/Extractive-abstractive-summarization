WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The man who authorities allege carried out the 2001 anthrax mailings that killed five people sent himself an e-mail saying he knew the attacker 's identity , according to court documents released Wednesday .

Former biodefense researcher Bruce Ivins killed himself in July , authorities say .

Bruce Ivins , who authorities say killed himself in July as the Justice Department prepared to charge him in the anthrax case , is alleged to have sent the e-mail to himself last September .

An FBI agent quotes the message in an affidavit accompanying applications for search warrants for Ivins ' e-mail accounts .

`` Yes ! Yes ! Yes !!!!!!! I finally know who mailed the anthrax letters in the fall of 2001 . I 've pieced it together ! Now we can finally get this over and done with , '' the e-mail reads .

In it , the former biodefense researcher says he plans on turning information over to his lawyer and that his lawyer would then give it to authorities . The e-mail does not say who Ivins believed was responsible .

`` I 'm not looking forward to everybody getting dragged through the mud , but at least it will be over , '' the e-mail reads . `` Finally ! I should have it TOTALLY nailed down within the month . I should have been a private eye !!!! ''

The documents -- which the Justice Department says are the last Ivins-related search warrants that had yet to be released to the public -- also contain new details about allegations that Ivins wanted to kill his co-workers .

The details are in an account of a July 9 group therapy session during which Ivins allegedly said he was a suspect in the anthrax investigation .

According to an FBI agent 's account , Ivins was `` angry at the investigators , the government , and the system in general . ''

`` He said he was not going to face the death penalty , but instead had a plan to kill co-workers and other individuals who wronged him , '' the account reads . `` He said he had a bullet-proof vest , and a list of co-workers , and added he was going to obtain a Glock firearm from his son within the next day , because federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own . ''

The FBI agent also alleges that Ivins said during the session that he had walked around the `` ghetto '' areas of Frederick , Maryland , near his home , late at night `` hoping that someone would try to hurt him so that he could stab them with a sharp pen . ''

That description is similar to something Ivins allegedly wrote on YouTube referencing a winner of the television game show `` The Mole . '' Authorities said Ivins ' YouTube message read : `` The least someone could do would be to take a sharp ballpoint pin or letter opener and put her eyes out , to complete the task of making her a true mole ! ''

General details of the therapy session have previously been reported . After the meeting , social worker Jean Duley contacted authorities and Ivins was taken into custody . He was released after being evaluated at two hospitals .

Notes allegedly written by Ivins at the time of his hospitalization were found in the trash at his home after his death . According to the FBI , he wrote about the stresses in his life and the possibility of facing prison time .

Ivins ' attorney , Paul Kemp , maintains Ivins did n't carry out the attacks and says the new documents prove nothing .

`` There is simply nothing new here , nothing that is proof against Dr. Ivins , '' Kemp said Wednesday .

The anthrax probe continues , Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said .

`` We are working to close the investigation soon , '' Boyd said , adding that `` investigative efforts '' and `` administrative measures '' need to be finished .

The anthrax attacks occurred less than a month after the September 11 , 2001 , suicide attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania . Letters filled with bacterial spores were sent to Senate Democratic leaders and news organizations .

Those who died were Washington postal workers , a New York hospital worker , a supermarket tabloid photo editor in Florida and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut .

Scientists from inside and outside the FBI said they traced a strain of anthrax from the envelopes and victims to a batch of anthrax in Ivins ' lab at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute in Fort Detrick , Maryland .
