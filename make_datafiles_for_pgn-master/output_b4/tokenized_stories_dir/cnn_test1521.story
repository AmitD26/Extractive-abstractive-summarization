-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joran van der Sloot is meeting with investigators Thursday in the Netherlands in response to the recently released videotape in the Natalee Holloway case , his U.S.-based attorney said .

Joran van der Sloot awaits transfer from the Netherlands to Aruba in November . He later was released .

The exact location of that meeting was not disclosed , but van der Sloot 's attorney , Joe Tacopina , said his client has `` agreed to answer any questions . ''

In the video that aired Sunday on Dutch television , van der Sloot , a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Holloway , told a man he was with the Alabama teen on an Aruban beach when she apparently died and that a friend of his with a boat disposed of Holloway 's body .

Van der Sloot later said the statements were lies , and on Monday , Tacopina said the video contains `` no admission of a crime . ''

The lawyer said facts in the case contradict two assertions van der Sloot made in the video , including that the boat-owner friend mentioned was n't in Aruba in May 2005 . Watch how video has brought new interest in case ''

Meanwhile , prosecutors are still awaiting a decision from a three-judge appellate panel on the nearby Caribbean island of Curacao as to whether van der Sloot can be arrested in reaction to the video .

The chief prosecutor in Aruba , Hans Mos , was denied an initial attempt to arrest van der Sloot by the investigating judge last Sunday .

The judge determined that numerous pretrial detentions of van der Sloot in the past have created a `` high bar '' that current circumstances do not meet .

The prosecutor appealed the judge 's decision on Tuesday , and the appellate panel will have eight days to respond .

Holloway disappeared while visiting Aruba with about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham , Alabama , and was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe .

Mos dropped charges against the three men in December , saying he could n't be sure of a conviction . E-mail to a friend
