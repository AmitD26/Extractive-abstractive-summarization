-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For five generations , the Meserve/Kunhardt family has been the collector and custodian of some of the most valuable photographs and memorabilia of Abraham Lincoln .

Peter W. Kunhardt , left , Philip B. Kunhardt III and Peter W. Kunhardt Jr. co-authored `` Looking for Lincoln . ''

In fact , eminent Lincoln historian Harold Holzer said there 's only one other family that 's contributed more `` to our understanding of America 's most enduring leader , '' and that 's the Lincolns themselves .

`` The Kunhardts -- and before them , their ancestor Frederick Hill Meserve -- have been active , and crucial for generations , in preserving Lincoln 's image for posterity , '' Holzer said .

`` Mr. Meserve literally saved photos from destruction , then cataloged and analyzed them . Later members of the family wrote seminal books incorporating the family-owned archive into the stories of Lincoln 's life and death . ''

The family collection was the basis for the new book , `` Looking for Lincoln '' -LRB- Knopf -RRB- , and for a PBS documentary . One of the book 's co-authors , 26-year-old Peter W. Kunhardt Jr. , has now joined the family business as assistant director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation .

Kunhardt , who recently earned a master 's degree in art business and photography , also works on the Gordon Parks Foundation , a division of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation , which includes the life 's work of the pioneering African-American photographer .

Kunhardt spoke with CNN in an interview and follow-up conversations about the extraordinary family history .

CNN : Tell us about your family .

Peter W. Kunhardt Jr : I 'm the fifth generation to be working on Lincoln . My great-great-grandfather was a man by the name of Frederick Hill Meserve . His father , William Neal Meserve , was a soldier in the Civil War who was wounded at the battle of Antietam , and he kept a diary of the entire time he was in war .

That diary was illustrated by his son , Frederick Hill Meserve , years after the war through collecting photography . He became one of the leading collectors of 19th-century American photography . ... At that time photography was still quite new .

In the late 19th century , the war-weary nation lost its interest in the images of that era . Many glass negatives were thought to be worthless . The emulsion was washed off , and many were used to build greenhouses .

Meserve wrote a book in 1911 called `` Photographs of Abraham Lincoln . '' He became obsessed with Lincoln . Lincoln was the first president to be photographed while in office . Meserve 's goal in life was to find and catalog all the existing images of Lincoln , of which we now know there were about 120 .

Each photograph in Meserve 's book , which he updated for the next half century , was given an `` M '' number . Part of our work was to update his numbering system and establish a new national standard .

Then his daughter Dorothy Meserve Kunhardt , she became heavily involved with Lincoln scholarship and the collection as well . She was the author of the children 's book , `` Pat the Bunny , '' which ... as everyone knows today , it 's one of the most popular children 's books . She worked with her father on Lincoln publications and continued to collect Lincoln .

The collection was passed to Philip Kunhardt Jr. , my grandfather , who eventually passed this collection of photographs on to my father and uncle , who were my co-authors in this book , `` Looking for Lincoln . ''

My grandfather , father and uncle wrote a book on Lincoln in 1992 called `` Lincoln : An Illustrated Biography , '' using the contents of the collection .

Each generation has continued the fascination with the collection but with a special interest in Abraham Lincoln .

CNN : What 's your involvement now in the collection ?

Kunhardt : My role is the assistant director of the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation . The foundation was established in 2002 by my father and uncle in order to preserve our family 's collection and make it available to the public .

During the past century , the collection had grown so large that we decided it was finally time to place it in public hands . That is why we first formed the Meserve-Kunhardt Foundation . And this year the collection will be moved to the Neuberger Museum of Art at the State University of New York in Purchase , New York , and the Purchase Library at SUNY , where it will be made available to students and scholars .

CNN : Was there ever any doubt in your mind that you wanted to go into this field ?

Kunhardt : I was an art history major at Wheaton College in Norton , Massachusetts . I 've always been fascinated with our collection . I was flattered to be asked to help with this project , the Lincoln book . I 've been an intern since I was about in fifth grade . I 've grown up knowing this collection very well , putting everything in plastic sleeves . Then when we found out that they were n't of archival quality , I had to change them to polyester sleeves .

It 's really been a family love . We 've all grown up with this collection . A great portion of this collection is now housed at the National Portrait Gallery . It was sold after my great-grandmother 's death .

CNN : What are some of the most valuable parts of the collection ?

Kunhardt : It includes many gems , like Alexander Gardner 's oversized portrait of Lincoln that was taken just before he went to Gettysburg . As a young boy , I remember it hanging on the walls of our home . We also own the bronze life mask of Lincoln cast by Leonard Volk .

CNN : Was Lincoln particularly interested in being photographed ?

Kunhardt : It was his way of reaching out to a wider audience . It was a process that was so slow , he had to sit for long periods of time with a neck brace in order to be photographed because the exposure time was forever . There are pictures where if he moved just slightly , the picture was blurry . Crowd scenes are always blurry because you could n't make the crowd stay still .

CNN : What 's the story of the Gordon Parks Foundation ?

Kunhardt : My grandfather Philip Kunhardt was managing editor of Life magazine . He and Gordon became close personal friends , and shortly before both of them died in 2006 , my grandfather showed Gordon how we were preserving our 19th-century collection . After Gordon 's death , his estate placed all of his photographs with us , and we formed the Gordon Parks Foundation .

CNN : What else are you working on ?

Kunhardt : Our next book is `` Lincoln Life Size , '' which will be published in September 2009 . We 're taking the Lincoln photographs and blowing them up to the actual size of Lincoln 's face ... and it will include his own reactions to some of the photographs .
