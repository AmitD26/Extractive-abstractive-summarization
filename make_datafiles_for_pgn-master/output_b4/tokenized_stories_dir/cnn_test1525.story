WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso met with President Barack Obama on Tuesday making him the first head of state to be hosted by the new administration .

Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso steps off his Boeing 747 at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland Monday .

It was a long trip -- 6,800 miles -LRB- 11,000 km -RRB- -- for a short meeting -- one hour -- and happened as Obama was preparing his first address to a joint session of Congress .

Sitting next to Aso in the White House , Obama said : `` The friendship between the United States and Japan is extraordinarily important .

`` It is for that reason that the prime minister is the first foreign dignitary to visit me in the Oval Office . ''

Obama said the U.S.-Japanese alliance would be crucial in solving international problems including climate change .

`` We think we have to work together , not only on issues relating to the Pacific Rim , but throughout the world , '' Obama added .

Aso said the global economy was also on the agenda at their meeting .

`` We are the number 1 and second biggest economies of the world . We will have to work hand in hand .

`` I think we are the only two nations which are powerful enough to solve those very critical , vital issue , '' Aso said .

Japan 's Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said that being the first to visit the Obama White House was an indication of the priority the new president placed on the relationship .

Another topic likely to have been on the agenda was Japan 's Asian neighbor North Korea , which U.S. intelligence says is preparing to test a long-range missile . Pyongyang has denied the charge , instead saying it is making preparations to launch a satellite .

A test-fire by North Korea in 2006 failed 40 seconds after launch . The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles -LRB- 6,700 kilometers -RRB- , which -- if true -- could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii .

Aso 's visit to Washington comes , as his approval rating stands at a meager 11 percent , the second lowest ever recorded for a Japanese prime minister . Yoshiro Mori , a former prime minister , resigned after his rate bottomed out at 9 percent .

Last week his finance minister Shoichi Nakagawa announced he will step down after coming under fire for appearing intoxicated at a weekend news conference during the G-7 meeting in Rome .
