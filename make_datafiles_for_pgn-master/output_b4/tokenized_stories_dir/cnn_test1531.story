-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Back in my day -LRB- a day not long ago , as it turns out -RRB- , you could go down to the local record shop and plunk down your paper-route money for little disks of plastic that were embedded with the latest sounds of your favorite musical performers .

A self-admitted tech geek , Chris Pirillo is president of Lockergnome.com , a blogging network .

Whether your tastes ran from Al Jarreau to `` Weird Al '' Yankovic , you could be assured that those purchased disks were yours -- for keeps .

You could play 'em over and over until they were scratched beyond repair , you could lend 'em to friends , you could amplify 'em at illicit Charleston dancing parties , you could sell 'em to used record stores or you could store 'em away in a safe deposit box in hopes they 'd gain value as collector 's items .

You could even make precious mix tapes for your soda-sharing sweetheart with songs copied from 'em , though this made recording industry executives more than a little nervous . And it was n't long before their weaselly whimpers of protest began .

As the digital age arrived to usher in more perfect ways to copy and distribute -LRB- aka `` pirate '' -RRB- what these executives saw as their property , those whimpers turned to howls . They 've only grown louder since .

So the recording industry has had a good gig going . It 's easy to see why its upper crust is miffed at lowly hoi polloi tampering with its bread and butter -LRB- or pizza . Or pie . Whatever crust suits your fancy -RRB- .

One can imagine some mad scientist under the employ of said recording industry locked away in an underground bunker somewhere cooking up a scheme so dark , so evil , that its repercussions would completely remap the way media would be controlled -- with consumers being suckered into paying much , much more for much , much less .

This scheme would come to be known as DRM . Digital rights management or devious rental misappropriation ? That 's right . Rental . You see , you do n't really buy music for keeps anymore . I mean , how can you when this is the sort of thing that can happen ?

It 's a bit like buying your dream car , driving it around for a while , then being told it 's got to be given back to the factory because the dealership where it was purchased no longer has a legal association with the factory .

Sorry if you thought you could drive it around until it was worn out beyond repair , if you thought you could lend it to your friends , if you thought you could drive it to the illicit Charleston dancing party , if you thought you could sell it to a used car dealer or if you thought you could store it under a tarp in your garage for the next couple of decades in hopes it would gain value as a collector 's item .

Being used to the old , tangible business model , you were under the impression that you 'd actually bought something . No one told you that you were merely borrowing someone else 's property for a while -LRB- and paying for the privilege to do so -RRB- . Like a sharecropper . Like a serf . Like a sucker .

And most people do feel like suckers when DRM locks them out of something that they feel they have every right to use , often to the point of attempting to circumnavigate this crappy , unfair system by means that might lead to trouble .

I can only conclude that , like bootleggers at the repealing of Prohibition , viruses and spyware acquired in pursuit of overcoming content restrictions would n't prosper in a DRM-free world . Really , it 's hard to take alarm from DRM-happy organizations such as the MPAA as anything but a double dose of dookie when you find out that 2007 was a record box office year in spite of all the pirates and ne'er - do-wells and whatnot !

Who , exactly , is getting plundered ? It 's no wonder blogger Cory Doctorow finds DRM to be one of the most offensive digital constructs on the planet . It 's inevitable . It 'll go away or change dramatically . Let 's hope sooner rather than later .

-LRB- This column was written before Apple announced that iTunes would be , at some point in the future , capable of providing DRM-free music throughout its entire library . This was pretty big news , considering how many people use iTunes to manage their music library . This is n't to say that the DRM-free tracks available at Amazon or eMusic are any less valid , but let 's face it : just about everybody who carries an iPod or iPhone also uses iTunes as the gateway for purchasing music . -RRB-

I subscribe to Rhapsody , so I can listen to just about anything from my desktop , and subscriptions are my preferred method of content consumption . I have an XM satellite radio subscription , I pay for just about every channel on digital cable and I have been known to purchase hard copies of content in the past -LRB- DVDs , CDs , 8-track tapes , etc. -RRB-

But DRM ? It 's no good . It 's downright evil . I find it very difficult to purchase something outright when I 'm told that I can only play it X times , only on X devices or for X long . That 's counter-intuitive and consumer unfriendly . There are certainly exceptions to the rule , but not when the content is a commodity .

I once found four different versions of the same song on my wife 's system . One had been purchased on Rhapsody , another on iTunes , another on Napster and the fourth was an MP3 ! Quadruple madness ! I do n't care how good a song is , she does n't need to have four copies of it -LRB- three of which are completely useless without the proper systems in place -RRB- .

The MP3 ? It 's as perfect as it needs to be , playable on just about anything these days . That 's consumer friendly .

Services that limit when and how you play digital music are ripping off consumers

Digital rights management , or DRM , means you do n't really own the music you buy
