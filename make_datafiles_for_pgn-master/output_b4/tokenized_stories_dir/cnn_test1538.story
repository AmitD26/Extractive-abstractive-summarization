-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistan cricketers have been told they will not be allowed to appear in the highly-lucrative Indian Premier League -LRB- IPL -RRB- this coming season because of fears over security .

Danish Kaneria , in action against India last December , was hoping to play in the Indian Premier League .

Stars from Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Sri Lanka , West Indies and , for the first time , England will be competing in the action that starts on April 10 .

Several Pakistan stars had also signed for IPL franchises while another five , including leg-spinner Danish Kaneria , were scheduled to appear at a players ' auction to be held in Goa , India , on Thursday .

However , the Pakistan Cricket Board -LRB- PCB -RRB- said players would not be allowed to play in the IPL this coming season on government advice .

`` We have informed the IPL and Indian board that our players ca n't take part in the IPL this year , '' PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters.com .

The decision follows concerns for players ' safety because of the tense relations between Pakistan and India after the Mumbai militant attacks in November .

Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik , who plays for Delhi , said the players would abide by the directives of the government and PCB .

Meanwhile , another former captain , Inzamam-ul-Haq is among several top Pakistan players who have successfully challenged a domestic ban imposed following appearances in the unofficial Indian Cricket League -LRB- ICL -RRB- .

Provincial Sindh High Court on Monday suspended the 2007 action taken by the PCB which must appear in court later this month to explain their action .

Players affected by the 2007 ruling also include Mohammad Yousuf , Imran Nazir , Mohammad Sami and Azhar Mahmood who along with Inzamam , played for Lahore Badshahs . Last year , the Badshahs named after a Pakistani city and with a number of Pakistani players won the ICL 20s Indian championship .

`` The honorable court has suspended this relevant clause of the PCB rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect , '' Zahid Fakhruddin Ibrahim , the legal counsel for the players , told Reuters.com .

Lahore coach Moin Khan , a former Pakistan captain , said the suspension of the ban was good for Pakistani cricket .

`` Some of the ICL players can still play for Pakistan and when they play in domestic cricket , youngsters will learn from them , '' Khan commented . `` The ban had hurt the players financially as well as cricket-wise , so it 's a great decision . ''
