LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jay Leno plans `` something really unusual and different '' when he hands over `` The Tonight Show '' to Conan O'Brien on May 29 , 17 years after Johnny Carson left the hosting duties to him .

Jay Leno begins `` The Jay Leno Show '' in September . His last `` Tonight Show '' is May 29 .

But do n't expect an emotional final show , since Leno and most of his staff are just moving across the NBC lot to produce a nightly prime time show debuting in September .

The traditional desk , chair and guest sofa probably wo n't follow Leno to his 10 p.m. show , but many of his favorite comedy elements will , Leno said .

Making people laugh before they go to bed is still the mission .

`` To me , 10 o'clock is like the new 11:30 , '' Leno said . `` I hear more and more people , even young people , say ` I ca n't stay up past 11 . I car pool , I got ta get up at 6 . ' ''

`` The Jay Leno Show '' will be competing against scripted dramas , not other comedians telling jokes , which Leno said should give him the edge over the long haul .

`` When I was a kid , there was comedy all over TV , and it was fun to watch , whether it was Carol Burnett or any of the sitcoms , '' he said . `` You 'd have a whole night of comedy , and now everything is very serious and it 's all murder . ''

The new show will have famous guests , but they will not drive the ratings , Leno said .

`` It 's all about the joke material , '' he said . He will `` try to keep it moving '' with a longer monologue with dozens of jokes , he said . The last half-hour will be filled with comedy , he said .

`` You look right in the camera , you directly talk to people as low-tech as possible , a little humor before people go to bed , '' he said .

NBC 's decision to put a talk-variety show on at 10 o'clock raised some complaints from affiliate station owners , worried the ratings would n't be strong enough to build an audience for their 11 o'clock local newscasts . The network 's Boston affiliate briefly threatened to move its news to 10 , pre-empting Leno .

Leno , who grew up in Boston , said he understood the economics behind the concern .

`` Although my job previous to this was to give a good lead-in to Conan , the job giving a good lead-in to the 11 o'clock news is really , really important , '' he said . `` That 's really where our local affiliates make their money , is on the 11 o'clock news . ''

He does n't expect to beat the dramas the first week out , but he noted those shows produce only about 22 new episodes a year .

`` During those repeat weeks and whatever , we 'll be live , fresh , original shows , '' Leno said .

The last week of `` The Tonight Show with Jay Leno '' will include a lot of looking back and `` best of '' segments , `` because that 's easier than writing new stuff , '' Leno said .

His guests Monday through Thursday include Mel Gibson , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Wanda Sykes , Billy Crystal and Prince .

Conan O'Brien will be on the final show , along with singer James Taylor .

Taylor 's songs were the last thing Leno heard on the radio when he left Boston in the late 1970s to start his career , so he wanted to have him as his last musical guest , he said .

Leno hinted the last show would have some surprises .

`` I have something really unusual and different planned , '' he said , `` Something really out of left field that we 're going to end on . ''

Pressed for more hints , Leno said it was `` something really personal , something that has to do with show and staff . ''

`` I think it will make people smile , '' he said .

Leno can smile as he moves on , having left the legendary show -- which has had only four hosts in 54 years -- as the top show for the past 16 years .

'' ` The Tonight Show ' is sort of the America 's Cup of television , and you do n't want to be the guy to screw it up , '' he said .

If he fails in the new show , he will be all right , he said .

`` If it did n't work out , then oh well , at least I have this . ''
