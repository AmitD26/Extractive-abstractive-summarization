WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An extended trip to Ecuador by two Americans changed from a dream to a nightmare after a brutal attack last week , according the couple 's blog and U.S. officials .

State Department spokesman Robert Wood confirmed Tuesday that the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador had been told that two Americans from Bend , Oregon , were attacked in the city of Esmeraldas , on Ecuador 's northern coast . But he said he could provide no further information because of privacy laws .

Two State Department officials , however , said that the man was stabbed more than 24 times and that his fiancée was beaten and raped .

CNN does not name the victims of sexual assault and has removed publication of the man 's name to help protect the identity of the woman .

The couple was evacuated to the United States on Tuesday for treatment , the officials said .

The couple wrote a blog throughout their trip . In the most recent post on Monday , the woman wrote that her fiance was in intensive care after three surgeries .

`` I was informed by the head surgeon there is no certainty he will survive , '' she wrote .

The earlier postings were happier reflections on their visit to Ecuador , a year-long trip they planned after getting engaged and selling all their belongings .

In the blog , the couple seems unconcerned about safety , posting that they occasionally hitchhiked , visited the homes of strangers and posed for pictures with new friends they made on their travels .

One senior official told CNN that the victims ' parents complained to U.S. consular officers in Ecuador that the Embassy did not do enough to warn Americans that many people have been attacked in Esmeraldas .

The State Department 's Web site advises caution when traveling to the northern border region of Ecuador , including Esmeraldas .

The travel advisory section notes that `` U.S. government personnel are under limitations with respect to traveling alone and over-nighting in these areas due to the spread of organized crime , drug trafficking , small arms trafficking , and incursions by various Colombian terrorist organizations . ''

The Web site says that since 1998 , at least 10 U.S. citizens have been kidnapped and one killed near Ecuador 's border with Colombia .

Wood on Tuesday expressed the State Department 's `` deep sympathy '' for the victims and said the department worked with the victims ' families to provide assistance .

`` It 's a horrible and shocking incident '' he said .
