-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Friday afternoon , Robin Meade , HLN anchor of `` Morning Express with Robin Meade , '' sky-dived just before former President George Herbert Walker Bush , who was commemorating his 85th birthday .

HLN Anchor Robin Meade chats with former president George H.W. Bush on his 85th birthday .

In recent years , Bush 's jumps have been about fun and celebration , but he first parachuted out of a plane when he was a naval aviator shot down over the Pacific Ocean during World War II .

On Friday , Meade and Bush were each strapped to a member of the Army 's Golden Knights parachute team . They made their jumps over Kennebunkport , Maine .

Before the jumps , Meade sat down with Bush to learn more about why he sky-dives . Plus , the former president weighed in on his and his son 's legacies , Supreme Court justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor , and his view on the country 's most pressing problems . This is an edited transcript of the interview .

Robin Meade : Thank you for making time for us to talk to you today .

George H.W. Bush : Oh , no , listen , I 'm so glad you 're here .

Meade : Happy birthday -- 85 .

Bush : I thought you did n't know .

Meade : Everybody knows , right ?

Bush : I know . It 's exciting . It really is wonderful .

Meade : What 's with your penchant for jumping still ?

Bush : Well , two reasons . One , it still feels good . You still get a charge out of it . Not easy to do at 85 , but ...

Meade : I do n't think it 's easy to do at any age . Watch Bush talk about why he still sky-dives ''

Bush : And secondly , just because you 're old , that does n't mean you ca n't do fun stuff . And you do n't want to sit around drooling in the corner . And so it 's a wonderful release .

And you know , because I was president , it sends a message all around . You can go out and get something going . Old guys can still have fun and still do stuff . And so , those are the two reasons . ...

Meade : You know , I 'm thinking about , too , last Saturday we had the 65th anniversary of D-Day , and that was the first time , in World War II , that you jumped , because you had to ditch your plane .

Bush : Yes .

Meade : Being back with service members up in a plane and getting ready to jump , does that kind of rekindle your feelings of connection ?

Bush : A little bit of deja vu . A little bit , but not that much anymore .

But yes , that 's one of the reasons I made the first controlled jump , is because I did the first jump -- or had to get out of the plane . And that was kind of ugly . I pulled the ripcord too early and hit my head on the tail of the plane going by . I was just lucky I 'm still alive .

And the parachute hung up for a minute on the tail of the plane .

It 's all kind of war stories . If I start telling you that , then you 'll tell me about your father 's war stories or something , or grandfather 's . And so it would n't be fair .

But I wanted to do it right . And I did it wrong then . It did save my life , but I did it wrong . So then I 've been out with the Golden Knights and I made several solo jumps . And now it 's tandem . I think they hope the old boy will remember to push .

Meade : Did I read somewhere that you asked President Clinton to jump once ? And he has n't jumped with you .

Bush : I may have asked him . I ca n't remember . Maybe I did , but I have a good relationship with him , a very good one . Watch Bush leave plane , land ''

Meade : Now that you 're 85 , are you thinking a little bit more about the `` L '' word , `` legacy ? ''

Bush : I was thinking of the `` L '' word being `` life . '' Life its own self . But no , I think my view on legacy is let the historians figure out what I screwed up and figure out what I got right .

And I 'm confident that , you know , we had a good administration and good people . And I think the same thing is true of our son . And you know , he had tough times and all , but he 's doing it right . He 's laying back there and he 's not criticizing the president . And I 'm very proud of him . Watch Bush and sons talk after the jump ''

And I hope that we both have set examples for how you ought to conduct yourself when you 've been president and then go out of office . Let the other guy do it , and support him when you can , and be silent . Do n't be out there criticizing all the time .

Meade : The one guy at the helm ?

Bush : Yes . And the `` L '' word , so it does n't -- I mean , my view is the historians will decide these things , for better or for worse and for right or for wrong . So I 'm not doing any biography or anything like that . And I 'm confident , because we had such a great team around us , that it will be favorable .

Meade : Tell me a little bit about Judge Sonia Sotomayor , she 's someone that you appointed to a U.S. District Court .

Bush : District Court .

Meade : Now she 's been nominated for the Supreme Court . What would her impact be on the Supreme Court , do you think ?

Bush : I think she 'd pull a ripcord just at the right time and make a very nice parachutist . I 'm going to leave that to others to analyze , but she should be given a fair hearing . She should be accorded every courtesy that goes with her record as a judge and her aspirations to be a Supreme Court justice . And I have a feeling she will be confirmed , but again , I do n't go into that day in and day out . ...

I think she 's had a distinguished record on the bench and she should be entitled to fair hearings . I like the way Sen. John Cornyn said it . I mean , he may vote for her , he may not . But he 's been backing away from these -- backing off from those who use radical statements to describe her or to attribute things to her that may or may not be true .

I mean , she was called by somebody a `` racist . '' Well , that 's not right . I mean , it 's not fair . It does n't help the process to be out there name-calling . So let them decide whether they want to vote for her or not , and get on with it .

Meade : There are so many causes and so many problems , so many issues right now .

Bush : Right . Right .

Meade : What is our most pressing problem , do you think , in the country ?

Bush : Well , I 'd have to say as long as people are hurting , the economy , and those who are out of work , ca n't find work . I think it will get better . I remain optimistic about our recovery and all of that .

But I 'd say that 's -- and health care . But those -- we 've got a lot of people working on those problems .

Meade : Oh , by the way , one more question . Is there going to be another jump after this ?

Bush : I think when I finish this one , I 'll say , `` See you on my 90th . '' Whether I do it or not , it gives me a goal . I 'm a goal-oriented guy . I really believe in goals . And so -- but we finish this one ...

Meade : I hope we do .

Bush : ... we 'll all be standing there . And they 'll say to you , `` What are you going to do ? '' And you 'll say , `` Five more years , I 'm going to do another one . '' And I 'll say , `` I 'll be there . ''

Ninety years old . I 'll do it .

Meade : Is it a deal ? In five years , we 'll do it again ?

Bush : I 'm for it . I 'm for it .

Meade : OK . All right .
