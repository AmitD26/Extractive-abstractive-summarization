LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Britons including Prime Minister Gordon Brown have leapt to the defense of their creaking healthcare service after President Barack Obama 's plans for a similar system in the United States were branded `` evil '' by Republicans .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a heartfelt message of support for the NHS via Twitter .

Tens of thousands of people have joined a Twitter group expressing pride in the UK 's National Health Service -LRB- NHS -RRB- , which offers free taxpayer-funded medical care to all British residents , while leading politicians have spoken out in support .

Republican former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin earlier this week condemned Obama 's plans to introduce a public heath insurance scheme as an `` evil '' move that would result in `` death panels '' deciding who would live or die .

Her criticism has been echoed by fellow Republicans in direct attacks on Britain 's NHS . In an article , Former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich said British healthcare was run by `` Orwellian '' bureaucrats who put a price tag on life .

The comments caused a storm of protest in the United Kingdom , with Prime Minister Brown wading into the argument via micro-blogging site Twitter , where a conversation chain , '' #welovetheNHS '' , is generating huge online traffic . Britons react to the U.S. healthcare debate ''

A posting on the 10 Downing Street Twitter site on Wednesday read : `` PM : NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort , despair and hope , life and death . Thanks for always being there . ''

The message was followed by another , from Brown 's wife Sarah , adding : '' #welovetheNHS -- more than words can say . ''

Professor Stephen Hawking , author of `` A Brief History of Time '' , also spoke out in favor of the British system , telling the Guardian newspaper that he owes his life to NHS treatment for the neuro-muscular dystrophy he has suffered from for 40 years .

`` I would n't be here today if it were not for the NHS , '' he said . `` I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived . ''

Despite the support , the 51-year-old NHS is regularly the target of criticism at home , with opposition politicians accusing Brown 's government of mismanagement resulting in long waiting lists and a `` lottery '' in deciding who gets life-saving drugs and surgery .

Nevertheless , opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron also added his voice to the defense campaign with a posting on his party 's Web site .

'' Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family .

`` One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you 're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are , where you are from , or how much money you 've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you . ''

His statement followed comments from one of his own party members backing the Republican criticism of the NHS . Dan Hannan , a Conservative member of the European Parliament reportedly said in an interview that `` he would n't wish it on anyone . ''
