TEHRAN , Iran -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Marching in dramatic silence , many with tape over their mouths , hundreds of thousands of Iranians kept alive public support for opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi Wednesday even as the government stepped up efforts to thwart daily protests calling for a new presidential election .

Supporters of defeated reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi line the streets of Tehran Wednesday .

Large crowds gathered in Haft-e-Tir Square in central Tehran Wednesday evening for a fifth day of protests , according to witnesses . The demonstrators are demanding that officials throw out the results of the balloting Friday that kept hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power .

More protests are expected Thursday after Moussavi , in a message on his Web site , called for an afternoon `` ceremony of mourning , '' which he planned to attend .

Referring to those who have died or been wounded `` as a result of illegal and violent clashes '' with his opponents , Moussavi urged people to gather in mosques and holy sites and wear `` mourning symbols '' in a show of sympathy and support for the families .

The protests have claimed at least eight lives , according to Iran 's government-funded Press TV . The eighth death was included in a report the Intelligence Ministry provided to parliament Wednesday , the network said . View a map of major rallies in Tehran ''

The National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Iranian Majlis briefed lawmakers `` about the current situation in the country , '' Press TV reported . No details of the report have been made public .

Iran is also investigating reports of violence at a Tehran University dormitory in the wake of rallies sparked by last week 's disputed election .

Moussavi and former President Mohammad Khatami sent a joint letter asking Iran 's courts to quell post-election violence and release protesters who have been arrested . The letter , posted on Moussavi 's Web site , said , `` the use of violence against ordinary people , raiding people 's residences just because they chant the sacred phrase of Allh-o-akbar -LRB- Allah is great -RRB- , beating up women and men , destroying buildings '' is not in line with the standards of the Islamic Republic .

For a second day Wednesday , pro-Moussavi marchers urged their peers to march silently -- perhaps as a way of keeping a low profile in the face of riot police , witnesses told CNN .

Protesters held placards and posters reading , `` Where is my vote ? '' and `` Freedom , '' the witnesses said . Some held signs that said `` Silence '' and put their finger to their lips .

Several business owners reported that they closed up shop early so their employees could attend Wednesday 's rally .

The government cracked down by banning international media from covering the protests and blocking access to Web sites . Watch Christiane Amanpour on media restrictions ''

A CNN iReporter who is not being identified said Wednesday 's rally ended without incident .

`` The people of Iran are finally fed up with the lies , the temperament , the foolish actions of Ahmadinejad , '' a 20-year-old Iranian man told CNN .

Authorities in Tehran transported dozens of protesters to jail Tuesday and blocked access to social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook . The government accused international reporters of being the `` mouthpiece '' of `` hooligans '' who have created unrest , and said it could not guarantee the safety of those reporters . -LRB- Full story -RRB-

`` I do believe them because the militia , they do n't care who you are . If they see a camera , you will be a target , '' said a CNN producer who is not being identified for his safety . He was referring to the Basij , a volunteer paramilitary force that takes its orders from the Revolutionary Guard and is suspected of being behind most of the violent acts .

Citizens were barred from using typical means of getting Iran 's stories to the outside world , but amateur videos and photos blossomed on sites such as YouTube and CNN 's iReport . The content was impossible to verify in most cases , and much of it was posted anonymously or through third parties , some with little information . iReport.com : On the ground in Iran

Iran 's Revolutionary Guard corps said it will pursue legal action against Web sites that it said were inciting people to riot . The Guard , a military unit that enforces the government 's Islamic codes and morality , blamed U.S. , British and Canadian companies , including American intelligence agencies , for financially and technically supporting the Web sites .

Despite the Guard 's threats , defiant Moussavi backers stood firm .

`` We are fighting with our lives and the world is just watching , '' said Ali , a Tehran University student who requested his last name not be used . `` They see how the government is trying to silence us , how they are beating us -- but they do n't come to our help . It 's OK . We will succeed , even if we have to fight alone . ''

Though the focus of demonstrations has been in Tehran , reports of protests and violence sprouted in all corners of Iran .

Human rights group Amnesty International , which is monitoring the situation through media reports and a network of local correspondents , said people had protested in Tabriz and Bobol in the north , Shiraz in the south and Mashad and Zahedan in the east .

It reported several deaths in Oroumiye and Shiraz as well as beatings by police , use of tear gas and the detention of hundreds of protesters .

A video on CNN 's iReport site by a third party showed several people who apparently had been shot , purportedly in the city of Esfahan , about 200 miles south of Tehran , and others attempting to treat them without medical supplies .

In Shiraz , 28-year-old Najmeh said she has taken to the streets every day since Saturday -- much to the chagrin of her worried parents . But Wednesday , the hospital nurse said no more .

`` The police are everywhere you look , '' she said . `` They hurt and arrested so many people last night that no one wants to go out . ''

Thousands of miles away , members of Iran 's national soccer team sported green arm and wrist bands Wednesday during their World Cup qualifying match against South Korea . The team does not normally wear bands of green , the venerated color of Islam that has been adopted by Moussavi supporters , and many Iranians viewed the gesture as a sign of support , although that has not been confirmed . -LRB- Full story -RRB-

Meanwhile , the Swiss ambassador to Iran -- the protecting power of the U.S. in Iran -- was called into the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday to hear Iranian complaints regarding U.S. interference in Iran 's election process , P.J. Crowley , assistant secretary of state for public affairs , told reporters in Washington .

U.S. President Barack Obama has voiced `` deep concerns '' about the elections , as has the European Union . But neither has dismissed the election results outright .

Counter-demonstrations by Ahmadinejad backers have also drawn thousands , reflecting a deep fissure in the country .

Iran 's all-powerful leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , appealed to the citizenry to stand behind the Islamic republic . He is to deliver a sermon Friday that will be closely watched for a sign of how the government plans to resolve the stalemate .

On Tuesday , Khamenei -- who has given his blessing to the election results -- asked the country 's election authority , the Guardian Council , to recount some of the votes . But Moussavi is asking for fresh elections .

CNN 's Samson Desta and Reza Sayah in Tehran , and Mitra Mobasherat and Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta , contributed to this report .
