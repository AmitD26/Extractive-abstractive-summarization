The Bamiyan Valley is a visually and archaeologically stunning part of Afghanistan . The region hopes to build its tourism industry .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thursday is `` Chinese night '' at the Hotel Silk Road in Afghanistan 's Bamiyan province .

Hungry guests sip cans of Coke and nonalcoholic beer and pick at a buffet that includes General Tsao 's chicken , egg drop soup and slices of sweet green melon grown in nearby fields .

When a vegetarian diner arrives , the hotel 's Japanese owner , Hiromi Yasui , runs back to the kitchen to whip up a dish of spinach , garlic and steamed rice .

`` This is the most clean kitchen in Bamiyan , '' she boasts in heavily accented English , as she directs her staff of Afghan assistants in fluent Dari . Yasui proudly points to an electric dishwasher , perhaps the only one of its kind in this battle-scarred Afghan province .

The Hotel Silk Road has been open for less than two years . The green concrete walls of this compound jar somewhat with the brown , mud brick architecture of Bamiyan Valley . But the hotel is probably the largest foreign private investment in Bamiyan 's fledgling tourism industry since the overthrow of the Taliban eight years ago . See photos of the Bamiyan Province ''

Aid workers say tourism is one of the greatest economic hopes for reviving this isolated , yet visually -- and archaeologically -- stunning part of Afghanistan , a region that has seen little infrastructure development over the last eight years , even though Bamiyan is one of the safest parts of the country .

`` The natural resources and cultural resources here are probably the single best place for economic development to happen , around revitalizing the tourism industry here , '' says Bob Thelen , the representative for the Aga Khan Development Network in Bamiyan . The nonprofit organization has been working with the government of New Zealand to distribute $ 1.2 million over a three-year period to develop eco-tourism as an industry in Bamiyan .

Bamiyan first attracted widespread international attention in 2001 , when Taliban militants spent weeks blowing up two giant statues of Buddha . For more than 1,500 years , these colossal figures -- one was 53 meters -LRB- 174 feet -RRB- high , the other 35 meters -LRB- 115 feet -RRB- -- stood like sentries overlooking this alpine valley . Today , the massive caves where the Buddhas once stood are huge , empty pockets carved into cliffs that dominate the countryside .

Despite the loss of these archaeological treasures , the cave network of monasteries that honeycomb the cliffs , as well as Bamiyan 's breathtaking mountains and alpine lakes , continue to attract a trickle of both Afghan and foreign tourists .

Hotel Silk Road owner Yasui spotted Bamiyan 's potential when she first traveled here as a photojournalist in 1996 .

`` Before the war , this was a touristic place , '' she says . `` More than 7,000 cars a day visited here . ''

In the '60s and '70s , Afghanistan was a Central Asian stop on the Hippie Trail , a destination favored by hash-smoking Western visitors driving Volkswagen vans .

But the Soviet invasion of 1979 plunged the country into a decades-long spiral of conflict . Bamiyan became the site of horrific massacres during the civil war of the 1990s and the subsequent rise of the Taliban .

The Taliban 's overthrow in 2001 seemed to open the door to new opportunity .

In 2002 , with the help of her Afghan husband and a Japanese investor who fronted hundreds of thousands of dollars , Yasui purchased a plot of land next to a bend in the river that runs through the valley . The couple then spent the next five years building their hotel .

`` I like Afghanistan , I like Bamiyan , '' Yasui explains . '' -LSB- But in the past , -RSB- I did n't want to stay more than three days , because there was no shower , no place to sleep . ''

Yasui 's hotel opened in 2007 . Rooms cost $ 100 a night , pricing them far out of the range of most Afghans . Guests must remove their shoes at the entrance and wear slippers , in accordance with Yasui 's strict standards of hygiene .

`` The furniture has all been imported from Pakistan , '' Yasui said . `` I bought the water glasses from the PX -LSB- American military supermarket -RSB- in Kabul . ''

Yasui is not the only hotelier in Bamiyan .

In 2003 , an Afghan businessman named Raziq got a jump-start on the local tourism industry , when he and several partners rented a house on a plateau offering a spectacular view of the Buddha cliffs . The building had been housing American special forces soldiers . Raziq and his partners rechristened it the Roof of Bamiyan Hotel .

Raziq , an ethnic Hazara who learned American-accented English catering to foreigners on Kabul 's touristic Chicken Street , says he got his inspiration to open a hotel after he saw female Western backpackers paying to sleep on the floor of a grimy tea shop in Bamiyan 's dusty bazaar .

Over the last year , the Afghan government declared Bamiyan 's Band-i-Amir lake , which sits 3,000 meters -LRB- 9,843 feet -RRB- above sea level , the country 's first national park . The New Zealand-funded eco-tourism project , in conjunction with the Aga Khan Foundation , also recently trained 22 young male and female Afghans to be professional tour guides .

The three-month course included `` the relevant topics for this area , geology , archaeology , history , hospitality , English , communication skills , '' said Thelen , of the Aga Khan Development Network .

One of these guides is former Roof of Bamiyan employee Jawad Wafa .

Though only 23 years old , this ambitious young Afghan plans to launch a tourism and logistics company , complete with a fleet of rental vehicles and guides .

`` The first thing we need to have more tourists in Bamiyan , we need security and peace . The second one is roads , '' Wafa says .

Eight years after the overthrow of the Taliban , the entire province of Bamiyan has barely 3 kilometers -LRB- about 2 miles -RRB- of paved roads . Travel here from Kabul requires at least seven hours driving on a bone-jarring dirt track .

But even this isolated oasis is feeling the threat of the mounting violence spreading across the country .

`` Every time there is a bomb in Kabul , visitors cancel reservations , '' says Raziq , operator of the Roof of Bamiyan Hotel .

And in recent months , troops from New Zealand have documented a spike in insurgent attacks , mostly along Bamiyan 's border with Baghlan province , a region where Taliban insurgents have grown increasingly active .

`` As much as on the one hand you can promote Bamiyan and other pockets throughout Afghanistan as secure and peaceful , there 's always the very real threat of violence , '' Thelen said .

Tour operators saw a dramatic drop in foreign visitors this summer , due to the uncertainty and violence surrounding the August 20 presidential elections .

In fact , the handful of people seen touring the remains of the Buddha statues last week were mostly American aid workers . They were sent by their organizations from less secure parts of Afghanistan , to take temporary shelter within the mountain walls of Bamiyan Valley .
