SOUTH CHINA SEA -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Aboard the Svend Maersk , the sound of the ship 's five-story high engine permeates like a heartbeat through the four-football field length of ship .

Chief Officer Christian Vium talks to CNN 's Eunice Yoon as night falls on the bridge of the Svend .

It 's also the heartbeat of the world economy , as the Maersk takes its thousands of containers filled with shoes , computers , furniture and fireworks from China to markets in Europe .

But a more telling sight is when the massive vessel nears Singapore and passes by dozens of idle ships .

`` A lot of ships have been taken out of service or laid up . Instead of sailing with half empty ships , it 's cheaper to lay up the ship , '' said Bo Nikolaisen , captain of the Svend . `` I feel lucky , of course , that I am on a ship that is still working . ''

A 10 percent drop is expected this year in the shipping business , which one analyst called `` a $ 20 billion black hole . '' It 's an industry that is a prime indicator of the global economy -- 90 percent of world trade is carried on ships such as the Svend Maersk to ports and onto shops around the world .

CNN sailed with the crew of the Svend Maersk for four days as the ship sailed from Hong Kong to Malaysia to get a sea-level view of the industry . What stands out on these vessels is the incredible size -- the vessels stack 15 stories high -- and streamlined crew : Only 21 men are required to run the ship .

The crew comes from Denmark , Germany , Romania and the Philippines . `` We 've been joking that the ship was the United Nations at sea , '' said Captain Nikolaisen . `` There are many nationalities , sometimes eight , maybe more . They are professionals -- most of them -- and they know that we can not afford to be unfriendly to one another . ''

Some of the crew are over 60 ; among the youngest is 24-year-old recruit Joey Lamasan . Lamasan still has trouble sleeping since he left his village in the Philippines . But here , he can earn triple what he would make back home .

`` The salary in the Philippines is too small compared to the salary on board the ship , '' said Lamasan , who is on a six-month contract -- typical for many young seafarers .

Piracy has been making the news in recent months , exacerbating economic concerns of the financial crisis . More common than large-scale theft of multi-million dollar cargo is thieves coming on board and stealing cash , computers and personal items .

But what they fear the most `` would be fire or explosion , '' said Captain Nikolaisen . `` We can not run away . ''

Life on the boat -- like the scenery -- can be repetitive . There is no mobile phone service , no booze , and limited Internet access . Many of the seamen work in two four-hour shifts ... to stay alert . Meals and coffee breaks are routine . Free time is usually spent alone in the cabins , playing computer games together , or occasionally calling home on a satellite phone .

`` Ten to 15 minutes just to hear how it 's going and keep contact . Also it 's nice for the kids too . So they can still remember what Dad sounds like , '' Captain Nikolaisen said .

After two months on the high seas officers get two months ' vacation . `` When I am out here I miss the family , '' Nikolaisen said . `` And when I am at home I miss a little bit being at sea . ''
