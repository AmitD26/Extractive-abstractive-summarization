MIAMI , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Father Alberto Cutie , an internationally known Catholic priest who admitted having a romantic affair and breaking his vow of celibacy , was married this week in Miami , Florida .

Father Alberto Cutie was married in Coral Gables , Florida , on Tuesday , according to court documents .

Cutie , 40 , announced last month that he was leaving the Catholic Church and joining the Episcopal Church .

A judge performed the marriage ceremony Tuesday in Coral Gables , Florida , for Cutie and Ruhama B. Canellis , 35 , according to Miami-Dade County court documents .

Cutie , whose name is pronounced koo-tee-AY , is a native of Puerto Rico , and Canellis was born in Guatemala .

He was received into the Episcopal Church on May 28 at Trinity Cathedral in Miami . He will pursue the priesthood in the Episcopalian faith , the Episcopal Diocese of Southeast Florida said in a written statement . It was not immediately clear how long the process would take .

Cutie -- sometimes called `` Father Oprah '' because of the advice he 's given on Spanish-language media -- shocked some in the Catholic community when photographs of him embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman emerged last month in TV Notas magazine .

He acknowledged having carried on a two-year relationship with the woman , who at that time had not been publicly identified .

`` This is something I 've struggled with , '' he told CNN in May . `` I do n't support the breaking of the celibacy promise . ''

Referring to his relationship with the woman , he said , `` It looked like a frivolous thing on the beach , you know , and that 's not what it is . It 's something deeper than that . ''

After the photographs surfaced , Cutie was removed from his duties at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace Networks .

Cutie had been president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications , home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace . He has also written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book , `` Real Life , Real Love . ''

John C. Favalora , archbishop of the Catholic Church 's Miami archdiocese , said last month that Cutie 's actions have `` caused a grave scandal within the Catholic Church . ''

Favalora also had harsh words for the Episcopal Church 's decision to accept Cutie .

`` This truly is a serious setback for ecumenical relations and cooperation between us , '' he said .
