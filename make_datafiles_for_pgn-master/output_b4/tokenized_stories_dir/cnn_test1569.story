Charles Smith , 48 , who was serving time on a murder charge , was captured in Grand Beach , Michigan , near the vacation home of Richard Daley , the mayor of Chicago , Illinois .

Daley said he was inside with his wife and three grandchildren at the time of the capture .

Smith and another of the escapees were spotted walking near the house at 5:30 a.m. by a Chicago police officer assigned to Daley 's security detail , the mayor said .

`` I think they were lost , and they happened to pass in the vicinity , '' Daley said .

Though Smith was captured and handed over to the Grand Beach Police Department , the other man escaped into the woods , where police have been searching , Daley said .

Police urged residents to be on alert .

`` I have residents in this area calling their neighbors and telling everybody , stay inside , keep their children inside and watch the news for updates , '' Dan Schroeder of the Grand Beach Police Department told CNN affiliate WLS on Monday .

Smith escaped from the prison in Michigan City on Sunday with convicted murderer Mark Booher , 46 , and convicted rapist Lance Battreal , 45 , said John Schrader , a public information officer with the Indiana Department of Corrections .

`` It appears they escaped by traveling in tunnels under the prison grounds , '' Schrader said Sunday . `` This is a very unusual occurrence . ''

Smith was sentenced in 1999 to a 95-year sentence for murder .

Battreal was sentenced in 1998 to 50 years for rape , criminal confinement and stalking .

Booher was sentenced in 1999 to 65 years for murder and robbery .
