-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors in Hungary indicted a Nazi war crimes suspect Tuesday with involvement in the brutal treatment and deportation of thousands of Jews during World War II .

Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary was allegedly `` actively involved '' in sending nearly 12,000 Jews to various concentration camps in the spring of 1944 , according to the Metropolitan Chief Prosecution Office in Budapest .

According to prosecutors , Csizsik-Csatary served as a senior Hungarian police officer in the city of Kosice , which is now in Slovakia but was under Hungarian rule in the 1940s .

Csizsik-Csatary topped the Simon Wiesenthal Center 's list of `` most wanted Nazi war criminals '' as of April this year .

The Wiesenthal Center , a worldwide Jewish rights organization , and a British tabloid , The Sun , highlighted the case against him last year after the suspect , who is reportedly in his late 90s , was found living in Hungary in 2011 .

The prosecution 's indictment describes how most of the local Jewish people were forced into a ghetto and a deportation camp housed in a brick factory in April 1944 , a month after the town was occupied by German troops .

Csizsik-Csatary was made commander of the `` collection and deportation camp '' in the brick factory at the beginning of May 1944 , it says .

During that month , he `` regularly beat the interned Jews with his bare hands and whipped them with a dog-whip without any special reasons and irrespective of the sex , age or health condition of the assaulted people , '' the indictment alleges .

From mid-May to the start of June , the almost 12,000 Jews held in the camp were transported in packed freight wagons to the concentration camps in German-occupied territories . The majority of the Jews deported from Kosice went to Auschwitz , it says .

The defendant `` was actively involved in and assisted the deportations , '' the indictment says .

In early June , he also allegedly `` prohibited cutting windows on the wagons which could have helped the about 80 people being crammed under inhuman circumstances in the windowless wagons to get more fresh air . ''

The indictment concludes that Csizsik-Csatary `` intentionally assisted the unlawful executions and tortures committed against Jewish people who were deported . ''

According to the Wiesenthal Center , Csizsik-Csatary was previously convicted in absentia and sentenced to death for torturing Jews and his role in the mass deportation to Auschwitz .

He escaped to Canada after World War II but was stripped of his Canadian citizenship in 1997 , and chose voluntarily to leave the country , the center claims .

He was rediscovered in the fall of 2011 as part of the center 's Last Chance project , and was charged last July with the torture of Jews in the Kosice ghetto , it says .

In March this year , a Slovak court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment to enable Slovakia to seek Csizsik-Csatary 's extradition from Hungary to stand trial for his crimes in Kosice , it adds .
