Editor 's note : John M. McCardell Jr. , president emeritus at Middlebury College , is founder and president of Choose Responsibility , a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age .

John McCardell says the 21-year-old drinking age is n't preventing widespread binge drinking .

-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- One year ago , a group of college and university presidents and chancellors , eventually totaling 135 , issued a statement that garnered national attention .

The `` Amethyst Initiative '' put a debate proposition before the public -- `` Resolved : That the 21-year-old drinking age is not working . '' It offered , in much the way a grand jury performs its duties , sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test . It invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate . And it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that , after 25 years , the status quo could not be challenged , even improved .

One year later , the drinking age debate continues , and new research reinforces the presidential impulse . Just this summer a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that , among college-age males , binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979 ; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent ; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent .

Remarkably , the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators , and accepted uncritically by the media , including editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success .

More recently , a study of binge drinking published in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced that `` despite efforts at prevention , the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise , and so are the harms associated with it . ''

Worse still , a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard : `` For each year studied , a greater percentage of 21 - to 24-year-olds -LSB- those who were of course once 18 , 19 and 20 -RSB- engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol . ''

Yet , in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinely -- indeed in life - and health-threatening ways -- violating it , there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a `` success . '' And elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country 's state legislative chambers : Any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation .

But it 's not 1984 anymore .

This statement may seem obvious , but not necessarily . In 1984 Congress passed and the president signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act . The Act , which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding , sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities . And indeed , that problem was serious .

States that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol-related traffic fatalities . It was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided . The results were predictable .

Now , 25 years later , we are in a much different , and better , place . Thanks to the effective public advocacy of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving , we are far more aware of the risks of drinking and driving . Automobiles are much safer .

Seatbelts and airbags are mandatory . The `` designated driver '' is now a part of our vocabulary . And more and more states are mandating ignition interlocks for first-time DUI offenders , perhaps the most effective way to get drunken drivers off the road .

And the statistics are encouraging . Alcohol-related fatalities have declined over the last 25 years . Better still , they have declined in all age groups , though the greatest number of deaths occurs at age 21 , followed by 22 and 23 . We are well on the way to solving a problem that vexed us 25 years ago .

The problem today is different . The problem today is reckless , goal-oriented alcohol consumption that all too often takes place in clandestine locations , where enforcement has proven frustratingly difficult . Alcohol consumption among young adults is not taking place in public places or public view or in the presence of other adults who might help model responsible behavior . But we know it is taking place .

If not in public , then where ? The college presidents who signed the Amethyst Initiative know where . It happens in `` pre-gaming '' sessions in locked dorm rooms where students take multiple shots of hard alcohol in rapid succession , before going to a social event where alcohol is not served . It happens in off-campus apartments beyond college boundaries and thus beyond the presidents ' authority ; and it happens in remote fields to which young adults must drive .

And the Amethyst presidents know the deadly result : Of the 5,000 lives lost to alcohol each year by those under 21 , more than 60 percent are lost OFF the roadways , according to the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse .

The principal problem of 2009 is not drunken driving . The principal problem of 2009 is clandestine binge drinking .

That is why the Amethyst presidents believe a public debate is so urgent . The law does not say drink responsibly or drink in moderation . It says do n't drink . To those affected by it , those who in the eyes of the law are , in every other respect legal adults , it is Prohibition . And it is incomprehensible .

The principal impediment to public debate is the 10 percent highway penalty . That penalty should be waived for those states that choose to try something different , which may turn out to be something better . But merely adjusting the age -- up or down -- is not really the way to make a change .

We should prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol in the same way we prepare them to operate a motor vehicle : by first educating and then licensing , and permitting them to exercise the full privileges of adulthood so long as they demonstrate their ability to observe the law .

Licensing would work like drivers education -- it would involve a permit , perhaps graduated , allowing the holder the privilege of purchasing , possessing and consuming alcohol , as each state determined , so long as the holder had passed an alcohol education course and observed the alcohol laws of the issuing state .

Most of the rest of the world has come out in a different place on the drinking age . The United States is one of only four countries -- the others are Indonesia , Mongolia and Palau -- with an age as high as 21 . All others either have no minimum age or have a lower age , generally 18 , with some at 16 .

Young adults know that . And , in their heart of hearts , they also know that a law perceived as unjust , a law routinely violated , can over time breed disrespect for law in general .

Slowly but surely we may be seeing a change in attitude . This summer , Dr. Morris Chafetz , a distinguished psychiatrist , a member of the presidential commission that recommended raising the drinking age , and the founder of the National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse admitted that supporting the higher drinking age is `` the most regrettable decision of my entire professional career . '' This remarkable statement did not receive the attention it merited .

Alcohol is a reality in the lives of young adults . We can either try to change the reality -- which has been our principal focus since 1984 , by imposing Prohibition on young adults 18 to 20 -- or we can create the safest possible environment for the reality .

A drinking age minimum of 21 has not changed the reality . It 's time to try something different .

It 's not 1984 anymore .
