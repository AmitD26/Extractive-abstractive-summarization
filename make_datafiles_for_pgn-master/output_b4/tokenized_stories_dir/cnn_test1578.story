-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Pennsylvania teens will serve time in a county jail for participating in a brawl that left a Mexican immigrant dead last July .

Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak 's joint trial began in late April in Schuykill County , Pennsylvania .

Brandon Piekarsky , 17 , was sentenced to 6 to 23 months , and Derrick Donchak , 19 , received 7 to 23 months for their roles in the beating death of 25-year-old Luis Ramirez .

Judge William Baldwin ordered the two to report to Schuylkill County jail on July 19 to begin serving their sentences .

An all-white jury convicted the two former high school football players of misdemeanor simple assault at trial last month and acquitted them of felony counts , including aggravated assault , ethnic intimidation and hindering apprehension -- charges that carried lengthier sentences .

In fashioning his sentence , Baldwin acknowledged the severity of the attack , which left Ramirez on life support for two days before he died , but said he could pass a sentence only in accordance with the jury 's verdict .

`` This was n't any fight , this was a group of young athletes ganging up on one person . That 's not a street fight , '' Baldwin said , referring to the defense team 's characterization of the confrontation as a `` street fight . ''

`` You picked out a guy who was n't one of you and beat the pulp out of him , '' Baldwin said .

The incident divided the small , rural mining town of Shenandoah into camps for and against the boys as it became a flashpoint for racial tensions across the country .

After the verdict , Gov. Ed Rendell sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder recommending that the Department of Justice pursue civil rights charges .

`` The evidence suggests that Mr. Ramirez was targeted , beaten and killed because he was Mexican , '' Rendell said . `` Such lawlessness and violence hurts not only the victim of the attack but also our towns and communities that are torn apart by such bigotry and intolerance . ''

During Wednesday 's sentencing , Baldwin said he was surprised that Rendell had chosen to speak out on the case and told the court that his sentence was not affected by the governor 's letter .

Fred Fanelli , Piekarsky 's lawyer , said he felt the sentence was harsh , given the circumstances . The judge could have sentenced the teens to probation under Pennsylvania 's sentencing guidelines .

`` I 'm disappointed that the court exceeded the aggravated range and sentenced him to six months . Having said that , I 'm glad we finally have some finality with this case , '' Fanelli told CNN affiliate WBRE after the sentencing .

Baldwin heard from several teachers , coaches and family friends who testified that the teens were good kids who fell into a bad situation . They urged leniency so the teens could realize their potential as adults .

Ramirez 's longtime girlfriend and mother of two of his children read a statement in open court before an audience consisting mostly of the defendants ' supporters .

`` He was my one and only love , and they took him away from me , and they took my children 's father , '' Crystal Dillman said . `` Now I have to live without my best friend and love of my life . ''

The court also heard a prepared statement from Ramirez 's mother , Elisa Zavala , who lives in Guanajuato , Mexico .

`` I 'm not the same person as before , now I feel a great emptiness within my heart , '' she wrote . `` There are moments in which I 'm alone and I ask myself : What do I do now that I do n't have my son ? I feel that without him , I am no one . ''

The judge also tacked on extra days to each boy 's sentence for consuming alcohol earlier in the evening . For providing the alcohol to his friends before the fight , Donchak was also convicted of corrupting minors .

Jurors found Piekarsky not guilty of third-degree murder . Prosecutors had said he delivered a fatal kick to Ramirez 's head after Ramirez was knocked to the ground in the alcohol-fueled brawl , which occurred on a residential street in Shenandoah the evening of July 12 .

Prosecutors alleged that a group of teens , which included Piekarsky and Donchak , baited Ramirez into the initial confrontation after a night of drinking , hurling racial epithets at the undocumented Mexican immigrant .

After the fight broke up , witnesses said Ramirez came back at the teens , who beat him so severely that , according to a medical testimony , brain tissue oozed out of his skull during surgery at a hospital .

Jurors heard from several teens who witnessed the incident but did not participate , as well as one teen who pleaded guilty in juvenile court and another whose case is being handled in federal court . The testimony painted a picture of confusion , with several inconsistencies as to who did what .

Defense lawyers argued that Ramirez 's death was a street brawl gone wrong that was not motivated by racial bias . They also suggested that Ramirez was responsible for triggering the second confrontation .

Advocacy groups condemned the verdict and sentences , and called on the Department of Justice to bring federal hate crime charges against the defendants .

`` The meager sentences handed to the defendants today leaves justice gasping for further redress , '' said Gladys Limon , staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund .

Citing FBI statistics , Limon said that hate crimes against Latinos have risen 40 percent in the last five years and called on Congress to strengthen hate crime laws .

`` The failure to hold these defendants responsible for their atrocious crimes denies justice not just to the Ramirez family , but also to the entire community by failing to deter similar crimes in the future , '' she said .

Richard Cohen , president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center , said the case had troubling implications in the wider context of race relations nationwide .

`` Since the year 2000 , we 've seen a 50 percent surge in the number of hate groups across the country , to a record 926 by our latest count , '' he said .

`` The increase has been fueled by the same factor responsible for the rise in the anti-Latino hate crimes -- a backlash against the changing demographics of our country , a backlash fueled by politicians trolling for votes and pundits looking for ratings . ''
