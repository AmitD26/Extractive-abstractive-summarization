COLUMBIA , South Carolina -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- At the University of South Carolina , the campus is quiet , but students were still heading to their classes after six students were killed in a beach house fire during the weekend .

The school is planning a short ceremony Monday evening to honor the six students who were killed Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach , North Carolina .

A seventh person killed is believed to be a student at Clemson University . Their identities had not yet been released Monday afternoon .

The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity .

`` The fraternities are praying for them and their families for the loss . It 's something we 're all affected by , '' Jay Laura , student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon .

In a later news conference , Laura said the outpouring of condolences was a testament to the character of the fraternity brothers who died . He also said he was proud of the way the university was coming together to support each other .

Lauren Hodge , the chapter president of Delta Delta Delta , said the sorority would have ministers and counselors at the sorority house to help USC students .

`` We 're trying to everything we can right now to help people cope , '' she said .

`` We 've spent a lot of time -LRB- counseling -RRB- with the students from the sorority and fraternity , '' said Dennis A. Pruitt , the vice president for student affairs . `` We encourage any student who is just learning of the situation and is a member of Tri-Delta or SAE to contact their parents and let them know they 're OK . ''

The school decided against canceling classed on Monday .

`` Going back to normal , everyday activities may be the best way for some to mourn and grieve , '' Pruitt said .

A weekly concert that is typically a well-attended event failed to bring out students on Monday . Most students appeared to be spending time in their dorm rooms where counseling was offered .

`` I feel shocked that something like that could happen here . You always see stuff like that happening at other schools , but you never it can happen to your school , '' said Artifa Ricks , a sophomore majoring in broadcasting .

Six other University of South Carolina students were treated for injuries at a local hospital and released , the school said . The university is providing counseling and assistance to students who have requested it .

`` When any one member of our family is lost , every one of us is diminished . I 'm profoundly saddened , as are all members of Gamecock Nation , by these tragic deaths , '' said Dr. Andrew Sorensen , the university president .

The students were on a weekend getaway at Ocean Isle Beach , a popular resort destination along the southern coast of North Carolina . E-mail to a friend
