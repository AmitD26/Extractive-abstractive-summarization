A Chinese boy gets treated for blood poisoning in Shaanxi province Aug. 15 .

At least 851 children living near a plant in northwestern China 's Shaanxi province were found to have excessive lead levels in their blood , according to the Xinhua news agency .

The Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Co. would cease operations no later than Saturday , Xinhua reported Wednesday , citing local authorities .

County officials had agreed to relocate residents who live within 1,640 feet -LRB- 500 meters -RRB- of the Dongling Lead and Zinc Smelting Co. in three years , but the relocation is behind schedule , Sun Hong , the company 's general manager , told Xinhua .

The local government has pledged to speed up the relocation , Xinhua reported this month .

A second smelter also was closed Wednesday in central China and two of its executives detained , a local official said , according to Xinhua ,

Initial tests showed more than 1,300 children in the Hunan province town of Wenping have excessive lead in their blood from the Wugang Manganese Smelting Plant . A second round of testing has been ordered to confirm the results .

The plant opened in May 2008 without gaining the approval of the local environment protection bureau , said Huang Wenbin , a deputy environment chief in Wugang City , Xinhua reported . The plant was within 500 meters -LRB- about a quarter mile -RRB- of three schools .

The poisonings have occurred against the backdrop of China 's rapid industrialization , which has produced economic success and wrought environmental havoc . Hundreds of millions of Chinese lack access to uncontaminated drinking water , and air pollution is blamed for myriad deaths and illnesses every year . Toxic air enshrouds cities across the country , one of the most polluted in the world .

The government has stepped up anti-pollution efforts in recent years , but many companies flout such campaigns and laws .
