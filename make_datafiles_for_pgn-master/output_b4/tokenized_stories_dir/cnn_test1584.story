-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Researchers announced this week that they 've found a new gene , ALS6 , which is responsible for about 5 percent of hereditary Lou Gehrig 's cases .

The discovery of a new gene mutation may allow those with ALS in their family to be tested .

It 's being called a `` momentous discovery '' by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association .

Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital , the University of Massachusetts and Kings College in London found the mutation by doing detailed sequencing of the genes in several families with an inherited form of ALS . The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association .

ALS , a disease of the nervous system , impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis . It was brought to national attention in 1939 , when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig 's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS . Today , the disease is most commonly known by his name .

ALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell 's nucleus , but in patients with Lou Gehrig 's disease , it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps .

ALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding , combined with a gene they discovered last year , TDP-43 , may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease .

Both genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they 're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing .

Lucie Bruijn , senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association , likens this process to building an engine : If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way , the engine does n't work right .

`` Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place , and any imbalance ... can cause things to go awry , '' Bruijn said .

`` It 's exciting because what it 's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme , '' Bruijn said . `` We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS . A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases . ''

She believes this gives researchers `` huge '' potential to develop new therapies .

And new therapies are needed .

There is no cure and only one treatment for ALS , a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord . These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness , twitching , cramping and thick speech , eventually leading to paralysis . According to the ALS Association , the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year , and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary .

The discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene -LRB- this makes three genes -RRB- . Bruijn says a test `` will be possible ; however , currently , it is not widely accessible '' and `` it would only be used in familial ALS patients . ''
