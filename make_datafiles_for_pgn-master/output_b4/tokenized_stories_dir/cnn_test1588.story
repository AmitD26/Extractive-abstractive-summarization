-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state , an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday .

In an hours-long process , 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office . A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement .

Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti .

On Wednesday , lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote , making for a slow process .

The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29 , giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya 's fate .

The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras .

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya 's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month .

`` We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the -LSB- Honduran -RSB- Congress would have approved his return , '' Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington . `` Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled . It has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept President Zelaya as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of Honduras throughout this political crisis . ''

The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis , in addition to the unity government .

`` The absence of democratic , constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo , '' a senior U.S. administration official said on the conference call , remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation . `` The election is a step toward a day where Honduras will have an electorally legitimate government in place . ''

Zelaya , who says he does not recognize the election , also has said he would not accept the post even if Congress voted him back in . Accepting the job , he said , would legitimize the coup .

Many nations said before the Sunday 's election they would withhold recognition if Zelaya were not returned to power .

Some countries , such as the United States , Colombia and Costa Rica , have said they will recognize Lobo . Others , such as Argentina , Brazil and Spain , have said they will not .

Despite the diplomatic pressure from abroad , lawmakers were voting the will of the people , Congressman Juan Angel Rivera Tabora said .

`` History will judge us , and I 'm certain it will judge us positively , '' he said . `` Congress did n't make this problem . The problem came to us . ''

Those voting against Zelaya echoed those sentiments . After the coup , the same body voted to install Micheletti as interim president . Wednesday vote only happened because the agreement between the two sides called for it , many lawmakers repeated .

Zelaya 's supporters argued that the coup was an illegal act that only restitution could heal .

Congress sought opinions from the nation 's Supreme Court and other bodies before holding the vote . The court ruled last week that Zelaya can not return to office without facing trial on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when he tried to hold a vote that could have led to the removal of presidential term limits . The Supreme Court ruled before the coup that the vote was illegal and Congress had forbidden it .

The coup came on the day the term-limits vote was to have been held .

Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya 's removal was a constitutional transfer of power , not a coup .

But the United Nations , the Organization of American States , the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately . He was n't .

Zelaya , who was flown out of the country while still in his pajamas on the day of the coup , has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras ' capital since secretly returning to the country September 21 .
