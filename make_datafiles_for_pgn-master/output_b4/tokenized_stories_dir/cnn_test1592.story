-LRB- OPRAH.com -RRB- -- He can saw himself in half , sing a selection of Broadway showtunes and swing on a flying trapeze .

Neil Patrick Harris says he 'll try to make viewers feel like they 're in good hands with him as Emmy host .

When Neil Patrick Harris , one of the stars of the hit CBS sitcom `` How I Met Your Mother , '' is n't dabbling in the extraordinary , well , he 's probably hosting an awards show .

In the late '80s , Neil -- known as NPH to his fans -- landed the starring role on `` Doogie Howser , M.D. '' After years of child stardom and teen heartthrob status , Neil left the small screen for the stage . He became a respected Broadway actor , starring in shows like `` Rent , '' `` Cabaret '' and `` Proof , '' before returning to television .

Now , millions know Neil as Barney Stinson , the womanizing , slap-happy sidekick on `` How I Met Your Mother , '' which begins its fifth season September 21 .

Like Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson before him , this man-of-many-talents is also making his mark as an awards show host . On Sunday , September 20 , Neil will host the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards . He shares his thoughts on fate , finding balance and making out with his co-star .

Kari Forsee : How are you preparing for Emmy night ?

Neil Patrick Harris : I 'm just trying to make sure all the comedy host elements are in place . We 'll have a good opening bit and a couple surprise things throughout . We want to balance respecting the show and the doling out of the awards with the sort of random things that will keep the audience 's attention in other ways . So that 's kind of been my job . You want to make it unique and , yet , classic . That 's a tricky dynamic . Oprah.com : Planning an Emmys party ? Get 4 entertaining solutions

KF : I can imagine . How often are you rehearsing ?

NPH : Well , it 's sort of a litany of e-mails and phone calls all day with the producers . We had a great opening short film we are going to shoot , and it would be the first thing you shot . That was going to be with Alec Baldwin , and he withdrew at the last minute . So that got scrapped , and we 're off to plan D , E or F. It 's sort of like now you go : `` That 's fantastic , great . We 've got that person , '' or `` Oh , that person did n't work . Now what do we do ? '' A lot of `` now what do we do ? '' questions .

KF : Now at the Tony Awards , you sang a , may I say , legendary closing number . Will you be singing at the Emmys , or is dancing more the focus ?

NPH : I suspect you wo n't see me dancing very much . That 's not my forte . But yeah , I might throw some sort of singing into it . I have n't quite decided . I sort of feel like the Emmys are so classy and glamorous and black tie , the host really needs to respect his job title . I think too much `` Look at me ! Look at me ! '' as the host of a show that big is counterproductive . So long as I make you feel confident that you 're in good hands with me as the host , then it 's my real responsibility to introduce you to a lot of other people and elements -- other presenters who are then going to talk to you or other introductions of next sections . That 's my role . It 's not really to be a song-and-dance man .

KF : Did you look back at past Emmy hosts for inspiration ?

NPH : Very much . Steve Allen hosted the first televised awards , which was the 7th Annual Emmy Awards , in , I think , 1955 , and he was great . That was sort of my inspiration for all of this . He just had such a dry wit , a commanding voice , a great presence . You knew when you were watching it that if something went wrong , you could look to him , and he would steer you through it . It was always with great dignity and a dry sense of humor , and he was sort of out there all the time . He was definitely the `` host . '' He definitely helped the show , so I like that . Johnny Carson , too , was great .

KF : Hypothetically , what would you do if your name was called for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series this year ?

NPH : Oh my , I would graciously accept , try to keep my speech to a minimum , and then quickly set it backstage , because I have a lot more to do for the next couple hours .

KF : Is the award given out early on in the show ?

NPH : I think it will be within the first hour . It 's a nice and refreshing win-win for me , because if I do happen to win , it will be awesome-tastic , and oddly , a bit of a distraction . And if I do n't win , it just provides lots of comedy fodder for the rest of the show . So I 'm pretty safe either way . It 's a tough category , for sure .

KF : So the day after the Emmys , a new season of `` How I Met Your Mother '' premieres . Last season 's finale left us wondering if your character , Barney Stinson , will finally settle down and start dating Robin Scherbatsky .

NPH : They certainly take a stab at it . I know there will be lots of necking and making out . Lots of canoodling between Robin and I. My lips are chapped . They have strong physical chemistry , apparently .

KF : `` How I Met Your Mother '' puts a lot of stake in fate . Are you a believer in fate ?

NPH : I do n't know what to make of fate . I certainly do n't think you can predetermine things . It feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen , it rarely does . But if you allow for good things to happen , they seem to . I think a lot of that is more perception , you know ? A lot of people would take getting rear-ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another , and I think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it was n't worse . That allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that . I think if you try to angle your life in those ways , then fate , destiny , karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth . Oprah.com : How to get lucky in love and life

KF : I 'm curious , how did your father meet your mother ?

NPH : They were college , fraternity and sorority sweethearts . This was in Albuquerque . She was in Alpha Chi Omega . And he was in , something Pi ? They did the whole , you know , he gave her his pin . She was pinned , and they were a couple . Then , they were married , and they 've only been with each other . I 'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents . ... We did n't have a lot of money growing up , but we were never made to feel poor . They had amazing senses of humor , senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids . So I lucked out .

KF : Did your parents help you survive child stardom ?

NPH : They were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous . They 're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame . Their main concern was just my well-being and my brother 's well-being during all of our crazy times , whether they be intimate or very public . They 're remarkable people .
