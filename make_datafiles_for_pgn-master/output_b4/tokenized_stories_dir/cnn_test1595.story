NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. David Ores , or Dr. Dave as he 's referred to by his patients , is n't your average neighborhood doctor . It 's not because his arms are covered with tattoos of nearly naked women or because he drives a Harley to work , but because eight months ago he started New York City 's first health care cooperative for restaurant workers .

The Harley-riding Dr. David Ores has started New York 's first health care cooperative for restaurant workers .

The Restaurant Worker 's Health Care Cooperative , currently servicing 15 restaurants in lower Manhattan , provides free health care to all restaurant employees , from bus boys to bartenders . Every month the owner or manager of each restaurant contributes money into a common fund based on its number of employees . In return , their workers can go see Dr. Dave with any kind of health issue they may have .

Dr. Dave , a graduate of Columbia Medical School , has been treating uninsured people for more than a decade . He decided to start the co-op after noticing a trend among patients working in the restaurant industry .

`` Over the past ten years , I 've seen many patients that work in restaurants , and there were always two things in common : They had no real access to any kind of medical care , and they also waited a long time to come see a doctor , '' Ores says . `` I decided to form this co-op in order to get them early , basic health care . '' Watch the doctor at work ''

The restaurant workers , many of whom have never been medically insured , can now make appointments , stop by the office , text medical questions and even send photos of their injuries to Dr. Dave , free of charge .

`` This is my first checkup ever , '' Asaf , a waiter at Macao Trading Co. , told CNN in the waiting room . `` It 's an example of how someone finds an easy and fair solution to a serious problem or a need . ''

And statistics show there is , in fact , a need .

According to a 2005 study by the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York , about 73 percent of all New York restaurant workers -- about 160,000 people -- have no health insurance .

The co-op comes as a relief to restaurant owners who would ideally like to provide medical insurance to their employees but can not afford to do so .

`` Obviously we want to take care of our people , but financially we 're only capable of doing so much , '' says restaurant owner Billy Gilroy . `` This was the perfect opportunity to be able to extend the ability to find medical services through the restaurant , but in a way that 's affordable . ''

The price for use of the co-op 's services ranges from as little as $ 50 a month for an establishment with a couple of employees to $ 400 a month for a larger restaurant .

Dr. Dave , who works as a general practitioner and sees other patients , is able to support himself because both his office and apartment are located in rent-stabilized buildings operated by the Lower East Side People 's Mutual Housing Association , a not-for-profit housing group that charges him only $ 800 a month for rent .

With health care currently a hot-button political issue , Dr. Dave sees this local , not-for-profit health system as a model for how national health care in America could work .

`` I 'm not against profit , '' he says . `` I just do n't think you can have a for-profit health system that provides everyone with proper health care . It 's just never going to work . ''

In the meantime , Dr. Dave has plans to expand .

`` In the next year I 'd like for our little health co-op to offer more services . Maybe dental , more hours in the evening , maybe hire a second doctor . ''

He also hopes to offer routine checkups for all workers , so he can catch illnesses early and hopefully prevent steeper medical costs down the road .

Although Dr. Dave started the program only eight months ago , he 's no stranger to helping others .

`` I would call him a pioneer in health care , I would call him a pioneer as a human being , and also as a doctor , '' says restaurant owner and longtime friend Julio Pe√±a , who has been benefiting from Dr. Dave 's services for quite a while . `` We 've been trading pasta and cappuccinos for stitching somebody up with him for years , and now that he 's doing it with other people , it 's great .
