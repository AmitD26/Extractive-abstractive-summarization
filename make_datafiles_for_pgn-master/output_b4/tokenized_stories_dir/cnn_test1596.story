-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Authorities in Alaska were working Friday to ensure public safety after a woman was mauled to death by animals -- most likely wolves .

The victim , Candice Berner , 32 , was found dead Monday in the village of Chignik Lake , authorities said .

If the attack is confirmed , it would be the first fatal encounter with wolves on record in Alaska , said Megan Peters , spokeswoman for the Alaska State Troopers .

If officials determine which animals were responsible , authorities will try to find them and destroy them , Peters said .

An investigation determined the death was `` non-criminal in nature , '' the troopers said in a news release , adding that `` it has been concluded that the animals most likely responsible for the attack are wolves . ''

Troopers were working with the Department of Fish and Game `` as it addresses public safety concerns regarding wolf activity close to the community of Chignik Lake , '' the troopers said .

Berner , a Pennsylvania native , moved to Alaska last year .

Chignik Lake is in the southwest part of the state , part of the Alaska Peninsula that shoots out from the mainland . The community of about 105 residents is about 475 miles southwest of Anchorage .

Several Chignik Lake residents have reported recent encounters with wolves , some of them threatening , Peters said .

Authorities saw a bloody trail where Berner had been dragged off a road and wolf tracks near the body , Peters said .

`` It 's hard . It 's really hard . I feel horrible , you know , empty , '' her father , Robert Berner , told KTUU-TV in Anchorage , Alaska . `` They said Candice put up a good fight , '' he said , `` and there must have been two , maybe three of them . ''

Berner described his daughter as `` small and mighty , '' a woman who liked to box , lift weights and run , according to a dispatch in the Slippery Rock Herald , the newspaper in her Pennsylvania hometown . She was training for a race and could get into a meditative state when running , her father said .

Foul play has been ruled out , Peters said .

Berner was an itinerant special education teacher , according to CNN affiliate WTAE-TV of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Authorities listed her address as Perryville , Alaska , around 30 miles from where her body was found .

She had arrived in Chignik this week to work at the school there , the Slippery Rock Herald said . Berner had been with the Lake and Peninsula Borough School District since August , schools official Rick Luthi said .

Her co-workers last saw her alive at the end of the workday Monday , Luthi told the newspaper .

`` She had made the comment that she wanted to get out and get some fresh air , '' Luthi said . `` We assumed that that meant a run for Candice , because she had a habit of doing that whenever she could . ''

Her father was a professor and taught her first special education class , KTUU-TV said .

`` I felt like it was work worth doing , and I 've always felt that way , '' Robert Berner said . `` I thought Candice would be able to handle it well , because she has a tremendous tolerance for those who are different . ''

Residents in Berner 's hometown recalled an adventurous woman who loved the outdoors and longed to live in Alaska , WTAE said .

Patrick Grant , of Slippery Rock University 's Special Education Department , told the station that Berner returned home for grad school and that he last saw her about 18 months ago .

`` She cared about other people , '' Grant told WTAE . `` She cared about kids . She cared about how she 'd make a difference in the world . That 's why she was there . She wanted to make a difference in the world . ''

Berner was featured in Slippery Rock 's winter 2010 journal , where she talked about life in Alaska without television and having her groceries flown in . She also wrote a blog called `` Adventures of an Alaskan Bush Teacher , '' posting photos on it and writing about the wildlife -- particularly the wolves that lurked in the wilderness .

`` This tragedy affects all of us . We 're all deeply crushed by it , '' Grant said . `` We 're all deeply concerned about someone so young reaching such a tragic death , and we 're all asking ourselves , ` What can we do ? ' And I do n't know what the answer is . ''
