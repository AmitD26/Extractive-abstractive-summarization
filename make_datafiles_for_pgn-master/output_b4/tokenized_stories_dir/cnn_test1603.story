NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What started as a college a cappella pastime became a ticket to the big time for 10 Indiana University graduates .

Straight No Chaser broke up years ago , but success on YouTube brought the band back together .

Last year a member of the disbanded group -- called Straight No Chaser -- posted a video of a quirky 1998 performance of `` The 12 Days of Christmas '' on YouTube . It got more than 8 million hits . And one of the people watching was Craig Kallman , chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records .

Kallman summoned a couple of the troupe members to Los Angeles , where he offered them a record deal . Straight up . The boys -LRB- now men , of course -RRB- got back together and within 10 months -- and almost 10 years after graduation -- had a debut album neatly tied with a bow .

And you thought your college reunion was exciting . Watch Straight No Chaser blend their voices ''

`` Holiday Spirits '' mostly features festive covers such as `` Santa Claus Is Coming to Town '' and `` Silent Night , '' all sung in the a cappella tradition but with creative and entertaining tweaks . -LRB- They do a stirring Christmas-infused rendition of Toto 's `` Africa . '' -RRB-

Members of Straight No Chaser sang for CNN in New York recently , talked about their surprising career turn and where it leaves their day jobs .

CNN : What is it like then to actually become a YouTube sensation ?

Randy Stine : Well , -LSB- Jerome -RSB- got recognized on the street in Hong Kong .

Jerome Collins : A person walked up to me and said , `` Hey , I know this may be out of line , but you look like this guy on this video I just saw . '' I called -LSB- Randy -RSB- and I was like , `` We officially made it . We 're being recognized in Hong Kong by some random person on the street . '' So it was kind of cool , and that 's when I knew that -LSB- it -RSB- was on a bigger scale than we thought .

CNN : What went through your mind when you got the call from Atlantic Records ?

Stine : I was half believing it was a prank . I got the call from Craig , and while I 'm talking to him the first time , I 'm on the computer Googling his name to read his bio . It was just kind of a dream phone call . And I kept thinking , `` Is this really happening ? '' It was pretty amazing .

CNN : You all have day jobs , do n't you ?

Stine : Yeah . I was actually in Chicago doing IT sales , wishing I was still in music . We 're all spread across the country . We 've got guys in Chicago , Vegas , Atlanta , here in New York . Jerome was actually in Hong Kong when all this started , and he moved back from Hong Kong to be a part of this .

CNN : What were you doing in Hong Kong ?

Collins : I was doing a festival of `` The Lion King , '' and I was Simba . We have one guy selling medical devices , another guy a reporter for ABC , one guy working at a bank , another guy a teacher . ... You name it , we have it .

CNN : And how do you arrange rehearsing or performances if you are scattered throughout the country ?

Stine : That 's probably one of the big challenges . We all have to fly in from whatever city we 're in to New York , to Chicago , L.A. , wherever we have to meet up to rehearse or record . But when we get together it 's like no time has passed .

CNN : Are you going to keep your day jobs ?

Collins : There 's no chance that I 'm going to be keeping my day job . I obviously gave it up to try and do this so I know for a fact that I 'm not going to be going back . I hope they did n't hear that . This is it . This is what I dreamed to do as a kid . This is what I want my day job to be .

Stine : I quit my job in July . I had to get enough time off to record but could n't do it . I have one shot at this . I know there are tons of other musicians out there who would cut off a limb to have this opportunity so I could n't pass it up .

Collins : We 're going to force the other guys to make sure they quit their jobs . With the scheduling and the touring some of them may not have a job to go back to . So that 's what we 're hoping may happen .

CNN : That 's what you 're hoping ? You 're hoping that they will get fired ? That 's nice !

Stine : Yeah , we 'll make the phone calls on their behalf . Like , `` he 's not coming into work today '' -LSB- Stine and Collins laugh . -RSB-

CNN : Now that you have your debut album in the can , are you thinking ahead to other projects ?

Collins : Well , that 's the whole point . We hope that that momentum -- not only with YouTube , but with our album -- keeps going so we can get right back in the studio and come out with some fresh new music that 's not holiday . We do n't want to pigeonhole ourselves . We do all genres , all types of music .

CNN : Part of your appeal seems to be that you do n't really take yourselves too seriously , do you ? You have a lot of fun with it .

Collins : It 's really fun singing with your best friends onstage . We have fun . Outside of this business , we are still friends ; we all go do things together ; we all still hang out . We still fight like brothers . So essentially ... I hope that never changes because that 's what made us who we are today .

CNN : What about your personalities ... have you all changed a little since you were at school together ?

Stine : I think all of us are pretty much the same , just maybe more opinionated .

Collins : Some of us have wives . That 's the only thing that 's changed .

CNN : Why are you called Straight No Chaser ?

Stine : We basically came up with the name from Thelonious Monk , his jazz album and song . And we just thought it really tied in well to our mentality of voices , no instruments . And of course it ties in to college and visiting the bars late at night .
