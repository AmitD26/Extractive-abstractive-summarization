SANTA BARBARA , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Barbara Harvey climbs into the back of her small Honda sport utility vehicle and snuggles with her two golden retrievers , her head nestled on a pillow propped against the driver 's seat .

Californian Barbara Harvey says she is forced to sleep in her car with her dogs after losing her job earlier this year .

A former loan processor , the 67-year-old mother of three grown children said she never thought she 'd spend her golden years sleeping in her car in a parking lot .

`` This is my bed , my dogs , '' she said . `` This is my life in this car right now . ''

Harvey was forced into homelessness this year after being laid off . She said that three-quarters of her income went to paying rent in Santa Barbara , where the median house in the scenic oceanfront city costs more than $ 1 million . She lost her condo two months ago and had little savings as backup .

`` It went to hell in a handbasket , '' she said . `` I did n't think this would happen to me . It 's just something that I do n't think that people think is going to happen to them , is what it amounts to . It happens very quickly , too . ''

Harvey now works part time for $ 8 an hour , and she draws Social Security to help make ends meet . But she still can not afford an apartment , and so every night she pulls into a gated parking lot to sleep in her car , along with other women who find themselves in a similar predicament . Watch women who live in their cars ''

There are 12 parking lots across Santa Barbara that have been set up to accommodate the growing middle-class homelessness . These lots are believed to be part of the first program of its kind in the United States , according to organizers .

The lots open at 7 p.m. and close at 7 a.m. and are run by New Beginnings Counseling Center , a homeless outreach organization .

It is illegal for people in California to sleep in their cars on streets . New Beginnings worked with the city to allow the parking lots as a safe place for the homeless to sleep in their vehicles without being harassed by people on the streets or ticketed by police .

Harvey stays at the city 's only parking lot for women . `` This is very safe , and that 's why I feel very comfortable , '' she said .

Nancy Kapp , the New Beginnings parking lot coordinator , said the group began seeing a need for the lots in recent months as California 's foreclosure crisis hit the city hard . She said a growing number of senior citizens , women and lower - and middle-class families live on the streets . See how foreclosure filings are up 75 percent ''

`` You look around today , and there are so many , '' said Kapp , who was homeless with her young daughter two decades ago . `` I see women sleeping on benches . It 's heartbreaking . ''

She added , `` The way the economy is going , it 's just amazing the people that are becoming homeless . It 's hit the middle class . ''

She and others with New Beginnings walk the streets looking for people and families sleeping in their cars . The workers inform them about the parking lot program .

New Beginnings screens people to make sure they wo n't cause trouble . No alcohol or drugs are allowed in the parking lots .

`` What we are trying to do is we pull bad apples out , and we put good apples in the parking lots and really help people out , '' said Shaw Tolley , another coordinator with New Beginnings .

Most of the time , the lots are transition points . New Beginnings works with each person to try to find a more permanent housing solution .

`` It saddens me when they live in their vehicles , '' Tolley said . `` It is not the most ideal situation for senior citizens and families , but it is reality . ''

He added , `` We need to engage this problem . This is reality . ''

John Quigley , an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley , said the California housing crisis has left many middle-class families temporarily homeless or forced them to go to food banks to feed their families .

`` Part of the reason why it 's so painful in Santa Barbara is , there 's so little in the way of alternative housing , '' Quigley said . `` If there were alternative low and moderate housing and rental accommodations that were reasonably close by , you can imagine it would n't have this desperate look to it as people living in their cars . ''

At the only lot for women in Santa Barbara , it 's a tough existence . There are no showers or running water . On the night CNN visited , a half-dozen women were in the parking lot before nightfall .

Linn Labou , 54 , lives in her car with four cats . She used to be in the National Guard and is on a waiting list for government housing , but the wait is a year long .

`` I went looking for family , but I could n't get them to help me , '' she said .

As for Harvey , she begins each day by walking her two dogs before going to her part-time job . She leaves the dogs in her car with its windows cracked while she works .

It 's another chapter in her life that she 's certain she 'll get through . Her 19-year-old daughter moved in with friends to avoid being homeless . Her other children live overseas , and she did n't want to tell them about her living status .

Even if her children offered to help , she said , she would n't accept it . `` They know me well enough to know that I will get through this . ''

`` My daughter especially is very unhappy . Sometimes she 'll cry , and she 'll call and say , ` Mom , I just ca n't stand it that you are living in a car , ' '' Harvey said . `` I 'll say , ` You know what ? This is OK for right now , because I 'm safe , I 'm healthy , the dogs are doing OK , and I have a job , and things will get better . ' ''
