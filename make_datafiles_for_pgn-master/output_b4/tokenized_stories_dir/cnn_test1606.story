Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Dr. Roberto Feliz and Dr. Hiba Georges were quickly jolted from the most modern of medical care in Boston , Massachusetts , to the most rudimentary of care when they flew to Haiti last week to work at a hospital housed in two tents run by the University of Miami .

The doctors , who worked at the Boston Medical Center , quickly learned that when you have no technology -- not even the simplest blood test -- you have to make medical decisions in an entirely different way .

The first death they witnessed taught them a valuable lesson .

The patient was a boy who needed his leg amputated or else he would die of either an infection or rhabdomyolysis , a kidney disease that follows injuries where muscles are crushed .

Feliz , Georges and the other doctors had nowhere to take the boy . Their own hospital had yet to open its operating room , so they spent hours trying to find a hospital that could do surgeries . Their search was in vain .

Finally , the doctors decided to do the surgery themselves that night by the moonlight under a mango tree .

`` We just sawed his foot off . We did n't have to use anesthesia because he was already unconscious and was n't feeling a thing , '' Feliz says .

But they 'd waited too long . The boy took his last breath during the surgery .

`` Some of the doctors cried , '' Feliz says . `` I told them , ` There is no crying in medicine . ' ''

As a direct result of the boy 's death , a few hours later , at 3 in the morning , the surgeons at the University of Miami hospital decided to build their own operating room . They had no surgical lights , no oxygen , no blood , no ventilators and no monitors . For a tourniquet they used one of the doctor 's belts .

`` We 'd been waiting to build the operating room until we received better equipment , but after that boy 's death we became more aggressive . We said let 's do it , because they 're going to die anyway , '' Feliz says .

The doctors continued to learn lessons about what one had called `` civil war medicine '' after the operating room went up .

At one point , a 16-year-old boy needed an amputation , but the surgeons asked Feliz and Georges to make sure the boy 's kidneys were working before they put him through surgery . Without any blood tests to assess kidney function , the only thing they could look for was urine as a sign that his kidneys were working .

`` We tried to see if we could get some urine going , but there was not a drop . We filled him with fluids and gave him Lasix , a diuretic , to get him to pee , but nothing , '' Feliz says .

The boy died as the doctors were treating him .

`` I saw a lot of deaths there , but this one hit me the hardest , '' he says . `` I texted my wife back at home , ` I 've had a bad day . ' ''

After that boy 's death , surgeons were quicker to give permission to amputate , Feliz says .

Feliz says if there 's any silver lining to practicing such rudimentary medicine , it 's that it made him a more humble doctor .

`` Back in Boston , I 'm a hot shot . The nurses have to respect me , '' Feliz says . `` Here , I 'm just a worker bee . I cleaned the OR floor after surgery . I carried dead bodies down the street . I was in traffic carrying dead bodies . That makes you human . I came here a very fancy doctor , and I 'm leaving here as a humble man . ''
