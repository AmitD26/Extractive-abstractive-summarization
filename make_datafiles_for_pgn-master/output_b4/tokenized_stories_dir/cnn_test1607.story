-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After eight months in hibernation , ABC 's `` Lost '' returns to television tonight to finally explain , among other things , the dazzling white light that ended the 2009 season not with a whimper , but with a bang .

Was it a nuclear blast ? A quantum-leaping time shift ? A reboot to the story 's preflight origins ?

These are key questions as broadcast TV 's most ambitiously complex drama series presents the beginning of the end -- the first of 16 final-season episodes before ending its time-rearranging , sympathy-shifting narrative . But the most important question of all , six years after `` Lost '' was launched in 2004 , is this :

Who cares ?

That 's not a flippant question , because both TV and the audience have changed in the years since `` Lost '' pulled back from Jack 's eyeball to reveal , slowly and masterfully , the panicked insanity of a remote island plane crash .

Little more than a decade ago , `` Lost '' would have been riveting `` appointment television , '' but DVRs and DVD boxed sets have changed the rules of the game .

Instead of clearing calendars to watch in real time and line up for the water-cooler conversation the next morning , fans of such shows as `` Lost '' and Fox 's similarly serialized `` 24 '' might just as easily record and time-shift their viewing , avoiding office chats until they watched on their own schedules . Or , even more aggressively , they might actively avoid the broadcasts of their favorite show , just for the delayed gratification of watching the entire season later on DVD -- gobbling up episodes at their own pace , and without commercials .

It 's a very different TV world than in 1967 , when the long-awaited ending of ABC 's `` The Fugitive , '' with David Janssen 's Richard Kimble finally coming face-to-face with his wife 's one-armed killer , drew enough viewers to set a TV record for entertainment programming that beat even The Beatles on `` The Ed Sullivan Show '' three years earlier .

Or in 1983 , when the finale of CBS ' `` M * A * S * H , '' with its end to the Korean War , drew 77 percent of all TV viewers that night , and set a viewership record of 121.6 million that still stands . And , given the fragmentation of TV audiences , most likely will never be equaled .

`` Lost , '' at its viewer zenith in season two , boasted an average of nearly 19 million viewers . By last season , that number was below 12 million . And the season finale -- the episode that , in a reverse-polarity nod to the abrupt blackout ending to HBO 's `` The Sopranos , '' concluded with an unsettling fade to white -- attracted about 10 million viewers .

In the interim , the broadcast networks attempted to copy the `` Lost '' formula of season-long mysteries and unanswered questions , but all the attempts -LRB- `` Threshold '' from CBS , `` Invasion '' from ABC , etc. -RRB- came up short , and vanished without concluding . `` Lost , '' at least , is marching towards an actual ending -- and that alone makes it a TV event worth embracing .

iReporter : `` Lost '' lives up to expectations

After all , how many more opportunities like this will viewers get ? On cable TV , perhaps many . But on broadcast TV , how many shows are left that are even worth caring about -- much less anticipating their conclusion ?

It 's likely that many viewers who gave up on `` Lost '' in years past will return for this final lap , hoping to witness something special . And they will . The creators and show runners of this labyrinthine drama series have known for years what the final image will be -LRB- my guess , and my hope : an extreme closeup of Jack 's eye , ending the show just as it began -RRB- , and are crafting this final season with an eye -LRB- so to speak -RRB- to the show 's beginnings , as well as its endings .

Despite all the changes in technology and viewership , `` Lost '' is a series that rewards , if not demands , watching in real time . ABC did n't even provide critics with preview copies of the final-season premiere -- and even though I 'm therefore deprived , I 'm not complaining .

This is a show I want to watch as it airs , and discuss with friends afterward . I do n't take for granted how rare that is these days -- and neither should you .
