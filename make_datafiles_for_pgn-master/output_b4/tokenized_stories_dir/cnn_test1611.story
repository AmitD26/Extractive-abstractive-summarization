Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Ricot Duprevil tells it , rescuers saved him after he spent two weeks under earthquake rubble .

There 's no question that Duprevil was pulled out alive from the rubble of a Port-au-Prince building Tuesday . But confirmation of his two-week account might just remain buried among the ruins .

A doctor treating the 31-year-old man says he is inclined to believe Duprevil .

The hospital where Duprevil was taken was unable to conduct an initial blood test that might have helped prove or disprove his account .

And the U.S. soldiers who arrived and treated Duprevil after his rescue did not see which building area residents recovered him from -- a freshly collapsed one or one destroyed two weeks ago , when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti . The residents who rescued him could not be immediately located .

If the Haitian salesman did survive 14 days entombed in rubble , he would match a record set in 1990 by a man pulled free from the ruins of a hotel after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in the Philippines .

The Haitian government announced late last week that it was switching from rescue efforts to recovery operations , even as some survivors were found alive .

On Saturday , a 24-year-old man was freed by a French rescue team , 11 days after the quake .

That man , Wismond Jean-Pierre , had survived on soda found in the hotel shop where he was working at the time of the quake .

And a 5-year-old boy named Monley flashed an ear-to-ear smile last Wednesday when he was rescued after eight days spent under the ruins of his collapsed home .

Duprevil said he was selling soda when the quake hit and he ran inside a building in fear . The building then collapsed , he said .

His family reported him missing after the quake , and feverishly looked for him .

Meanwhile , Duprevil said , he survived by rationing water from a 2-gallon jug he found among debris . The water ran out Tuesday morning , he said .

U.S. military medics and doctors at the International Medical Surgical Response team field hospital said Duprevil was severely dehydrated after being rescued , but otherwise had strong blood pressure and pulse .

On Wednesday morning , he was in stable condition while being treated for a fracture to his right thigh bone .

`` Undoubtedly , this is very , very exciting , especially for all of us who have been deeply involved in this mission , '' said Dr. Henry Ford , who is treating Duprevil . `` To pull this one out ... is exhilarating . ''
