-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man suspected of fatally shooting two Tampa , Florida , police officers is a suspect in another homicide and is sought for questioning in two others , Police Chief Jane Castor said Thursday .

All the homicides have taken place since Dontae Morris was released from prison in April , Castor told reporters .

`` We just want to make the public aware of who we 're dealing with here in Dontae Morris , '' she said . '' ... he 's a cold-blooded killer . ''

Morris , 24 , is accused of shooting Officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis during an early-morning traffic stop Tuesday near downtown Tampa . The officers , both 31 , later died at a hospital .

Morris is also suspected in the killing of a man at an apartment complex , Castor said . That homicide occurred May 18 , according to the Tampa Tribune .

`` We are continuing to track down some very , very positive leads , '' the chief said , and police remain confident Morris will be apprehended .

She said she did n't believe the community was at risk , but said Morris could be moving about , and the situation could be `` unpredictable . ''

Meanwhile , Morris ' picture was featured on FBI billboards in Florida , Georgia and Alabama , authorities said Thursday .

Although it 's not the first time authorities have featured fugitives ' pictures on billboards , the posting of Morris ' photograph marked the first time authorities could post such images themselves , through a partnership with outdoor advertising companies , said Chris Allen , spokesman for the FBI 's Tampa bureau .

`` Beforehand , it would have taken the better part of a day or two '' to get the photos up by contacting the companies , he said . While the initiative was on standby for the Times Square bombing attempt , it was not used , he said .

The billboards went up in Florida shortly after the crime occurred Tuesday , he said . Authorities recently decided to feature the picture in Alabama and Georgia . Other states can be added , too , he said -- authorities simply create the alert on a computer and use a drop-down menu to select states .

Asked whether officials plan to use the billboards in other states , Allen said it depends on where the investigation leads authorities .

Morris ' picture and information was also put on the website of the television program `` America 's Most Wanted . ''

Meanwhile , Tampa police said Wednesday afternoon the reward for information leading to Morris ' arrest has increased to $ 100,000 -- the biggest in the city 's history .

`` The intensity will keep up until we capture him , '' said Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio . Anyone helping or harboring Morris is `` making a huge mistake , '' she said .

Asked about some citizen complaints about being inconvenienced by the ongoing search , Castor said , `` I am very sorry for anyone 's inconvenience . We do n't want to inconvenience anyone , but our ultimate goal is to keep the citizens of Tampa safe ... I believe that anger should be focused on Dontae Morris . He 's the one that 's causing all this . ''

Iorio said the evacuation of a building or the closure of a street is a `` small inconvenience '' given what authorities are trying to do .

Asked about officers ' anger toward Morris , Castor said police are `` reeling over the loss of two family members '' but are professionals who will take Morris into custody safely if at all possible . She reiterated , however , that the best course of action would be for Morris to give himself up .

Authorities have arrested several of Morris ' associates , she said . According to CNN affiliate Bay News 9 , police are also searching for Morris ' 21-year-old brother for questioning .

Public services for the fallen officers will be held Friday evening at a church in Lutz , Florida , Bay News 9 reported . Funeral services are planned for Saturday .

The officers were shot after Curtis pulled a vehicle over about 2:15 a.m. ET Tuesday , and the driver -- identified by police as Cortnee Brantly -- gave him identification and vehicle registration that did not match the vehicle , Castor said . Running a criminal history check , Curtis found that the passenger -- identified as Morris -- had an outstanding misdemeanor worthless-check warrant from Jacksonville , Florida .

Curtis called for backup , and Kocab responded , police have said . As the two attempted to arrest the suspect , he pulled out a gun and shot them both , Castor has said . A gun was not found at the scene , she said , and police believe Morris still has it .

Brantly was taken into custody Tuesday and authorities released her after seven hours of questioning , Castor said . Brantly provided police with information , she said , but `` I would not describe her as cooperative . '' Although police had enough information to arrest Brantly , their focus is on apprehending Morris , the chief said .

She defended the decision to release Brantly , saying `` there is still a very , very distinct possibility she will be charged down the road ... The community needs to trust in the ability of the TPD . ''

Kocab 's wife is due to give birth next week , police said at the time of the shootings . Curtis leaves a wife and four sons , ages 9 , 6 , 5 and 8 months .
