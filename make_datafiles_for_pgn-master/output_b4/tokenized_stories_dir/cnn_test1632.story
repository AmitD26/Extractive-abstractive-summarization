Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lawmakers have scheduled a hearing Thursday to look into the recall of popular pediatric medicines by drugmaker McNeil Consumer Healthcare , which has initiated four recalls of its products in the past seven months .

Among those testifying will be Colleen Goggins , the worldwide chairman of Johnson and Johnson , of which McNeil is a division .

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform also invited Johnson and Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon , but he declined to attend because of health reasons .

A panel of Food and Drug Administration officials will also be at the hearing .

The recalls include popular over-the-counter drugs such as Tylenol , Motrin and Benadryl .

Fifty children 's versions of these nonprescription medicines were also recalled on May 1 because of quality and safety concerns .

McNeil has maintained that its recall of the children 's drugs was not `` undertaken on the basis of adverse medical events '' but as a precautionary measure .

Adverse event reports are consumer complaints of a serious side effect associated with the use of a medical product , according to the FDA .

Adverse events could include death , hospitalization , disability and other health complications .

Following the pediatric medicine recall , Johnson and Johnson suspended production at McNeil 's facility in Fort Washington , Pennsylvania that manufactured the children 's drugs .

On Tuesday , the drugmaker outlined steps to remedy serious quality and safety lapses at the Fort Washington plant and its other manufacturing facilities .

`` McNeil is taking steps to bring its operation back to a level of quality that Johnson and Johnson demands of its companies , and that the public rightly expects of us , and that we expect of ourselves , '' the company said in a statement .

Among the measures , the drugmaker said it has hired an independent pharmaceutical consulting firm to identify corrective actions to improve quality and manufacturing systems at its Fort Washington facility .

McNeil did not say when it would resume production at the plant .

Regarding its products , McNeil said it will conduct in-depth quality assessments for each product that the company manufactures to `` ensure each product 's ability to meet specifications throughout its shelf life . ''

The company also said it will update the FDA about its progress implementing the plan at least once a month and would involve an independent firm in making product decisions during the first six months of operation .

McNeil 's other recalls in the past seven months were :

-- In November 2009 , five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ-open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea , stomach pain , vomiting and diarrhea .

-- In December , the recall was expanded to include all product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ-open cap .

-- In January 2010 , the recall was widened to an undisclosed number of Tylenol , Motrin and other over-the-counter drugs after complaints of consumers feeling sick from an odor .
