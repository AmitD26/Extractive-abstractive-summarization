New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The last thing 18-year-old Mohamed Kamara from Sierra Leone expected was to be honored by the New York Yankees , but there he was , tossing out the first pitch at a Yankees-Detroit Tigers game last week .

Kamara survived one of Africa 's most brutal civil wars , nearly losing his life in his homeland .

The Yankees celebrated Kamara 's survival and community spirit here , where he has lived since coming from Sierra Leone , with the team 's annual Project HOPE program . HOPE -LRB- Helping Others Persevere & Excel -RRB- recognizes people who have overcome their own personal challenges and who now inspire others by changing the community they live in .

`` Today is going to be your day , where you 're going to hang out with us on this Hope Week and we 're going to make this day about you , because you make every day about everybody else , '' said Brian Chashman , general manager of the Yankees , as Kamara was being honored .

Hanging out was an understatement , even by Yankee standards .

Kamara got the shock of life when he walked into a room at the New York Stock Exchange and was greeted by Yankee brass and players , including star lefthander C.C. Sabathia along with Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson . He toured the trading floor and was awarded an internship for next year by the stock exchange .

He did n't know it then , but his surprise itinerary would next include a chat with Mayor Michael Bloomberg , a visit to the United Nations to meet the ambassador from Sierre Leone and to stand on the rostrum of the General Assembly , plus that trip to Yankee Stadium to throw out the first pitch at the Yankee-Tigers contest Wednesday night .

Kamara earned his special honors .

He was forced to become the sole provider for his family at the age of 9 . With his mother suddenly ill and an absentee father , Kamara took care of his four younger siblings .

When a shaky ceasefire began in Sierre Leone , Mohamed came to the U.S. a few years ago to live with an aunt and uncle in the Bronx and to pursue his hope that he could create a better life for himself and his family .

He attended high school , starting without any English skills , and ended up graduating in the top quarter of his class .

A high school mentor helped him get a job as a golf caddy , and he commutes by train for almost five hours a day to and from New Jersey for that job . Seventy percent of what he earns is sent back to his family .

'' -LRB- I -RRB- get up every day at four o'clock in the morning to go to work . It was hard for me , but you know , I was determined to do it because I have a family to take care of and that was my main focus , '' Kamara said .

He went on to earn a partial scholarship to Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island , where he plans to major in business .

Kamara recognizes the problems created by Wall Street but is not deterred ; rather , he believes he has a role to play in its recovery .

`` You know , it takes someone to fix it up , so hopefully one day I will be that person , '' Kamara said .

Derek Jeter , captain of the Yankees , who met Kamara at the U.N. , described him as `` a remarkable young man . He 's come over to this country , goes to school , works to support his family , now he 's headed off to college . We could n't be more proud of him . ''

After his U.N. tour , Kamara said he hoped one day to return to Sierre Leone to help improve things there .

`` We 're inspired by the younger generations , moving like this , and trying to rebrandish the country of Sierra Leone , '' said Ambassador Shekou Touray . .

Kamara 's friends also are inspired by the selflessness of his actions -- so inspired , they compare him to a president they greatly respect .

`` One time he was standing for class president and people came out with , ` Mobama , Mobama ! ' We used to call him that , '' said Owusu Mensah , Kamara 's closest friend .
