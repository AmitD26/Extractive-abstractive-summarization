-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Australia captain Ricky Ponting insists it is `` absolutely possible '' that his side can regain the Ashes by thrashing England 5-0 .

Ponting 's side surrendered the famous urn to their bitter rivals last year when England won the Test series 2-1 on home soil .

But the last time England travelled to Australia as holders , in 2006 , they were beaten in all five Test matches .

And Ponting , 35 , now believes his new-look side -- who have won eight of their last ten Test matches -- are capable of a repeat performance when the series gets underway in November .

Asked if Australia could whitewash England Ponting told reporters : `` It 's absolutely possible . There 's no reason why not . We 've learnt from a lot of the mistakes that we 've made .

`` There 's no doubt we made some mistakes in the last Ashes series in England that cost us the series . But we know now that we 're a more experienced and probably a better team now than we were then . ''

Many of Australia 's so-called ` golden generation ' have retired in recent years including leg spin bowler Shane Warne , seam bowler Glenn McGrath and batsmen Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer , leaving Ponting to mould a younger side .

They have been in good form of late but were recently held to a 1-1 Test series draw by Pakistan when the two sides met in England . Yet England are already 2-0 up in their own four Test series with Pakistan , with two games played .

When the teams last met England won a seesaw series 2-1 , thanks to a dramatic victory at the Oval in the final Test when Jonathan Trott scored a century on his debut .

And Trott suggested Ponting may have put unnecessary pressure on his team by talking up their chances of a resounding victory .

Speaking ahead of the third Test with Pakistan , he told reporters : `` I do n't know Ponting that well -- I do n't know his character or what he would be meaning saying stuff like that .

`` But if I were to say something like that I 'd find it put pressure on me and the team more than if we just go about our business like I know we will . ''
