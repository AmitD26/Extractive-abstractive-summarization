MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexican officials said they have identified two suspects in this week 's slayings of two Americans in northern Mexico .

Mourners carry the coffin of Benjamin LeBaron , 32 , on Thursday in the Mexican state of Chihuahua .

A security camera at a toll booth near the municipality of Galeana captured images of the suspects , Chihuahua state Attorney General Patricia Gonzalez Rodriguez said Thursday , the state-run Notimex news agency reported .

Gonzalez declined to name the suspects , other than to say they belong to a crime organization known as `` La Linea '' -LRB- The Line -RRB- .

The toll booth cameras show four trucks or sport utility vehicles in which 12 suspects were riding , she said .

No arrests had been reported by Friday .

Benjamin LeBaron , 32 , and his brother-in-law , Luis Widmar , who was in his mid-30s , were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home Tuesday morning in Galeana .

Arturo Sandoval , a spokesman for the Chihuahua attorney general 's office , said earlier this week that a note was found on LeBaron 's body but he could not confirm the contents .

Local media reported the note indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town .

LeBaron 's younger brother , Eric , was kidnapped in May and returned unharmed a week later . The kidnapping prompted LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand .

`` There are no leaders here , or we are all leaders , '' LeBaron 's brother Julian LeBaron told CNN affiliate KINT-TV in El Paso , Texas , this week . `` If they kill my brother , another three will take his place . And if they kill us , another hundred will take their place . We are not giving up . No way . ''

The LeBaron brothers belonged to the `` Community of LeBaron '' in the municipality of Galeana , a township founded by ex-communicated Mormons .

CNN 's Mayra Cuevas-Nazario contributed to this report .
