-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This weekend 's Scottish football fixtures have been curtailed as overseas officials scheduled to cover for striking referees decided not to help out .

Poland 's football association withdrew its offer of 12 officials , while two refs from Portugal returned home on Friday after arriving in Glasgow , the UK Press Association reported .

Luxembourg 's Alain Hamer will referee two Scottish Premier League matches in two days as he takes charge of second-placed Celtic 's home clash with Inverness and defending champions Rangers ' trip to Dundee United .

The four remaining SPL games are expected to go ahead ahead despite the Portuguese officials Cosme Machado and Joao Ferreira having been scheduled for two of them .

Israel will provide officials for the other two , with Meir Levy to referee Hamilton Accies v St Mirren and Eli Hacmon taking charge of Kilmarnock-Aberdeen , also on Saturday .

Sunday 's Challenge Cup final between Ross County and Queen of the South is still expected to be played .

However , two of the three Scottish Cup replays are off due to the Polish turnaround and 10 lower league matches have been postponed .

Scotland 's category one officials decided earlier this week that they would stand down in protest against increasing levels of criticism from players , managers and the media .

PA reported on Thursday that the cost to bring in overseas officials would be around $ 50,000 compared to the $ 300,000 shortfall if the matches were not played .

SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said the strike was `` a sad day for Scottish football . ''

`` After further positive talks yesterday , and having received the backing of both the SPL and the SFL -LSB- Scottish Football League -RSB- , I felt that we had shown our commitment to the refereeing fraternity and that they had recognized that substantial progress had been made , '' he told the SFA website .

It is the first time that Scotland has employed officials from outside its borders .

The 44-year-old Hamer has a decade of experience in Europe 's top club competition , the Champions League , and has refereed Scotland matches at international level .
