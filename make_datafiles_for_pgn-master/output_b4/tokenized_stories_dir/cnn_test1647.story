The Congolese government and rebels agreed to allow the survey team into the gorilla section of Virunga National Park , which rebel fighters loyal to Laurent Nkunda have controlled since September 2007 .

Only about 200 mountain gorillas were estimated to be living in the park at last count , out of an estimated 700 in the world .

The team of rangers beginning a planned monthlong survey spotted a group of gorillas Tuesday known as the Humba family group . The Humba group had nine members at last count , said Pierre Peron of Virunga National Park , and experts are eager to see how many it now includes .

Hundreds of rangers had fled the fighting between Nkunda 's ethnic Tutsi rebels and the Congolese army and allied militias , leaving scientists with no reliable information about the endangered gorillas . Take a closer look at the animals ''

But more than 100 rangers have returned , park spokeswoman Samantha Newport told CNN last week .

At least nine mountain gorillas are known to have been killed last year , including an infant female .

Before the rebels took control of the park , 72 of the gorillas were accustomed to human contact . Another 130 or so were not , making it impossible to accurately count them .

The gorilla sector of the park lies in a strategically crucial area near the border of Uganda and Rwanda .

The U.N. Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization has designated Virunga National Park as a `` world heritage site . '' Africa 's oldest national park , it was formerly known as Albert National Park .
