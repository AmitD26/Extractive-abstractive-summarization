ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Christine King Farris was sewing an Easter dress for her daughter in their Atlanta home one rainy April evening when the nightly news was interrupted by a special report .

A lone survivor , Farris , 80 , is writing a memoir about life with her brother called `` Through It All . ''

The newscaster announced that Farris ' younger brother , the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , had been shot in Memphis , Tennessee . Another update came minutes later : King was in critical condition .

`` It was a horrible moment , '' Farris said of that night in 1968 . `` I tried to call my sister-in-law ; the lines were busy . I tried to call my parents ; the lines were busy . I could n't get anybody . ''

While boarding a plane for Memphis , Farris learned that her brother was dead . It was the beginning of a string of family tragedies . Her only surviving sibling , younger brother A.D. , drowned the next summer . Her mother , Alberta , was shot dead five years later while playing the `` Lord 's Prayer '' on an organ in church on Sunday morning .

Farris raises her hands in bewilderment when she contemplates the losses .

`` I think of the things that I 've faced in my life , and sometimes I question how I 'm still here , '' Farris , 80 , said in her office at Spelman College , surrounded by photographs of her famous brother and other civil rights leaders she once knew .

`` I 'm the lone survivor in my family , '' Farris said .

This year , the civil rights community will gather in Memphis on April 4 to mark the 40th anniversary of King 's assassination , but Farris will not join them . She is talking publicly about the death of her younger brother for the first time , but a return to Memphis is not part of her agenda .

`` I ca n't go , '' she said . `` I 've not been there since the time we went to gather my brother . My memory of Memphis is not a pleasant one . It 's one that I can not erase . '' Farris is remembering her brother in another way . She is writing a memoir about her life with him called `` Through It All . ''

A formal and reserved woman , Farris has spent the past year delving into her ugliest memories .

`` It 's been a real challenge , '' she said . `` I 've had to relive those moments . Sometimes it affects me more than others . I try to live with it . ''

She says it 's important for her to push past those painful memories , because she wants to humanize her younger brother . Everyone has heard about King , the civil rights icon . She wants to strip away those platitudes to reveal the playful brother she knew . `` He was normal as a person could be , '' she said . `` I really want people to understand that . I want people not to think of him as some mythic character from out of space . ''

The mythic nature of King 's ministry , though , is palpable in Farris ' roomy office at Spelman , the predominantly black women 's college where she has taught education for 49 years .

Farris stores photos of her brother on her desktop computer as screensavers . As each image shifts to another , her computer plays highlights of her brother 's most famous public speeches .

Isaac N. Farris Jr. , her only son , says his mother still plays recordings of her brother 's speeches and reads his manuscripts at home .

They were n't just siblings . They were friends .

`` She was the first one to meet Mrs. Coretta -LSB- King 's wife , Coretta Scott King -RSB- . She lent him money for his engagement rings , '' he said . `` Over the years , she 's especially talked about missing the friendship they had . ''

The resemblance to her brother is obvious up close . She has the same square face and the same measured , Baptist preacher 's drawl . She says she 's accustomed to people staring at her when they encounter her in Ebenezer Baptist Church , the Atlanta church her brother once led that she still attends .

`` Sometimes people will point me out and say , ` That 's Dr. King 's sister , ' '' she said .

`` And , of course , I 'm immediately surrounded by people . Sometimes , it 's a little uncomfortable . I try to be as cordial as I can . ... People come up and ask , ` Are you Dr. King 's sister ? ' I ca n't say no . ''

Farris says she had no inkling that her brother would become such an iconic figure . She remembers the little brother who loved playing pool , doing the jitterbug dance and telling jokes . She also recalls his nickname as a young man : Tweed .

`` He had this tweed suit , and he loved it , '' she said , smiling . `` He would wear it so much so the boys nicknamed him Tweed . ''

Farris ' son says his mother still retains some of that playful side herself . He occasionally catches her dancing around the house to contemporary R&B music .

`` I 've seen her do the electric slide , '' he said . `` She gets a kick out of it . ''

When Farris ' brother was thrust to the forefront of the civil rights movement , both were aware of the danger to him . But they never talked about it .

`` When you are a part of it , you do n't really take the time to sit down and think , '' she said . `` It did n't really bother us too much . We were conscious that it could happen , but it did n't occupy front space , so to speak . ''

When April 4 , 1968 , did come , Farris says , others stepped in to help her shoulder her grief . Sen. Robert Kennedy dispatched a plane to Atlanta to take her and King 's widow to Memphis .

Her voice remains level as she talks about the plane ride . Then her eyes start to mist .

She says she never left the plane when it arrived . She watched her brother A.D. come on the plane with the Rev. Andrew Young and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy , two of King 's closest aides .

`` They were crying like babies , '' she said .

She says she has tried to remember when she last talked to her brother , but it 's frustrating .

`` I 've been trying to think about that . He had a meeting with his staff the Saturday before he went to Memphis , but I did n't get to talk to him . Then ... ''

Farris halts herself in mid-sentence . Then her voice trails off .

Her only son says his mom has been a `` rock '' for the family . He says he 's never seen her cry about the loss of his famous uncle . The only time he remembers seeing her cry is when her remaining brother , A.D. , drowned in 1969 .

`` My mother let out a yell that still to this day brings tears to my eyes , '' he said .

Farris has carved out her own life of distinction . She married and has two children with Isaac N. Farris Sr. , an entrepreneur . She 's written a children 's book on her brother titled `` My Brother Martin : A Sister Remembers Growing Up with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. '' She 's also dabbled in public speaking and served as an executive at the King Center , the Atlanta-based center devoted to the teaching of King 's nonviolent philosophy .

Only recently , though , Farris experienced another series of losses . Her brother 's widow , Coretta Scott King , died two years ago from cancer . And Yolanda King , her brother 's oldest child , died from an apparent heart condition last year .

Yet she and her son shrug off any suggestion that her family , like the Kennedy clan , is somehow marked for tragedy . `` God never puts on us what we ca n't bear , '' she said .

`` We never embraced that ; others have , '' added her son , who is CEO of the King Center . `` We have felt through it all , we 're still blessed . That 's the way we were taught . ''

Forty years after her brother 's untimely death , Farris will return to Memphis , but only through her memories .

As she sits in her office surrounded by those memories , she says it 's now more urgent than ever that she add her own chapter to his story .

She 's the only one left .

`` I thought about all that I 've been through and all these memories and sometimes it gets tough , '' she said . `` By being the lone survivor , if I do n't do this , a part of history will be left out . ''
