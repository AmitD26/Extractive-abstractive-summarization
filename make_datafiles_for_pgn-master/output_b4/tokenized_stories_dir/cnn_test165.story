-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- The `` Good Wife '' returns Sunday night -LRB- CBS , 9 p.m. ET -RRB- , and while we 're all eager to meet Kalinda 's estranged husband Nick -LRB- check out our scoop on him here , and find out who was behind the door in the clip below -RRB- , there 's more to look forward to in season 4 .

• The arrival of Nathan Lane . We 'll also meet his recurring character , the firm 's appointed trustee Clarke Hayden , in the season premiere . `` He becomes a foil to everyone , but primarily Diane and Will , '' co-creator Robert King says . `` We 've been studying a lot about law firm bankruptcies , and when you want to restructure to give yourself relief from your creditors , sometimes a bank or court will order in a trustee . A trustee is someone who represents the creditors ' interest , and he or she is brought in above the managers , or the partners in this case . He basically can veto any decisions of the partners . '' It 's an especially interesting time for Will , who 'll be practicing again now that his suspension is over . `` Because they are in this kind of bankruptcy limbo where they have to make a certain amount to pay off the creditors in a certain amount of time , it 's a very bad time to find a conscience . Just like we 're all struggling with that in this economy : How much do you let your ethics lead , and how much do you let your pragmatism lead ? Will 's gon na be struggling with that almost daily . '' And do n't forget about David Lee . `` David Lee 's someone who has new clout given this bankruptcy and the fact that family law is doing so well . Given the world of Lockhart Gardner and how much it 's struggling , David Lee is a commodity and will have a lot of confrontations with the Nathan Lane character . ''

• Seeing more Cary . `` We love Matt Czuchry . We felt we painted ourselves a little into a corner having him over at the State 's Attorney 's office . It really was good for cases when he was on the other side , and it was really good with the Peter relationship . We got to see what that developed into . But we feel so much better having him again in-house , '' King admits . `` You just want to see more of him . You want to see more contact with Alicia , with Kalinda . So we feel we have a mature Cary coming back to the Lockhart Gardner fold . The irony , of course , is the moment he comes back is when things are just miserable financially over there . So it 's both good and bad for him . Cary started as someone who was more pragmatic and then become more ethical over the last three years . We want to see how that plays out now in this new environment where it 's kind of dog eat dog . '' And how will things be between Cary and Kalinda ? `` There 's a difficulty there , because now Kalinda 's husband 's in town , and so , the Cary-Kalinda relationship is n't a straight line . It never has been , but it gets even more crooked , '' King says . `` And I think the other thing with Cary is we want to see a little bit more of people 's home lives this year . It 's hard for the show to go too far in that direction , because it ca n't take you too far from other plot lines . ''

• Eli 's focused again on Peter . `` We felt we made a mistake with Eli last year . Sorry to admit it now , '' King says , with a laugh . `` But the thing is , Eli seems to have more fun when he has one overwhelming goal for the year , as opposed to little goals . And the goal for the year is to get Peter elected governor . And Eli has never played in the big leagues like this before . And to see an Eli , who is unhinged , try to get Peter elected is just going to be very fun I think both for Alan Cumming and the audience , who will see him dealing with a lot that we see now nationally with Romney and Obama -- the mix of serious issues but also being tainted by frivolous issues . How do you separate the two and should you ? How do you keep what 's frivolous in the public 's eye so they do n't start questioning about Peter 's past with a prostitute or Peter 's time in prison ? It 's not just a defensive game , it 's an offensive game , and Eli becomes a master at that game . ''

• Jackie and Eli ! `` You 're gon na see Jackie first in episode 4 , and she 's gon na have a stronger presence this year , partly because Jackie is someone who will use anything to get what she wants , and now she 's using her potential illness as another weapon in her arsenal . The other thing is for the campaign , it 's very important when you 're going state-wide in Illinois that you get the senior vote . And Jackie can pull in seniors who would otherwise be reluctant to vote for someone who slept with prostitutes , '' King says . `` So obviously , what we love about that is her fights with Eli . So Alan Cumming and Mary Beth Peil are for us a couple from comedy heaven . We want to see more of those struggles as they go through the campaign this year . ''

• A different kind of Peter . `` The third season was a Peter who wanted to do things differently . This year is a Peter who really wants to win , and how do you keep your ethics when you really want to win ? Do you just let other people around you do the dirty work for you , or do you engage on that ? '' King says . `` Some of the issues from the year before will come back for him , supposed racism in his department and other issues . So what we want to see a Peter who has to deal with these things sometimes by ignoring them and letting Eli just handle them . ''

• How Peter 's campaign affects Alicia . `` There 's a more engaged Alicia this year because she really wants her husband to win , too . Not for any power move on her part , but because she 's afraid of what the opposition will bring , '' King says . But there are issues . Let 's start with the kids : `` Zach 's 17 , Grace is 15 . Zach really wants to be involved with the campaign . Alicia does n't want it . But at a certain point , the kids reach the age where they 're not off-limits anymore . How do you keep them from being involved with the campaign when they 're kind of being dragged into the campaign by the press ? '' King says . `` And what we like about that is what it does for Alicia . Her natural instinct has always been to protect her kids , but then it becomes a question mark : is it really appropriate anymore to protect them as much as she wants to ? '' As the issue of race becomes part of the campaign , the fact that Zach is dating an African-American young woman could be useful . `` The difficulty obviously is where does Alicia draw the line when she knowingly is being used : Do you just start having a jaundiced eye toward the fact , or do you really draw the line and say , ` I will not allow our family to be used this way ? ' And that 's a struggle within Alicia because she 's not a kid anymore and she 's not naive about how the world works . ''

There 's also Alicia 's friendship with Maura Tierney 's recurring character , wealthy businesswoman Maddie Hayward , who makes her first appearance in the second episode . Eli will want Maddie to endorse Peter . `` The difficulty dramatically for characters on our show is where do you draw a line between the personal and the professional . And sometimes , more often than not , people do n't draw the line . Everything that 's professional is personal and everything that 's personal is professional . And for Alicia , that 's a very difficult balance . Sometimes she wants someone to be a friend and not there to be an agenda . ''
