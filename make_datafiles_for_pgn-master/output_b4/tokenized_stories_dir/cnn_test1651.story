Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The interpretation of complex legal verbiage is the Supreme Court 's bailiwick , but sometimes the outcome of a case falls upon the meaning of single word . The magic word in an appeal argued Wednesday was `` personal , '' and whether it extends beyond humans to `` artificial '' entities like corporations .

Telecom giant AT&T wants `` personal privacy '' protections applied to businesses , just as they have long been granted to individuals .

At issue is whether corporate `` personhood '' extends to the Freedom of Information Act , which exempts the public release of government documents that invade personal privacy . The company wants material gathered by a federal agency during a consumer investigation to be kept secret .

Several justices seemed deeply skeptical of the company 's claims for relief .

Citing `` dozens and dozens '' of examples in a study of government bureaucracy , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that `` overwhelmingly , ` personal ' is used to describe an individual , not an artificial being . ''

`` Can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the ` personal privacy ' of a corporation ? '' asked Justice Antonin Scalia . `` It 's a very strange phrase to me . ''

But others on the bench were not willing to say personal privacy applies only to a single human being .

The dispute began in 2004 when AT&T Inc. found out it may have overcharged the federal government for the E-Rate program , which provides affordable internet and telecom access for schools and libraries across the United States . The company voluntarily turned over documents to the Federal Communications Commission , the agency charged with investigating the matter .

Months later , a trade group that included some of AT&T 's competitors filed a Freedom of Information request for all correspondence related to the E-Rate probe . The material included AT&T memos , e-mails , invoices and employee names .

The company said the material was exempt from public release , since it was collected strictly for `` law enforcement purposes , '' according to court filings , and it argued that disclosure would cause an `` unwarranted invasion of personal privacy . ''

The FCC ultimately rejected the claims , saying the personal privacy exemption applies only to individuals . A federal appeals court reversed , finding for the corporation , and prompting the government 's Supreme Court appeal .

Wednesday 's hourlong oral arguments featured several justices offering various examples of the extent to which `` personal '' privacy could ever be applied to the corporate theory .

`` For example , you could refer to personal jurisdiction over a corporation , could n't you ? '' Justice Samuel Alito asked the Justice Department 's lawyer , Anthony Yang .

`` I suppose families have rights of personal privacy , do n't they ? '' added Chief Justice Roberts , extending the term beyond individuals .

AT&T 's attorney , Geoffrey Klineberg , told the court the issue is one of fairness . `` All we are asking for and indeed all that Congress provided for is that the privacy interests be weighed against the public interest in disclosure . And what the FCC did here was to categorically exclude corporations from the protections '' under federal law .

Ginsburg was unconvinced . `` How does the commission , unaided by AT&T , go through the papers and decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee , as distinguished from the corporation ? ''

Klineberg said e-mails could be exposed to public view showing corporate officers who `` may engage in a frank exchange about the competence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of the corporation . Or disparaging comments '' about a business competitor , something that should be protected under privacy laws .

`` Why does that relate to the corporation 's privacy interest ? '' replied Scalia . `` Anything that would embarrass the corporation is a privacy interest ? ''

The AT&T lawyer ran into further trouble when he tried to mince words -- suggesting that because `` person '' is defined to include a corporation in the relevant federal statute , the term `` personal '' also must apply .

`` I tried to sit down and come up with other examples where the adjective was very different from the root noun , '' said John Roberts . `` It turns out it is not hard at all . You have craft and crafty . Totally different . Crafty does n't have much to do with craft . Squirrel , squirrely . Right ? I mean , you have a pastor and pastoral . Same root , totally different . So I do n't think there 's much to the argument that because ` person ' means one thing , ` personal ' has to be the same relation . ''

Beyond interpreting the meaning of personal privacy , the court may also have to wrestle with defining or redefining `` corporate , '' either as an association of citizens with extended , shared rights , or as a state-chartered entity with its own separate , competing rights apart from those of its members .

Such interpretation was key to the high court 's controversial campaign finance ruling a year ago , in which the conservative majority gave corporations greater power to spend freely in federal elections , overturning a federal law that had imposed strict limits .

The court said corporations had to be treated as `` persons '' when it came to campaign spending , with the same power as individual donors . Now the dispute is whether corporations enjoy similar protections in the privacy context .

Liberal groups have complained that the Roberts court has been overly friendly to businesses in recent rulings , at the expense of individual consumers . They want a blanket rule exempting corporations from personal privacy protections .

`` Congress did not and could not imbue corporations with the dignity interests that FOIA protects when it shields living , breathing human beings from invasions of personal privacy , '' said Elizabeth Wydra , chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center . `` A corporate charter can not blush or feel embarrassed by FOIA 's policy of transparency , ''

A number of media organizations have also filed briefs in support of the Obama administration , saying the Freedom of Information Act has been a powerful tool to hold governments and corporations accountable .

Coalitions of business groups , including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable , are backing AT&T .

Justice Elena Kagan is not participating in the case because she had handled the appeal as the administration 's solicitor general before being nominated to the high court last year .

The case is FCC v. AT&T Inc. -LRB- 09-1279 -RRB- . A ruling is expected in the next five months or so .
