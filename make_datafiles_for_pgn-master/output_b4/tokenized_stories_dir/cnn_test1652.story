Abidjan , Ivory Coast -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Violence in Ivory Coast was ongoing amid a tense political standoff Wednesday , after at least five police officers were killed and three U.N. peacekeepers were wounded in an Abidjan neighborhood , and three other police officers were killed in clashes with protesters , officials said .

The five police officers were killed Tuesday night by heavily armed gunmen in what authorities said was a targeted attack in the densely populated Abobo area of the city , a police source said Wednesday .

The three U.N. peacekeepers sustained minor injuries overnight when they `` came under crossfire from both sides of the road '' while returning from a patrol , the U.N. operation in Ivory Coast said in a statement Wednesday . The U.N. forces -- a joint team of military and U.N. police -- were forced to return fire , the operation said .

Five other people were killed earlier Tuesday in clashes between police and supporters of the nation 's president-elect amid an ongoing political standoff in the West African nation , an official said .

The dead included three police officers and two demonstrators , the governor of Abidjan said Tuesday . The deaths came a day after the U.N. Security Council condemned the violence that has erupted since the country 's November 28 presidential runoff election and `` urged all parties to exercise restraint . ''

The incidents came a day after forces belonging to self-declared President Laurent Gbagbo blocked and looted a food convoy , the operation said , adding it `` reiterates its call for calm and urges all parties concerned to avoid recourse to violence . ''

Amnesty International issued a statement warning of a fresh outbreak of violence in the wake of the five officers ' deaths , which it said happened early Wednesday .

`` Some of the worst armed clashes so far broke out in the city of Abidjan today , '' the organization said . An unidentified witness told Amnesty International of having heard `` heavy exchanges of fire '' around midnight and seeing Wednesday morning `` three military vehicles burnt out '' and the body of a member of the security forces , the statement said .

State-run RTI reported the government has imposed a curfew on the Abobo and Ayaman neighborhoods of Abidjan , where the violence occurred . The curfew is in place from Wednesday until 6 a.m. Saturday , it said .

The cocoa-producing nation was plunged into crisis when Alassane Ouattara was declared the winner of the election , but the incumbent , Gbagbo , refused to leave office .

The Security Council expressed its support for efforts by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States in pursuing a peaceful resolution of the crisis .

At the same time , the council repeated its readiness to impose measures -- including sanctions -- against those who threaten the peace process by blocking the work of the U.N. mission and others or `` commit serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law . ''

Meanwhile , Ouattara is willing to add Gbagbo supporters to his Cabinet , provided the incumbent steps down , Ivory Coast 's ambassador to the United Nations said this week .

Ambassador Youssoufou Bamba said Ouattara would not enter a power-sharing government similar to that in Zimbabwe but that he would be open to a unity Cabinet .

U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq could not confirm any such offer from the Ouattara government and said that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon still calls for Gbagbo to step down in an orderly transition .

Ouattara told CNN last week that he welcomes a proposal for direct negotiations with Gbagbo -- on the condition that Gbagbo recognize Ouattara as president .

But in a telephone interview Tuesday , Gbagbo spokesman Ahoua Don Melo rejected the idea , saying Ouattara `` should first go to the Constitutional Council to get recognized as the president before making any proposal . ''

An independent election commission declared Ouattara the winner of the vote , but the country 's Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared Gbagbo the winner .

The U.S. Treasury froze Gbagbo 's assets in the United States last week and barred Americans from doing business with him . His wife and three top aides also were sanctioned .

Ouattara remains in the Golf Hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers .

The United Nations and an ever-increasing number of other nations have recognized Ouattara , a former prime minister , as the rightful election winner .

The United States and other countries have offered Gbagbo what they call a `` dignified exit , '' which could mean living and working in other countries , including the United States .

Gbagbo , however , has ignored those offers and has refused to accept telephone calls from U.S. officials .

Ouattara has said he will ensure protection for Gbagbo if he concedes , said Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga , the African Union envoy for a multinational mediation effort .

U.N. Security Council members have also `` strongly condemned and demanded an immediate halt '' to media efforts to `` propagate false information to incite hatred and violence , '' and condemned the ongoing blockade around the Golf Hotel .

Meanwhile , the United Nations ' refugee agency is building a refugee camp for Ivorians fleeing to neighboring Liberia . The camp will initially be capable of housing some 18,000 refugees , it said .

At present , there are about 25,000 Ivorian refugees in Liberia , with about 600 more arriving daily , it said .

The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it has sufficient relief supplies for about 30,000 people in Liberia and `` is ready to mobilize stocks from Ghana for an additional 30,000 people if the need arises . ''
