Hollywood , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Larry King , America 's interviewer-in-chief , ended his record-setting career as CNN 's prime-time , talk-show host Thursday night with a serenade from Tony Bennett , a greeting from President Obama and a `` Larry King Day '' proclamation from California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .

Those guests and others capped his 25-year run behind the microphone with CNN .

`` Welcome to the last ` Larry King Live . ' It 's hard to say that , '' King said in his opening remarks to his last show .

He was joined on the set by comedian Bill Maher and television host Ryan Seacrest .

On several occasions , King stifled tears , especially when Maher put King in the same company as TV legends Johnny Carson , Steve Allen and Walter Cronkite .

`` This is not Larry 's funeral , '' Maher interjected early in the show . `` Larry is hopefully going to be in our living rooms for years to come . This is the end of a show , not the end of a man . ''

King wore his signature suspenders -- a pair of red ones with a red-and-white polka-dot tie over a black shirt .

At end of his hourlong broadcast , King became choked up with his final sentences .

`` It 's not very often in my life that I 've been without words , '' King said . He thanked his staff and producers .

`` When I started 25 years ago in a little studio in Washington , D.C. , I never thought it would last this long or come to this , '' King said . `` I 'm going to do specials on CNN and do radio work ... so you 're not going to see me go away , but you 're not going to see me on this set any more .

`` I do n't know what to say , except to you my audience , thank you . And instead of goodbye , how about so long ? '' King concluded .

His set then went black -- except for a spotlight illuminating his chrome microphone .

In his overall 53 years in broadcasting , King amassed 50,000 interviews , 6,120 shows in CNN 's archives , 10 Cable ACE Awards , an Emmy , a Peabody and an entry in the Guinness World Records for having the longest-running show with the same host in the same time slot .

Among the guests on the last show was Schwarzenegger , who appeared by a satellite transmission from the capital of Sacramento . The governor extended congratulations and displayed the written proclamation declaring Thursday as belonging to King .

`` Thank you , '' King said , adding this quip : `` and keep this in mind : I 'll be back . ''

King will be working on special projects for CNN .

In a pre-recorded videotaped message , President Obama called King `` one of the giants in broadcasting . ''

`` You say all that you do is ask questions , but for generations of Americans , the answers to those questions have surprised us and they have informed us , '' Obama said .

From a studio in New York , talk show host Regis Philbin tried to engage King in a song , but King was caught off guard .

`` I lost the $ 500 question , '' King joked .

Joining Philbin in New York was Donald Trump .

`` You should n't be leaving anything , Larry , '' Trump said . `` Nobody ever did it better . ''

Also in New York was comic Fred Armisen , who dressed up exactly like King and then started interviewing him .

`` Now Larry , '' Armisen said , `` what has been my favorite interview ? ''

King : `` You know you 've done so many , it 's hard to pick one out . ''

Armisen : `` Larry , what is the most interesting thing about me . ''

King : `` The most interesting about you is you 're a little whacko . ''

Armisen : `` What question have you asked more than any ? ''

King : `` Why . You see the best question of all , Lar , is why . Because it ca n't be answered in one word and it forces the person to think . ''

Armisen : `` Besides holding up my pants , why do I wear suspenders ? ''

King : `` I will not stop wearing them . No matter what I do in life , the suspenders will remain . ''

News anchors Katie Couric , Diane Sawyer , and Brian Williams joined talk show host Barbara Walters in extending farewells . They were also telecasted from a set in New York .

`` We are your protégés , your groupies , '' Sawyer said , giving King a pair of suspenders embroidered with the four guests ' and King 's names .

`` All of us have done heads of state '' interviews , Walters said . `` No one has done more than you . ''

After King moved the conversation to Williams , Williams remarked : `` You 've just done what scores of network executives have been unable to do . You just snatched airtime from Barbara Walters . ''

Couric read from a poem she wrote for King , in which one verse went :

`` You made NAFTA exciting and that 's hard to do .

`` And you scored the Paris Hilton post-jail interview , '' Couric recited .

Former president Bill Clinton , who just returned from a visit to Haiti and was in Little Rock , Arkansas , said he admired King 's work ethic . Clinton had appeared 28 times on King 's show .

`` I 'm like you , '' Clinton said in a live feed from Arkansas . `` I have to keep working . I do n't know if it keeps me young , but it keeps me out of the grave . ''

Seacrest read from a letter written to King from the Rev. Billy Graham , who wrote : `` You will be greatly missed in my evening routine . ''

Talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw joined the Hollywood set toward the end of the show and asked King how he felt .

King turned the question on McGraw : `` How am I doing ? ''

`` With grace , '' McGraw said .

`` You never like to be the center of attention , '' McGraw later said . `` You ask short questions . '' Turning to Seacrest and Maher , he added : `` He told me years ago , if it 's more than 2 sentences , it 's too long . ''

King was then joined by his wife , Shawn , and two sons , Chance , 11 , and Cannon , 10 , to hear Tony Bennett sing `` Best is Yet to Come '' from Lake Charles , Louisiana .

`` How about them apples , '' King said afterwards .

`` Thanks for all the great interviews you 've given us , Larry , '' Bennett said .

Chance said he looked forward to seeing more of his father .

Cannon then stole the show momentarily with an uncanny impersonation of his father , as if he were talking to him and then his mother :

`` Get in the car . I 'm too old for this . I 've done this for 50 years , '' Cannon said , with an entertaining imitation of King 's gravelly voice . `` Stop doing your makeup . This is the last show . We 're going to be late . ''

When King ended his last show and the airtime moved on to Anderson Cooper for his show , the anchor summarized : `` a remarkable moment and a remarkable man . ''
