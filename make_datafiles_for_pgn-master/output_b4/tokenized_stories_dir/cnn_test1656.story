CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Bringing you 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines from across the U.S. and around the world . I 'm Carl Azuz . CNN Student News starts right now !

First Up : Coal Mine

AZUZ : `` The rescue teams are prepared . They 're charged up and ready to go . '' That is what the governor of West Virginia said yesterday as efforts got going to reach miners trapped by an explosion . The plan was to drill multiple holes down into the mine to help clear out dangerous gases . But later in the day , an official said that samples taken from inside the mine showed that those gas levels were still too dangerous to allow rescuers to go inside . 31 people were working in the Upper Big Branch South Mine when Monday 's blast happened . At least 25 were killed ; two were hospitalized ; the other four may still be trapped . This is , of course , a developing story . To get the latest details on it , head over to CNN.com .

Hurricane Prediction

AZUZ : Well , the predictions are in for this year 's Atlantic hurricane season , and the forecast : above average . The season starts on June 1st , lasts through the end of November . Here 's a look at the prediction for this year versus an average year . Storms are assigned a name when they reach a certain intensity . Experts are forecasting that we 'll have 15 named storms . A typical season has 11 . Of those 15 , the prediction is that 8 will turn into hurricanes , and four of those will become major hurricanes . An average year has six hurricanes , including two major storms . Now , the people who make these predictions point out they are just preliminary . Another one is scheduled to come out on June 2nd .

Budget Crisis

AZUZ : Over on the west coast of the country , the city of Los Angeles is facing a major budget problem . In fact , one official called it the most urgent financial crisis in the city 's recent history . L.A. 's mayor , Antonio Villaraigosa , has an idea to help .

ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA , LOS ANGELES MAYOR : I 'm asking the CAO to develop a plan to shut down all general-funded city services , with the exception of public safety and revenue-generating positions , for two days per week beginning the week of April 12th .

AZUZ : That means this plan could go into effect on Monday . The mayor said there are no simple ways to solve the budget crisis . But he added , `` we can no longer wait . We must act now . '' As you might guess , some people are opposed to the mayor 's plan , including a company that represents thousands of city employees . It says the plan would threaten services and people 's lives . In its current financial situation , Los Angeles is facing a possible $ 10 million deficit by the start of May .

I.D. Me

MATT CHERRY , CNN STUDENT NEWS : See if you can I.D. Me ! I 'm a country that 's located in Central Asia . I was part of the former Soviet Union , but I gained my independence in 1991 . My capital city is Bishkek , and most of my people speak Kyrgyz . I 'm Kyrgyzstan , and I 'm home to nearly 5.5 million people .

Kyrgyzstan Protests

AZUZ : Some of you might not have heard of Kyrgyzstan . The country is an ally of the United States . In fact , the U.S. has a military base there that 's an important part of getting supplies to Afghanistan . That 's part of the reason why the U.S. is paying attention to what 's going on in Kyrgyzstan right now : protests against the government . They 're taking place all across the central Asian country , and some of them have turned violent . You can see one in this video that was posted on YouTube . The government has declared a state of emergency . According to reports , fighting between demonstrators and police in the capital city of Bishkek caused at least 40 deaths . Around 400 other people were injured .

Kyrgyzstan has experienced a lot of political tension for years . Some of these protesters are pushing for anti-government leaders to be let out of jail . A few have been released and were reportedly going to meet with government officials . Other nations and groups , including the U.S , United Nations and Russia , are urging both sides to settle the situation peacefully .

Thailand Protests

AZUZ : A somewhat similar situation is happening southeast of there in Thailand , where protesters are speaking out against that country 's government . These demonstrations have been going on for weeks . The country 's prime minister declared a state of emergency there yesterday , sent a helicopter to pick up some officials after protesters broke into Thailand 's parliament building . They stayed there for a few hours and then regrouped at their usual meeting spots . The demonstrators -- they 're called `` Red Shirts '' -- they 're supporters of Thailand 's former prime minister . He was removed from office in 2006 and left the country in 2008 while he was facing corruption charges . The Red Shirts want him back , and they want the current prime minister to call for elections . The country 's leader says these protests are a violation of Thailand 's constitution .

Sentenced

AZUZ : North Korea has sentenced an American citizen to eight years of hard labor for entering North Korea illegally . Back in January , Aijalon Mahli Gomes crossed over the border from China to North Korea . That 's why he was arrested . Crossing the border without permission is against the law there . The United States does n't have any official relations with North Korea , but some people are asking the U.S. government to try to get Gomes released .

Brazil Flooding

AZUZ : Moving over to South America now , where firefighters in Brazil are trying to rescue victims of this : mudslides and severe flooding caused by heavy rains . Almost a foot of rain fell on Rio de Janeiro in one day . Nearly 300 people had been rescued by Tuesday , but officials said the severe weather had killed more than 100 others , and there are some people who are still trapped .

AZUZ : The city of New York is on a mission to plant a million trees over the next decade , and some folks your age are helping out . It 's not training them for a career in dendrology . But as Richard Roth explains , the potential benefits of taking part in the program could help these teens branch out in the future .

ADRIAN BENEPE , NYC PARKS COMMISSIONER : It 's an effort to take kids known as disconnected youth , connect them with employment possibilities , connect them with the environment . So in essence , it 's a combination environmental program and jobs program .

ROTH : More than thirty young adults participate , learning urban forestry and nature restoration . New York City branching out with with non-profit groups and agencies for funding and instructors .

MARK CHISHOLM , TREE PROFESSIONAL : My rule of thumb is four times whatever this diameter is , is what you want .

ROTH : Fabian is learning the ropes from a world champion climber and tree professional .

CHISHOLM : When you start dealing with the trees , you got ta know species of trees , how to identify hazards in a tree , determine whether it 's safe to climb at all or work in , what the tree may need . There 's just so many different avenues that they have to become proficient at , that I find that most people really enjoy the fact that they never get bored with it .

ROTH : And while tree climbing is physically demanding , it 's the mental and emotional challenges that initially need to be overcome .

BESHION BAILEY , MILLION TREES TRAINEE : I was scared , I was scared . I told them I could n't do it . That 's the one thing they kept on saying : `` Stop saying you couldnt , stop saying you could n't , you can . '' And that 's what they did , is take me out of my comfort zone . And look at me now , going up , how much , eighty , ninety feet .

ROTH : They have to stay alert on the streets of New York , and especially ninety feet up .

FABIAN VASQUEZ , MILLION TREES TRAINEE : Limb walking , especially right now with this weather , it 's kind of windy and stuff , you be limb walking on a limb and it would be shaking and stuff . It is really easy to fall , so you have to be careful where you put your foot at . Any slip , you could just fall so , you always have to be concentrating on what you are doing . You ca n't be thinking about the stuff outside work . To do this , you always got to keep your mind on this . Everything else is just going to mess you up .

ROTH : But does a city known for its asphalt jungle need to train its citizens for green jobs ?

BRIAN AUCOIN , NEW YORK PARKS DEPARTMENT : Our city parks department manages nearly 30,000 acres of parkland . 12,000 of those acres are undeveloped and naturalized . And with our Million Trees initiative , you know , planting a million trees we need a skilled workforce .

ROTH : Climbing trees , a first step to rising to the top in a green career . Richard Roth , CNN , New York .
