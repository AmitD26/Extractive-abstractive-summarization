-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As ballots were being counted in Somaliland , a breakaway republic in northwest Somalia , officials said Sunday an observer from the electoral commission was killed .

The former British colony held a presidential election Saturday . Voters lined up at polling stations under tight security ; more than 1 million had registered to cast their ballots , according to Ise Yusuf Mohamed , chairman of the electoral commission .

Mohamed said the polling was peaceful , but acknowledged small outbreaks of violence , including the killing of the observer Saturday near the town of Lasa Anod . The observer 's identity and further details were not given .

Mohamed warned the Somaliland people and the three political parties involved in the election not to celebrate results before they are officially declared .

Security measures during the voting included a 12-hour ban on vehicles not carrying special permits , Mohamed said Saturday .

Voters cast ballots under threats of violence from al-Shabaab , the primary Islamist group leading an insurgency in and around the capital city of Mogadishu in southern Somalia . In an audio message to local media , the group 's leader , Sheik Mukhtar Abdirahman Abu Zubeyr -- himself a descendant of Somaliland -- called democracy `` the devil 's principles '' and warned people in Somaliland not to adopt it .

Al-Shabaab militants attacked Somaliland and the neighboring semi-autonomous region of Puntland with simultaneous suicide blasts in October 2008 that killed at least 24 people .

In the election , current President Dahir Riyale Kahin of the ruling party UDUD is opposed by two other candidates .

The northwestern region of Somaliland achieved independence from Britain on June 26 , 1960 , followed by the rest of Somalia , which became independent of Italy five days later on July 1 , 1960 , and joined Somaliland to form the state

of Somalia .

After the fall of Somali dictator Siad Barre in 1991 , Somaliland declared its separation from Somalia , according to the CIA World Factbook . Somaliland has yet to receive international diplomatic recognition as a state but has achieved a level of security and stability unmatched in the rest of Somalia .

Southern Somalia has not seen a stable government since the fall of the dictatorship and has been mired in civil war since its fall . The ongoing conflict has resulted in `` an unprecedented humanitarian crisis , '' according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees .

`` In May -LRB- 2010 -RRB- , the fighting intensified in Mogadishu and displaced more than 270,000 people , causing the number of internally displaced persons to reach 1.5 million people , '' according to a report on the UNHCR website .
