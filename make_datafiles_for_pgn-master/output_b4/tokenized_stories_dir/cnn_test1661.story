-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Riccardo Ricco has been suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team amid claims that the Italian gave himself a blood transfusion .

Ricco -- who only returned to the sport last March after being handed a 20-month ban for doping during the 2008 Tour de France -- was admitted to a hospital in Modena on Sunday .

His father told reporters at the time that Ricco had been suffering from a high fever and suspected kidney failure .

But Italian media claimed the 27-year-old had admitted to doctors that he had made himself ill by injecting contaminated blood .

And now his team have issued an official statement , saying they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend the rider with immediate effect .

The statement said : `` Internal research results following the illness and rumors regarding Ricco have given the team sufficient reason to suspend the Italian with immediate effect . ''

It continued : `` Last Tuesday , the team started an urgent investigation following the hospitalisation of Riccardo Ricco . Three days later the results of this study brought the team to the conclusion that an immediate suspension of Ricco was required .

`` The violation of internal regulations of the team and other indications justify this measure . The team can not prejudge but emphasises that a zero-tolerance policy towards doping is practised . ''

Blood doping -- an action that increases the amount of red blood cells available to carry oxygen to the muscles -- has been a problem in cycling for a number of years , with disgraced 2006 Tour de France winner Floyd Landis admitting last year that he blood-doped during his career .

Blood cells are not damaged by freezing , consequently a `` blood doper '' can remove blood from their body , safely store it , and re-inject it when increased aerobic capacity and stamina is needed .

However , if the blood is stored incorrectly , it can become infected , resulting in severe illness if transfused .

The practice of blood doping is banned by all official sporting governing bodies and Ricco now faces expulsion from competitive cycling if found guilty , as well as a possible jail sentence in a country where all forms of doping are classed as illegal .

Ricco has yet to react to the claims surrounding his hospital stay .
