-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Japan 's national sport of sumo wrestling was rocked by a match-fixing scandal on Thursday after it was revealed three wrestlers had admitted to rigging bouts .

`` Three sumo wrestlers have admitted to match-fixing , '' Yoshiaki Takaki , the country 's minister for education and sport , announced to a parliamentary panel .

`` Sumo is our national sport . If match-fixing has occurred , it is a very serious betrayal of the people , '' Naoto Kan , the country 's Prime Minister , added .

Japan 's Kyodo news service claimed that Tokyo Police had found suspicious messages on a number of wrestlers ' phones that suggested the outcome of several fights had been planned .

The messages exchanged between wrestlers discuss how fights would be arranged and also the amount of money that would change hands .

`` I 'll hit my opponent head on , '' was one message reported in British newspaper The Guardian .

`` For 20 more I will concede . After the meet , I need to make at least 50 or I 'll be in serious trouble , '' read a further text which discussed the financial rewards for one wrestler .

`` You fall when I move to tackle , '' read another message reported by Japanese news wire Jiji Press .

Japan Sumo Association chairman Hanaregoma told a news conference that 13 people who had been mentioned in the messages would be investigated .

`` It 's a betrayal of sumo fans . If this is true . It would be something that rocks -LRB- sumo -RRB- to its foundations . We will investigate thoroughly , '' Hanaregoma said .

It is the latest controversy to hit sumo after a gambling scandal emerged in July last year when 34-year-old wrestler Ozeki Kotomitsuki is said to have illegally bet on baseball games .
