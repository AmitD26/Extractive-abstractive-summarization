-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Will you marry me ?

That question carries an extreme amount of significance for those who are popping the question and for those who must answer .

While weddings have long been planned to a T and photographed and videotaped , marriage proposals are rapidly becoming public events with some videotaped for the enjoyment of family , friends and millions of strangers .

Posted on sites such as YouTube and Vimeo , the videotaped proposals can go viral overnight with millions of viewers . That 's what happened to one video of an elaborately orchestrated proposal in a movie theater .

`` We had no idea it 'd be such a viral success , but there were particular elements that made it so successful , '' says Michael Escobar , the videographer who recorded both Matt asking his fiancee 's father for her hand and Matt 's epic route to get to the theater where Ginny was with her brother .

Famously dubbed the movie trailer proposal for Matt and Ginny , Escobar 's production got more than 10 million views in less than two weeks .

What is it about proposal videos that draw so many viewers from around the world ?

`` These videos reflect our need to ` connect ' with one another , '' says Steven Sherwood , a sociology professor at Los Angeles Valley College . `` They are therefore just the most contemporary version of the smoke signal of communicating what 's important to us .

Escobar says proposal videos `` give hope for a lot of people , '' and that `` when you see something genuine and heartwarming you gravitate towards it . ''

For Christina Nelson , 42 , a Kenyan immigrant who 's been married for six years , the emotional aspect of these videos are what touch her .

`` I know what they 're feeling and wow . I just love how they feel , '' Nelson says , adding that her girlfriends often pass links to such videos along to her .

Nelson explains , `` Women are emotional beings -- so are men -- but we have another degree of emotion and we love the fact that it 's being exposed . ''

It 's the same factor that made songs by Elvis , and now Justin Bieber , wildly popular in today 's culture : women who want to be warmed by romance -- theirs or someone else 's .

Ashli Reese , a young bachelorette living in Atlanta , sums up her reaction to watching proposal videos : `` I want that one day . I want that to be me . I want to feel the way they feel . ''

For men , these public emotional displays online can elicit a different reaction .

`` I 'll watch for the entertainment , '' says 24-year-old Tracy McClades . And even though he says he has n't found `` the one '' yet , he admits he can `` get ideas from them '' and be prepared when he is ready to propose to his future wife .

Atlanta resident George Nelson proposed six years ago in the middle of a busy restaurant while his friends documented the moment . He offers another reason why people videos of these used-to-be private moments .

`` When there 's a new trend , we want to be a part of the trend -- both male and female , '' says Nelson .

John Schlueter , who proposed last year while running with the Olympic Torch , says public proposals and videos represent `` competition for men , '' while being , `` heartwarming for women . ''

Although he did n't have a video made of his proposal , he and his wife are reminded of their emotional moment every time they see the Olympic torch that he carried during the proposal hanging in the middle of their living room .

Escobar does n't see the proposal competition as a bad thing .

`` If it does have people step up their game , if it sparks a person to go the extra mile for the person they love , that 's a good thing . ''
