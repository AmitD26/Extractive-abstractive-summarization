-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 7-year old Michigan boy took a 20-mile drive in his stepfather 's car , ending in a high-speed chase with local law enforcement , according to the Huron County Sheriff 's office .

Around 10 a.m. Monday , 911 dispatchers received multiple calls reporting what appeared to be a young child driving a red Pontiac across town .

`` Uh , yes , I 'm on Kinde Road outside of Caseville , and believe it or not , I just passed about a 5 - , 6-year-old kid flying down the road with a red Pontiac Sunbird , '' one caller told the dispatcher as he tried to follow the speeding car . Eventually , the caller lost sight of the boy .

According to Huron County Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson , the car was seen again minutes later in Caseville by another man who called 911 . It was racing past a Dairy Queen restaurant .

Based on details provided by 911 dispatchers , Huron County Sheriff 's Deputy Randy Britt and Caseville Police Chief Jamie Learman began searching for the car .

Hanson said Britt and Learman caught up to the young driver and attempted to stop the car , which officials said was driven as fast as 50 mph . The boy appeared to have difficulty pulling over and footage from Britt 's dashboard camera shows the officers eventually had to box the car in to slow it down .

According to Hanson , though stopped , the car was still running and in gear . The boy was upset , he said , and could n't unlock the car door . Finally , officers were able to calm the child and get the door open . Britt put the vehicle in park .

`` It was learned that the child had left his residence in his stepfather 's vehicle , which is in the Sheridan Township area . He was heading for his father 's residence in the Filion area , '' said Hanson . `` Deputy Britt called the child 's mother and got her voicemail . She quickly returned the call and was unaware that her son was missing . Apparently , she had worked a night shift and had left instructions with the boy to be awakened at 10:00 a.m. ''

A deputy brought the mother to the car and her frightened son , where deputies arranged for them to go to the county Department of Human Services .

`` We 're waiting to hear back from DHS to see how to proceed if we need to , if there is any trouble in the home , any neglect , '' Hanson said . `` We wo n't release the parents ' names until DHS has decided what to do , so we do n't interfere with possible court proceedings . ''

No charges have been filed against the boy or his mother . According to Timothy J. Rutkowski , prosecuting attorney for the Huron County Prosecutor 's Office , `` We 're still in the process of looking over the report . ''
