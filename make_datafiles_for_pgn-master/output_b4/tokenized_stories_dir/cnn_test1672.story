New Delhi -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- India and Pakistan Wednesday pledged not to let their fragile peace process slide again because of thorny issues that have made the nuclear neighbors bitter enemies .

Pakistan 's new Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar met her Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna in New Delhi in an engagement that saw no major breakthroughs over outstanding disputes but a commitment to pursue dialogue .

Their talks came barely two weeks after three deadly explosions ripped through Mumbai , an attack that revived memories of the 2008 terror siege of India 's financial hub . Pakistan was quick to condemn the July 13 bombings of Mumbai while New Delhi was careful not to finger Islamabad .

`` This is indeed a new era of bilateral cooperation between the two countries and it is our desire , and I believe after having spoken to you mister foreign minister , that it is the desire and commitment of both the governments to make it an uninterrupted and uninterruptable process , '' Khar remarked , standing beside the Indian leader after their meeting .

In his comments , Krishna too acknowledged sustained negotiations were the way forward .

`` We have reaffirmed our commitment to resolve all outstanding issues through a comprehensive , serious and sustained dialogue . While being fully cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead , I can confidently say that our relations are on the right track , '' he said .

`` We have some distance to travel , but with an open mind and a constructive approach , which has been demonstrated in this round of dialogue , I am sure we can reach our desired destination of having a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries , '' Krishna added .

As part of their confidence-building measures , both sides agreed to double the frequency of trade across Kashmir -- the disputed region divided between the countries -- to four days a week . The current three-year agreement involves 21 locally made items , which a joint statement issued after the talks said would be reviewed for possible additions .

India and Pakistan have have fought three wars since the partition of the Asian subcontinent in 1947 , two of them over Kashmir , which both nations claim .

`` The ministers held discussions on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and agreed to the need for continued discussions , in a purposeful and forward looking manner , with a view to finding a peaceful solution by narrowing divergences and building convergences , '' the joint statement noted .

Earlier this year , New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai strikes , which have been blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups .

Under U.S. pressure , Indian and Pakistani leaders held meetings last year in a bid to put their dialogue back on track , but no dramatic headway has been made .

In 2004 , the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues , including Kashmir , terrorism and Pakistan 's concerns over river dams on the Indian side of the border , which it sees as a threat to its water supplies .

Since then , successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony .

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan 's President Asif Ali Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings .

But talks were suspended two months later , in November 2008 , after the terror raid on Mumbai that left more than 160 people dead .
