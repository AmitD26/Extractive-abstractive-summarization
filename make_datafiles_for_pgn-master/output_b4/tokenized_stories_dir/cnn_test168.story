-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This week super fans from around the world are gathering in New York to celebrate the 159th birthday of the legendary consulting detective Sherlock Holmes .

Never mind that Holmes is a fictional character . To this day , in books , TV and movies , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's creation remains just as popular as he was when he debuted in the late 19th century .

Much of Holmes ' appeal has always been his amazing mind -- how he is able to solve a seemingly insurmountable mystery through simple observation and deep thought . Would n't we all like to borrow from his bag of mental tricks ?

Just imagine the possibilities if you put Holmes ' brain power to use in the workplace , the classroom or social situations . That 's the premise of Maria Konnikova 's fascinating new book , `` Mastermind : How to Think Like Sherlock Holmes . '' Konnikova , a columnist for Scientific American and a doctoral student in psychology , explores the latest science to dissect the inner workings of the iconic detective 's mind .

In turn , Konnikova uses Holmes as an example of how anyone can learn to think more clearly , improve his or her memory and generally increase everyday mental power .

CNN recently spoke to Konnikova about the book and the benefits of learning to think like Holmes . The following is an edited transcript :

CNN : How did you become a fan of Sherlock Holmes ?

Konnikova : I was introduced to Sherlock Holmes by my Dad when I was young . We had a tradition every Sunday night , he would read to us . Different stories , different books . `` The Count of Monte Cristo , '' `` The Three Musketeers , '' things kids would really enjoy .

One Sunday we started the Sherlock Holmes stories , and it was just a completely eye-opening experience . I remember sitting there riveted . It really stuck with me as I grew older . I realized how powerful they were from a literary standpoint .

Conan Doyle was such a phenomenal writer . I do n't think people appreciate just how good the work really is . He 's masterful with voice , with conversation , with pacing , with description . He has it all down .

I was also struck by how incredibly accurate his psychological observations were . Sherlock Holmes became this figure who predated modern psychology , neuroscience and our understanding of how the mind works by more than a century . Combing through the stories , I thought it would be a fascinating way of looking at the mind by using this fictional character .

CNN : Can you briefly explain Holmes ' thought process ?

Konnikova : Holmes is really a mindful detective , someone who knows the true value of observation , which means being mindful and in the present moment , really taking in your surroundings , really taking in everything . That type of approach permeates all of his thinking . He 's not just aware of his environment ; he 's aware of himself ; he 's aware of the contents of his own mind . He has a powerful knowledge of how he thinks , what mistakes he is likely to make . Holmes puts it best when he says it 's the difference between seeing and observing .

CNN : What is the `` brain attic '' Holmes talks about ?

Konnikova : It 's his analogy for how we store and process information . How is it that we take the world around us and we form it into the permanent memories that we will then use as the basis of future decisions , future thinking , of future knowledge .

The reason he uses an attic is twofold . First , an attic is finite . You ca n't just keep stuffing things up there and expect it not to give . That 's true of the mind as well . The human mind is more expandable than an attic , but there is this finite capacity for working knowledge .

Which is Holmes ' second point , and why the analogy works so well . It does n't just matter what you put up there ; it matters how you do it . So if you think about it like an attic in an old house , if there are just boxes everywhere filled with junk and none of them are labeled , you 're not going to be able to find anything .

What Holmes tells you is be careful , label everything , make sure everything is organized and accessible . That way , not only will you know where to find it , but you will remember it better . We really only know what we can remember at any given moment . It does n't matter if you memorized the information , and it 's in your attic somewhere . If you ca n't access it when you need it , you might as well not know it at all .

CNN : Are there everyday benefits of learning to think like Holmes ?

Konnikova : Absolutely , this type of approach can make you healthier , happier and sharper .

CNN : Where would you start ?

Konnikova : The first thing to do -- and this is difficult in our modern environment -- but realize that multitasking is not your friend . When you multitask , you can not think like Sherlock Holmes . That 's just anathema to his mindful approach .

If we take chunks out of the day where we focus , where we allow ourselves to just do one thing and nothing else , you 'll find your mind becomes better at doing that one thing and better at managing multiple inputs , filtering out distractions and creating a cleaner slate for you to work .

When you 're cognitively busy , you 're not thinking as clearly . If you 're someone with a busy schedule who has to multitask all the time , even if you just practice this quiet mindfulness a few minutes a day , just let your mind focus on the present moment , it can make a huge difference in the clarity of your thinking .
