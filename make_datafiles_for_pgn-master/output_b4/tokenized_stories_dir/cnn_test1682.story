-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The shooting down of a Chinook helicopter in central Afghanistan with the loss of 38 lives -- most of them U.S. Navy SEALs -- highlights two crucial aspects of the conflict in Afghanistan , as U.S. forces begin to draw down and Afghan security forces start taking the lead .

The first is the growing reliance on U.S. Special Operations Forces to combat the Taliban and other insurgent groups -- in operations every night across the country .

The second is that many areas far beyond the Taliban 's traditional strongholds in the south remain very insecure , areas where the Taliban have exploited an instinctive wariness of a foreign force among locals -- and punished those who dare to work with them .

One such place is the Tangi Valley in Wardak province , where the crash occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning . Soldiers who have served there describe it as perfect territory for insurgents , with steep mountainsides of shale and boulders overlooking orchards and thick vegetation .

Improvised bombs are regularly planted along the one road that runs through the valley , next to the Logar River , and detonated from vantage points above . -LRB- NATO officials say that the IEDs ' control wires are laid across the river , making pursuit of the insurgents more difficult . -RRB-

Tangi is only 60 miles from Kabul , close to the main highway south . But the Taliban -LRB- though not al Qaeda or other foreign groups -RRB- have long been active in the area .

In 2009 , soldiers in the U.S. Army 's 10th Mountain Division were deployed to this part of Wardak . They encountered 57 roadside bombs in the valley in just three months , dubbing the road `` IED alley '' and `` Walter Reed Highway , '' a reference to the Army medical center where many soldiers wounded in Afghanistan have received treatment .

Firefights were an almost daily occurrence .

On his blog this weekend , a former member of the 173rd Airborne Brigade recently deployed to Tangi wrote of the village where the helicopter came down . `` Juy Zarin is a village we went to frequently during our deployment and never found anything good while out there . In fact it was a wonderful place to go if we felt like getting into contact . ''

Back in the 1980s , the Soviet Army was never able to pacify the region , and Soviet convoys were frequently ambushed there .

Earlier this year U.S. forces passed control of the military post in the valley to Afghan troops . Lt. Col. Thomas S. Rickard of the 10th Mountain Division handed over Combat Outpost Tangi to a unit of the Afghan National Army .

`` As we lose U.S. personnel , we have to concentrate on the greater populations , '' Rickard told the U.S. Army website at the time . But the afghan Army did not maintain a permanent presence at the outpost , according to officials of the International Security Assistance Force -LRB- ISAF -RRB- .

As elsewhere , especially in eastern Afghanistan , U.S. forces are now returning to areas previously seen as too remote to focus on or too difficult to defend , where the Taliban and other insurgent groups have filled the vacuum . As they do , the risk of casualties grows -- as does the role of U.S. special forces .

The use of U.S. Special Operations Forces -LRB- SOF -RRB- in Afghanistan has grown exponentially . In a talk two weeks ago at the Aspen Security Forum , the outgoing commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command , Adm. Eric T. Olson , disclosed that SOF carried out `` somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000 operations '' in 2010 alone .

`` This is now routine , every night ... ground forces getting on a helicopter and flying against a target , '' Olson said .

The template of such operations includes `` a quick reaction force on call to render assistance should things go bad , '' Olson said . In Friday night 's attack , it was the quick reaction force , on its way to assist an ongoing mission by Army Rangers , that perished .

Speaking of the Navy SEALs who took part in the mission that killed Osama bin Laden , Adm. Olson made their role sound almost mundane . `` For the people involved it was another mission and another target ... This is not a force that sits on the second deck of the fire station waiting for the bell to ring every 10 or 15 years . We trace our lessons back to what we did last night . ''

Who are the Navy SEALs ?

But he also recognized the huge burden now falling on Special Operations Forces to subdue the Taliban .

`` We are beginning to fray around the edges . We are asking an awful lot of our people , '' he said at the Aspen conference , adding that SOF units were seeing `` a lot of separations short of divorce . '' But 82 % of SOF troops who have the choice of leaving or staying in choose the latter , according to Olson . And more will be asked of them . Of the 33,000 U.S. troops due to be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2012 , none will be special forces .

Special Operations Command -- drawn from all four branches of the U.S. military -- has grown to a strength of 60,000 . With a $ 10 billion budget it is now larger than the U.S. Coast Guard and about the same size as the entire Canadian Defense Force .

And the caliber of its members reflects its special status . Thirty percent are college graduates . They are more experienced than regular soldiers , with an average age of 30 , and they volunteer multiple times . Olson says 60 % of SOF have joined since September 11 , 2001 -- and the aim is to keep them in the military for an average of 20 years .

SOF operations in Afghanistan have at times been controversial , the subject of criticism from President Hamid Karzai because of civilian casualties .

In 2010 , then-ISAF Commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal tightened rules of engagement after a series of raids involved civilian deaths , although some units remained exempt from the directive . When he took over , Gen. David Petraeus expanded the use of SOF in an effort to drive the Taliban out of Helmand and Kandahar provinces and blunt the Haqqani network further east .

In testimony to Congress in March , Petraeus said : `` We have stepped up the tempo of precise , intelligence-driven operations to capture or kill insurgent leaders ... In a typical 90-day period , precision operations by U.S. special-mission units and their Afghan partners alone kill or capture some 360 targeted insurgent leaders . ''

It appears the Army Rangers were involved in just such a mission in Tangi Valley -- closing in on Taliban commanders meeting in a village -- when they called for reinforcement .

Special Operations Forces remain the sharp end of a multi-pronged approach in Afghanistan . Olson said the strategy marries `` the counter-terrorism line of operation and the engagement line of operation -- what 's been called village stability operations and the development of Afghan local police trying to return neighborhoods back to the neighbors . ''

It 's become known as `` clear , hold , build , transition '' to win over what are euphemistically called `` under-governed spaces . ''

Such was the aim of commanders in Tangi two years ago .

Lt. Col. Kimo Gallahue , battalion commander for the 2nd Battalion , 87th Infantry Regiment , told the Armed Forces Press Service in March 2009 : `` We 'll take the physical terrain from the enemy ... and we 'll take the people away , because the people are the prize in this fight . ''

But even with the surge last year , many areas of Afghanistan rarely see an ISAF soldier . And officers acknowledge that while a platoon can show a presence , it might take a company or more to persuade villagers they are secure . `` Successful counter-insurgency is labor intensive , '' said one officer .

One soldier deployed to Tangi Valley wrote of his experiences on the website AssgnmentAfghanistan in January .

`` Few of the villagers are openly hostile towards us , but they are always mindful of the Taliban , who move through the valley at night , '' he said . `` They are in a delicate situation -- we Americans have much to offer them , but they know that we will not be in their valley forever , and they know that the -LRB- Afghan National Army -RRB- and -LRB- Afghan National Police -RRB- can not fight the insurgency alone . ''

Last year , the newspaper Stars and Stripes reported on a planned meeting for farmers in the district .

Two officials from the ministry of agriculture in Kabul backed out at the last minute , fearing for their safety , and not a single farmer showed up , `` leaving a handful of American soldiers and a lone U.S. Department of Agriculture representative , sitting on otherwise empty benches in a stiff breeze , with folding tables full of unopened water bottles and unmade tea , '' the paper reported .

The phrase commonly used in Afghanistan is : `` The Americans have the watches , but the Taliban have the time . ''
