London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Actor Hugh Grant tried to persuade photographers stalking the mother of his child to leave her alone , but they just said : `` Show us the baby , '' he told British lawmakers Monday .

`` Do you really think this is a way for grown men to be behaving ? '' he said he had asked paparazzi staked out at the home of the woman , but they ignored him .

Grant was part of a panel of celebrities testifying before lawmakers examining press ethics amid scandals about phone hacking and police bribery by journalists .

Comic Steve Coogan and former motor racing boss Max Mosley were also on the panel , alongside member of Parliament Zac Goldsmith .

The witnesses were asked how much it cost to fight newspapers

`` You 've got to risk a million pounds to get justice , '' said Mosley , who successfully sued the now-defunct News of the World tabloid for libel .

Coogan said it had cost him 15,000 to 20,000 pounds -LRB- $ 23,500 to $ 31,400 -RRB- to have lawyers get a court order to keep a newspaper from publishing a story about one of his relatives , and he said he had spent `` over 200,000 pounds '' over the hacking of his phone by journalists .

Mosley also talked about the difference between defamation and invasion of privacy .

Mosley sued the News of the World after it ran a front-page article claiming he had organized a Nazi-themed orgy with multiple prostitutes . A court found in his favor , saying there was no Nazi element to the event .

`` If the News of the World had been forced to run a front-page picture with the statement ` Actually , this was a private orgy , ' it would n't have done me much good , '' he said to laughter .

The hearing is separate from a government-backed inquiry into press ethics .

The Leveson Inquiry was set up in response to outrage at revelations of the scale of illegal eavesdropping and police bribery on behalf of News of the World , which was shut down in July over the scandal .

Police are separately investigating phone hacking , computer hacking and bribery .

They say that about 5,800 people , including celebrities , crime victims , politicians and members of the royal family , were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories .

Phone hacking involves illegally eavesdropping on voice mail by entering a PIN to access messages remotely .
