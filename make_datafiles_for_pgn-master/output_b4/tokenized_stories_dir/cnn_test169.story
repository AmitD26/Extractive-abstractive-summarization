-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The captain is still in charge .

No matter how technologically advanced a cruise ship may be or how modern its safety procedures or how strict the web of international regulations , passenger safety still depends on the captain 's ability to make good decisions .

It 's not clear what difference more stringent regulations would have played in the decisions of Captain Francesco Schettino , who allegedly deviated from a set route , abandoned ship after the disaster with passengers still aboard and did not return to the ship to lead rescue efforts when ordered by local port officials , according to transcripts between authorities and the captain .

In light of the Concordia disaster , the new head of the International Maritime Organization -- the United Nations agency responsible for shipping safety , security and prevention of marine pollution -- has promised to look into the regulation of large passenger ships .

`` We should seriously consider the lessons to be learnt and , if necessary , re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation , '' IMO Secretary-General Koji Sekimizu said in a statement released Monday . `` In the centenary year of the Titanic , we have once again been reminded of the risks involved in maritime activities . ''

Passengers first , then crew , then captain

In addition to the United Nations agency , a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies , often called `` flag administration . '' The ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops . -LRB- The Concordia did n't stop in U.S. ports carrying U.S. passengers , which means it was n't subject to U.S. Coast Guard regulations , according to Brad Schoenwald , senior marine inspector of the U.S. Coast Guard 's Cruise Ship National Center of Expertise . -RRB-

In the Concordia case , the laws of Italy also apply . Schettino may face charges including manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board , chief prosecutor Francesco Verusio said . Abandoning ship is a maritime crime that has been on the books for centuries in Spain , Greece and Italy , according to Alessandra Batassa , a lawyer in Rome , although many other countries have long abandoned it .

Although U.S. law does n't single out abandoning ship as a crime , it 's a longtime maritime tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship , according to maritime law professor Craig Allen , visiting professor of law at Yale University Law School and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy .

`` If you 're going to be master of a ship , your responsibility is first to your passengers , second to your crew , then you look after yourself , '' said Allen , a Coast Guard veteran . `` It 's shameless and dishonorable -LSB- for the captain -RSB- to take himself out of the mix like that . ''

Current international regulation

Under current international regulations , each cruise company must have a safety plan , called a safety management system , that details responsibilities in the event of an emergency , Schoenwald said .

In the event of a fire on board , the captain would sound the general emergency alarm -- seven short blasts followed by one longer blast -- to direct crew members to fight the fire and direct passengers to their specified `` muster '' stations , where passengers are directed during safety drills to gather in event of emergency .

If the incident is contained , passengers might be allowed to resume their normal activities or be kept away from the damaged part of the ship until a return to port , or they might be required to abandon ship .

`` The call to abandon is made by the captain , '' Schoenwald said . `` When the abandon ship signal is made , they have 30 minutes to get everyone off the ship , even though the general emergency could have started a day or hour before . ''

It 's not clear to Miami maritime attorney Brett Rivkind why the captain did n't issue a mayday signal to call for outside help soon after the accident . '' -LSB- A captain needs -RSB- to know your ship and what danger your ship is in , '' he said . `` Tilting and listing is a pretty good sign '' of distress .

Passengers can be prepared

While passengers have little or no control over the abilities of their captain or crew , disasters like the Concordia are rare . Still , passengers can take steps to ensure a safe trip much of the time .

AAA Travel recommends that U.S. citizens who are traveling internationally register with the U.S. Department of State 's free Smart Traveler Enrollment program -LRB- STEP -RRB- at https://travelregistration.state.gov or directly at U.S. embassies or U.S. consulates , AAA spokeswoman Cynthia Brough said . This will help the State Department better help them during an emergency .

Before you board , make a copy of your passport and have a bag with necessities like hard-to-replace medication , said Kimberly Wilson Wetty , head of the Valerie Wilson Travel 's cruise department . As soon as you board your ship and arrive at your room , find your life vest and participate in the mandatory safety drill , called a muster drill .

`` If you 've been on a number of cruises , you do n't pay as close attention -LSB- to the muster drill -RSB- as you probably should , '' said John Deiner , managing editor of CruiseCritic.com . Though attendance is mandatory , he said , there are often a few people who skip the drill .

Find out where you 'll get a life jacket if an emergency keeps you from returning to your room for yours . During the cruise , place your purse and necessities in the same place in your room every time you enter .

Whatever went wrong to cause or exacerbate the Concordia cruise ship disaster , most of the Concordia crew and passengers safely made it off the ship . And though the images of the disaster may turn off many people to cruising , experts say it 's still one of the safest transportation methods available .
