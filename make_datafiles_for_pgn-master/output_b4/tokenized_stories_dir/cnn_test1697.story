New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Pakistani Muslims in Brooklyn are now running the oldest bialy store in the city , and keeping it kosher .

Zafaryab Ali and his business partner , Peerada Shah , were shocked on hearing through a friend that Coney Island Bialys and Bagels was closing . Ali had worked at the store for 10 years in the 1990s and remembers it always being crowded , with lines out the door and people waiting up to half an hour for fresh bialys . So Ali and Shah bought the store to keep the 91-year business alive .

Bialys are a lighter , softer cousin to the bagel , traditionally made with onion sprinkled on top .

`` I know bagels and my partner knows management , '' Ali said . `` If we work hard and pay attention , we 'll build up and bring more customers in . ''

Ali and Shah are keeping everything the same -- ingredients , equipment , recipes -- all used when it was a kosher store under Jewish management . Ali is now on the hunt for a rabbi to come and give the store an official kosher certification .

They even have some of the same staff , like Ernie Devivo , a semi-retired baker who is still helping out around the shop .

`` I 'm glad we opened up again , '' Devivo said . `` It 's good for everybody . ''

Asked about seeing the store open again , after a short closure , one customer said , `` It 's good . It 's beautiful . ''

According to the bakery 's website , Coney Island Bialys Bakers Co. was started in 1920 by Morris Rosenzweig , who brought the bialy recipe with him from Poland . The family continued to make hand-rolled , traditional bialys for 91 years . The business passed to Rosenzweig 's son Don and then to his son , Steve Ross , who began wholesaling the bialys as well , shipping them across the country . Then in August , Steve Ross decided to close .

`` My son was going to take over , but with the area changing and business slowing down and the economy doing a double take on the recession , it was n't worth keeping at that point , '' Ross said .

Ali and Shah reopened shop In mid-September , and say that business has been going well .

Ross is glad to see his family 's store living on .

`` I 've got no problem whether they 're black , white , purple , green , yellow . They came in , wanted to keep the business open and wanted to keep the industry going . ... I 'm glad it 's still there . I 'm happy . ''

And Coney Island Bialys and Bagels is still a family business , with Ali , his brother and his nephew all working to keep its traditions alive .

`` We 're sticking with kosher , '' Ali said .
