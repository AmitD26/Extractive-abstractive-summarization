Madrid , Spain -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Spain 's best-known judge , Baltasar Garzon , refused to answer questions from a prosecutor as he took the stand Tuesday in his trial on charges of abusing his judicial authority .

Garzon sat and listened in silence as lawyer Joaquin Ruiz Infante read out all his questions to put them into the court record .

The case centers on Garzon 's investigation of human rights abuses under Gen. Francisco Franco , the dictator who ruled Spain for four decades , until his death in 1975 .

A seven-judge panel at Spain 's Supreme Court Tuesday rejected requests from both state prosecutors and Garzon 's defense to throw the case out , clearing the way for private prosecutors to press forward .

Spanish law allows for private prosecutions , and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon .

Garzon , however , did answer questions from his defense lawyer , Gonzalo Martinez Fresneda , explaining that his investigation started in December 2006 after people came forward with complaints about those still missing from the Franco era .

Garzon testified that he searched but could not find any national census of how many people disappeared or their identities . So he decided to investigate because he considered those to be `` permanent crimes '' which still affect their descendants , since the remains have never been found .

He said he began to see evidence that there was a `` systematic plan '' against Franco 's opponents , which he said included forced disappearances , illegal detentions and assassinations .

About 20 supporters applauded the judge in a hallway of the courthouse before the trial began Tuesday , while outside , dozens more demonstrated in his favor , some holding placards with just one word : justice .

Judges began hearing the Franco-era case last week , a week after a different seven-judge panel at the same court conducted another trial against Garzon , for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a high-profile financial corruption case known as Gurtel . That trial lasted three days and a verdict is pending .

Garzon , 56 , was suspended from his post in 2010 , pending these trials . If convicted , he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain .

Many observers said the second trial is the more important one against Garzon , who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , who was in a London hospital . Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and crimes of genocide .

Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch was in the courtroom on Tuesday along with other international observers and later said , `` Garzon showed today that his decision to take up the investigations of the crimes of the Franco era was fully supported by international law . ''

`` But the spectacle of a judge as a criminal defendant , having to justify his investigation into torture , killings and ` disappearances , ' was itself an affront to principles of human rights and judicial independence , '' Brody added .

The private prosecution is led by a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias , or Clean Hands . It brought charges against Garzon , saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in Spanish Parliament , two years after Franco 's death .

`` Parliament unanimously approved the amnesty law . Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they 're crazy . What does he think ? That he 's better than them ? '' said Miguel Bernard , leader of Manos Limpias .

Bernard denies critics ' charges that his group is a tiny far-right front , but he recently told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation .

Just before the trial began on Tuesday , Bernard told CNN outside the courtroom that he had heard the judges would deny the motion to stop the trial and instead proceed .

`` A first victory , '' Bernard said .

Garzon said in May 2010 , at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court , `` I face this calmly , with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges . ''

Franco 's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War . The war ended when Franco 's forces emerged victorious over Republican and leftist fighters . Franco 's dictatorship continued until his death .

Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed , including one this week in the southern Spanish village of Gerena , said Emilio Silva , from a group called Historical Memory .

Silva said the excavations are being done with permission from the landowner , whether public or private , and with permission from local health authorities , who must ensure that the potential discovery of bones or other remains does not pose a current public health risk .

Just outside the courtroom before the proceedings began January 24 , Garzon told CNN he was `` okay '' as he headed into this second trial . He talked with his lawyers and supporters , smiled broadly and appeared relaxed .

Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court , which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases . He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , the Basque terrorist group ETA , and drug traffickers .

At times in the past , Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left , depending on the cases he was investigating . His critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras .

Since his suspension in 2010 , Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues , including in Latin America .
