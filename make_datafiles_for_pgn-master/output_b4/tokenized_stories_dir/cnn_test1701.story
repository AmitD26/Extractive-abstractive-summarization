-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gareth Bale scored both goals as Tottenham Hotspur bolstered their burgeoning title challenge in the English Premier League with a 2-0 win at Norwich Tuesday night .

The comfortable victory lifted Tottenham four points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea in the standings and within seven of Manchester City and Manchester United at the top .

Harry Redknapp 's men also have a game in hand over all their nearest rivals and while qualification for next season 's Champions League remains a more realistic expectation , the manner of their win in East Anglia would have again raised even greater hopes among their supporters .

The home side have surprised a number of teams on their return to the top-flight but had few sights of goal on their home ground and did not win a corner until deep into the second half .

Welshman Bale , who wasted opportunities in the first half , finally found the target in the 55th minute at Carrow Road as Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor set him up to fire past home goalkeeper John Ruddy .

His second displayed his individual brilliance as sent away by Luka Modric , the flying winger outpaced Zak Whitbread before chipping Ruddy for this seventh league goal of the season .

More might have followed as Tottenham kept a stranglehold on possession but they will go into their next two fixtures over the seasonal period against Swansea and West Bromwich Albion with great confidence .

`` We 've learned a lot from last year being in the Champions League , '' man of the match Bale told Sky Sports .

He added : `` As long as we are creating chances that 's the main thing .

`` We were confident we would get one whoever it fell to and lucky enough it was

me . ''

Earlier Tuesday , Tottenham 's north London rivals Arsenal were held to a frustrating 1-1 draw by 10-man Wolves at the Emirates Stadium .

It left Arsene Wenger 's men in fifth place , 12 points behind Manchester City and Manchester United and five adrift of Spurs .

Gervinho put Arsenal ahead in the eighth minute after being put through by Israeli international Yossi Benayoun .

But Wolves , again battling relegation , leveled just before halftime as Steven Fletcher reacted quickly to head home .

In the second half , Arsenal thought they should have had a penalty when Christophe Berra appeared to handball and the visitors were reduced to 10 men when Nenad Milijas was sent off for a foul on Mikel Arteta .

With a man advantage , the prolific Robin van Persie was kept out by Wolves keeper Wayne Hennessey , who also saved superbly from Thomas Vermaelen as Wolves held out for a point .

`` It is very frustrating , '' Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told AFP .

`` You wo n't play many draws like that in a season but sometimes it can happen . ''

In Tuesday 's other match , promoted clubs Swansea and QPR shared the points in a 1-1 draw at the Liberty Stadium .

Swansea took a 14th-minute lead through striker Danny Graham , with QPR appealing for handball .

The visitors leveled in the second half when Jamie Mackie latched on to Swansea midfielder Jamie Britton 's misjudged back header and shot under Michel Vorm to score .
