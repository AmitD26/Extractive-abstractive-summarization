-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Why Indianapolis ?

Super Bowl visitors will enjoy the fabulous Super Bowl parties and the very best of this Midwestern city 's arts , music and food festivals tailored specially for this sports-filled week .

And when the Super Bowl party-goers leave and the confetti has been cleaned up , the locals will return to enjoying their city . Whether you 're traveling to Indianapolis for the Super Bowl or taking a trip later , here 's where the locals have fun -- and where they recommend you go , too .

A music scene that covers all the bases

Indianapolis has some world-class music talent that music writer Ryan Williams is always eager to share with out-of-towners . Williams focuses his music blog on the Fountain Square neighborhood but loves music all over the city .

Check NUVO.net and do317.com for band schedules and times . Williams ' favorite venues include :

The Melody Inn is Indy 's version of CBGBs with a line-up that heavily favors punk and louder sounds , except for more roots and country material on Friday evenings . Radio Radio is a smoke-free space that puts together an eclectic blend of indie rock , rockabilly and touring artists .

The Vogue hosts dance nights most nights , but larger touring acts make their way through here as well -LRB- and those shows are usually smoke-free as well -RRB- . Locals Only really does welcome everyone to their line-up of local rock , blues and hip-hop . Jazz fans can choose the small club feel of the Chatterbox or the larger dinner/show feel of the Jazz Kitchen . The latter choice also features R&B , soul and hip-hop .

Local , sustainable food with a kick

Although the Midwest has a reputation for meatloaf and casseroles , there 's a burgeoning food scene in Indianapolis . When Brad and Nancy Royal opened City CafÃ © downtown in 2000 , residents did n't focus much on local , independent restaurants . And their downtown neighborhood pretty much closed up after work . So they decided to offer breakfast and lunch with a sustainable bent at their 15-table restaurant and skip dinner so they could focus on family life at night .

Over a decade later , their restaurant is part of a growing independent restaurant and arts scene downtown , where artists are making their mark and chefs are using local and sustainable food in their menus . Even in winter , Chef Brad Royal 's special always features local ingredients . And do n't worry if there 's a wait . Nancy Royal , who runs the front of the house , promises the tables turn quickly . The restaurant will serve dinner during the Super Bowl week , so call for special hours .

Indianapolis is home to some great Greek food . To get some of the best Greek food in the country , longtime residents often recommend Santorini Greek Kitchen in Fountain Square . To get off the beaten path , turn to IndyEthnicFood.com for its recommendations . -LRB- It also has a Super Bowl week guide . -RRB-

For dessert , head to the Flying Cupcake Bakery on Mass Ave with at least 12 choices daily -LRB- and extended hours and specials for Super Bowl weekend -RRB- . Try its ugly but delicious Red Velvet Elvis cupcake , with extra added chocolate chips turning the cupcake into a brownie-cake . There will also be cupcakes for each Super Bowl team and a special `` snack food '' cupcake made of pretzel crust , chocolate cake , peanut butter cream cheese filling and topped with icing and chocolate covered pretzel bits .

To step back in time , head to the L.S. Ayres Tea Room at the Indiana State Museum , which recreates the historic Tea Room -LRB- open 1906-1990 -RRB- . A proper lunch is served Monday through Saturday and high tea is served on Sunday . Reservations are required on Sunday and are recommended the rest of the week .

For the history buff , and the shopper

Art history and Civil War buffs alike will enjoy the Herron-Morton Place historic district , which is named for two institutions : Camp Morton , a Civil War prison camp , and the John Herron Art Institute .

After soaking up some history , head to Minx to delve into store owner Jennifer Mentzer 's collection of mostly vintage clothing , purses and other accessories -- including some designer pieces .

`` My mission is to encourage people to care about what they wear and maybe try something different , '' says Mentzer , who opened her most recent shop in August . `` We do have a few modern things , but they are highly curated . ''

For children , or people who act like children

Often rated one of the best children 's museums in the country , locals say the Children 's Museum of Indianapolis , with a Dale Chihuly blown-glass permanent sculpture and working carousel , is not to be missed .

For a louder experience , try a hidden gem downtown : the Rhythm ! Discovery Center , a hands-on project of the Percussive Arts Society . Get ready for some volume -- the center has more than 150 instruments for children and adults to play as well as interactive learning exhibits .

To buy some unusual gifts for your child -LRB- no Disney or Barbies here -RRB- , head to Mass Avenue Toys , where children , their parents and people acting like children can play with a carefully selected collection of European and other toys . Then head to the nearby Flying Cupcake Bakery -LRB- see more information in the food section above -RRB- .

For the wanderer

Indianapolis has become friendly to people who like to walk and wander , as long as you 're ready for temperatures ranging in the 40s during the day and the 30s at night . Bustling walkable areas include the Broadripple District 's nightlife and shops , Mass Ave 's galleries and theater and the music scene in Fountain Square .

The Canal and White River State Park , which has lovely walking paths , also features the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art and the Indiana State Museum . Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay 's collection at the state museum houses some of Irsay 's NFL collection , Jack Kerouac 's original manuscript for `` On the Road '' and musical instruments from Grateful Dead founder Jerry Garcia and others .
