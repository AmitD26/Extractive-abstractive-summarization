-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Wales went to the top of rugby union 's Six Nations Championship with a 27-13 win over Scotland Sunday at Cardiff 's Millennium Stadium .

It was the second straight victory for the Welsh , who beat Ireland 23-21 in their opener in Dublin .

They next face England , who have also won their first two matches , at Twickenham where a victory will give them the Triple Crown .

Scotland , beaten by England at Murrayfield last weekend , battled to hold Wales to 3-3 at halftime .

But the home side dominated the second half with two tries from full-back Leigh Halfpenny , with wing Alex Cuthbert also crossing .

Halfpenny ended with a tally of 22 points while Scotland had the consolation of scoring their first try in five Tests as they battled bravely to stay in the match .

New fly-half Greig Laidlaw , in for the retired Dan Parks , crossed for the Scots , but they suffered for losing backs Nick de Luca and Rory Lamont to the sin bin after the break .

Down to 13-men , the Welsh took full advantage to take control and Scotland were left contemplate the wooden spoon after two straight defeats .

`` Yellow cards are always crucial in this day and age so everybody has to work on their discipline , '' Wales flanker and man-of-the-match Dan Lydiate told BBC Sport .

`` Once we go through the phases we know we 're dangerous , but fair play to Scotland they came back into it . ''

Wales played without captain Sam Warburton , who pulled out just before the start of the match through a niggling injury .

England scored a narrow win over Italy Saturday in the only other Six Nations match played this weekend .

The clash between France and Ireland was called off due to a frozen pitch at the Stade de France .
