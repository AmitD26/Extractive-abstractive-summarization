Paris -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Al Jazeera will not broadcast video it received showing killings in France blamed on Mohammed Merah , it announced Tuesday , saying the material `` does not meet our Code of Ethics . ''

The network is `` also declining all requests for copies , '' it said on Twitter .

The decision came after Al Jazeera 's Paris bureau chief said the network received video of the shootings in the mail .

The edited footage contains images of the killings of seven people , along with music , religious singing and readings from the Quran , bureau chief Zied Tarrouche said Tuesday .

`` You can hear the gunshots at the time of the killings . ... You can hear the cries of the victims , '' he said on CNN affiliate BFM-TV .

Al Jazeera gave the material to the police , he said .

Before the network 's decision not to broadcast it , French President Nicolas Sarkozy asked television stations not to show the footage `` out of respect for the victims and out of respect for the republic . ''

`` I ask the heads of all television channels that have these images in their possession not to distribute them under any circumstances , '' the French leader said .

Merah , the suspect in the shootings , was killed Thursday at the end of a 32-hour siege at the apartment in the city of Toulouse where he was holed up .

He was wanted for the killings of three French paratroopers , a rabbi and three children ages 4 , 5 , and 7 . Two other people were seriously wounded in shootings blamed on him .

The video arrived by mail Monday on a USB stick along with an unsigned letter claiming al Qaeda was responsible for the attacks , Tarrouche told CNN .

The memory stick contained two clips with a total of 25 minutes of material , Tarrouche told CNN .

Al Jazeera kept a copy when police took the original , he said .

The video of the shootings on March 11 , 15 and 19 was apparently recorded by a camera around the gunman 's neck , Tarrouche said . Police said earlier they believed Merah had filmed the killings and that they had recovered video after he was killed .

Separately , the Israeli government confirmed Tuesday that Merah had visited Israel and the West Bank for three days in September 2010 , but did not offer details about what he did there .

He crossed from Jordan via the Allenby Bridge , where he underwent procedural questioning by Israel 's internal security service , the Shin Bet , and was allowed to enter , government spokesman Mark Regev said .

On Sunday , police charged Merah 's brother , Abdelkader , with complicity in seven murders and two attempted murders and took him into custody , the Paris prosecutor 's office said .

Authorities also charged the brother with conspiracy to prepare acts of terrorism and group theft , the prosecutor 's office said .

Abdelkader Merah feels he is being made a scapegoat for the crimes his brother is accused of , his lawyer Anne-Sophie Laguens said .

He feels Mohammed Merah 's acts were `` reprehensible , '' Laguens said on BFM-TV , adding : `` The impression we are getting today is that because we were n't able to put his brother on trial because he is no longer with us , then maybe we are coming down on the only person that is present . ''

Police also questioned Mohammed Merah 's mother and his brother 's girlfriend , but have released them without charge , the Paris prosecutor said .

Questions have been raised as to why Merah -- a petty criminal who was placed under surveillance by French authorities after visiting Pakistan and Afghanistan -- was not being more closely watched .

He claimed to have attended an al Qaeda training camp , according to Paris prosecutor Francois Molins , and was on the U.S. no-fly list for that reason , a U.S. intelligence official said .

Prime Minister Francois Fillon told French radio station RTL that `` there was no single element '' that would have allowed the police to arrest Merah before the killings began .

He was tracked down by police 10 days after the first shooting on March 11 .

In that attack , Imad Ibn Ziaten , a paratrooper of North African origin , arranged to meet a man in Toulouse who said he wanted to buy a scooter Ziaten had advertised online , the interior minister said . The victim said in the ad that he was in the military .

Four days later , two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban , about 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- from Toulouse .

In the third attack , at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on March 19 , a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher 's young sons -- in the head . The other victim , the daughter of the school 's director , was killed in front of her father .

Police said the same guns were used in all three attacks .
