-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Animal print is as classic to fashion as the little black dress . But this spring , the orange-and-black look of leopard is heading to the back of the closet in exchange for cuddly kitten faces .

Animals are shaping what we wear , from high-fashion runways to big retail stores to resale shops -- and it has nothing to do with fur , or even zebra print . No , fashion is trying to re-chic the old sweater of a wolf howling at the bright yellow moon or a T-shirt of an iguana going for a snack .

The animal illustrations growing popular now are a departure from the sophisticated animal prints that designers used a few years ago . Pets , specifically cats , are the most popular animals within the trend , fashion watchers said .

`` Pets are a language of international happiness , '' Susan Cernek , Glamour magazine 's fashion development director said . `` You can hop on YouTube and see a cute puppy video and have comments come from all over the world . There is a universal appeal . ''

Cernek said animal motifs cycled into trendiness about 2006 . The use of animal prints like leopard and zebra took off during the recession , when designers were trying to find a luxe substitute for pricier bejeweled clothing .

`` It is the kind of print that scales well , '' Cernek said . `` You can have a great print in a $ 30 shoe or in a $ 3,000 dress . ''

Leah Chernikoff , the editor of Fashionista , an online fashion blog , said the graphics ' transition from tacky to stylish can be attributed to designers like Riccardo Tisci and his Givenchy men 's line , which prominently features Rottweiler prints .

Rapper Kayne West donned a Givenchy Rottweiler shirt during a celebrity - and media-studded event . It exposed the public to the rising trend , Chernikoff said . She also points to celebrities like Liv Tyler and lines like Burberry that brought animals like the owl to the center of fashion .

Chernikoff said city street fashion culture helped to pioneer animal fashion before it showed up in magazines .

`` We were seeing people wearing these cheesy animal sweaters in an ironic way , '' Chernikoff said . `` There is something cool about the cheekiness . Hipsters are reclaiming things ... you would buy -LSB- animal prints -RSB- at souvenir shops , but there was this hipster appropriation in fall 2011 . ''

It 's the nature of the fashion industry , Glamour 's Cernek said -- it 's cyclical and reactive , always looking to rethink what 's out there to create a different effect .

`` More fashion-forward designers try to do the opposite , and do something that is more fun , like the cheeky animal prints , '' Cernek said .

The tongue-in-cheek animal graphics are showing up on runways , and among the work of artists like Kelly Eident .

Eident owns an Etsy store , I 'm Your Present , where she sells clothes created with vintage fabrics and repurposed clothes she finds at thrift stores . One of her best-selling items is a form-fitted dress adorned sheer sleeves and a large graphic illustration of animals like wolves or cats .

She describes her clothes as fun -- with a sense of humor .

`` I think animals are always in style , '' she said . `` Everyone loves them . ''

Everyone -- including designers like Victoria Beckham , who came out with a line that features cat prints on dresses and blouses , and Roberto Cavalli , whose line Just Cavalli features strands of earth-tone feathers and desert sand snake print .

`` Fashion went through a phase of being very serious and had a heavy vision , '' Cernek said . `` But the best designers epitomize this sense of whimsy and they take leopard print , luxurious and serious , and do something more fun with it . '' ''

That universal appeal has driven the trend from the street to the store . Target spokesman Joshua Carter said this season 's animal fashions are well-received by customers . The store sells a Jason Wu for Target T-shirt featuring a black cat , men 's shirts with large prints of huskies , pugs and beagles , plus items like snake-print skirts , faded leopard skinny jeans and cheetah-print flats .

`` We have seen animal print as a growing trend and continue to incorporate it into our apparel and accessories as either a full print or an embellishment on a solid style , '' Carter wrote in an e-mail .

Target 's success with the trend demonstrates that it is making impressions on mainstream fashion and consumerism .

Whimsy is a really important aspect to Berene Campbell when it comes to design and fashion . The Vancouver resident grew up in South Africa , where animals were incorporated in everything from fashion to dÃ © cor .

Campbell is now a graphic designer who crafts unconventional fabric patterns for handbags inspired by animals . She created a handbag in the shape of an owl , merging `` geek '' appeal with a colorful palette .

`` I like things that are fun and whimsical and entertaining , '' she said . `` Something that you look at and you go ` Aww , ' something that makes a person turn up the creases on the side of their mouth . ''

Eva Kischel crafts her clothing by outfitting T-shirt sleeves with minimalist cat face designs . Kischel , who runs the Etsy shop The Petite Chouette , said she gravitates toward the animal trend not because of ironic appeal or Vogue magazine , but because of its eco-friendly appeal .

`` I think wearing animal-themed clothes also demonstrates that you are against fur or other animal skin in fashion , which is a good thing , '' she said . `` I personally like this trend because it simply makes me happy to ` wear ' my favorite animals without hurting them . ''

Whatever the reasons , animals cute and fierce have clawed through many layers of fashion because it makes people happy , fashionistas said .

`` It is joy and whimsy , '' Cernek said . `` Why not have something like that is your clothes ? ''
