London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Europe risks being squeezed between `` low-cost China '' and `` high-tech America '' unless it can rediscover the knack for innovation , says the head of aerospace company Avio .

Francesco Caio , the CEO of Turin-based Avio , told me that Europe 's prospects were bleak unless it could find a `` new frontier of innovation . ''

`` Europe runs the risk of -LRB- being -RRB- squeezed between the muscles of low-cost China and the innovation of high-tech America , '' said Caio , a corporate high-flyer whose resume includes heading Cable and Wireless , Indesit and Olivetti .

`` I am genuinely concerned that if Europe is not determined to go all the way we run the risk of having a ` half-baked cake ' -- which would be very dangerous if ... digested . ''

European leaders need to face the fact that `` an industrial model that has worked very well to create wealth and growth has come to an end , '' he said .

`` That is the challenge and that is the role of leadership in Europe -- -LRB- to -RRB- make sure we have the ideas , vision and new ability to mobilize the great forces and strength that Europe has for growth . ''

Avio is the prime contractor for Vega , the new European rocket system designed to launch the small satellites that are expected to be the main driver of the aerospace industry .

Watching the Vega 's maiden launch from the Guiana Space Center in February had been exhilarating , said Caio .

`` You put seven years of development on the line -- you have a few seconds in which the system needs to perform particularly well , '' he said . `` It was a relief in the first 12 seconds , the first 24 seconds , and then it was off . ''

Made from carbon fiber , the Vega uses a solid propellant which gives it faster speeds than the Ariane 5 .

`` I think it lowers the barriers to entry for satellite launch , and for the exploration and exploitation of space technology , for smaller companies , university centers , '' he said .

Of the nine satellites launched into orbit by Vega rockets so far , seven had been developed by European students .

Despite the gloom surrounding his country 's economic fortunes , Caio said there were `` two stories '' for Italian business at present .

`` Companies that have a mix of domestic and export are doing very well , indeed , because they have hooked on to growing markets , '' he said . `` People who have been focused just on domestic market ? Yes , they are suffering . ''

Avio was now looking to Brazil and China for growth , said Caio . `` We 're going where new consumers are learning the beauty of flight . ''
