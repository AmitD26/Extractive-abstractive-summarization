-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What started out as Chelsea 's worst season since owner Roman Abramovich arrived in 2003 is now on the verge of becoming one of the English club 's best .

Saturday 's FA Cup final success , the London side 's fourth in six years in the world 's oldest football competition , is the latest step in a revival that could end in the realization of the Russian billionaire 's longheld dream .

The nailbiting 2-1 victory at Wembley is but a tasty precursor to a Champions League final in Munich on May 19 that offers the chance for Abramovich to finally win Europe 's top club prize .

He brought Premier League success to Stamford Bridge in 2005 after spending millions on coach Jose Mourinho and a swathe of star players , achieving Chelsea 's first English title in 50 years .

Two more followed , but not before Mourinho departed after failing to repeat the European triumph at Porto that earned Abramovich 's attention -- and Avram Grant , Luiz Felipe Scolari and Carlo Ancelotti also exited as Champions League success proved elusive .

Andre Villas-Boas , `` the new Mourinho , '' was bought out of his contract at Porto to replace Ancelotti -- a European champion as both player and coach -- but the Portuguese prodigy alienated Chelsea 's powerful old guard of players as he sought to stamp his authority and rebuild the squad .

His assistant Roberto di Matteo , a former Chelsea player himself , has had no such problems winning their respect as he has reverted to the style so successful under Mourinho , allowing the likes of veterans Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba to restore their pre-eminent roles in the team .

Drogba scored the vital winner in the first leg of the remarkable Champions League semifinal success against arguably the world 's best team , Barcelona , and he netted the ultimately decisive second goal against Liverpool .

The 34-year-old Ivory Coast captain is now the only player to score in four FA Cup finals , equaling the five goals in total scored by legendary Liverpool striker Ian Rush in three title matches .

Drogba may yet make his Chelsea exit after the Bayern Munich clash in two weeks ' time -- a match which not only holds the key to Abramovich 's hopes , but could also be part of a solution to the challenges the club faces under European soccer 's new financial fair play rules .

Each team will get a reported $ 66 million for making the final , when television money is added to the prize total on offer , representing a major budgetary boost for a club like Chelsea -- which under the new regulations can no longer rely on Abramovich 's deep pockets .

Chelsea 's bid to become more financially self-sufficient took another step ahead of Saturday 's final , with news the club is seeking to buy the nearby iconic Battersea power station and turn it into a new home ground with capacity greater than the present one .

The $ 2.9 million earned by winning the FA Cup final for the seventh time will also help , as well as furthering the prospects of Di Matteo being made Chelsea 's permanent manager .

Brazil midfielder Ramires followed up his second-leg goal against Barcelona with the opening strike in the 11th minute as he beat goalkeeper Pepe Reina at the near post with a low shot .

Drogba doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime , but Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll ensured a nervy finish after reducing the deficit on 64 .

The striker -- who has struggled since joining Liverpool for a club-record $ 50 million fee in January 2011 after Fernando Torres left for Chelsea for $ 30 million more than that -- thought he had leveled the scores with a late header .

However , Chelsea keeper Petr Cech clawed the ball clear off the underside of the crossbar apparently before it had crossed the line -- much to the disgust of Liverpool striker Luis Suarez , who was booked for remonstrating with the line official .

`` We 've been heavily criticised this season and we 've got a trophy and we 've got the chance for another , '' said Di Matteo , who scored in two FA Cup final wins for Chelsea in 1997 and 2000 .

`` This group of players have made the club proud . It 's been hard work , but we came through it . ''

Liverpool will play in Europe next season , albeit the second-tier Europa League after winning the League Cup in February , but it has been an otherwise disappointing season under manager Kenny Dalglish .

The 18-time English champions trail sixth-placed Chelsea by 12 points with two games to play in the Premier League , a situation which can not please the club 's American owners -- who are looking to emulate the success they have had with baseball 's Boston Red Sox .

`` They were better than us for the first hour , '' Dalglish said after the final . `` We finished really strong and if we 'd started the way we 'd finished we 'd maybe have been happier than we are now . We 've just got to learn the lessons . ''

Abramovich 's hopes of Champions League football next season , meanwhile , appear to rest solely on victory in Munich , despite a slip-up by third-placed London rivals Arsenal on Saturday .

Arsenal 's 3-3 draw with Norwich gave Tottenham and Newcastle the chance to move up to third and fourth with victories on Sunday .

Spurs , who hold the edge on goal difference only , face relegation-threatened Aston Villa while the in-form Magpies will seek to follow up Wednesday 's 2-0 win over Chelsea with another result against league leaders Manchester City .

Both clubs are five points clear of Chelsea , but know that the fourth-placed team will be bumped down to the Europa League if Abramovich gets what he really wants in Germany .

City returned to the top on goal difference with a 1-0 win in Monday 's Manchester derby , but second-placed local rivals United have easier opposition on Sunday as the defending champions host mid-table Swansea .
