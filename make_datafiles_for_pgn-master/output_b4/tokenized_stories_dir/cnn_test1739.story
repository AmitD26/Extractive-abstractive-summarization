-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The recent announcement by the United Nations that 89 % of the world 's population -LRB- 6.1 billion people -RRB- now has `` sustainable access to safe drinking water '' was described by Secretary General Ban Ki-moon as a `` great achievement for the people of the world . ''

Meeting part of the target of one of the U.N. 's Millennium Development Goals -LRB- MDGs -RRB- ahead of the 2015 deadline was `` a testament to all those who see -LRB- them -RRB- not as a dream , but as a vital tool , '' he added .

But the goal of universal access to clean water is far from complete says Stef Smits , program officer for IRC International Water and Sanitation Center .

`` Reaching the last 10 % of the population -- those living in remote rural areas and on the fringes of big cities -- will become increasingly difficult and expensive , '' Smits said .

Furthermore , he says , the MDGs on basic sanitation are unlikely to be met before 2025 .

It 's an area which the U.N. concedes is `` lagging far behind '' the millennium commitments , with 2.5 billion people -LRB- including one billion children -RRB- still exposed to poor sanitation and one child dying every 20 seconds as a consequence , the U.N. estimates .

But hope that this horrifying statistic can be eradicated is being fueled by technology which is helping monitor water supplies more quickly and efficiently .

U.S.-based NGO Water for People is helping lead the charge in this area with the development of a new system called FLOW -LRB- Field Level Operations Watch -RRB- .

The mobile technology android-based system uses camera and GPS to collect information on wells and pumps .

These then link to a web-based dashboard where survey data can be tracked on Google Maps and Google Earth , according to Water for People .

`` Lots of organizations do monitoring and that 's great , but it tends to be a very slow process , '' said Keri Kugler , Water for People 's senior manager of programmatic data .

`` This is something that -LRB- can be done in -RRB- real time . You can look at the data as soon as it 's collected , allowing organizations to make really quick decisions , '' she added .

The Liberian government , in partnership with the World Bank 's Water and Sanitation program , has already put it to good use Kugler says , mapping 10,000 water points during 2011 .

Various countries are experimenting with mobile monitoring , which could play a vital role in solving long-term sanitation issues , IRC 's Stef Smits says .

The secret life of drinking water

`` It reduces the cost of data collection and hopefully reduces the downtime . I think the U.N. estimates that one in three water pumps are not working at any given moment -- that 's a shocking number , '' Smits said .

Water for People recently teamed up with Akvo , a Dutch open source software company , to help develop the FLOW 's -LRB- now officially called Akvo FLOW -RRB- features and international reach .

Twelve years ago , when it inaugurated its MDGs for Ensuring Environmental Sustainability , the U.N. stated : `` Improvements in sanitation are bypassing the poor . ''

Today , little appears to have changed .

`` Water sanitation is a harder goal to get to . There just are n't enough NGOs out there to put a latrine in every household , '' Kugler said .

But efforts to shift the emphasis away from traditional methods of improving sanitation to simple technology-based ones might pay dividends .

`` Traditionally , there have been a lot of reasons why organizations do n't want to monitor -- too expensive , too time-consuming and too difficult to do , '' Kugler said .

`` The aim of FLOW is to remove some of those barriers and create something that is easy to use . ''
