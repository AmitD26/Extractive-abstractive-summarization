London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A British man accused of orchestrating his wife 's murder by hit men while they were on honeymoon in South Africa should be extradited to face trial , a London court ruled Wednesday .

Shrien Dewani 's appeal was dismissed by Judge Howard Riddle , paving the way for extradition , said an official at Westminster Magistrates ' Court .

Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife , Anni Dewani , 28 , during a taxi ride in Cape Town in 2010 .

Taxi driver Zola Tongo confessed within weeks of Anni Dewani 's death that he had hired two men to kill her .

In a plea deal with South African authorities , he said he was paid by Shrien Dewani to carry out the hit and to make it look like the two were the victims of a car hijacking as they were driving through a township on the edge of Cape Town . Tongo was subsequently sentenced to 18 years in prison for his part in the killing .

Speaking outside the court Wednesday , Anni Dewani 's sister , who did not give her name , said the family was satisfied by the ruling , but it was just one step in the battle to find answers .

`` We do n't want to forget Anni in this -- for us it 's all about Anni , it 's all about finding out what happened to her , '' she said . `` We will fight this battle to the end , and this battle has just begun for us . ''

The ongoing case has been hard on her family , she said . `` Look at my mum , look at my dad -- they are struggling every day with this . They have lost a daughter . ''

Ashok Hindocha , the victim 's uncle , told CNN the extradition decision is a relief .

`` We want to know what happened . Our view on this is quite simple . There were five people in the car , four men , one lady . She was murdered , '' he said .

`` Three of the people in the car have confessed that that they were involved and they are also in jail now for their part in this incident . Shrien is the only one who has n't spoken . We want to know why . Why did a beautiful girl on her honeymoon have to die , to be killed , brutally murdered ? ''

Dewani 's legal team may still seek to appeal Wednesday 's ruling .

The businessman , from Bristol in southwest England , has said his wife was the victim of a carjacking and denies any involvement in the killing .

His extradition was halted last year on mental health grounds .

Psychiatric experts told a UK court last year that Dewani was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and that he 'd tried to take his life .

` Fair trial '

South African Justice Minister Jeff Radebe welcomed Wednesday 's extradition ruling , saying it reaffirms the view that South Africa 's legal system is fair and upholds the rule of law .

`` We are also pleased that at last Mr. Dewani will stand trial for the alleged murder that induced a sense of shock and outrage -- national as well as around the world , '' he said in a statement .

`` We guarantee him and the entire world that he will indeed receive a fair trial . ''

Radebe said the ruling is also a vote of confidence in the ability of Valkenberg Hospital , a psychiatric hospital in Cape Town , and the correctional services to ensure Dewani is cared for in South Africa .

But he said the ruling would not mean that Dewani would immediately be returned to South Africa , since he has further legal avenues to explore . If successful , they could lead to a further appeal in the UK courts .

Dewani 's attorneys argued last year at the High Court in London that extradition to South Africa would breach his human rights under European law .

Their appeal cited concerns over the effect of extradition on his mental illness , the provision of facilities for its treatment and the risk of attack and sexual violence from other inmates .
