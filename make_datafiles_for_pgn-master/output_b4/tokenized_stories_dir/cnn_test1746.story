ORLANDO , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Swinging high in the air , a newly cleaned portable toilet is hoisted by crane to the nosebleed section of Orlando 's new Events Center .

The Sharps say they live by the motto , `` The money that 's made in the company ... stays in the company . ''

The arena is the future home of the NBA 's Orlando Magic . It will seat more than 18,000 fans when it opens next year . The only seats John Sharp Jr. is concerned about , though , are the ones in the 42 portable toilets he placed on this job site .

When you work five stories high , a nearby toilet can be your best friend . But for Sharp 's company , Comfort House , business is n't exactly , um , flowing like it did before the recession .

`` We had 98 percent of our inventory out , with strong healthy prices , '' he told CNN . `` With the boom in the production homes , that 's what kept us busy . ''

The arena is one of the biggest projects in Florida with more than 400 construction workers on site . But the decline in construction , which was 95 percent of Comfort House 's business , hit the company hard . It 's been forced to lay off about a third of its staff , including some long-time employees . Hours have been cut back as well .

Now a sea of toilets sits unrented on the company 's property . But it 's not a sign of desperation , Sharp said .

`` We did n't take on a large amount of debt . We paid cash for our assets , '' he said . The company owns its property outright , including all its portable toilets , vehicles and equipment .

That 's part of the business model Sharp said his parents taught him , and it 's helped this family business survive and ward off bottom feeders who see the toilets sitting unused and think he 's desperate to be bought out at a fraction of the cost .

`` Had we spent outside our means , had we grown and leveraged everything , financed everything , we 'd be in a really tough situation , '' he said . `` Good business model : Storing money , saving money when you make money ... keeping things simple . '' Watch Sharp discuss the recession 's effect on his business ''

Comfort House is a third-generation family business that started in the late 1960s . John Sharp Sr. , the family patriarch , said he 's acquired considerable wisdom from the three previous recessions that he and his company have survived .

`` My boat is a 12-foot johnboat we use for duck hunting , and that 's my yacht , and that 's pretty much the extent of my extravagance , '' he told CNN .

`` So we kind of live by that motto that the money that 's made in the company kinda stays in the company , '' he said .

But every company has its breaking point , and even with sound business principles and mechanics , the Sharps say , it 's hard to tell how long they can last . This recession is by far the worst that the elder Sharp has seen .

`` You do n't know when it 's gon na end , '' he explained .

`` If you could tell me it 's gon na end in six months , I could say , ` OK , here 's my business plan , ' but our business plan is that this could go on for another year or two , '' he said .

In many ways his son is getting a real-world crash course in `` Recession 101 . ''

`` It 's been a great learning lesson for me ... I 'm very fortunate ... because this will carry me , hopefully , for the next 30 years plus , '' he said .

And while the Sharps are involved in a business that smells like anything but roses , John Sharp Jr. says as long as his toilets stay rented , they all smell like money .
