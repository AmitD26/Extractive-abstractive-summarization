-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Rafael Nadal remains on course for a record seventh French Open title after he dismissed the challenge of fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro to notch up his 50th Roland Garros victory .

The world No. 2 triumphed 7-6 6-2 6-3 over the 12th seed as he goes in search of the 11th grand slam title in his illustrious career .

Standing between Nadal and a seventh Paris final is another Spaniard , David Ferrer , after the No. 6 seed beat Britain 's Andy Murray 6-4 6-7 6-3 6-2 .

The former world No. 1 has lost only once at the French Open since making his debut as an 18-year-old in 2005 . He is yet to lose a set in this year 's tournament .

`` It was a tough one , but I am through and I am very happy , '' Nadal told the ATP Tour 's official website . `` You can not expect to win an easy match in the quarterfinals of a grand slam .

On his semi-final against Ferrer , Nadal added : `` We played each other a lot of times . His game bothers everybody because he 's one of the best players in the world on every surface -- on clay especially .

`` He 's a complete player . It 's very difficult to play against him , because his movement is probably the best in the world and he 's able to hit the ball very early a lot of the time . ''

Should Nadal secure his seventh title he will go one better than legendary Swede Bjorn Borg , who has six . He will also match Bjorg 's record of 11 career grand slam titles .

Murray , who said he was satisfied with his performance in the tournament despite going out to a player seeded two places below him , said Nadal is the favorite to win .

He told reporters : `` I think the four best clay court players in the world are left in and whoever plays best will win . Probably have to favor Rafa slightly , but everyone is playing very , very well . ''

Ferrer 's victory ensured he made the final four of the French Open for the first time in his career , a surprise statistic for someone who is renowned as a clay court specialist .

He said his four-set win over Murray was grueling , but good preparation for his showdown with Nadal , who he labeled the best player on clay ever .

`` Tonight 's match was very hard , physically very difficult , '' he said . `` But I am happy to be in the semifinals at Roland Garros for the first time .

`` It will be a tough match against Rafa , he 's the best in history on this surface , but I hope to have a good match . ''

Murray 's disappointment was evident on court , as he made 59 unforced errors during the match and seemed to be troubled by a series of injuries .

`` He had his chances and converted them , '' he said of Ferrer . `` He 's solid and consistent and if you do n't convert opportunities against him , the games become longer and the pressure builds on you .

`` But it was a good tournament for me . I felt better coming in this year than I did last year . I lost to a better clay court player tonight . There are things to work on but I knew it would be a tough match . ''

Thursday sees the first semifinal , between world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 16-time grand slam champion Roger Federer , take place .
