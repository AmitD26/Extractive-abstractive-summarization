-LRB- RollingStone.com -RRB- -- After years of speculation and anticipation , the cast and crew of `` Arrested Development '' are finally at work on new episodes .

In the interim , David Cross was n't waiting by the phone covered in blue paint , like Tobias Funke : he released his third comedy album in 2010 , created and starred in `` The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret `` on IFC and guest-starred on `` Modern Family . ''

Cross took the time to talk to Rolling Stone about the return of the cult favorite .

It 's been almost ten years since the show started .

I never really thought of it that way . I do n't know of any project that 's had a shelf life -LSB- like this -RSB- . It was about a four-and-a-half year window of people thinking , `` OK , it might be any month now that it starts . '' You know , `` Next month ? Next year . Next year ? Next two months . Tomorrow ? Three years . '' And that process was four years , so it seems very present . That whole part was longer than actually shooting .

How does it feel to be back in the cutoffs ?

Well , the cutoffs themselves are great , because that first day of shooting we were in Burbank , and it was 102 degrees . It was a treat to be in the cutoffs . It 's great , and it 's a little surreal . I would say about half of the crew is back , the same crew from six years ago . We 're all older and people are married , have kids now . There 's no good way to do it . You 're not gon na sit around on set and shoot the s *** for three hours and catch up . You just get there at 6:30 in the morning and go . And you know , an hour-and-a-half later you 're in front of the camera doing your first scene .

Is a 10-episode season still the plan ?

I think it 's going to be 13 episodes , not 10 . There 's too much story . Some characters will have two-parters . Everybody sort of participates , sometimes in a bigger way and sometimes in a tiny little thread that goes through everybody else 's stories .

Is the new season going to be more serialized , like some of the later episodes ?

I 'm not gon na divulge anything , but I know what the stories are and what Mitch -LSB- Hurwitz -RSB- is doing , and it 's so layered . It 's really audacious and amazing . I think a lot of people will miss the work that is involved , the story , the Venn diagrams that are being created , the domino effect that characters have with each other in their various episodes . I know what he 's doing , and this has never been done on a TV show like this . This makes `` Lost '' look like a Spaulding Grey monologue . You 'll have to watch each episode more than once .

Do you think the return of `` AD '' and the possible `` Party Down '' movie and the campaign to save `` Community '' have happened because fans have the Internet , or something else ?

The networks finally caught up to the understanding of how people watch TV . If it was one year later , `` Arrested Development '' would still be on the air . Or , not currently , but it would n't have gotten canceled . Just one year ! It took them a while to figure out what everybody else already knew , which is that people are n't watching the show the night it airs .

The new episodes are going to be released on Netflix . What 's it like working with them compared to a network ?

Netflix is great . They do n't meddle at all . They know what they want . They 're happy to have it . The idea of Fox and NBC and being kind of studio - or network-loyal is absurd . People do n't give a s *** . What is it ? It 's on the plane . It 's on Netflix . It 's on Hulu . It 's on YouTube . It 's on the Internet . That 's how people watch TV .

A lot of people are already planning marathons and parties for the new episodes .

I think there 's gon na be a lot of power outages across North America . I think the grid is gon na go down .
