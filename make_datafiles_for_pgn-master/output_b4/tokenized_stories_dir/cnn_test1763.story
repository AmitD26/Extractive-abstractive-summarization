Khartoum , Sudan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The preliminary results of a referendum on an independent Southern Sudan will be announced in the next few days , with final results as early as February 7 , the national commission that organized the vote said Tuesday ,

The South Sudan Referendum Commission -LRB- SSRC -RRB- , which was formed last year by President Omar al-Bashir , said the preliminary results will be announced Saturday in Juba in Southern Sudan and on February 2 in Khartoum , Sudan 's capital .

`` If there is no appeal , the final results will be announced on February 7 , '' said Justice Chan Reec Madut , deputy chairman of the commission .

`` But if there is an appeal or appeals , they have to be discussed , and the final announcement will then be on February 14 . ''

South Sudanese voted in a weeklong referendum in early January on whether to form an independent state .

Preliminary results show 99 % voted for independence with most of the count in the south completed .

The commission faced three challenges during the referendum process : the legal aspect of the referendum itself , time and finances , according to commission chairman Muhammad Khalil .

`` In these kinds of situations , where there are political negotiations , there is a lot of give and take , '' Khalil said , `` and this reflected on the law . ''

`` The law itself was framed in an unclear way with much repetition . ... It was shaky , '' he said .

Nevertheless , Khalil said , the referendum commission , which includes southern Sudanese and northern Sudanese members , worked easily together , `` making decisions in accord . ''

Khalil said the commission did not have much time to conduct its work .

`` It was conceived by those who signed the Comprehensive Peace Agreement -LRB- CPA -RRB- that the referendum process would take 42 months , '' he said . `` By the time the referendum commission was established , we had four months . ''

The referendum on whether to declare independence from the government based in the north is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end a two-decade-long war . The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians or animists in the south . The conflict left about 2 million people dead .

Funding was also a challenge for the referendum , Khalil said .

`` The international funding was generous but not made available for Sudanese expertise , '' he said .

`` If we had more funding , we would have included more Sudanese experts to give the referendum an added national face . ''

Both the federal government of Sudan and the government of south Sudan had committed themselves to funding the referendum with 400 million Sudanese pounds -LRB- about $ 160 million -RRB- , Khalil said , but the commission only received 26.6 million SDG in the north , and 60 million SDG in the south .

Madut also pointed to `` logistical difficulties '' in the south during the referendum .

`` We used human porters who delivered material on their heads to transport the materials and kits to the counties . ''

However , Madut said , the high turnout was historical .

`` It is something that has never happened in Sudan ; in fact some say it never happened anywhere . ''

Madut said once the counting is done , the rest will be up to the politicians .

Issues such as borders , the future of the oil-rich border district of Abyei , citizenship rights and how to manage international debts are yet to be resolved .

`` We were able to finish in five months what was supposed to be done in three years , '' he said .

`` So unless we are told to come back ... we we would like to take a beautiful vacation . ''
