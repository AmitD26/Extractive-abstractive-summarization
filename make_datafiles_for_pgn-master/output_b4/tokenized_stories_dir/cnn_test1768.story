Islamabad -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Tuesday , the United States votes to elect its next president . For Americans , the choice is about which candidate will improve the economy , healthcare , the employment rate and ensure better living standards .

However , for Pakistani citizens living in the country 's northwest , especially for the 800,000 people in the tribal region of Waziristan , the American election is a question of life and death .

Malik Jalal Khan lives in Datta Khel , a small town in North Waziristan , and is an elder of the Mada Khel tribe . He told me that more than 200 people from his tribe have been killed through the CIA-run clandestine drone program in the last seven years .

Thanks to Pakistani local channels which translated all three presidential debates into Urdu , Malik Jalal has paid close attention to every word uttered by President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney .

Just like these candidates , Malik Jalal is also responsible for the wellbeing of his people . He has to ensure that his tribe 's young have stable jobs , children can go to school and sick people are treated in the best possible way . Malik Jalal listened very carefully when Obama said he would further strengthen health care , improve employment , raise taxes on the rich and improve public education . Such promises were doubled by Romney , who said that he would do even better if elected president .

This was all good news for Americans voting in the elections . But when it came to matters concerning Malik Jalal and his tribe 's people , there was no good news . Both Obama and Romney promised to continue with drone warfare that has targeted northwest Pakistan if elected .

This means that Malik Jalal still has to live with the fear that any of his tribe 's women , children or men like him are all potential targets , as reports suggest the CIA considers every male of able military age a potential terrorist in North Waziristan

It means his 9-year-old will still not go to school due to fear that his school might be targeted by a drone . It means people will still not attend funerals , have large weddings or conduct their fruit export or mining businesses openly .

Drone strikes started under President George Bush but were escalated in real sense by President Obama since he took office in 2009 . According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , more than 3,300 people have been killed in more than 350 drone strikes during the last nine years .

So far , according to our estimates , these strikes have only killed 41 of the Al Qaeda-linked individuals who were meant to be the real targets of the drone program . No names are known of all the others killed , and the CIA expects Americans to accept their word that everyone killed in a drone strike is a terrorist posing an imminent threat to the United States of America .

In a recent conversation with an American diplomat in Islamabad , I was astonished when he said to me that civilian deaths number only in two digits , according to their records .

I was further shocked when I asked him if he knows about independent sources that report on civilian deaths such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , or the recent report compiled by Stanford and New York universities . The diplomat looked completely lost .

Why do American presidents love drone technology ? The obvious answer lies in American politics . Any president at war can not afford large numbers of American soldiers coming back in coffins . But the U.S. would like to keep its hegemony , and drone technology makes this dream a reality . Now the U.S. can wage war anywhere in world without putting American troops on ground , and the resulting loss of political capital . Drone warfare is also keeping the very strong American defense lobby happy and busy with new technology .

But Malik Jalal tells me this does not work for him , his people and certainly not for peace in the region . Policies like drone attacks , extrajudicial murders committed by a state , and covert programs like rendition and secret prisons in timid allied states not only kill people -- they decimate any hope for peace .

These killings help extremists recruit more discontented youth . A person in tribal society who has lost his family members in this manner is bound by the Pashtun honor code -- Pashtunwali -- to retaliate and opt for `` badal '' -LRB- revenge or justice -RRB- . There is growing anti-American sentiment in regions affected by drone attacks and some people are tempted to resort to illegal means when the system does not deliver justice to them . This discontent is spreading among Muslims . Pakistani-born US citizen Faisal Shahzad is one example of this as he cited drones as one reason for his failed attempt to car bomb New York 's Times Square .

Malik Jalal worries when he listens to war-mongering presidential candidates and wonders if he ever will be successful in preaching peace to his kinsmen if the opponent has only contempt , and a message of death for his people . Malik Jalal wishes that Waziris were also able to vote in American elections .
