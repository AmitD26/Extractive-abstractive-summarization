-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The dieting world screams with contradictory advice : Carbs are evil ; carbs are good for you . `` Good fat '' is healthy ; `` good fat '' has tons of calories .

Diets targeted at carbohydrates , proteins or fats result in similiar results , as long as calorie intake was reduced .

Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center put four popular diets -- high carb , high fat , low-fat and high protein -- to the test to see which of the regimens resulted in more weight-loss success .

After two years of monitoring the participants , `` all the diets were winners , '' said study co-author Dr. Frank Sacks , a professor of cardiovascular disease prevention at the Harvard School of Public Health . `` All produced weight loss and improvements in lipids , reduction in insulin .

`` The key really is that it 's calories . It 's not the content of fat or carbohydrates , it 's just calories , '' said Sacks . The findings are published in the latest edition of the New England Journal of Medicine .

For the study , 811 overweight adults in Boston , Massachusetts , and Baton Rouge , Louisiana , were assigned to one of four diets .

A quarter went on a carbohydrate-heavy diet , some on high-fat , others on low-fat and the remaining on high-protein diet . The four diets were not based on popular diets , Sacks said .

Regardless of diet , most participants had dramatic weight loss after six months , losing an average of 13 pounds .

According to Sacks ' research , many of the 800-plus participants regained weight after a year , but about 80 percent of them lost at least eight pounds after two years . And 15 percent of the participants lost at least 10 percent of their body weight .

The study , funded by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health , showed little difference in users ' satiety , hunger or satisfaction with their diets .

Participants could attend individual sessions where dieticians educated them and group sessions where they discussed their experiences with one another .

Those who had better attendance in the sessions had stronger weight-loss results . `` These findings together point to behavioral factors rather than macronutrient metabolism as the main influences on weight loss , '' according to the study . Macronutrients are the three main nutrients the body uses in relatively large amounts : proteins , carbohydrates and fats . Watch the comparisons among four diets . ''

`` No one of those diets are necessarily better than any other diet , '' Sacks said .

In an accompanying editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine , Martijin B. Katan wrote the researchers ' hypothesis is `` plausible , '' but said the `` differences in macronutrient intake were too small . ''

There was an underlying similarity between the four diets .

On average , the overweight participants had a 750-calorie reduction per day . An average-sized male who consumed 2,800 calories a day was prescribed just over 2,000 calories and a woman who ate 2000 calories a day was prescribed 1,250 calories .

All diets were compatible with American Heart Association guidelines , Sack said . The study did not give the participants food . For the first 10 days , participants received menus , then were assigned to create their own using the healthy food options .

Depending on their prescribed diet , participants ate a wide range of carbohydrates , fat and protein , derived from healthy foods , such as olive oil , pasta and nut butter .

From these results , Sacks recommends going with `` the diet you feel most comfortable that is healthy , that appeals to you in terms of what foods are in it , that is n't a drastic crash diet . Whatever allows you to keep the calories down and not feel really deprived . ''

Calorie restriction can be done without feeling deprived , said Dr. Luigi Fontana , an associate professor of medicine at the Washington University who studies the effects of calorie restriction on longevity . But he warns against just halving a person 's current diet . Share your weight-loss success story with iReport.com .

`` A lot of people think of calorie restriction like eating half a hamburger , half a pack of French fries -- that you can obtain by reducing in half your portions , '' Fontana said . `` That 's calorie restriction with malnutrition . ''

Dr. Melina Jampolis , the diet and fitness expert for CNNhealth warned against drastic measures like completely focusing on one macronutrient . `` People want to be extreme , '' she said . `` You say cut back on sugar , they cut it completely . The take-home would be that there is no markedly superior diet . If there was , people would n't stick with it anyway . ''

Cindy Moore , the director of nutrition therapy at Cleveland Clinic and a registered dietician agreed .

`` People gravitate to the latest fads or trends , because they may have known someone who was successful in losing weight . That friend may have been in that early grace period of losing weight . The other thing is people think they need that magic bullet . ''

But a significant change in eating habits -- like cutting out an entire nutrient group like carbohydrates , proteins or fats , often ca n't be sustained .

Weight loss tends to be dramatic during the first few months . Brenda Driver , of Springfield , Missouri , was not involved in the study but says she lost 10 pounds in 10 days on the Atkins diet by eschewing all carbohydrates .

The 26-year-old and her fiance said they were `` not looking at a crash diet , but want to jump start weight loss . '' The former vegetarians began eating meat again because of the high protein demands of the diet .

Driver said she 's aware the Atkins diet is not an ideal long-term plan . Six years ago , she tried the diet for seven months and lost 45 pounds . She finally quit the diet because of her chocolate cravings .

This month , Driver and her fiance decided to give the Atkins another try . `` I want to rebel against the whole , ` you 're - engaged-now-you-have-to-lose-weight , ' '' she said . But it would be nice to look slimmer in those wedding photos , she said .

`` I 'm approaching it as a temporary thing . Vegetarianism is where I want to be the rest of my life . ''

Moore said the basics of losing weight boil down to this : Limit the calories consumed so a person is taking in less than the body needs or increase activity to burn more energy .

The problem , she said is that , `` People get discouraged if weight loss is really , really slow . ''
