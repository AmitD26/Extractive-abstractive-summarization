-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It may not be `` High Noon , '' but the Red Bull team are facing a Shanghai showdown when their two drivers resume rivalries at this weekend 's Chinese Grand Prix .

Sebastian Vettel has been vilified for ignoring team orders and passing his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in Malaysia to whisk the win from under the Australian 's nose .

Directly behind the dueling Red Bulls , the opposite scenario was playing out as Nico Rosberg reluctantly obeyed team orders not to overtake his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton for third place , even though the German appeared to have a quicker car .

The controversial issue of team orders in Formula 1 has once again tested respect between teammates -- and ahead of Sunday 's race Vettel said he would probably do it again given he felt Webber had not supported him in the past -- and raised question marks over the purity of the sport 's racing .

The willingness to accept team orders often relies on a tacit understanding between the drivers , on their status within the team and how the race will be run .

Former Honda , Brawn and Williams driver Rubens Barrichello -- who spent six years as Michael Schumacher 's deputy at Ferrari -- explained : `` In the team meeting before the race you have to talk about various situations .

`` Obviously there is an interest in doing the best for the team , '' Barrichello told CNN . `` All the team wants to see is if one driver has a problem he will not make it difficult for his teammate .

`` If it was agreed before by both drivers that they needed to go lower on revs -- and if that is a code for no overtaking -- then that is what they had agreed . ''

Webber was told to turn down his engine revs after taking the lead in Malaysia . He understood that instruction meant -- as Barrichello suggested -- he would not be passed by his teammate .

But the fact that Vettel chose to ignore this instruction and run his own race has left serious , unanswered questions over his respect for Webber .

Taking the low road

`` I do n't think there 's the same respect now for other drivers , '' British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN .

During his F1 career between 1951-60 , Moss would only sign contracts that named him as the team 's number one driver . In his era of racing , that meant if there was a problem with his speed machine , he could simply call in his teammate and take over his car .

There was , however , one exception to Moss ' rule when , in 1955 , he signed for Mercedes alongside Argentine great Juan Manuel Fangio .

The pair shared a mutual respect on and off track , says Moss , even though it was `` El Maestro '' who would capture his third world title at the end of the season .

`` When I was at Mercedes with Fangio there were no pit orders at all until we had a 30-second lead over the rest of the field , '' Moss recalled .

`` When a team had the lead , the number one driver would hold position and not pass him , says Moss .

`` I respected Fangio so much that I was just as happy to be number two . I was quite happy to sit right behind him . It did n't worry me , '' he said .

`` We were known as the train because I was only about two yards behind him the whole race ! ''

It 's all different now though , says Moss .

`` Because -LRB- Red Bull -RRB- had specifically said to -LRB- Vettel -RRB- let Webber have it , that made him a naughty boy but he felt , ` well dammit , why should n't I win ? ' I do n't think he 'll ever repair that damage because he probably thinks ` well , that 's the way I race . ' ''

Career-defining moments

On the other side of the garage , the Malaysia team orders drama may have more emotional , career-defining consequences for Webber , whose Red Bull contract expires at the end of the season .

Barrichello can empathize with Webber 's position as he considers his perpetual role as Red Bull 's `` number two '' driver .

The Brazilian was famously forced to cede first place to Schumacher by Ferrari in the controversial 2002 Austrian Grand Prix . It was the start of a long period of reflection for Barrichello .

`` In my case in Austria there were eight laps of conversation because they told me that I should do something that was not agreed , '' he explained .

Because of what happened in Austria , people think there was something that was written in his contract . But there was n't , says Barrichello .

`` The year before in Austria I had let Michael by when I was second and he was third and I had that conversation with the team afterwards when I said : ` Listen , what would happen if I was first ? ' And they said : ` We would never ask you that if you were first , ' '' he explains .

`` And then it was exactly the case the following year in 2002 . I refused to do it until the penultimate corner because it was not agreed .

`` It was very hard , it was absolutely very , very hard . I really tried to give my very best to see if the team would ultimately change the philosophy . ''

It was the reason why the Brazilian quit his Ferrari contract one year early in 2005 .

`` I saw that there was no winning scenario , the case was lost , '' he said .

That career-defining moment for Barrichello also led to a decision by the sport 's governing body , the FIA , to ban team orders that directly affected the outcome of a race .

Ironically , it was another infamous incident between two Ferrari drivers in 2010 -- when Felipe Massa was told to surrender the lead to teammate Fernando Alonso -- that led to a ban on team orders being stripped from the rulebook in 2011 .

There was simply no point trying to police something that has always been an intrinsic part of the sport .

Teams before drivers

Team orders have always existed in F1 because , in simple terms , teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money .

It is , after all , the teams who finance the drivers ' fun and it is their brand and sponsors who they are protecting .

When the top teams are spending $ 1m a day it makes business sense to protect that investment by not allowing drivers to race freely if there is a danger that in the heat of the moment both cars could take each other out of the race .

`` The team has always been the most important thing , '' said Moss .

`` I drove for teams like Mercedes and Maserati and at one time I drove my own car which meant I could do what the hell I liked ! '' he said .

`` But once you 're with a company you really have to do what they tell you to . It 's a professional business with very big money , which it was n't -LRB- when I drove -RRB- . Drivers are being paid like film stars now . ''

This constant clamor of commercial team interests means the men at the wheel of the world 's fastest cars often have to suppress their racing instincts .

That is exactly what Rosberg did in Malaysia and exactly what Vettel chose not to do .

Do F1 drivers simply have to accept that when it comes to racing it is the team who ultimately decides how a race is run ?

`` I do n't think drivers accept that , '' says Barrichello .

`` There are racetracks when one driver can do better than another and there should be freedom for them to decide that . They should be allowed to fight . ''

Moss , meanwhile , understands Vettel 's racing instincts .

`` I suppose he was a naughty boy , '' Moss says , `` but he is a racing driver who 's paid to go fast .

`` I 'm glad I raced when I did and not now because the pleasure was so much more then and the racing certainly was purer . ''

Few of F1 's global television audience of half-a-billion fans would disagree with Moss . Who wants to watch races that have been massaged and manipulated by team orders ?

But the furore across global media outlets and social media sites following the Malaysian GP also proved F1 fans balked at the unsporting flavor of Vettel 's victory -- even if he was doing what a triple world champion is supposed to do , race .

There appears to be a thin divide between team orders that protect a worthy longtime leader and instructions that see him denied the taste of champagne from the top step of the podium .

Vettel , Webber and Red Bull will begin to find out how much crossing that line in Malaysia has hurt them when they reunite in Shanghai .
