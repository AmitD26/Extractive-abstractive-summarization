New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The New York Police Department has arrested a man in the shooting deaths of three New York City shopkeepers , according to Commissioner Raymond Kelly .

Salvatore E. Perrone , 63 , was arrested after ballistics tests showed the .22-caliber rifle found in his duffel bag was the same one used in the three crime scenes , Kelly said .

Detectives recovered the duffel bag from the house of Perrone 's girlfriend on Wednesday morning and found the carbine with a sawed-off stock and a combination laser/flashlight attached to its barrel with duct tape and two thick , pink rubber bands .

They also recovered a box of .22-caliber long-rifle ammunition , an empty magazine and a 12-inch kitchen knife with dried blood on it as well as two Buck folding knives , each with 7-inch blades .

Perrone is charged with three counts of murder and faces life in prison if convicted .

Police said the .22-caliber rifle was used to kill Vahidipour Rahmatollah , 78 , at his She-She boutique on November 16 ; Isaac Kadare , 59 , at Amazing 99-Cent Deals on August 2 ; and Mohamed Gebeli , 65 , on July 6 at Valentino Fashion in Brooklyn .

Kelly did n't provide a motive for the murders .

`` I think it 's reasonable to assume that he was going to continue doing this and by arresting him , we have saved lives , '' said Kelly .

Perrone was an independent seller of men 's and women 's clothing to boutiques in Brooklyn , said Kelly .

`` After his photograph was circulated , we received several calls from proprietors of similar stores to inform us that they recognized Perrone as a salesman who would periodically visit their stores , '' he said .

He was spotted at a pharmacy in Brooklyn on Tuesday evening and voluntarily agreed to come to the precinct .

In 2001 , Perrone was also arrested in Franconia Township , Pennsylvania , on a forcible entry charge .

He has a house on Staten Island but has been residing with his girlfriend in Brooklyn for the past several years , police said .

It was not immediately clear whether Perrone had any legal representation .
