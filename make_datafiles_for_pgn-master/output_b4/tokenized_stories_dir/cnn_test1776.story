`` It will be hard for us and it will be an achievement just to get out of the group stages and through to the quarterfinals , but I am personally dreaming of reaching the final ! '' he added .

Shevchenko has scored 46 goals in 105 appearances for his country -- and he is not nervous about leading his side out in the finals , despite the weight of a nation 's expectations on his shoulders .

`` I have already experienced captaining us at the World Cup finals in Germany in 2006 and it will be equally as important to be captain in 2012 .

`` We are playing at home , with full stadiums and passionate fans . It will be very special moment for me . ''

Captaining his country in a major international tournament on home soil will be a fitting end to a wonderful career for Shevchenko , who is among the greatest forwards the world has ever seen .

Shevchenko is best remembered for his time at AC Milan , where he scored 175 goals in seven seasons -- the second most prolific striker in the famous Italian club 's history -- as well as helping the club lift the Champions League title in 2003 .

It is something Shevchenko is naturally very proud of .

`` When I was a child , it was my dream to be a professional footballer . When I was 14 I visited Milan 's San Siro stadium and remember thinking how unbelievable it was , '' said Shevchenko .

`` From then onwards I vowed that one day I would be playing there -- and I am very proud that I achieved this and also for everything else I have managed to achieve in football . ''
