-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They 're calling it the `` Crews missile . ''

Fired from the keyboard of 67-year-old Nick Crews , the missive blew the lid off his dysfunctional family .

In an e-mail titled `` Dear All Three , '' published in U.K. newspaper The Telegraph , Crews excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the `` bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out '' to him and his wife .

Crews , a retired British naval officer , was fed up with his children 's unsuccessful marriages and inability to earn a living that , as he said , measures up to their potential .

`` I for one , and I sense Mum feels the same , have had enough of being forced to live through the never-ending bad dream of our children 's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes . ''

5 ways to raise a grateful child

In the e-mail , made public with his permission by his daughter Emily , Crews describes his concern for his grandchildren .

`` It makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation-driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you , their parents . ''

And then this ultimatum : `` I want to hear no more from any of you until , if you feel inclined , you have a success or an achievement or a REALISTIC plan for the support and happiness of your children to tell me about . ''

Whoa . This is beyond disappointment . This sounds just plain mean .

Yet , the story , and support for Crews , has gone viral . It `` struck a chord , '' wrote Telegraph reporter Cristina Odone .

Sure , what parent does n't fear raising a bum ? But as the mother of two young adult children , I had to wonder whether a withering e-mail attack was the best way to go about getting the kids to shape up .

I asked Dr. Gail Saltz , associate professor of psychiatry at New York Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine , whether the former submarine captain took the right tack .

For a parent fed up with his child 's behavior , `` It can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart , '' said Saltz . But , she added , one must pave the way long before the children became adults , with a warm , communicative relationship .

Although two of his children have n't spoken to him since receiving the note , `` Crews has been swamped with encouraging messages , '' writes Odone . Many are applauding Crews for `` telling it like it is . ''

But does he ? In the e-mail , he alludes to his own mistakes : `` Having done our best , probably misguidedly , to provide for our children ... '' He describes his envy when hearing his friends brag about their children , and seems deeply wounded by the fact that his children do n't consult him or his wife before making life decisions .

The secret life of my sixth grader

Perhaps he played a larger role than he would admit , or even knows , in how his children turned out . He did acknowledge to Odone that due to his naval career , he was pretty much an absentee father .

The Crews story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents .

In the wake of the Great Recession , many parents have resigned themselves to the fact that their college-graduate children may not be moving out anytime soon and may not even have a job .

A U.S. 2010 policy brief sponsored by Brown University showed that 43 % of those under 25 live with their parents , up from 32 % in 1980 .

But is the economy alone to blame for what I fondly call `` Deadbeat Kid Syndrome ? ''

`` Not everything is parenting and not everything is biology , '' said Saltz . `` There 's a combination here . '' And sometimes , she added , families just have bad luck .

Saltz said although Crews obviously loves his children , `` he ended up missing the mark '' with the e-mail .

Still , the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing , Saltz said , especially in a world full of `` overly indulgent parents , '' who are n't teaching children life skills .

Everyone 's tweeting and boasting about their kids ' successes , but missing an important point , failure is important too .

`` If you do n't teach your kids any resilience , you fail them out of everything , '' Saltz said . `` They need to fall down , say I fell down before but got back up , and I know I can do that . ''

I 'm guilty of this sort of thing . Growing up , I never once called my mother at work . Yet I allowed my own kids to call me all the time . It just took that much longer to wean them off the `` workday quickie advice call . '' Perhaps I should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own .

Many parents have blinders on . If you do n't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude , why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades , which they likely deserve , or for failing them for cheating ?

When heroes disappoint our kids

Timothy Law Snyder is vice president for academic affairs at Loyola University Maryland and lectures nationally about generational differences . Snyder says some parents blame the school or the professor , rather than the student , for bad grades , even when their child is caught plagiarizing .

`` It 's at its worst when the parent is living through their child , '' he said . `` The parents ' successes , even life accomplishments , are identified entirely with those of their child . ''

`` It used to be parents would go to the school and care that -LRB- their -RRB- kid has a moral compass and understands right and wrong , '' Saltz said . Nowadays , the concept of right and wrong is n't as clear . `` They 're more concerned that the kid gets an A than be a kind person , a moral person . ''

Saltz said parents are under pressure for things to look good and feel good . `` They love their children . ... . But they 've got tunnel vision . ''

Case in point : when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well , or poorly , they 've played .

`` Children come out and experience nothing but success , not necessarily done by them but enabled by their parents , intervening all the time , '' Saltz said .

Such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood , and that 's not a good thing . Nor is having too many choices too soon .

Take the beauty salon . How young is too young for a manicure ? In my salon , there 's a 4-year-old girl who 's been getting `` mani-peds '' for two years . She loves the pedicure bath , '' the manicurist told me . What happens to that little girl when she grows up and ca n't afford manicures ?

And think , does your 6-year-old really need a cellphone ?

As for the Crews saga , Saltz said she hopes it makes a lot of people think about being more honest with their children .

`` Someday they 'll have to frustrate their child , disappoint their child , point out their child 's mistakes . By doing those things earlier rather than later , they 'll help their children to be better people . ''
