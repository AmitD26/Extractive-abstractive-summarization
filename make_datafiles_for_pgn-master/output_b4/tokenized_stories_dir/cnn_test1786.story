New Orleans , Louisiana -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Of all the terrifying moments during Hurricane Katrina , one of the worst was when word came that the roof of the Louisiana Superdome was tearing away .

During the storm and for days after , the dome was a refuge of last resort for people who had nowhere else to go . It was an iconic image of the city itself , and it became a symbol of all that went wrong with the evacuation .

The Superdome suffered severe damage -- 70 percent of its 10-acre roof was ripped away , revealing the metal framework underneath , and allowing oceans of water to flow inside . Over 70,000 stadium seats were soaked , and water poured down over 2 million square feet of walls , electronics and furniture .

Doug Thornton , senior vice president of SMG , a managing company in charge of the Superdome , watched as the city 's crown jewel was shredded .

`` There were projectiles that had actually been driven into the aluminum skin of the Superdome , '' he says . `` We were very concerned about debris falling from the roof . We had no water pressure . We had no ability to remove trash and debris , and we were taking on more and more and more people . The Superdome was literally the poster child for misery and suffering . ''

As the last of the storm 's refugees were finally evacuated from the area days later , Thornton flew out in a helicopter and looked back across his own neighborhood to the Superdome , seeing an ocean of water the whole way . `` I did n't think there would be any way to come back ... not to the city , not to the dome , not to my home . ''

Still , within days , he and his staff returned , called in architects , and began examining the Dome to see if it might be saved . For a month , they crawled through the framework , studied structural components , and finally decided that a restoration could be attempted . Maybe a long shot , but possible .

So mounds of debris were cleared . Anything that had been damaged beyond repair was removed , and the expensive process of replacing everything that had been lost began . The cost was staggering . A new sound system was put in for $ 7 million . Concession stands : $ 3 million .

Video systems : $ 8 million . Phones : $ 8 million more . And on and on it went .

All of this was happening under enormous time pressure . The NFL wanted the Saints to open their 2006 season in the Superdome , and that game was slated for little more than a year after Katrina . Work would have to proceed seven days a week .

So Thornton is grateful for every break that came his way . The crews replacing the roof hoisted a `` No Hurricanes '' flag as a joke to stave off any storms that would delay their efforts . It worked . They finished more than a month ahead of schedule .

Inside , all those soaked stadium seats were molding . They could not afford to replace them all , so they cleaned them , covered them in plastic , and for two months blew hot air beneath the plastic to thoroughly dry them and kill off any residual mold . That worked too . Only 20,000 were beyond saving .

Thornton stands far up in the stands looking over the vast expanse of seats and shakes his head in wonder . `` If we would have had to replace 72,000 seats we would n't have made it . ''

But they did make it . Much remained to be done , but the Dome was declared `` football ready '' and filled with fans to see New Orleans ' beloved Saints beat the Atlanta Falcons in the home opener . Since then , the Saints have , of course , won the championship of the NFL , making the whole comeback seem as if it were fated .

Thornton knows better . The work has continued nonstop for five years , and it goes on still .

This is the largest stadium restoration project ever attempted in this country on one of the largest rooms in the world . When it is all done , it will have cost more than $ 300 million .

And yet it is the small moments that Thornton remembers most as he walks the hallways , tending to this landmark of a beleaguered city . Near one stadium gate , he points out a spot where every day during the crisis he saw an old woman crouching , helping tend to some children . He says he still wonders , almost every time he passes , what happened to her .

But just as he did with the Superdome itself , he hopes for the best , and works on .
