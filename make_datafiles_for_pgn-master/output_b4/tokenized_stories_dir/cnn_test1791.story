London , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When I think back on this past week and the rollercoaster of emotions I have experienced at the Paralympics , I realize that everything happens for a reason .

Hours before the London 2012 opening ceremonies I learned that my appeal to overturn my reclassification had been denied . In that moment I felt defeat .

I felt as though everything I had worked for the past four and a half years had been stripped from me , but it was then that I realized that the journey to get to this point was n't about the medals .

The reason why I got back in the water in April 2008 nearly four months after being paralyzed , the reason that I devoted my life to swimming for the past four years , the sacrifices I made , and the person I became , was n't about the medals .

I think it was easy for me to get lost in the numbers -- the number of how many golds I could win -- but when this happened it forced me to reflect on my journey and what got me to this point . I realized I did all of that to become the best possible swimmer , athlete and person I could be for this very moment , medals or no medals .

I poured my heart , soul , sweat and tears into these past four and a half years to challenge myself , to see just how far I can push my body , to move forward with life , and most importantly because I absolutely love to swim .

No matter what happens and what has happened , that is something that ca n't be taken away from me . That is something that no-one can strip from me . The work that I have put into this , the passion that backs it , and who I have become throughout this journey all remains the same no matter what classification I am .

As I went into Sunday 's 50 meters freestyle , I knew what I had to do and I knew what I wanted . I had dreamed of that very moment for years and I wanted nothing more than to see our flag raised and hear the national anthem play .

I went into that race with some stiff competition . Competition I had never raced before . I sat in the ready room as a T10 complete paraplegic , no function from my belly button down , and I was up against girls who are single-arm amputees .

I sat there and watched them stretch their legs as I stretched my arms and I knew that it would be an uphill battle , but I also knew that nothing is impossible . As I got out to the blocks , everything from that point on became a blur up until the point when I hit the wall and turned to see my face on the big screen .

I had done it , I had won my first Paralympic gold medal and I had done it despite my reclassification and everything that had happened . In that very moment the journey that brought me there flashed before my eyes .

Everything I had dreamed of came true . I proved to myself that no obstacle is too big to overcome . No matter what happens we all have the ability to overcome , and on Sunday I pushed my body to new limits and showcased my ability .
