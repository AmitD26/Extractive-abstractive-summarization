-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two of the most influential papers for voters in Iowa and New Hampshire -- the first two states to weigh in at the polls in 2008 -- both endorsed John McCain in the Republican presidential race , but differed in their choice in the Democratic contest .

The Des Moines Register backs Hillary Clinton , while The Boston Globe picks Barack Obama .

The Des Moines Register backed Hillary Clinton , while The Boston Globe picked Barack Obama , in excerpts of Sunday 's editorials posted on their papers ' Web sites Saturday night .

The Iowa caucuses are January 3 , and New Hampshire 's primary follows five days later .

The Globe 's editorial board dismissed concerns over the Illinois senator 's relative lack of Washington experience .

`` It is true that all the other Democratic contenders have more conventional resumes , and have spent more time in Washington , '' the board wrote .

`` But that exposure has tended to give them a sense of government 's constraints . Obama is more open to its possibilities . ''

But the Register 's editorial board -- which noted that Obama `` demonstrates the potential to be a fine president '' -- still gave the edge to the senator from New York , saying it made the nods in both parties ' primaries based on competence and readiness to lead .

`` When Obama speaks before a crowd , he can be more inspirational than Clinton , '' the board wrote . `` Yet , with his relative inexperience , it 's hard to feel as confident he could accomplish the daunting agenda that lies ahead . ''

The Iowa paper 's endorsement is widely viewed as a major boost for Clinton , and a blow to the campaign of former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards , whose Register endorsement during the 2004 race was followed by a surprisingly strong showing in the state 's Democratic caucuses .

Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN 's Mike Roselli that the campaign was `` not surprised '' by the Register 's decision , adding `` that it was a bigger surprise to get the Globe 's , '' and noting that the Des Moines paper `` said good things about us . ''

Obama told CNN , `` I think we are doing pretty good . We split it today between the Globe and the Register . ''

The Clinton campaign immediately sent out a news release containing the full text of the paper 's endorsement , which took Edwards to task for recent campaign trail rhetoric , writing that `` We too seldom saw the ` positive , optimistic ' campaign we found appealing in 2004 . ''

`` Obama , -LSB- Clinton 's -RSB- chief rival , inspired our imaginations , '' the Register board wrote . `` But it was Clinton who inspired our confidence . ''

Clinton spokesman Mark Daley told CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux that the campaign is incredibly pleased and honored .

`` But we know we have a few weeks left to go before the caucuses and a lot of work to do , '' Daley said , adding that after Clinton 's Thursday debate performance , her Friday endorsement by Iowa 's Democratic Rep. Leonard Boswell and Saturday 's Register nod , `` we feel good about our campaign heading into the final weeks . ''

On the Republican side , the Register 's board wrote that the endorsement went to the senator from Arizona because `` time after time , McCain has stuck to his beliefs in the face of opposition from other elected leaders and the public .

`` The force of John McCain 's moral authority could go a long way toward restoring Americans ' trust in government and inspiring new generations to believe in the goodness and greatness of America , '' they wrote .

Meanwhile , the Globe 's board passed over former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , saying that while McCain 's views might differ from theirs , his `` honesty has served him well . ''

`` As a lawmaker and as a candidate , he has done more than his share to transcend partisanship and promote an honest discussion of the problems facing the United States , '' the board wrote .

In 2004 , the newspaper stuck with the native son on the ballot , giving the nod in the Democratic primary to Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry , who went on to win the New Hampshire primary .

The Boston Globe 's endorsements are influential in neighboring New Hampshire , especially the southern part of the state , where many residents make the daily weekday commute to work in Boston .

And the endorsement weighs even greater with Democratic voters there , since the state 's main newspaper -- the New Hampshire Union Leader -- has a conservative editorial board and makes only one primary endorsement , which is almost always a Republican .

McCain 's Globe endorsement follows a recent nod from the New Hampshire Union Leader .

Political pundits almost left McCain for dead this summer , after his campaign nearly ran out of cash and hemorrhaged staff , and the candidate sank in the polls . Now , the senator is in second place or tied for second in the most recent Granite State polls .
