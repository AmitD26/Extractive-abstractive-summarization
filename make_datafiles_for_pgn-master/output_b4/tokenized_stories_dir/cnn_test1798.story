-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You may not know his name , but anyone who watches movies and television knows the squat , tough-faced character actor Charles Durning , who died on Christmas Eve , according to his family .

The 89-year-old decorated World War II veteran had an award-winning career that spanned 20th Century entertainment , from the burlesque stage and theater to television and film , playing roles as diverse as society itself .

Durning was the gruff father smitten by Dustin Hoffman 's female impersonation of `` Tootsie , '' the Southern politician dancing on stage with George Clooney 's Soggy Bottom Boys in `` O Brother , Where Art Thou ? '' and the corrupt cop caught up in the `` big con '' by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in `` The Sting . ''

He won Tony and Golden Globe awards and was nominated for Academy Awards two times as a supporting actor . He also received nine Emmy nominations and was honored in 2007 with a lifetime achievement award from the Screen Actors Guild .

Born in Highland Falls , New York , on February 28 , 1923 , Durning became an actor relatively late .

According to his TV Guide biography , Durning left home at age 16 and later enlisted in the Army . Durning landed at Normandy on D-Day and fought in the Battle of the Bulge , receiving the Silver Star and three Purple Hearts .

He worked odd jobs that ranged from professional boxing to teaching ballroom dancing to ushering in a burlesque house , where he got his start on stage by once filling in for a comic who failed to show up , the actor often recalled .

He also attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts , where he trained with Jason Robards , Colleen Dewhurst and others .

Some of Durning 's other best-known roles included his Tony-winning performance as Big Daddy in `` Cat on a Hot Tin Roof '' , the governor in `` Best Little Whorehouse in Texas '' , a beleaguered police officer in `` Dog Day Afternoon '' and as Doc Hopper , the owner of a frog leg restaurant in `` The Muppet Movie . ''

Durning 's family , in a statement issued Tuesday , said , `` Not only was Charlie a World War II hero but he was also a hero to his family . Charlie loved Christmas and if he could have chosen a time to pass , he would have chosen this day . ''
