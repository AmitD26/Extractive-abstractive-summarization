Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Barack Obama on Monday appeared to call out Mitt Romney over what he said about going after Osama bin Laden on the campaign trail four years ago , as opposed to on the eve of the first anniversary of the raid that killed the terrorist leader .

Asked about Romney 's comments earlier in the day that the decision to go after bin Laden was a clear one and that `` even Jimmy Carter would '' have made the call , Obama referred to a difference between what Romney said during his 2008 presidential campaign and on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack .

`` I assume that people meant what they said when they said it , '' Obama said during a joint appearance with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda . `` That 's been at least my practice . I said that I 'd go after bin Laden if we had a clear shot at him , and I did . If there are others who said one thing and now suggest they 'd do something else , I 'd go ahead and let them explain . ''

Obama also appeared to take exception with a reporter 's question that suggested there was excessive celebration around the anniversary of the al Qaeda leader 's death , repeating a charge that Republicans have made .

`` I hardly think that you 've seen any excessive celebration taking place , '' Obama said . `` I think that the American people likely remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens . ''

Romney 's spokeswoman , Andrea Saul , responded in a statement that Obama was using the anniversary of bin Laden 's death as `` a cheap political ploy '' that she said distorted Romney 's policies on fighting terrorism .

`` While the Obama administration has naively stated that ` the war on terror is over , ' Gov. Romney has always understood we need a comprehensive plan to deal with the myriad threats America faces , '' Saul said .

U.S. Navy SEALs killed bin Laden on May 2 , 2011 during a raid in Pakistan .

The war of words around the bin Laden death anniversary started last week when Obama 's campaign made it an issue in a Web ad that questioned whether Romney would make the same call in the Oval Office . Former President Bill Clinton narrates parts of the video , in which he praises Obama 's decision to order the attack . It also points out Romney saying in 2007 that , `` It 's not worth moving heaven and earth , spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person . '' Days later , he said , `` We 'll move everything to get him -LRB- bin Laden -RRB- . ''

Asked by a reporter at an event Monday morning whether he would have made the call , Romney said `` of course '' he would have . `` Even Jimmy Carter would have given that order . ''

Surrogates took up the argument over the bin Laden raid on the Sunday talk shows .

Senior Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs defended the campaign , while senior Romney adviser Ed Gillespie characterized it as a `` bridge too far . ''

Gibbs , the former White House press secretary , said the video was `` not over the line '' and criticized comments Romney made on the issue during his first White House bid as `` foolish . ''

`` There 's a difference in the roles they would play as commander in chief , and I certainly think that 's fair game , '' Gibbs said Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''

Gillespie , a former aide to President George W. Bush and former chairman of the Republican National Committee , said using the raid for political purposes is one of the reasons Obama has `` become one of the most divisive presidents in American history . ''

`` He took something that was a unifying event for all Americans , and he 's managed to turn it into a divisive , partisan political attack , '' Gillespie said in a separate interview on the same NBC program . `` I think most Americans will see it as a sign of a desperate campaign . ''

The day Osama bin Laden died

Arizona Sen. John McCain , Obama 's 2008 opponent , called the minute-long spot `` a cheap political attack ad . ''

White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan avoided politics and praised the president 's decision-making skills on the talk shows and in an address Monday at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars .

`` One year ago today , President Obama faced the scenario that he discussed here at the Wilson Center five years ago , and he did not hesitate to act , '' he said .

`` The death of bin Laden was our most strategic blow yet against al Qaeda , '' Brennan said . `` Credit for that success belongs to the courageous forces who carried out that mission , at extraordinary risk to their lives ; to the many intelligence professionals who pieced together the clues that led to bin Laden 's hideout ; and to President Obama , who gave the order to go in . ''

Vice President Joe Biden previewed the theme in a Thursday campaign-style address .

`` If you are looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how President Obama has handled what we inherited , it 's pretty simple : Osama bin Laden is dead , and General Motors is alive , '' he said during a speech at New York University .

Clinton appeared in a fundraiser with Obama on Sunday night , characterizing Romney as `` an opponent who basically wants to do what they did before -- on steroids . Which will get you the same consequences you got before -- on steroids . ''

Obama will pick up the message with what the campaign has billed as his re-election kick-off Saturday . He is expected to attend campaign rallies in Columbus , Ohio , and Richmond , Virginia , two likely battleground states in the November election .

He cited Ronald Reagan on Monday as he rallied building trade union members , trying to draw a distinction between the conservative icon and the Republican Party that the president is running against now .

`` Ronald Reagan once said that rebuilding our infrastructure is common sense ; an investment in tomorrow that we need to make today , '' Obama told the Building and Construction Trades Department Legislative Conference . `` Ronald Reagan said that -- that great socialist Ronald Reagan said that . Could n't get through a Republican primary these days . ''

Biden will attend campaign events in Missouri and Indiana on Monday and in Washington on Thursday .

Obama 's campaign manager , Jim Messina , said that Saturday will mark the end of the Republican `` monologue . ''

Romney 's campaign , meanwhile , announced that its candidate will mark the anniversary of the bin Laden raid in an event with former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who was dubbed `` America 's mayor '' for his response in the days after bin Laden 's 9/11 attacks against the U.S.

Romney 's Jimmy Carter comments came at an event in New Hampshire with Sen. Kelly Ayotte , another of those believed to be on Romney 's vice president candidate search list . The freshman senator was an early backer of Romney 's and appeared with him repeatedly on the stump ahead of her state 's primary .

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida got the VP scrutiny treatment last week when he appeared with Romney in Pennsylvania . Many political observers see Rubio as the favorite for Romney 's vice presidential pick , given his ties to the swing state of Florida , the Hispanic community -LRB- he is the son of Cuban immigrants -RRB- and members of the grassroots tea party movement .

Rubio was one of three potential candidates mentioned by House Speaker John Boehner in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' Boehner said there is a `` long list '' of qualified candidates for the GOP ticket , including Rubio , Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana , all of whom fit his criteria that the pick be capable of serving as president .

Romney will spend much of the coming week fundraising , with events in Pennsylvania and Virginia . He is expected to meet with former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum on Friday , a long-awaited rendezvous , given that the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania has yet to endorse his party 's presumptive nominee .

Santorum danced around the issue last week with CNN 's Piers Morgan during his first televised interview since he suspended his candidacy on April 10 .

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is expected to announce the suspension of his campaign Wednesday , at which point he will back Romney , sources told CNN .
