-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Teenage sensation Lydia Ko followed up her record-breaking round of 10-under-par on day one of the Women 's Australian Open with a score of 69 , but it was n't enough to retain the overall lead .

Colombian Mariajo Uribe , whose round of nine-under on Thursday was overshadowed by her 15-year-old rival , again kept a bogey off her card as a 67 took her one shot clear on 15-under .

Korean World No. 7 Jiyai Shin is hot on the heels of Uribe , her round of six-under drawing her level with Ko on 14-under as the trio gear up for a battle in Canberra over the weekend .

`` I went out just wanting to get in the competition more , after two months without playing , so it was a fun round , '' Uribe told the tournament 's official website .

`` I made good putts , took advantage of the opportunities and the same thing I did today . So I feel pretty good .

`` It 's funny because the tournaments I play better are the ones that I 'm rusty or that I 'm not hitting the ball that well . I think I come in with low expectations and things kind of happen .

`` I believe in things that are meant to be and I feel it 's meant to be for me to play good this week . Hopefully it stays like that for the weekend . ''

It is the first time Uribe has led a tournament at the half way stage but she said she was comfortable with the expectation that brings : `` I 'm not the type of player who gets nervous . I love pressure . That 's when I play better , usually . ''

It was perhaps inevitable Ko would n't be able to repeat her heroics from day one but a steady round of four-under means she is well placed to launch an attack to claim the fourth tournament victory of her fledgling career .

`` I think four-under is a pretty good score out there . I mean , it 's not an easy golf course . I 'm pretty sure it is a pretty good score for me , '' she said .

`` I mean at some points , because my putting was so good yesterday when it did n't go in I was a little disappointed but I think I putted well out there and played well . ''
