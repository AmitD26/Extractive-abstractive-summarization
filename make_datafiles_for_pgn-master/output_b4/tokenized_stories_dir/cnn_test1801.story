-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Typhoon Sanba was aiming squarely at South Korea early Sunday after passing over the Japanese island of Okinawa , according to regional forecasters .

It made landfall in northeastern Okinawa around 6:30 a.m. Sunday -LRB- 5:30 p.m. ET Saturday -RRB- with an eye that was nearly half the island 's length .

There were no immediate reports of damage .

As of 9:50 p.m. ET , Samba was moving to the north at 30 kph -LRB- 18 mph -RRB- , the Japan Meteorological Association said .

The storm has maximum sustained winds of estimated winds of 194 kph -LRB- 120 mph -RRB- and gusts nearing 241 kph -LRB- 149 mph -RRB- , according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center , the U.S. military agency responsible for issuing tropical storm warnings in the Pacific Ocean .

Sanba is on track to make a direct hit on South Korea in a couple of days , the Korean Meteorological Association predicted , before moving up the Chinese coast .

People in Okinawa and along the rest of the Ryukyu Island chain took serious precautions ahead of the storm .

The infrastructure on the island is designed to withstand powerful storms , since the island is in an area of the western Pacific Ocean where typhoons are frequent . But storm surge could prove to be a problem for residents .

`` It 's a large storm , and it 's going to have a fairly wide-reaching effect , '' CNN International weather anchor Jenny Harrison said .

In the city of Ginowan in southern Okinawa on Saturday afternoon , skies were gray with dark clouds in the distance , according to video from CNN iReporter Kathryn Spoor .

Even though it had weakened since Friday when it was briefly classified as a super typhoon , Sanba now has the same intensity as a Category 3 hurricane , meteorologists say .

A Category 3 , on a scale of 1 to 5 , is a major hurricane with winds ranging from 111 to 129 mph .

The storm is expected to have a far-reaching effect . It could cause serious flooding in the Philippine capital of Manila , for instance .

Sanba is forecast to make a second landfall in mainland South Korea around noon local time Monday . It could also strike southern mainland Japan .

Last month , Typhoon Bolaven killed more than 60 people on the Korean peninsula . Bolaven had also swept over Okinawa , which escaped relatively unscathed .
