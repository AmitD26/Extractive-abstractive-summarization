-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A U.S. team led by envoy Robert King left North Korea on Saturday after winning the release of an American citizen who had been detained there , state media reported .

The KCNA report did not say whether the team left with Eddie Yong Su Jun. .

Jun , a Korean-American businessman , was detained for `` committing a crime '' against North Korea after entering the country , KCNA had reported .

Jun admitted his crime during an investigation , the North Korean news agency said , but it did not specify what crime he had allegedly committed .

His release follows a visit by King , the special envoy for North Korean human rights , and Jon Brause , from the U.S. Agency for International Development . The group went there to assess food shortages that have left thousands starving after floods and harsh weather devastated North Korea 's crops .

King and Brause `` expressed regret at the incident on behalf of the U.S. government and assured that it would make all its efforts to prevent the recurrence of similar incident , '' KCNA said .

The news agency also said former President Jimmy Carter asked North Korea to pardon Jun. .

`` Taking all this into account , the ... government decided to set him free from the humanitarian '' standpoint , KCNA said .

`` We welcome North Korea 's decision to release Eddie Jun , '' said State Department spokesman Mark Toner . He added that King was able to visit Jun on Thursday , and that it was the Swedish Embassy , which represents U.S. interests in North Korea , that confirmed the impending release to the American government Friday .

In King 's discussions with his North Korean interlocutors , Toner said , King conveyed deep concern over the welfare of an American citizen in their custody , but said the purpose of King 's visit was not related to the release of Jun. .

`` It 's important to note and to clearly state that any decisions about food aid are not related in any way to any policy decisions if you will . It 's a separate process all together , '' Toner said Friday .

The assessment team traveling with King will continue its work on the ground and `` when they come back , we will look at their assessments , study it and compare to other assessments by other NGOs , '' and groups that have made similar trips , to make a decision on the amount of aid to extend , Toner said .

Though he could not reveal a total readout of Jun 's current physical condition due to privacy concerns , Toner said it was his understanding that Jun was in `` decent '' health . The Swedish government had ongoing access to Jun during his detention , Toner said .

It was not known exactly when Jun would leave North Korea , but Toner said he would not be traveling with King .

While the United States praised the North for its action , the two countries are still a long way from normalizing relations .

`` There are a number of things we would like to see North Korea do in improving relations with South Korea first and foremost before we see other steps on other issues , '' Toner said .

Tensions between North Korea and the West have spiked in recent years due in part to concerns over Pyongyang 's nuclear development program .

The United States and South Korea held joint military drills in February , despite North Korea 's warning to the South not to carry them out -- calling the exercises a provocation .

South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010 , killing 46 sailors .

In November , North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island , killing two South Korean marines and two civilians . That same month , it detained Jun. .

Two State Department officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details , told CNN in April that Jun was a Korean-American businessman who had a visa to enter North Korea .

The U.S. suspended aid two years ago to North Korea because it suspected the donated food was being diverted to the military or not reaching those most in need .

North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years , increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington .

In 2010 , Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes , a U.S. citizen who was fined about $ 600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea . Gomes , who attempted suicide while in North Korean custody , was thought to be a Christian activist .

Two American journalists , Laura Ling and Euna Lee , were arrested after entering North Korea in 2009 . They were sentenced to 12 years hard labor before being released in August 2009 after an intervention by former President Bill Clinton .
