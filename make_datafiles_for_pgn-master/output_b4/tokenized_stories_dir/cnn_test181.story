-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez had a `` consulting relationship '' with a Florida anti-aging clinic accused of providing banned drugs to baseball players , but there 's no evidence he did anything to violate baseball 's Joint Drug Agreement , one of his attorneys told CNN Monday .

Rodriguez is appealing a 211-game suspension that Major League Baseball levied against him this month , with the league accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs and having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis clinic .

Attorney Joe Tacopina said Rodriguez was one of many athletes who consulted for Biogenesis .

`` Clearly there was a relationship -- a consulting relationship , '' Tacopina said . `` I mean , Biogenesis , that lab has consulted with many professional athletes . Not every single one of those athletes has been accused of or found guilty of using illegal substances . ''

Tacopina declined to give further details about the relationship , citing confidentiality concerns . But he said , `` They have no scientific evidence to prove that Alex Rodriguez did anything to violate '' baseball 's drug agreement .

`` It 's witness testimony from one witness -- a witness who 's not going to be available , in my prediction , to either testify in arbitration or at some federal proceeding , '' he said .

Opinion : How A-Rod let us down

When asked why he would n't say unequivocally that Rodriguez did n't use performance-enhancing drugs , Tacopina again cited confidentiality considerations .

`` If I utter those words , I 've just violated the confidentiality clause of the JDA -- that 's the bottom line , '' he said . '' ... If you 're a supporter or a detractor , what happened to him is not fair by anyone 's standards . It 's clearly a vendetta , it 's clearly a witch hunt to get him 211 games -- not justifiable under anyone 's scenario that is being objective . ''

Alex Rodriguez : ` I 'm fighting for my life '

Apparently in response to comments like these , Rob Manfred , Major League Baseball 's executive vice president of economics and league affairs , sent Tacopina a letter on Monday , offering to waive confidentiality provisions .

`` While we believe that your public comments are already in breach of the confidentiality provisions of Major League Baseball 's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program -LRB- the `` Program '' -RRB- , we will agree to waive those provisions as they apply to both Rodriguez and the Office of Commissioner of Baseball with respect to Rodriguez 's entire history under the Program , including , but not limited to , his testing history , test results , violations of the Program , and all information and evidence relating to Rodriguez 's treatment by Anthony Bosch , Anthony Galea and Victor Conte , '' he wrote .

Tejada suspended 105 games

Tacopina was not immediately available to comment on the contents of the letter .

Rodriguez is playing during the appeal , which the players ' union filed on his behalf two days after the suspension was announced .
