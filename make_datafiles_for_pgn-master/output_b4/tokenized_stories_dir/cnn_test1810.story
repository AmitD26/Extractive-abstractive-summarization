-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Carlos Tevez scored twice against his former club as Manchester City claimed a 2-1 derby triumph over bitter rivals Manchester United in the first leg of the English League Cup semifinal on Tuesday night .

The Argentina forward , who left United in acrimonious circumstances after rejecting a new contract at the end of last season , scored in either half to give new manager Roberto Mancini victory over Alex Ferguson in his first derby in charge .

Veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs put United ahead in the 17th minute at City 's Eastlands Stadium with his first goal in a Manchester derby since 1996 , but Tevez leveled from the penalty spot three minutes before halftime and headed the winner in the 65th minute .

Mancini took off the man of the match with just over 10 minutes to play , and City had to hold on as United surged forward in search of a second away goal ahead of the second leg at Old Trafford on Wednesday next week .

Ferguson field an almost full-strength team for the first time this season in the tournament , which offers a Europa League place for the winners , but the continued absence of injured first-choice central defenders Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic was apparent in both City goals .

Fullback Rafael da Silva was ruled to have twice pulled back Craig Bellamy , the second time inside the area and with seemingly little contact made , as the City striker took advantage of his young opponent 's lack of experience .

Tevez blasted the ball into the net for his 12th goal in 11 games despite gamesmanship from his former teammates Wayne Rooney and goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar , who was booked for delaying the spot-kick .

Wes Brown and Jonny Evans were then caught out of position as United failed to properly clear a corner , allowing Tevez to dive in with a predatory close-range header from Vincent Kompany 's clever hooked cross .

Mancini , who left Brazil star Robinho on the bench after putting him on and then taking him off again during Saturday 's defeat by Everton , also had an inexperienced defensive line-up as he started with Dedryck Boyata .

The 18-year-old Belgian made only his third first-team appearance for City , and could do nothing as goalkeeper Shay Given 's reflex save from Rooney 's close-range flick hit his arm and fell into the path of Giggs , who made no mistake to put United ahead .

Boyata then got in the way of a goal-bound header from central defensive partner Micah Richards later in the first half , and looked a distraught figure when he was finally substituted in the 77th minute .

His replacement Nedum Onuoha made a vital contribution as United peppered the City goal , clearing United substitute Michael Owen 's scuffed shot off the line with Given grounded after doing well to deny Rooney .

Given tipped over another Rooney effort after the England striker jinked into the penalty area with ease , and winger Antonio Valencia should have put Patrice Evra 's cross into the net in the 87th minute as he appeared to be distracted by a potential collision with a goalpost -- though replays suggested he was offside anyway .

In time added on , Given again got down well to gather a Rooney shot which looked destined to hit the woodwork as City held on for a famous win .

Aston Villa take a 1-0 lead into the home second leg of their semifinal against Blackburn this Wednesday .
