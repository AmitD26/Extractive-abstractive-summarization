Beijing -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Xi Jinping was named China 's president Thursday by the country 's parliament , one of the final steps in China 's once-in-a-decade leadership change .

Four months after taking over as General Secretary of the Communist Party , Xi replaces outgoing leader Hu Jintao after a formal vote of about 3,000 deputies at the National People 's Congress -LRB- NPC -RRB- .

The vote , largely a rubber stamp that completes the highly choreographed leadership transition , was unanimous .

Li Keqiang will become premier , replacing Wen Jiabao who stands aside as part of the leadership overhaul , which will see the traditionally nine-member Politburo Standing Committee shrink to seven .

Xi was also named chairman of the state Central Military Commission . `` He has had a stronger military relationship than either of his two predecessors -- Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao -- when they began , so Xi comes in with a really strong position and he needs it , '' Robert Lawrence Kuhn , author of `` How China 's Leaders Think , '' told CNN .

`` We could go through a whole list of problems from the structure of the economy as well as the social issues : Health care , housing , education and pollution and retirement and food safety , '' Kuhn added . `` All of these things are all bubbling up together -- and with a billion cell phones in China , everybody knows it , so he 's on the spot . ''

Opening the NPC last week , Wen urged delegates to `` unite as one and work hard to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , '' according to state-run news agency Xinhua .

PROFILES : China 's new leaders

Since the congress convened March 5 , thousands of Chinese officials have held a series of meetings to discuss the structure of state departments and future targets . The NPC concludes Sunday .

On the first day , Wen announced the country was aiming for an annual growth rate this year of 7.5 % . Efforts would be made to keep consumer price inflation at around 3.5 % . And , nine million new jobs would be created with the intention of keeping urban unemployment at no more than 4.6 % .

During the NPC , it was announced Beijing would strengthen the powers of the State Food and Drug Administration in the wake of widespread health concerns over food safety , such as tainted milk and baby formula scandals , according to Xinhua .

The issue of water quality also became clear during the congress , with the discovery of nearly 6,000 pigs in a Shanghai river , raising local concerns about the safety of the city 's drinking water .

This winter has seen its worst pollution in living memory , angering a population already jaded by a series of high-profile corruption scandals -- including the downfall of the once high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- that have tainted the reputation of the party .

In a speech published by the People 's Daily earlier this month , Xi warned that China faced many risks and challenges , saying that the party 's future was at stake .

The NPC also approved the restructuring of several ministries under the State Council .

The two agencies that regulate and censor media -- the State Administration of Radio , Film and Television and the General Administration of Press and Publication -- will be merged , as will the Health Ministry and the National Population and Family Planning Commission , Xinhua reported .
