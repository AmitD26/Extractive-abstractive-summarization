-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Coming soon to your TV : a high-stakes recipe contest for home cooks , a giant boxing glove that knocks players into icy water and challenges carried out entirely in the dark .

Maybe .

These are a few of the television formats for sale next week at MipTV , the world 's largest marketplace for TV programming , held in Cannes , France .

Beginning Sunday and for the next three days , about 12,000 attendees will examine the formats and programs of more than 1,200 TV producers , up 25 % from last year . For the smart TV executive , it 's a chance to find ratings gold .

Some of America 's most popular TV shows , including `` American Idol , '' `` Dancing With the Stars , '' `` Big Brother , '' `` The Voice '' and `` America 's Got Talent , '' started out as formats sold to networks after they proved successful in other countries . In addition to the structure of the show , the format seller provides the know-how , helping buyers adapt the program to the unique characteristics of viewers in each country .

It 's a business that 's been growing since 1951 when `` What 's My Line ? '' on CBS was sold to the BBC . And it 's gotten bigger every year .

`` I think in these times when there is pressure on budgets , people rely on alternative formats because they know they 're getting well thought-out programs that have proven their worth in a number of territories , '' said Trish Kinane , president of worldwide entertainment for London-based FremantleMedia , a world leader in format sales .

FremantleMedia has a huge catalog of TV formats for sale , but at MipTV it will shine a spotlight on `` Recipe to Riches , '' a Canadian production . In that show , home cooks prepare their favorite recipes in a designated category , such as appetizers one week or entrees the next . The day after each show , the winning food item is featured in supermarkets across the country . Shoppers buy and taste the items and then vote for the best one overall .

`` It 's not just a traditional cooking show , '' Kinane said . `` In Canada , of the top 10 products over the last 10 years , four have come as a result of this show . ''

Another show on FremantleMedia 's menu is `` The Boxing Glove , '' developed by Fuji Television in Japan . Here , contestants stand above a pool of icy water . An enormous boxing glove swings slowly toward them . A TV monitor in the glove shows a question . A correct answer brings the glove to a stop .

In `` Total Blackout , '' contestants are put in a completely dark room and play games , including trying to identify items by touch . The Syfy cable network already bought the show for the United States and will premiere its American version on April 25 with Jaleel White as host .

The event also gives U.S.-based shows a shot at the international market . In a press release , cable network A&E touted `` 450 hours of new programming for international broadcasters . ''

`` A+E Networks comes to MIP TV with a newly expanded sales staff and a dynamic programming catalog that features some of the highest - -LRB- rated -RRB- series and formats on U.S. pay TV , '' Marielle Zuccarelli , managing director for A&E Networks international content distribution , said in the release . `` Our lineup is headlined by the epic mega-doc , ` Mankind : The Story of All of Us , ' and our hit formats will feature high on the agenda as we aggressively ramp up this area of our business and roll out some of our latest productions . ''

Game and reality shows have had the greatest success at MipTV , but nothing is guaranteed . The CW 's dating show , `` Farmer Wants a Wife , '' and the NBC quiz show `` The Weakest Link '' failed to win big ratings in the United States despite becoming hits elsewhere .

Comedy and drama formats also are for sale . Over the years , some of America 's most beloved scripted shows were conceived elsewhere , then adapted for U.S. viewers . `` Till Death Us Do Part '' became `` All in the Family , '' `` Steptoe and Son '' transformed into `` Sanford and Son '' and `` Man About the House '' turned into `` Three 's Company . ''

More recently , `` The Office '' was successfully adapted from the British original and gave NBC a hit . Other recent attempts have n't worked out as well . Examples of flops include `` Prime Suspect , '' `` Life on Mars , '' `` Wild at Heart , '' `` Life Is Wild , '' `` Kath & Kim , '' `` Eleventh Hour , '' `` Coupling '' and `` Blackpool '' -LRB- which became `` Viva Laughlin '' -RRB- .

`` Comedy is very much of its time and often is dependent on the character and the performer , '' Kinane said . `` It 's about the zeitgeist . I think comedies will work in the short term , but they 're not going to be like ` The Price Is Right . ' ''

Kinane predicted that interactive shows , such as `` Recipe to Riches , '' where viewers can watch a show and then eat the food the next day , will start a trend among TV format producers . `` Viewers love being involved , and this is just going one step further , '' she said .

Of course , such shows must be taped long before they are aired . `` It takes seven months for the supermarket to get the product in stores , '' she said .
