Jafar 's account comes a day after what may be the deadliest day yet in Syria 's 21-month civil war , according to opposition figures .

Lakhdar Brahimi , the joint U.N.-Arab League envoy , gave a dire warning Sunday on the rapidly deteriorating situation in Syria .

`` If nearly 50,000 people have been killed in about two years , do not expect just 25,000 people to die next year -- maybe 100,000 will die , '' he told reporters in Cairo .

`` The pace is increasing , '' he said .

`` A solution is still possible , but it is only getting more complicated every day , '' Brahimi added . `` Had we dealt more carefully with this conflict in 2011 , it would have been much easier to resolve it . There is no question that it is much harder today . ''

Traveling heavily in hopes of brokering a halt to the war , Brahimi said last week he is pinning his hopes on the formation of a transitional government in Damascus that would hold power until an election .

At least 397 people were killed across the country Saturday , the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said . At least 143 deaths were reported Sunday , including 10 children .

The LCC said Saturday 's death toll included more than 200 people who were captured and `` field executed '' by Syrian soldiers in the Homs suburb of Deir Baalbeh after Syrian forces won a battle there .

The group 's representative in Deir Baalbeh said he could only personally account for 27 deaths , but said a Syrian soldier who had been captured by rebels said government forces killed at least 200 people in the suburb .

The group posted video of several men 's bodies lined up in a grassy field with wounds to the head , in what it claimed was footage taken by witnesses .

Jafar said he believes Deir Baalbeh was targeted `` because it is the main gate to reach the Khaldiya neighborhood , which has been under the control of the rebels . ''

Syrian state-run TV confirmed there was conflict in the area but said that government forces had been chasing down `` terrorists . '' News footage showed bodies that appeared to have been dragged across the floor in a building , leaving long trails of blood behind .

The news report said forces had killed `` several terrorists '' in the Deir Baalbeh area . The government frequently refers to rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad as `` terrorists . ''

But another opposition activist in Homs , Hadi Abdallah , said the situation in nearby Deir Baalbeh `` is only turning from bad to worse . ''

`` Smoke is rising from Deir Baalbeh this morning , and a stench is coming out of some of its streets due to the burning of some corpses by the regime forces , '' Abdallah said Sunday .

`` What is noticeable in the bodies we found yesterday and today in Deir Baalbeh is that they appear to have been slaughtered at the neck and then burned , including women and children . Others appear to have been killed from knife and bullet wounds . ''
