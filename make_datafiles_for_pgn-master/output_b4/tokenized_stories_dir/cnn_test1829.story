-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Man , you give the guy a seat on the `` America 's Got Talent '' judging panel and suddenly , he thinks he should take over everything .

On his radio show this morning on Sirius XM , Stern casually mentioned how he 's going to `` take over The Tonight Show '' when addressing the public drubbing that Matt Lauer has received over Ann Curry 's departure last summer .

Stern also refers to how Bob Greenblatt â € '' NBC 's Entertainment Chairman â € '' told him how he 's `` got to take over the show . '' -LRB- To hear the exchange , click here -RRB- .

An insider told EW that no such talks are happening â € '' which makes sense , considering how Leno continues to dominate at 11:30 p.m. .

During the February sweeps , The Tonight Show beat Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Late Show with David Letterman among adults 18-49 -LRB- 1.003 million versus Letterman 's 920,000 and Kimmel 's 898,000 -RRB- and attracted a bigger audience -LRB- 3.5 million viewers versus Letterman 's 3.2 million and Kimmel 's 2.5 million -RRB- . Still , rumors persist about a possible succession plan in 2014 that would involve Jimmy Fallon assuming the 11:30 p.m. time slot .

` Enlightened ' canceled by HBO

Stern likes to talk trash about Leno . Last August , Stern claimed that reports about Leno taking a pay cut to limit staff reductions was not the entire truth . `` Jay wanted to cut staff . He 's embarrassed to do it . He did n't want to come off as a bad guy .

NBC took the hit for him , because they 're a corporation ... My bullsh-t meter is going off all over the place , '' he said . Stern also said he 's been `` feuding '' with Leno for years .
