-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Some die-hard fans are getting all wrapped up in a campaign to defend Paula Deen .

They 're sending cleaned and origami-folded butter wrappers to Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author in the wake of allegations of racism and sexual harassment . Deen later admitted to `` of course '' using the n-word . The wrappers are intended as signs of protest -- physical declarations of `` we 're sticking with Paula . ''

John Schmitt , a hotel night auditor in Indianapolis and the man behind the campaign , says he could n't abide by the `` betrayal '' of Food Network , QVC and others . He felt he had to do something to express his disgust at the situation .

`` She made a mistake 20 years ago , '' he says . `` We all make mistakes . I 've said things I regret . ''

First , he thought about mailing actual sticks of butter . Then he considered two things : the waste of butter -LRB- something true Deen fans could never forgive -RRB- , and the physical ickiness of envelopes steeped in melted butter .

He opted for an empty wrapper on which he wrote in black block letters : `` Where is Paula ? '' and began cooking up a plan .

Deen critics say credit is past due

Wrapping things up

Schmitt created the Facebook page , `` We Support Paula Deen , '' on June 21 and announced the butter wrapper campaign the following week after Deen 's now-famous interview with `` Today '' anchor Matt Lauer .

`` People on the page are a lot like me , '' he says . `` They support Paula and who she is as a person . ''

Schmitt and many others say they have sent wrappers to Food Network , the QVC , Wal-Mart , Ballantine Books and other companies that have dropped Deen . Food Network , QVC , Wal-Mart and Smithfield Foods declined to comment .

The idea for the butter wrapper campaign arose from Schmitt 's desire to do something `` tangible '' as a show of support for Paula , something beyond Facebook posts .

Opinion : Half-baked apology is recipe for racial indigestion

Talking with iReporter Chris Ford inspired him to try something different .

`` That 's when I said , ` You know , this is actually perfect , ' '' Ford remembers . '' ` The butter itself is Paula , and these wrappers are void of butter just like these companies are void of Paula . ' And -LSB- Schmitt -RSB- said , ` My God , that 's it . That 's our slogan . ' ''

The slogan that came out of it -- `` A corporation without Paula Deen is like a butter wrapper without butter '' -- inspired countless posters to pledge their own wrappers for Paula 's benefit .

Soon the page was smothered in posts and comments from users , gushing over the cleverness of the campaign and pledging to send their own wrappers to the list of companies Schmitt had posted on the site .

`` Perhaps somebody somewhere in mail rooms is keeping track , '' Schmitt says . `` I would 've loved to see their face for the first one . Like , ` Ew , is this butter ? ' ''

Schmitt sent his in the first week of the campaign , but he has n't received a formal response yet , just `` canned answers '' from Sears and Wal-Mart . He was n't necessarily expecting one ; the campaign , he says , is more intended for self-expression than for results .

Many , like Schmitt , say they were n't expecting personalized responses from Food Network , Smithfield 's or any Deen-dropping company .

`` I sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck-a-lucks down at the Food Network probably would n't even open it , '' wrote Liz Vannah , a supporter from Connecticut , in a Facebook message . `` But I felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading , for whatever hidden-agenda-ed reason it happened , is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public . ''

Comfort food , uncomfortable topics

Paula Love-fests

Schmitt says he 's been a Paula Deen fan for years , mainly because it was something he shared with his late mother , Laura Schmitt . They both enjoyed watching the show and shared a deep belief in Deen 's `` goodness '' -- a belief that has not been shaken , even following news of Deen 's alleged racism .

`` In a lot of ways , she reminds me of my mom -- this funny , gracious lady from a different era , '' he says . `` My mom probably used that word and she was n't a racist . ''

He points to Deen 's work with the charitable Bag Lady Foundation and the sweet stories people have shared on the page as intrinsic signs of this goodness .

Joyce Dixon , a Deen fan from Claxton , Georgia , says Schmitt 's page caught her eye because of its emphasis on personal stories . She joined as fan No. 102 and later became the volunteer manager of the site .

Dixon says she believes the page grew in popularity so quickly because people were attracted to the `` lovey-doviness '' of the stories , videos and photos shared by fans . Now , the page holds regular `` Love-Fest '' nights for followers to share their Deen stories .

Dixon has been a fan of Paula Deen since 1997 , when she first visited Deen 's Lady & Sons restaurant in Savannah , and there met Deen personally .

`` She just had black hair with a bit of salt and pepper in it , '' Dixon remembers . `` She was n't a big personality or nothing . She was very involved with the customers . ''

Dixon recalls how at the end of the meal , Deen took the time to sit down at their table to ask how Dixon and her friends had enjoyed themselves , even asking if there were any items they 'd like to see on the menu .

`` That 's when she won me over : the one-on-one , the face time , '' Dixon says . `` It 's Business 101 , and she 's got it down . ''

Since then , Dixon says the characterization of Deen in the media is `` so wrong . ''

`` You know what ? They 're the ones that did this , '' Schmitt says , referring to the companies that dropped Deen . `` People -LSB- visiting those pages -RSB- were angry and upset and saw something they could get behind . ''

Paula Deen : From the frying pan to the firestorm

Sticking with Paula

Deen supporters from the page argue this `` punishment '' has gone too far . They say Deen has become a scapegoat for media attention -- and Dixon says that is why she dedicates so many hours to a mere Facebook page . She wants to correct the public 's perception of the former Food Network star .

`` It was n't about the n-word ; it was about the extortion thing , about this one crazy employee , '' Dixon says . `` My interest is in Paula 's business . To me , it 's about a self-made woman . You have to ask yourself , ` If she was a man , would this happen ? If she was from the North would this happen ? ' And you know , I do n't think it would . ''
