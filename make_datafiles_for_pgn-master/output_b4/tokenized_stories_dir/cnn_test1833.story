-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Liverpool youngster Suso has been fined $ 16,000 by the English Football Association -LRB- FA -RRB- after calling a teammate `` gay '' for getting his teeth whitened .

The 19-year-old reacted to a photo that colleague Jose Enrique had posted on social networking site Twitter that showed him having treatment on his teeth .

He posted : `` What f *** is he doing ? This guy is gay ... he does everything except play football . ''

Suso later deleted the tweet and has subsequently apologized .

Enrique defended his teammate after news of the fine emerged , saying it was just `` banter '' .

'' ` Is amazing how fa can fine my friend @suso30fernandez for a banter thing . Was just a joke ! '' Enrique posted on his own Twitter site .

Suso , who has made 13 appearances for Liverpool this season , has also been warned about his future conduct by the FA .

A statement on their website read : `` Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing Liverpool 's Jesus Fernandez Saez -LRB- Suso -RRB- has been fined Â £ 10,000 and warned as to his future conduct for a comment posted on Twitter .

`` The charge , which the player admitted and requested a paper hearing , was that he acted in a way which was improper and/or brought the game into disrepute in that the comment was posted on his Twitter account and included a reference to a person/s sexual orientation and/or disability . ''

The sanctions meted out to Suso were welcomed by the Gay Football Supporters Network , but their chair Chris Basiurski said in a statement he thought the fine should go towards the fight against discrimination .

`` We hope that it will continue to be a warning to people in the game that homophobic comments are not an acceptable form of banter and that people should take greater care when using social media .

`` However , in a time where resources to fight discrimination in football are limited , we would like to see the monies received by The FA in fines reinvested in the fight against homophobia .

`` Not only would it serve as an appropriate punishment for offences , but also provide a positive outcome , with the fines used to fund some of the important initiatives needed in the game to spread the inclusive message . ''

Suso apologized on Twitter after the FA 's verdict . He said : `` I 'm very sorry if anyone has been offended by my comments about the photo of my team-mate Jose Enrique .

`` It was only a joke between the two of us . I realize that my words were unfortunate and it was not my intention to offend anyone . I apologize again if anyone was offended . ''
