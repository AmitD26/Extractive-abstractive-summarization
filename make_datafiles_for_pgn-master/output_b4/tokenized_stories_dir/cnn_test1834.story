-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When I was a small child , I spent many afternoons on my father 's lap seeing qat being chewed in front of my eyes .

In fact , I used to innocently help my father and hand him the greenish leaves from the plastic bag that was seated right next to us . My father , like almost all men in Yemen , would spend every afternoon , every day of the week and every month of the whole year chewing qat starting from afternoon until late at night .

Now I 'm joining a campaign against this leafy narcotic because of the devastating effect it has on my country . Aside from the effect that the drug has on individuals , production of qat is using up almost a third of groundwater in a country that suffers chronic water shortages .

We are calling for a `` No Qat Day '' on April 12 , asking the government to completely ban qat from its offices .

There are several reasons that my father -- and more than 90 % of Yemeni men -- chew qat for many hours a day . Chief among these is the excitement they obtain from it and the relaxing and sociable atmosphere it generates .

Little did I know as a child the catastrophic effect it has on life in Yemen .

Chewing qat is a major cultural phenomenon in Yemen and many East African countries . It used to be socially unacceptable for women to chew qat but nowadays a great number of women chew qat . Today , almost 90 % of my female relatives chew qat . I myself have tried it once .

Qat is an integral part of Yemen 's society because of two factors . The first factor is that during qat sessions contacts are made , business deals are sealed and social and even governmental decisions are made .

The second factor is qat induces a state of euphoria and elation with feelings of increased alertness and arousal .

It contains cathinone , a natural amphetamine that in the United States is a Schedule one drug , alongside heroin and cocaine . In 1980 , the World Health Organization classified qat as a drug of abuse that can generate light to moderate psychological dependence and not necessarily addictiveness .

More alarming , qat farmers usually sprinkle pesticide residues on it , which causes cancers , liver cirrhosis and kidney disease . This destructive leaf is not only lethal for qat chewers but also for Yemen as a state .

`` Cultivated areas of qat have increased from less than 10,000 hectares in the early 1970s to 146,810 in 2008 , '' said Dr Nasser Abdullah al-Aulaqi , former Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries , in a study paper quoted in the Yemen Observer in January 2012 .

`` The gravity of the situation lies in the depletion of groundwater with qat eating up almost 30 % of the natural reserves . Qat production generated in 2008 approximately 246 billion Yemeni Rial -LRB- $ 1.1 billion -RRB- , while fruits and vegetables brought in 276 billion Yemeni Rial -LRB- $ 1.3 billion -RRB- and grains 91 billion -LRB- $ 422million -RRB- , '' he continued .

Qat is consuming a huge percentage of Yemen 's water , when many experts predict that Yemen will be the first country in the world to run out of water in the near future . Qat embodies a great threat to Yemen 's development socially , economically and environmentally .

There have been numerous campaigns to fight qat and the most recent one was created by Hind al-Eryani , a Yemeni political analyst in social media living in Lebanon .

`` This campaign is an expansion for the first campaign -LRB- No Qat Day -RRB- that occurred on January 12 . It was relatively successful . The current campaign calls for the government to ban qat from governmental facilities , '' she explains . `` Meaning , to ban employees from chewing qat at those institutions because it 's a troubling side of Yemen .

`` There is a collective neglect in Yemen to this issue when it 's threatening . Employees at governmental facilities , teachers in school , lecturers at colleges chew qat publicly and that 's awful .

`` At least we must start with those educated working people to eliminate the consumption of qat , which will assist tackling the water shortage , '' she adds .

In 1972 , Yemen 's former Prime Minister Mohsen al-Aini designed a plan to fight qat with the assistance of religious figures , saying that Qat was sinful . His attempt completely failed .

After that , there was no concrete effort from the government to fight qat . However , today there is a hope with the grass-root efforts .

Al-Eryani has tens of organizers from local civil-society organizations throughout the country that will run sessions on this issue and distribute posters to people and government employees . She also has endorsement from very influential figures , like Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkul Karman ; prominent researcher and writer Dr Azmi Bishara ; former Yemeni representative to the Arab League Abdel-Malik Mansour , and others .

Al-Eryani believes the campaign will be a success . Moreover , most of Yemen 's media outlets will cover the campaign after Ali al-Amrani , the Minister of Information officially ordered them to do so , and schools throughout the country will run activities to raise awareness about qat 's danger after Dr. Abdel-Razaq al-Ashwal , Minister of Education officially ordered them to do so .

On top of all that , Omar al-Hemyeri , a Yemeni lawyer , designed a draft for a law to be legislated at the parliament . The draft suggests passing a law that bans chewing qat from governmental facilities .

Yemenis kicked out former president Saleh from power but will they kick out qat as well ? We shall wait and see .
