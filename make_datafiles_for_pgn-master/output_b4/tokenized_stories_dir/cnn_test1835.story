Geneva , Switzerland -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sitting at the first Africa CEO Forum this week , in the heart of Geneva , I asked myself if this was the right time to open the debate on Africa 's private sector future . Was Geneva the right place ? Critics will rightly argue that this sort of event should have been held in Africa .

Over two intensive days , top African chief executive officers shared with attendees from all over the Africa , Europe and Asia , some latest trends and best practices , discussed the future of the continent 's private sector , and received awards and accolades .

Speakers such as the outspoken Sudanese-born billionaire Mo Ibrahim tried to boost the narratives of Africa 's position compared to China and India but with little solutions to offer . When I asked him why the event was not held in Accra or Johannesburg , Ibrahim replied by stating that the reasons were more infrastructural and logistical than anything else .

Paul Collier -LRB- Oxford University -RRB- , Makhtar Diop -LRB- World Bank 's Vice President for Africa -RRB- , and Donald Kaberuka -LRB- chairman of the African Development Bank -RRB- also sent some very strong messages to African CEOs by reminding them to promote Africa 's private sector .

Diop said : `` This CEO Forum reminds us that Africa needs its business leaders as never before -- to help it generate more electricity , grow more food , and create more jobs to keep growing strongly , while also improving people 's well-being through less poverty , better health and education , and more hope .

Despite the positive kick-off , the conference saw the presence of few women CEOs and panelists , which demonstrated the need to push African women into the board room . However , women like Rwandan Valentine Rugwabiza -LRB- WTO -RRB- and Wendy Luhabe from the Women Private Equity Fund , made their voices strongly heard . Lubabe stressed the need for challenging and removing bad leaders in politics and in our organizations .

`` We must not allow nepotism and tribalism to exist in our organizations , '' she said . `` We must create a culture of performance not mediocrity . ''

She added : `` It is our responsibility as Africans to build a better business environment and create talent for our people . ''

Luhabe emphasized the importance of educating the youth , as they are the future of Africa , and of creating entrepreneurs and adding vocational training to employment policies and agendas .

A recurring theme at the event was that Africa needs more champions -- the likes of Bob Collymore , CEO of Safaricom in Kenya , Thierry Tanoh , CEO of Ecobank and Tewolde Gebremariam , CEO of Ethiopian Airlines . The last two were respectively named African Company of the Year and African CEO of the Year at the Forum .

This event was extremely timely , current and relevant . Timely , because Africa 's growth has been consistent in the past decade -- almost 6 % growth per year . The global crisis in Europe is not stopping Africa 's growth .

Current , because the narratives about Africa need to change ; we are witnessing great progress in the continent and this needs to be highlighted . Relevant , because African CEOs need a platform where they can share and learn from one another .

Most of the African CEOs have never met before but share common problems . However , only time will tell what impact the event will have on the CEOs when they return home . Africa faces enormous problems . A conference in Geneva can only ever be one step towards solving them .

Good governance and transparency are still a challenge in Africa . African CEOs need to implement good procurement systems to fight corruption and leaks . They must create a culture of performance and challenge mediocrity at its core .

The forum was packed with journalists from all around the world including young African bloggers and journalists from France 's biggest newsrooms . The question we are all asking ourselves now is how can we create , maintain and retain talent in Africa ?

As the Apps4africa 2012 competition team travels to find the next tech CEO in Africa , all these questions were left unanswered at the African CEO Forum . The forum failed to talk about the youth of Africa , the Diaspora , technology hubs , and the growth of micro-economic dynamism we are seeing today .

It dramatically failed to address what development strategies African companies should employ to sustain and scale up their businesses .

CEOs did not fail by any means to demonstrate that Africa is changing and growing despite all the negatives press .

Their energy and enthusiasm were palpable . The continent is needed more than ever , they said , but I think African CEOs must start working together , trusting each other , thinking of implementing a regional integration package and finding a route for transferring solutions between African countries .

They must have a common platform where they can continue to learn from each other and share ideas . This is currently lacking .

Collaboration is imperative amongst the CEOs of Africa . After all , the only way their individual successes is to be measured and defined is how people 's lives have changed , how many jobs are created , how many people get access to information , and how much their human resources have progressed .

Let 's be honest -- Africa still faces great challenges . Investors are still reluctant to invest -- there are huge barriers . Starting a business is not always straight forward in may countries in Africa , the business ecosystem is almost non existent in many countries , we still have electricity issues , getting funding to start a business is still challenging in most parts of Africa , people are n't trained enough to execute essentials jobs , degrees gained by most African are useless or have no purpose in the job markets .

These entire impediments must be addressed . Change is imminent !
