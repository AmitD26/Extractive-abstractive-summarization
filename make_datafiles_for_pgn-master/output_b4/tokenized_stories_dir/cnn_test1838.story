-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- India made Edgbaston a home from home Sunday to beat England by five runs in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy .

After rain had reduced the allocated 50 overs per side to just 20 overs each , India successfully defended their 129 for seven score as England fell agonizingly five runs short .

Roared on by thousands of their fans , who formed the majority of the crowd at the ground in Birmingham , the reigning 50 overs world champions again showed their mettle in one-day cricket .

Chasing a moderate target , but on a worn pitch taking spin , England looked well-placed to win after a fine stand between Eoin Morgan -LRB- 33 -RRB- and Ravi Bopara -LRB- 30 -RRB- .

But paceman Ishant Sharma , who looked the weak link in the Indian attack , then struck back by claiming the pair in successive balls in the 18th over .

Two more wickets fell in the next over bowed by left arm spinner Ravi Jadeja to leave England reeling .

Tailender James Tredwell needed a six off the last ball bowled by Ravichandra Ashwin , but his desperate heave was unsuccessful .

It left India to celebrate , having gone through the eight-team tournament undefeated , while England are still waiting for a global one-day international trophy .

They have lost in the final of three World Cups and the final of the 2004 staging of the Champions Trophy in England .

They will now turn their attentions to the battle for the famous Ashes against old foes Australia -- with the first Test taking place next month .

For India , it 's another triumph under the captaincy of MS Dhoni , but victory looked unlikely after a below par batting display , only lifted by an excellent late stand from top scorer Virat Kohli -LRB- 43 -RRB- and the ever dangerous Jadeja , who was named man of the match .

Dhoni was proud his team kept their nerve at the death .

`` We handled the pressure really well . People talk about technique but the better players are the ones who respond to the pressure , '' he told Sky Sports .
