-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Serena Williams battled back from the brink of defeat to claim her 15th grand slam title and win the U.S. Open for the fourth time with a 6-2 2-6 7-5 victory over world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka on Sunday .

The American added to her 2012 Wimbledon and Olympic crowns after being pushed to the limit by the Australian Open champion , who forced the 30-year-old to drop her first set of the tournament .

`` I honestly ca n't believe I won . I was preparing my runner-up speech because she was playing so well , '' Williams said courtside after the match , which lasted two hours 18 minutes .

`` I 'm so shocked . It 's remarkable . ''

It was the first time in 17 years that the women 's final went the distance in New York , and it ended Azarenka 's run of 12 successive victories in matches lasting three sets .

`` Serena deserves to win . She showed how true a champion she is , '' Azarenka said . `` I definitely gave it all today . Stepping off this court I will have no regrets . ''

Williams won the hard-court tournament for the first time as a 17-year-old in 1999 but has not enjoyed much success since her third win in 2008 .

She lost in an ill-tempered final last year and was also fined in 2009 after being involved in another incident during her semifinal defeat .

The former world No. 1 won the opening set in just 34 minutes , as she threatened to steamroll Azarenka as she has all opponents since bouncing back from her first-round defeat at the French Open .

However , unlike in their Wimbledon semifinal clash in July , her 23-year-old opponent picked herself up and dominated the second set with some power play of her own .

Azarenka broke to lead 2-1 in the deciding set but was immediately pegged back by the fourth seed .

A break to love in the seventh game put her in the position of serving for the title at 5-4 , but Williams rallied to win the next three games and leave Azarenka in tears after missing a golden chance to win her second grand slam title .

Williams took her record in grand slam finals to 15-4 , becoming the first 30-something to win a major since Martina Navratilova at the 1987 U.S. Open , as she claimed the $ 1.9 million first prize .

It was the first time since 2002 that a woman has won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in the same year , when Williams also won the French Open .

She joined her older sister Venus and Steffi Graf as the only women to win Wimbledon , the Olympics and the U.S. Open in the same year .

It has capped a remarkable comeback for Williams , who spent almost a year out of the game following her 2010 Wimbledon triumph .

She needed surgery after cutting her foot in a freak accident at a restaurant and then suffered life-threatening complications when blood clots formed on her lungs .
