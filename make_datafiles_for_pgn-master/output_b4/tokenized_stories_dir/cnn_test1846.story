-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Internal Revenue Service has admitted that it targeted groups with `` tea party '' or `` patriot '' in their names . We 've since learned that a wider array of groups concerned about spending , debt , high taxes , government growth , the Constitution , the Bill of Rights -- basically any conservative or libertarian issue you can name -- was targeted .

President Obama said Monday that he was `` outraged '' over the IRS ' behavior . He said that those responsible should be held `` fully accountable . '' I wonder when that will happen ?

On Wednesday , the president requested and received the resignation of Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller -- but that is not enough . The executive branch has been aware of this scandal for nearly two years and now , only as a result of massive public pressure , the administration has found a scapegoat .

The president did not announce that Miller was responsible , and we still do n't know who came up with the idea to target the tea party . We have not been told whether Obama administration officials knew about the discrimination and if they allowed it to continue when they found out . Forcing out Miller is not the end of this scandal .

Holding the guilty parties accountable is just the first step . But if the handling of the attack in Benghazi , Libya , is any indication , there are no guarantees this will happen .

The IRS is under the president 's jurisdiction . He needs to fully recognize the gravity of these charges .

The IRS targeting citizens for political reasons is not simply another Washington scandal . At issue is something that strikes at the very heart of who we are as a people , what we believe as Americans and what this country has always stood for .

The First Amendment was written to protect many different types of expression . But the Founding Fathers ' primary concern -- and a first principle for every generation of Americans that followed -- was the protection of political speech . Apparently , the IRS was even targeting people who criticized how the country was being run .

Protecting citizens ' right to speak out against their government has always been an integral part of what separates us from tyrannical regimes . What the IRS did is how the KGB used to target dissidents . It is how they deal with troublemakers in China .

It is not how we treat American citizens . Our Constitution guarantees it .

This week , I introduced a Senate Resolution condemning the IRS ' actions and calling for a full investigation into how the agency infringed upon the First Amendment rights of those targeted .

Democrats put a hold on my resolution .

We have learned that some officials knew about these indiscretions long before the recent denials . We wanted to investigate to find out who knew what , when , and for how long .

We have learned that some tea party groups had unduly long wait times for tax-exempt status . Some eventually withdrew their applications out of frustration .

In my home state of Kentucky , a 9/12 group filed for 501 -LRB- c -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- status in December of 2010 . It received its first correspondence almost immediately , saying there would be a determination within 90 days .

Fourteen months later , the IRS requested answers to 30 questions with sub-bullets -- 88 total separate inquiries -- and gave only a two-week period to comply .

The Kentucky 9/12 Project 's Eric Wilson estimated that it would have taken 5,000 pages to respond .

Eventually , the IRS granted granted this group tax-exempt status -- after well over a year . We wanted to find out why they had to wait . We wanted to find out what groups , and how many , might have been victims of political discrimination .

We wanted to ask for an independent authority to investigate and seek criminal charges against those who were involved in targeting Americans for their political views . We wanted to determine if the White House was aware and failed to take action .

This is not about Republican vs. Democrat or conservative vs. liberal . It is about arrogant and unrestrained government vs. the rule of law . Imagine if the IRS had targeted liberal or progressive groups under the Bush administration . The First Amendment can not be renegotiated depending on which party holds power .

The power to tax is the power to destroy . These allegations concerning the IRS remind us yet again of the inherently destructive nature of leviathan . With Obamacare adding staff and hundreds of millions to the budget of the IRS , the new and intrusive powers granted to our nation 's revenue collection service were worrisome enough . We should use this recent abuse of power as an opportunity to rein them in .

Each congressman and senator , and even the president , took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution . It is now upon us to determine if the IRS intentionally trampled the First Amendment rights of Americans who dared to dissent .
