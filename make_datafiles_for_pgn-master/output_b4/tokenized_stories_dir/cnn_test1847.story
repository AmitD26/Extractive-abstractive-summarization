-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's time mass worker casualties stopped seeming so commonplace .

In April , a garment factory in Bangladesh collapsed , killing more than 1,100 people . The previous day , cracks had been spotted in the building 's structure . `` Despite the danger , garment workers were told to report to work , '' CNNMoney reported .

And on Monday , more than 100 people died in a fire at a poultry factory in northeastern China , not far from North Korea -- an area the Wall Street Journal says is known as `` the Iowa of China . '' Sounds wholesome , huh ? All but one of the gates to the burning building were locked during the blaze , trapping people inside , according to state and international media reports .

What 's arresting is that most China experts quoted on the disaster expressed little surprise . Many have compared this week 's fire to a similar one at a toy factory in 1993 , which killed 87 workers . In both cases , doors were locked . Workers trapped .

'' -LRB- T -RRB- he lack of proper fire safety equipment , exits and training for workers are all too commonplace in China 's factories , '' the China Labour Bulletin says in a news release .

These events should ignite international outrage .

`` What kind of country is this ? '' Wang Shoufeng asked this week . CNN reporters found him outside the charred poultry plant . His wife was among the dead , and he was `` yelling at passing vehicles and demanding answers , '' the report says .

Opinion : The bloodshed behind our cheap clothes

His screams must not go unheard -- both in China , a country that seems bent on profit at virtually any expense of human life ; and in the West , where disasters like these can seem so far away , or so unthinkable , that they do n't register in the public consciousness . There are many signs , however , that the China of today is not the China of 1993 , when the toy factory fire made headlines . It 's more difficult to hide in the age of social media , and Chinese citizens are becoming more critical of their government . That 's clear in Wang 's response and that of other victims ' family members , who reportedly gathered at the site of the fire to protest and insist on information .

Their questions -- Why were the doors locked ? Why have n't we been able to see the bodies of our family members ? -- should be answered . And I 'll hold out hope they will be , if not by the government than by a crusading citizen .

The situation reminds me of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei 's project to name the child victims of a 2008 earthquake in southwest China . When the Chinese government would n't release the names , Ai set out to gather them independently .

The result was a fitting tribute to the dead . A work of art .

In addition to gathering the names , with the help of volunteers , Ai created a wall of children 's backpacks in Germany . He called it `` Remembering . '' The 9,000 backpacks , viewed from afar , spelled out this sentence , which reportedly was spoken by a family member of a child who was killed in the earthquake .

`` She lived happily for seven years in this world . ''

The 1993 fire in China also spawned a hero : Yuying Chen . According to a post on ScienceBlogs , the woman was 15 when she survived the fire at a toy factory . She went on to become `` an internationally recognized human rights leader . ''

Will someone in China take up the cause of the new victims ?

In Bangladesh , too , there are signs the tragedy may lead to safer work conditions , but there is still much progress that needs to be made .

At least 40 companies , including Abercrombie & Fitch , H&M and Calvin Klein have signed onto an agreement called the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh . The document envisions , quite reasonably , a world `` in which no worker needs to fear fires , building collapses , or other accidents that could be prevented with reasonable health and safety measures . '' It requires safety checks and the like .

So obviously everyone signed that , right ?

Nope . Walmart and the Gap are notable standouts , according to the International Labor Rights Forum , which is organizing protests of those U.S. companies .

Walmart and Gap reportedly are working on standards of their own , which could yield progress but continues to draw criticism .

Instead of following on these issues , U.S. companies should be leading the charge for enforceable and legally binding measures that will ensure the safety of workers in all countries . Their unwillingness to do so suggests that maybe they figure these tragedies , and their victims , will be forgotten soon enough .

Prove them wrong .
