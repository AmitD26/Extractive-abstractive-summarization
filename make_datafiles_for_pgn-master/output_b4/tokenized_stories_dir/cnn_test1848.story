-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- With a budget of $ 1.6 billion a year , a global staff of 14,000 and operations in 120 countries , Jasmine Whitbread could be in charge of a multinational corporation .

In fact , she is head of the charity , Save the Children International .

As the first global chief executive of the world 's largest kids ' not-for-profit , she leads the organization with the business acumen and astute professionalism of a Fortune 500 company .

Founded at the beginning of the 19th-century by two sisters devoted to protecting children , its mission is to respond to humanitarian crises from Oklahoma to Syria .

But in the long term , the organization 's remit is centered around improving the way children are treated across the world .

`` We want to play a role as a catalyst to really challenge some of these fundamental wrongs that ca n't be allowed to continue into the 21st century , '' says Whitbread .

And with Whitbread at the helm , the charity is doing just that . In 2011 , Save the Children increased funding and expenditure by 10 % and helped 125 million children .

`` Children should n't be going to bed hungry , they should n't be missing out on a basic education , these things are not expensive , they are not hard to solve . ''

There 's no room for vague ideas of `` wanting to do good '' in a charity like Save the Children .

`` We are just trying to help here , '' she says . `` I have heard that refrain from too many organizations and too many quarters where that help is actually doing harm so , I 'm under no illusion that just the will to do something good -LRB- is -RRB- enough .

`` We 've got to be incredibly professional , we 've got to be very impartial in our work and not be drawn on one side or the other .

`` You ca n't just expect to be praised for doing good , you 've got to be running a professional organization . ''

Alongside her visits to crisis-hit countries , she has met with business leaders at the World Economic Forum -LRB- WEF -RRB- in Davos .

`` I do think it 's a business where our bottom line is children 's lives , '' says Whitbread , 49 .

`` We have to be the most efficient we can possibly be , we ca n't afford to be sloppy and just trying to do the right thing . ''

To engage with business leaders in Davos , Whitbread needs to emphasize the economic case for the charity 's work .

`` If I went around talking about children , I do n't think that I would get very far , '' she says . `` But if I talk about young people , democratic dividend or the fact that many of these countries are now emerging markets with increasingly young potential workforces , business people can relate to that . It all depends on how you pitch it . ''

WEF is not only an opportunity to make the business case for the welfare of children , but it 's also an ideal forum to strike up relations with companies keen to give back and be a part of the solution .

This includes accepting pro-bono work from the likes of Boston Consulting Group to forming corporate partnerships with Bulgari , GSK , IKEA , Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever .

Save the Children has been criticized in recent years , accused by some of being inefficient after Haiti 's 2010 earthquake .

`` If there is genuine criticism then we look at ourselves and say ` Ok , how could we be better coordinated ? How could we be more efficient ? ' ''

However , she added : `` Haiti was such a difficult place to be working with in the first place . Children were n't going to school , children were going to bed hungry before the earthquake . We did n't do a good job of managing the very high expectations that were n't going to be met .

`` We have got enrollment in school up to rates that were never the case before the earthquake , so I also think that sometimes the criticism can be unfair . ''

Whitbread grew up on the outskirts of London and -- apart from a spell volunteering in Uganda in her 20s -- she worked in business until the age of 36 .

In 1999 , she left her job with Thomson Financial and moved her young family to Senegal in west Africa to become regional director for Oxfam .

After six years with Oxfam , she made the switch to Save the Children , first as chief executive of the UK branch , and in 2010 , became the organization 's first international head .

Since taking the post , Whitbread has worked to merge much of the work of the not-for-profit 's 30 national organizations .

It is not a job that affords much rest . Just back from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone , Whitbread is about to leave for North Korea .

`` I try and keep the trips quite short because I do want to get home and spend some time with the family , '' she says .

`` One of the great things about the work that I 'm doing now is it 's appropriate to bring one of my kids along sometimes . So my daughter came with me to India , my son to China , they 've seen quite a bit of the world . ''
