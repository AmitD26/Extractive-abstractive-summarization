San Diego -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Here is an unlikely duel : It 's Jeb Bush , former Florida governor and possible 2016 GOP presidential hopeful , vs. Matt Damon , actor and activist .

The topic : School accountability measures that rely on high-stakes testing to determine which students are learning , which educators are teaching and which schools are working .

Bush supports the tests , Damon opposes them . More on how their paths crossed in a minute .

First , take it from someone who taught for four years as a substitute teacher in my old school district in Central California and who has written about education reform for more than two decades : Many educators do n't want to advertise to the world how well their students are doing academically because , from there , it 's a short walk to grading teacher performance .

That is what accountability is all about . You probably have it in your job . I have it in mine . But a lot of public school teachers want nothing to do with it .

Accountability includes the No Child Left Behind law , which set forth the radical proposition that all students should be at grade level in math and reading by 2014 . The law also broke down testing data according to race and ethnicity , so minority communities could see how well the public schools in their neighborhoods are serving their students.Ã‚

Enter Damon , whose mother , Nancy Carlsson-Paige , is a professor of early childhood education at Lesley University in Boston . Damon is himself a product of public schools , a fact that he eagerly shared with the crowd of teachers that he addressed in Washington in July 2011 as part of a protest called `` Save Our Schools . ''

The protesters had gathered because they were upset with the Obama administration , which has picked up the mantle of high-stakes testing from its predecessor through its own education reform initiative , `` Race to the Top . ''

In his remarks , Damon looked back fondly on his own educational experience while criticizing high-stakes testing and other school accountability measures .

`` As I look at my life today , '' he told the crowd , `` the things I value most about myself -- my imagination , my love of acting , my passion for writing , my love of learning , my curiosity -- all come from how I was parented and taught . And none of these qualities that I 've just mentioned -- none of these qualities that I prize so deeply , that have brought me so much joy , that have brought me so much professional success -- none of these qualities that make me who I am ... can be tested . ''

The crowd roared .

More recently , Damon -- who grew up in the Boston area but now lives in the Los Angeles area -- has opened a can of worms by recently revealing to the Guardian newspaper that , his love for the public schools notwithstanding , he made other arrangements for his own kids .

`` Sending our kids in my family to private school was a big , big , big deal , '' Damon said in the interview . `` And it was a giant family discussion . But it was a circular conversation , really , because ultimately we do n't have a choice . I mean , I pay for a private education , and I 'm trying to get the one that most matches the public education that I had , but that kind of progressive education no longer exists in the public system . ''

The public schools are not progressive enough ? In Los Angeles ? Really ?

So despite his fondness for public schools , the 42-year-old actor does n't want his children anywhere near them .

Oh , oh . This caught the attention of Jeb Bush , who last week took to Twitter to denounce Damon 's hypocrisy .

Jeb Bush -LRB- @JebBush -RRB- tweeted :

`` Matt Damon Refuses to Enroll Kids in Los Angeles Public Schools . Choice ok for Damon , why not everyone else ? ''

Fair ? You bet . Damon has long been a cheerleader for the public schools , and so the actor deserved this spanking for his self-serving `` good enough for thee , but not for me '' defense of a public school system that he and his own family have abandoned . Others have said the same thing .

Yet now it is Bush 's turn to get spanked .

The liberal media is already -- surprise -- attacking the Republican presidential contender in defense of the Hollywood celebrity . Some have even pointed out that Bush also sent his kids to private school and insisted that this makes the Republican the real hypocrite .

I do n't agree . Bush supports school choice and he practiced in his own family . Where 's the inconsistency ?

The real issue in this story is n't the personalities . It 's the policy .

It was not smart of Damon to attack high-stakes testing -- especially since his own kids , because they attend private school , do n't have to worry about how bad some of our public schools would be without the accountability measures that their daddy opposes so vehemently .
