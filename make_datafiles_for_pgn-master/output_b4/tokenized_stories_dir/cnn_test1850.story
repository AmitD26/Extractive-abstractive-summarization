-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hamdeen Sabahy , a leftist dark-horse candidate for Egypt 's presidency , is a passionate proponent for the teeming nation 's poor and an ideological devotee of the late firebrand nationalist leader Gamal Abdel Nasser .

`` I am the president of the poor , '' Sabahy told Reuters . `` I want to bring justice to those who were wrong for so long . ''

`` My campaign is for all Egyptians and especially a campaign for the poor and the alleviation of the struggle between classes , ' he said , according to the MidEast News Source .

`` As a new president for a new Egypt , my first decision will be a quick rise in salaries for most of the working citizens , either in the public or private sectors , and also aid for poor people the very first moment I am in the -LRB- presidential -RRB- palace . ''

Egyptians head to the polls beginning Wednesday for historic elections -- the first democratic vote since President Hosni Mubarak was forced from power early last year .

The charismatic candidate has unique popularity . He 's neither an Islamist nor a status-quo candidate . And , he 's the most viable candidate for idealists , liberals and revolutionaries who turned out in Tahrir Square to protest the rule and help bring about the end of Mubarak 's rule .

Sabahy identifies greatly with the revered Nasser , an Arab world hero whose nationalist and populist rhetoric reverberated on the impoverished streets of Cairo and other towns in the 1950s and 1960s .

Nasser led the 1952 overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy , touted and implemented socialist reforms , supported pan-Arab nationalism , and led a losing fight against Israel in the Six Day War .

Sabahy was born in the small town of Baltim and lived in a working-class environment there .

He first got involved in politics during his student days at Cairo University , where he expressed full-throated displeasure with Anwar Sadat , Nasser 's successor . He also opposed Mubarak , who became president after Sadat was assassinated . Over the years , he has been imprisoned for his activities .

A longtime veteran Nasserist politician and a former member of the Egyptian parliament 's lower house , Sabahy is now leader and founder of the Dignity Party .

His stirring message of economic justice , accompanied on the campaign trail by Nasserite nationalist tunes , has been well-received by citizens across society -- organized labor , youth and rights groups , academics and public figures .

One prominent supporter is noted writer Alaa El-Aswany . Another is the mother of Khalid Said -- the man beaten to death by police in Alexandria two years ago . That fatality has since become a lightning rod for human rights activists .

His campaign style is described in a McClatchy newspaper report as `` a mesmerizing force , pressing hands with Egyptians who are so accustomed to neglect from the political elites that they follow him in crowds , through trash-strewn alleyways , slack-jawed as he asks about the price of tomatoes . ''

`` He is our protector , '' said Mohamed Mowafi , a Baltim electric company worker . `` We trust Sabahy ... he 's always among us and serving us . Even when he was a member of parliament , he remained here with us . ''

Sabahy has been critical of Egypt 's relationship with Israel , even though he said he 's not going to take on the Camp David peace treaty between the countries .

McClatchy quoted Sabahy as saying he would stop `` pampering Israel '' and that he 's supportive of funding Palestinian `` resistance '' groups

`` Everything besides the peace treaty is subject to change . Israel will not enjoy the exceptional privileges it was granted before , '' Sabahy told McClatchy . `` I am not Hosni Mubarak , who paid the price of pleasing Washington through Tel Aviv . ''

The Middle East Media Research Institute -- which monitors , translates , and studies Arab , Iranian and Turkish media , schoolbooks , and religious sermons -- translated a 2005 TV interview with him espousing violence against the United States in Iraq .

`` When a weapon is pointed at the Americans , it is good , '' he said . `` Any kidnapping or slaughtering of an American in Iraq is good . ''

He called al Qaeda in Iraq , the militant group that conducted attacks against U.S. troops and Iraqi forces , a `` resistance '' group and a `` positive phenomenon . ''

Speaking in the interview on Dream 2 TV , Sabahy said , `` one must salute this organization -LRB- al Qaeda -RRB- when it kills any American soldier -- soldier , not a civilian . ''

In the present day , he has opposed an amnesty deal for military rulers if they face charges after they leave power .

`` I have no option but putting anyone who participated in the killings and attacks on protesters to fair trial , even if those are members of the ruling military council , '' Sabahy told McClatchy .

`` That 's what I call the ` fair exit ' for the military rulers , not the ` safe exit ' as some other candidates may have proposed . ''

Sabahy 's backers say their man has touched a chord with the masses and hope he gains momentum at the polls .

Aswat Masriya , a news outlet , quotes Amr Helmy , former minister of health , as saying `` Sabahy has been a true revolutionary since his college years , he also has a detailed program that has room for all types of Egyptians . ''

Abdel Haleem Kandil , a prominent columnist , said he decided to cast a ballot for Sabahy after hearing him talk `` about peasants and workers with details that shows he has a direct relation with them , something that no other candidate has . ''
