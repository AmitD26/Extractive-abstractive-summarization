-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Norway 's alleged mass killer testified on Thursday that he played video games as a way to train for a shooting spree that killed 77 people last summer . In particular , Anders Behring Breivik said at his trial that he played `` Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 '' as a means of shooting practice , according to CNN 's report .

The confessed shooter also said he once played the online game `` World of Warcraft , '' a role-playing adventure with multiple players from around the world , for as many as 16 hours a day .

For people who have long suspected that there is some link between violent video games and real-world violence , the statement offered frightening new evidence for why the video-game industry should be more strictly regulated .

Many gamers and columnists , however , rolled their eyes and collectively muttered `` here we go again . ''

`` How many times are we going to do this ? '' Paul Tassi wrote in a Forbes story , `` The idiocy of blaming video games for the Norway massacre . '' `` Really now , it 's getting absurd . ''

`` Norway Killer Played World of Warcraft , Which Probably Means Nothing At All , '' declared a headline on Time.com , which shares a parent company with CNN .

Whether shoot - 'em - up video games can incite violence has been a long-running debate among the public as well as in clinical psychology . This type of discussion tends to come up every time it 's revealed that a high-profile killer also played video games .

Perhaps the most memorable case study was the Columbine High School shooting in Colorado in 1999 , during which experts speculated about the influence of the game `` Doom '' on the teenagers who carried out that crime .

And for years , the controversial `` Grand Theft Auto '' series , in which players can kill police officers , was targeted by critics who said it glamorizes criminals and promotes violence . The makers of the game were even sued by the attorney for a convicted cop killer in Alabama , who argued the game inspired his client .

Ultimately , it seems like science should judge whether playing violent video games can lead to a propensity for violence in the real world . A number of recent studies have cast doubts about the link between video games and violence , but there 's no definitive answer .

Confusingly , a 2004 U.S. Secret Service and Department of Education report studied 24 cases of school violence and found : `` Over half of the attackers demonstrated some interest in violence , through movies , video games , books and other media . However , there was no one common type of interest in violence indicated . Instead , the attackers ' interest in violent themes took various forms . ''

The always-vocal jury of the Internet , meanwhile , rushed on Thursday to the defense of the video game industry . Here 's a breakdown of the general argument , in case you want to be supercontrarian and appropriate these points for cocktail-party conversation this weekend .

Point 1 : Lots of people play video games and do n't kill people .

`` How many subscribers do those two games have ? Several million ? And yet several million of us managed not to go bonkers with a gun , '' a commenter on my Google + page . `` Ridiculous argument . ''

Point 1.5 : Lots of people who play `` FarmVille '' do n't actually farm .

Here 's a related point : People who play other kinds of video games do n't usually -LRB- or ever -RRB- act out the things they do in the games . `` Shooters do not create real-life killers . Neither does `` FarmVille '' create real-life farmers , '' another Google + commenter said .

Point 2 : The confessed Norway killer had other apparent influences .

`` If we 're looking for Breivik 's influences and motivations , we 'd better start with xenophobia , fundamentalist Christianity and right-wing ideology before even mentioning what was in his Xbox , '' a commenter wrote on CNN 's story about the trial .

And from Lisa Smith on Google + : `` If there were no violent video games or movies , would Breivek have shrugged off writing his manifesto -LSB- on -RSB- his irrational fear of Islam ? No , then perhaps then if he 'd been unable to watch the news ? Oops , now we have to keep him from using the Internet , was that enough ? ''

Point 3 : There are lots of ways to train for a shooting spree .

From a Forbes column : `` Let 's say he did use ` Call of Duty ' to help him train in some way . So what ? That may sound callous , but let 's be real here . If he went to a gun range every single day for the past year , a place that actually trains you how to hit person-shaped targets with a real gun firing real bullets in your hands , would we be talking about how shooting ranges are to blame ?

Would we want them all closed down for fear someone else might learn how to shoot a gun and kill someone ? Some might , but they 'd be shouted down by gun rights activists , ironically many of whom would like to blame games instead . ''

Point 3.5 : And anyway , these games would be crappy for training .

`` How can ` World of Warcraft ' be considered ` training ' ? Unless he planned on looting gold and armor . Also , ` Modern Warfare ' is hardly a training tool . Too linear and unrealistic , '' another Google + commenter wrote . `` Could the ` Armed Assault ' series , with its more simulation based approach , have been more useful to create a mass murderer ? ''

Point 4 : There 's little scientific evidence to suggest video games actually make people violent .

From Time.com : `` The most up-to-date research , according to academic and TIME contributor Christopher Ferguson , ` has not found that children who play VVG -LSB- violent video games -RSB- are more violent than other kids , nor harmed in any other identifiable fashion . '

In Ferguson 's own longitudinal studies , recently published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research , he found ` no long-term link between VVG and youth aggression or dating violence . ' And Ferguson references another recent longitudinal study involving German children , published in Media Psychology , which similarly found no links between increased aggression and violent video games . ''

Point 5 : The Norway killer apparently saw `` WoW '' as a cover-up device .

I 'll add this little factoid to the pile : If you search the manifesto that 's attributed to Breivik , you 'll only find a few references to `` World of Warcraft . '' When he does mention the game , he appears to be explaining that by saying if you 're playing `` WoW '' all the time , you can stop family members and friends from questioning what you 're up to .

`` Announce to your closest friends , co-workers and family that you are pursuing a ` project ' that can at least partly justify your ` new pattern of activities ' -LRB- isolation/travel -RRB- while in the planning phase , '' the manifesto says . '' -LRB- For -RRB- example , tell them that you have started to play ` World of Warcraft ' or any other online MMO game and that you wish to focus on this for the next months/year . This ` new project ' can justify isolation and people will understand somewhat why you are not answering your phone over long periods . ''
