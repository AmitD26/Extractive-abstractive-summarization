-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Peruvian reality show has become part of a real-life crime drama as authorities investigate the slaying of a contestant who appeared on the program .

Police found Ruth Thalia Sayas Sanchez 's body Saturday , more than two months after the 19-year-old 's on-air confession that she worked in a nightclub and twice accepted money for sex .

Investigators uncovered evidence of poison in her body and signs that she was strangled , Peruvian Attorney General Jose Pelaez told reporters .

Authorities accuse her ex-boyfriend of killing her because he felt he was entitled to some of the 15,000 soles -LRB- $ 5,700 -RRB- she won on the show , according to police accounts reported by local media .

Sayas was the first contestant on `` The Value of Truth , '' which features participants answering tough questions about their personal lives in front of an audience and loved ones . Before appearing on the show , contestants are subjected to a polygraph test to verify their responses .

Pelaez said investigators were looking into the role the show could have played in Sayas ' death .

`` The investigation will determine whether there is some degree of responsibility , even though it seems to me that it would be a responsibility that would not have a causal relation , '' he told reporters .

The teen 's family has said the show did not cause her death .

`` This television program has absolutely nothing to do with it , ' said Freddy Sanchez Rojas , Sayas ' uncle .

On Sunday , the president of Peru 's Radio and Television Advisory Council cited Sayas ' death as she called on media in the South American country to more closely monitor the contents of their programs .

`` I think there is a marked tendency in our media to convert strong and difficult news into a show so everyone can see it . There is a concept of information and news that goes against the very people covered within the report , '' President Rosa Maria Alfaro said .

Facing increased scrutiny , the show 's host has said the program is not responsible for her slaying .

Criticism of the show is unfair , host Beto Ortiz said .

`` What they are doing is giving an alibi to the defenders of a soulless criminal , because they are taking away his responsibility by saying that television creates monsters , '' he said .
