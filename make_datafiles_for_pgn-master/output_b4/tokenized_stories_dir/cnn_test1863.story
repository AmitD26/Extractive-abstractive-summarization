-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As Zimbabweans awaited presidential election results , the ruling party declared victory Thursday as the opposition dismissed the vote as a `` huge farce . ''

Vote counting was under way in the election that pitted incumbent President Robert Mugabe against Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai for the third time .

Mugabe , 89 , has been at the helm since 1980 , the only president the nation has known since it gained independence from Britain . A win would extend his time in office to 38 years .

Even though the nation 's electoral commission has not released any numbers , a ruling party official claimed victory .

`` There is no doubt whatsoever that we have seen results everywhere in the country so far that ZANU-PF has won , '' said Didymus Mutasa , a party secretary .

Tsvangirai 's party called the vote `` null and void , '' alleging widespread fraud .

`` This has been a huge farce , '' Tsvangirai , 61 , said at a news conference in the capital , Harare . `` The credibility has been marred by administrative and legal violations which affect the legitimacy of its outcome . ''

He said irregularities included voter intimidation , unauthorized voter migration and lack of transparency in printing ballot boxes .

But Mutasa dismissed the fraud allegations .

`` That is stupidity . If all the leaders were as stupid as Tsvangirai , the world would be a very sad place to live in , '' he said .

Opinion : Is Zimbabwe ready for elections ?

End of coalition government

The election marks an end to an uneasy coalition government between the two leaders formed after violence marred the last poll . At least 200 people were killed and thousands were injured in post-election violence in 2008 .

Regional leaders dismissed that election as a sham and pressured Mugabe to form a power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai , which led to the tense coalition in 2009 .

Rights groups have accused the government of intimidating and beating up opposition supporters , and interfering with the polls in the latest election .

But Mugabe has denied the accusations and extended a conciliatory message to his main rival .

`` I 've got my fair share of criticisms and also dealt back rights and lefts and uppercuts . But that 's the game . Although we boxed each other , with Tsvangirai , it 's not as hostile as before . It 's all over now . We can now shake hands , '' Mugabe said .

Mugabe to West : Back off

The elections were held under a new constitution endorsed in a March referendum that limits the president to two five-year terms . Mugabe is allowed to seek another term because the rule does not apply retroactively .

Last week , he had a few words for critics of the election , especially the West .

`` Keep your pink nose out of our affairs , please , '' he said in response to criticisms from the United States on his push for elections without key reforms .

About 6.4 million voters in Zimbabwe -- half of the country 's population -- were eligible to cast their ballots , according to the electoral commission . Long lines snaked at polling stations , an indication of high voter turnout .

` Will this be the moment ? '

Citizens say this year 's election is crucial in more ways than one .

Despite the setbacks , it provides another shot at democracy .

`` We are still a young country ... our democracy is still young , '' said Nigel Mugamu , who lives in Harare . `` A lot of African countries have changed leadership at least once or twice . We have n't seen a new face . From that perspective , it 's an exciting time . Will this be the moment it will happen ? ''

Hope after hyperinflation

Mugamu said a peaceful election will boost investment , a major concern for the nation , which has tense relations with its major donors .

This is the first poll since Zimbabwe battled hyperinflation that left investors jittery and led many to abandon the country 's currency .

In 2009 , the nation introduced a 100 trillion-dollar bill that was worth about $ 300 in U.S. currency . At the time , a loaf of bread cost about 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars .

The hyperinflation forced traders to insist on international currency to hedge against losses .

Big strides

Despite widespread poverty , the nation has made major strides in its economy since then , experts say .

Since then , the nation 's gross domestic product `` has grown by an average of over 7 % and inflation has remained in the low single digits , '' the International Monetary Fund said last month . `` Government revenues have more than doubled from 16 % of GDP in 2009 to an estimated 36 % of GDP in 2012 , allowing the restoration of basic public services . ''

And as the nation returns from the brink of a crippled economy , Zimbabweans are hopeful .

`` Whoever wins , the country needs to move forward , '' said Linda Mukusha , a Harare resident .
