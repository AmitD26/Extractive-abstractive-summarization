-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Following this week 's revelation that J.K. Rowling penned a crime thriller under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith , the `` Harry Potter '' creator has joined a long line of women who have written novels under a cloak of masculinity .

While some authors choose to write under a pen name as a form of artistic expression , many female authors purposefully opt for a male pseudonym to appeal to a wider audience , says Carmela Ciuraru , author of `` Nom de plume : A -LRB- secret -RRB- history of pseudonyms '' .

`` Sadly in certain genres , it still helps to be a man -- particularly in crime or science fiction , '' Ciuraru told CNN .

`` Sometimes it 's easier to be taken seriously as a man , and J.K. Rowling is in a difficult position as her reputation means that her work ca n't be judged on merit alone , '' she adds .

With Rowling 's book `` The Cuckoo 's Calling '' climbing the charts on Amazon bestselling list , CNN takes a look at renowned female writers , past and present , who have adopted male pen names .

Louisa May Alcott -LRB- A.M. Barnard -RRB-

Best known for her seminal tale `` Little Women '' , Louisa May Alcott , spent much of her early career writing under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard .

Featuring feisty women who did not conform to the ideal of the 19th century female , her early novels `` A Long Fatal Love Chase '' and `` Pauline 's Passion and Punishment '' were hidden beneath an ambiguous pseudonym , giving Alcott the artistic license to explore different conceptions of the fairer sex without fear of disapproval .

This darker literary alter ego confronted racier themes , and was discovered more than 50 years after Alcott 's death by book dealer Leona Rostenberg in 1942 . Letters between the author and a Boston publisher in 1855 and 1856 read , `` We would like more stories from you ... and if you prefer you may use the pseudonym of A.M. Barnard or any other man 's name if you will . ''

Nora Roberts -LRB- J.D. Robb -RRB-

After a highly successful career as a novelist under her own name , Nora Roberts decided to adopt a more elusive tag for her '' ... in Death '' collection : a canon comprising of 43 published works , with three more set for release later this year .

Unlike J. K. Rowling 's quick reveal -- a mere three months after joining the literary world as Robert Galbraith -- Roberts kept her pen name under wraps until the 12th installment of her romantic thriller series .

Mary Ann Evans -LRB- George Eliot -RRB-

Famed for her novels exploring psychological realism , Mary Ann Evans -- better known to the literary world as George Eliot -- was not short of opinions on fellow female writers . Publishing an essay in 1856 entitled `` Silly Novels by Lady Novelists , '' Evans lambasted the glut of unremarkable work produced by women in the era , which she believed diminished the credibility of female writers as a whole .

It was this that spurred the `` Middlemarch '' writer on to use a male pseudonym , musing : `` By a peculiar thermometric adjustment , when a woman 's talent is at zero , journalistic approbation is at the boiling pitch ; when it attains mediocrity it is already no more than summer heat ; and if she ever reaches excellence , critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point . ''

Christina Lynch and Meg Howrey -LRB- Magnus Flyte -RRB-

`` City of Dark Magic '' came across as a rather intriguing debut novel from novice author Magnus Flyte when it was published in 2012 . But it was soon revealed that the brains behind the book were Meg Howrey , an actress and author , and Christina Lynch , a journalist and TV producer .

Citing themselves as Magnus 's ` wranglers , ' the duo maintains his existence as an mysterious enigma , even ` interviewing ' him for their blog . Explaining their decision to adopt a single fictitious name for themselves , Howrey said : `` We had both read a raft of articles talking about how men do n't buy books written by women . ''

They may have been proven correct , as their first novel has spawned a successful sequel with the male nom de plume still intact .

The Bronte sisters -LRB- Acton , Currer and Ellis Bell -RRB-

Perhaps the most successful literary dynasty of all time , Charlotte , Anne and Emily Bronte collectively produced some of the world 's best loved novels during the 19th century . Publishing works under male names beginning with the same first letter as their own , Currer , Acton and Ellis Bell produced their first offering -- a collection of poems -- in 1846 , before going on to publish individual novels shortly after .

`` Charlotte really believed in their talents , and was actually very controlling about the publication of their work , '' says Ciuraru . `` She was incredibly bold for an unmarried woman , but she was determined that they would publish as men in order to get reviews that would n't be condescending .
