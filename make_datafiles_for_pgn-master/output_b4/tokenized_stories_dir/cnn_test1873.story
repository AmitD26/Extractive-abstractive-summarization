-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The United States government on Friday released a declassified summary of why it says it believes Syria 's government used chemical weapons in an attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21 .

The report 's release came amid continuing U.S. signals of a possible military attack on Syria in response to the suspected poison gassing , which reportedly killed hundreds of people .

Here are five key points :

1 . A chemical weapons attack killed more than 1,400 people August 21

The U.S. government has preliminarily assessed that 1,429 people -- including at least 426 children -- died in the attack . The report cites `` a large body of independent sources , '' including U.S. intelligence information , accounts from medical personnel , videos , witness accounts and reports from nongovernmental organizations .

Three hospitals in the area received about 3,600 patients with `` symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure in less than three hours ... according to a highly credible international humanitarian organization , '' the report said . `` The reported symptoms were consistent with mass exposure to a nerve agent . ''

What do Syria 's neighbors think ?

The report also cites 100 videos showing bodies `` exhibiting physical signs consistent with , but not unique to , nerve agent exposure . '' Some videos show imagery `` consistent with death from chemical weapons , and inconsistent with death from small-arms , high-explosive munitions or blister agents , '' the report said .

2 . Syrian government launched rocket attack on area

Multiple intelligence streams show that the Syrians executed a rocket and artillery attack in the affected area shortly before symptoms were reported , the U.S. report said . This includes detection of rocket launches from government-controlled territory about 90 minutes before the first social media report of a chemical attack , the report said .

3 . ` High confidence ' that government behind chemicals

The report concludes `` with high confidence '' that the regime used the munitions to deliver chemical warfare agents .

Some of the points it makes :

-- Intelligence indicates Syrian chemical weapons personnel were preparing chemical munitions . They `` were operating in the Damascus suburb of ` Adra from Sunday , August 18 , until early in the morning on Wednesday , August 21 , near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons , including sarin . ''

Bergen : Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S.

-- `` We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence . ''

-- `` On the afternoon of August 21 , we have intelligence that Syrian chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations . At the same time , the regime intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical attacks occurred . ''

4 . Opposition could n't have fabricated this

`` We assess the Syrian opposition does not have the capability to fabricate all of the videos , physical symptoms verified by medical personnel and NGOs , and other information associated with this chemical attack , '' the report reads .

Why Russia , China , and Iran are standing by Syria

The report also said that it was highly unlikely that rebels executed the attack . It cited , among other things , Washington 's belief that the rebels have not used chemical weapons and have not carried out a large-scale rocket and artillery attack like the one seen August 21 .

5 . A possible reason why government would have used chemical weapons

`` The Syrian regime has initiated an effort to rid the Damascus suburbs of opposition forces using the area as a base to stage attacks against regime targets in the capital , '' the report said . `` The regime has failed to clear dozens of Damascus neighborhoods of opposition elements , including neighborhoods targeted on August 21 , despite employing nearly all of its conventional weapons systems .

`` We assess that the regime 's frustration with its inability to secure large portions of Damascus may have contributed to its decision to use chemical weapons on August 21 . ''

The report adds that Washington , to protect sources and methods , can not publicly release all available
