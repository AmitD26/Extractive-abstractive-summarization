-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The vetting process and the subsequent hiring of Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson seemed like standard procedure . But in recent days he has come under fire for the controversy surrounding his academic credentials .

A graduate of Stonehill College , Thompson earned a bachelor 's degree in accounting . But his official biography at Yahoo and Paypal , where he worked previously , says that he also has a degree in computer science . Thompson probably could have gone further and claimed he had a master 's degree in engineering and no one would have questioned it . Holding these credentials seems very plausible for someone with Thompson 's job history . And since he was a well known and successful executive , a background check was probably put on the back burner . Why ? `` Groupthink '' is a possible culprit .

The term groupthink was coined by Irving Janis in 1972 to describe ill-fated decisions like in the cases of the Bay of Pigs invasion or the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger . In these instances , small , cohesive committees engaged in flawed decision-making while being under the gun to produce a result quickly . Group members feel the need to conform and be in a consensus , despite what their gut instincts tell them .

While we do n't know all the factors that went into the vetting process of Thompson , the executive search committee that was responsible for his review may have engaged in groupthink . Fortunately , in Yahoo 's case , the only bad outcome is that jobs were lost under Thompson 's leadership .

Thompson certainly is n't the only high profile executive to have been caught in this type of scandal . Plenty have come before him and plenty will come after him .

In Thompson 's case , it turned out that he did n't even submit a resume , and that he reached out directly to Yahoo about the job . How his record got embellished is not exactly clear at this point . Whether he was in any way involved with enhancing his biography or somehow the resume mistakenly incorporated incorrect information , the firestorm over Thompson serves as food for thought about the bigger issue of embellishing one 's resume .

Resume fraud is not uncommon . It is committed to gain a competitive edge in landing a job , but the rationale that people use to justify the fraud is less clear . Some people actually perceive their lies to be 80 % truths and therefore see no problem in fudging their resume . Other job seekers may feel the exaggerated information is permissible as a way to compensate for the many hard knocks they have endured in life . The more times that false information goes undetected , the more desensitized people become to their own deception , and will likely continue with this pattern of behavior .

Research has suggested that the best predictor of one 's future behavior is one 's past behavior . The more pieces of the puzzle that a job search committee can put together about a candidate 's past , the more accurate it will be in assessing that individual .

Nowadays , with a competitive job market and fewer jobs , recruiters should take extra precautions against resume fraud . In addition to background checks and verification of credentials , the interview process is an opportune time to ferret out any falsified information .

Structured job interviews with standardized questions are ideal for determining how qualified a candidate is for a job . But employers should be just as concerned about the candidate 's characteristics , especially their level of integrity .

The unstructured employment interview -- informal questioning or conversation -- is better at revealing a candidate 's personality traits . Candidates are usually caught off guard with small talk over dinner and drinks and inadvertently end up spilling the beans . Any red flags in a candidate 's past will have a high probability of being raised if they exist .

Vetting a candidate thoroughly can sometimes be costly and time consuming , but it is worthwhile for the long-term health of the organization . I 'm sure this has been an expensive learning experience for Yahoo . Hopefully , others will take note .
