London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Somalia 's president appealed for support for his struggling country Tuesday , comparing it to a young sapling that needs help to get started .

`` We need support ; we need assistance and investment ; and we need protection from those who try to knock us over , '' President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud told delegates at a donor conference in London .

The goal , he said , is for Somalia eventually to stand strong and tall on its own , a country `` at peace with itself and its neighbors and which poses no threat to the world , '' with a thriving economy , strong values and a good education system .

`` People may ask why Somalia matters at this time but there is a huge amount at stake right now : the future of our country , the security of the region and the wider world , and the removal of the piracy stranglehold on the Gulf of Aden , '' he said .

Delegations from more than 50 nations and groups , including the United Nations , African Union and International Monetary Fund , gathered for the meeting , hosted jointly by the UK and Somali governments .

Somali ministers shared detailed plans for developing the country 's armed forces , police , justice system and public financial management , as the African nation struggles to emerge from more than two decades of conflict .

Speaking with CNN 's Nima Elbagir in the Somali capital , Mogadishu , ahead of the conference , Mohamud said Somalia needed a financial commitment , technical support and diplomatic engagement from the world .

`` We want Somalia to be treated as a normal country , '' he said . `` Unless we are treated as a normal country , Somalia will never become a normal country . That 's what we are expecting from the world . ''

Mohamud , who took office six months ago , travels in an armored convoy but says he wo n't let the al Qaeda-linked Islamist group Al-Shabaab -- responsible for many terror attacks in Somalia -- dictate what he does .

In his remarks to delegates , British Prime Minister David Cameron said Somalia 's security matters to the entire international community .

`` Why ? Because when young minds are poisoned by radicalism , and they go on to export terrorism and extremism , the security of the whole world ... is at stake , '' he said .

UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said Somalia 's people and government should be proud of the `` huge progress '' the country has made over the past year .

`` A new parliament and government have been appointed in the most representative political process in a generation , '' he said in a statement . `` Al Shabaab has lost large areas of territory . The diaspora are returning and the economy is starting to revive .

`` But this progress is fragile , and maintaining the momentum will require leadership in Somalia and support from the region and the international community . ''

Mogadishu attack

In a reminder of the security challenges facing the country , a suicide bomber on Sunday drove a car packed with explosives into a convoy carrying a Qatari delegation through the capital , killing at least eight people , authorities and witnesses said . Those killed were bystanders , authorities said , with no one in the convoy hurt .

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombing , and said six soldiers were killed and nine wounded .

AMISOM , the African Union Mission in Somalia , is playing a key role in efforts to quell the militant group .

Brigadier Michael Ondoga , of AMISOM , told CNN Tuesday that although Al-Shabaab was `` largely defeated '' in Mogadishu , there were still issues with its members `` melting into the population '' and taking advantage of the city 's large size to hide . Mogadishu covers 640 square miles , and its population includes some 300,000 internally displaced people , he said .

But Somali security forces have done a great job in pre-empting many suicide attacks and have arrested some of the Al-Shabaab operatives hiding among the capital 's population .

`` The situation is generally good at the moment -- the security forces are controlling it very well , '' Ondoga said .

`` Here in the city now , the big guns are quiet , the streets are lit , many -LRB- in the -RRB- diaspora are coming back , new construction is going on , business is booming , '' he said .

Somali and AMISOM forces have also won back territory extending a long way out from the capital , he said , leaving Al-Shabaab in control of only a few small areas in the west and some ports in the east .

`` So there is great achievement that has been made between the national security forces and AMISOM , and we hope that this continues , '' Ondoga said . `` Eventually , national security forces should be able to man the streets of this country on their own . ''

Once security is stabilized across the country , piracy should no longer be an issue in the waters around Somalia , he added , since the pirates will no longer have a base to operate from . Somali pirates have been a threat to international maritime traffic for some years .

` Culture of impunity '

International rights group Human Rights Watch called for the London conference to address `` widespread human rights abuses by all parties , '' which , it says , have been overlooked throughout the long years of conflict .

`` The failure to address these abuses and the culture of impunity in which they have taken place has contributed to ongoing conflict and insecurity , '' the group said in a statement .

`` A substantial improvement in the respect for human rights and accountability for serious abuses is now essential . ''

Delegates agreed on a package of support for Somalia on preventing sexual violence , the UK Foreign Office said . As part of this , a team of U.N. experts will deploy to Somalia in the summer .

Somalia was subject to international condemnation this year over a case in which a woman and a journalist were sentenced to prison after she told him she was raped by security forces . She was subsequently acquitted on appeal , but the journalist 's conviction was upheld , though his sentence was cut .

Somali Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said via his Twitter account that the country 's progress so far had defied the skeptics , but challenges remain .

`` With the support of our friends and partners the progress must be made unstoppable . A bright future for #Somalia is within touching distance , '' he tweeted Monday .

Somalia has lacked an effective central government since 1991 , with portions of the Horn of Africa nation left lawless .

In January , the United States granted official recognition to the new Somali government .
