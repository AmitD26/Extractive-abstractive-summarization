-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced an American citizen to 25 years in prison for conspiring to sell missiles , rifles and other weapons to the Taliban , the U.S. attorney 's office for Manhattan announced .

The sentence for Alwar Pouryan -- which includes 10 years of supervised release after he leaves prison -- comes the month after he and a co-defendant were found guilty following a two-week bench trial by U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald .

`` Alwar Pouryan was an American who was all too willing to do business with the Taliban -- agreeing to provide that narco-terrorist organization with lethal , military-grade weapons that would have put countless innocent lives at risk , '' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement .

`` The sentence handed down today is a just and appropriate penalty for an individual who so callously sold out his country . ''

According to the Bahara 's office , the 38-year-old Pouryan and his co-conspirator Oded Orbach began communicating in fall 2010 with a person they believed represented the Taliban -- but who actually worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .

In conversations by phone , e-mail , Skype and in person in Ghana , Ukraine and Romania , Pouryan and Orbach offered specifics about what types of arms they 'd sell and for how much .

The weapons discussed included anti-tank missiles , grenade launchers and M-16 assault rifles , not to mention ammunition . Pouryan and Orbach were told surface-to-air missiles were especially needed to protect Taliban-run heroin facilities in Afghanistan from U.S. helicopter attacks , according to the federal prosecutor 's office .

Evidence presented during the trial included e-mails from Orbach to third-party weapons suppliers , asking about obtaining some of the items .

After hashing out price lists and other details , the two sides reached a deal : more than $ 25 million worth in weapons , ammunition and training , of which Pouryan and Orbach would pocket $ 800,000 in commission .

Until , of course , the plot unraveled with the two American men 's February 2011 arrest in Bucharest , Romania . Pouryan and Orbach were extradited more than three months later to the United States , where they stood trial .

Five other men tied to the plot -- all of whom coordinated with the same undercover agent , some of whom worked directly with Pouryan and Orbach -- were arrested in Liberia and likewise brought to the United States .

Four of them allegedly agreed to oversee a shipment to Benin of Taliban-owned heroin , which the Taliban could profit from after it was eventually flown to the United States , the U.S. Justice Department stated in 2011 . All five consented to sell the Taliban cocaine that the Afghanistan-based Islamist group could then sell for a profit , according to the agency .

The 55-year-old Orbach , who is currently being held in New York according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons , is set to be sentenced on November 1 by Judge Buchwald .
