-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Apple is getting pushed around a lot these days . Digerati reaction to the iPhone 5 was `` meh , '' response to the iPad Mini was akin to `` it 's about time '' and we are all more excited about unicorn-like products such as an iWatch and iTV than the things you can buy right now .

Apple 's strength is its Achilles ' heel : We expect it to reinvent on schedule and when , in our infinite wisdom , we believe it is not , we treat it like the kid who no longer belongs in our clique .

Some of this is to be expected when a company with as incredible a recent track record as Apple 's seems to be resting more on its laurels than finding new battles to win . Since the quixotic introduction of the iMac in 1998 -- reinvigorating the desktop computer well into the age of portables -- Apple has been on a tear :

• The iPod -LRB- 2001 -RRB-

• The iTunes Store , allowing the purchase of single music tracks -LRB- 2003 -RRB-

• The Apple retail store -LRB- 2004 -RRB-

• The iPhone -LRB- 2007 -RRB-

• The iPad -LRB- 2010 -RRB-

And you can add to list that Steve Jobs ' revitalization of the animated feature film through his acquisition of Pixar .

That 's a lot of imagination in a very short time . Apple has n't just dominated the story for a decade : It has written the story of the past decade . That is a lot to live up to . Most companies ca n't . It 's particularly brutal for tech -LRB- as opposed to , say , shampoo -RRB- companies , which at best can usually hope to set the pace for only about generation until they settle into a comfortable middle class .

Call it the Microsoft Curve . Microsoft dominated through the red-hot '90s , the height of the PC era . It is n't going anywhere . It still prints money by selling MS-Office and Windows licenses . But look at a five-year stock price chart , and you 'll see it has gone exactly nowhere . The only people dancing for joy about owning a Windows computer seem to be in those Surface Pro TV ads .

At the bottom of the pile there is the sad tale of Palm -- the hottest tech company on the planet for far too brief a time . Palm Pilots were once everywhere . But the company stumbled by failing to recognize quickly enough that , in the age of the Internet , no one wanted a portable device that could n't get online .

How Samsung is out-innovating Apple

Another hard luck case is Research in Motion -- now BlackBerry . That company did get the portable device memo , but it spectacularly misjudged the smartphone revolution sparked by Apple .

Now Apple is this unfamiliar territory : Successful on paper , products seen everywhere , Macbooks and iPhone placed in seemingly every TV show and movie and yet ... the cool factor is cooling off .

There is a big difference between atmospherics and actuality , of course . But nobody wants to be thought of as a has-been in the making .

The lesson of tech history is that smart companies crash when they believe what they have already done is all they need to do : that doubling-down and trash-talking the competition is what it takes .

Exhibit A ? Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer himself , whose initial public reaction to the iPhone was that business customers would n't want it `` because it does n't have a keyboard , which makes it not a very good e-mail machine . ''

This would be a good time to mention that increasingly large numbers of these `` business customers '' now want an iPhone at work , challenging Microsoft at what has been its enterprise stronghold .

Apple 's search for its next billion-dollar product

Success is never assured , but it can only be extended only two ways : If you corner the market , impossible in the uberdisruptive tech space , or if you are unabashedly willing to question everything , all the time .

Facebook began life as the world 's most exclusive private social network -- only Harvard students need apply . But it became a public company worth $ 68 billion because it decided instead to become the world 's least exclusive private network .

Even Palm 's trajectory might have been different if it had inverted its thinking in time : Imagine a Palm Pilot not as a personal information manager with connectivity , but a connected device with PIM applications , and you have described exactly what the smartphone is today .

There is no reason to think Apple wo n't thrive financially for years to come , just like Microsoft . But its continued reputation as the chief arbiter of cool is being challenged . Apple may still have the best-selling smartphone in the world , but the many others powered by rival Google 's Android operating system -- and especially those made by Samsung -- far exceed the iPhone .

For years , tech writers reviewed each new smartphone on a simple grading scale : Is this the iPhone killer ? None has been , but collectively the point has been made :

No phone has killed the iPhone , but plenty of them co-exist just fine , thank you very much .

We expect the unexpected from Apple , and the company does nothing to tamp down these expectations . So when it does n't dazzle us , ennui begins to creep in . Apple is also burdened by what I called at the time the meaningless milestone of having become the biggest company ever . Where do you go from there ? You are either still the biggest , or slipping . Consolidating your lead is fine and all , but it is n't sexy .

My own prediction of Apple 's prospects is that needs to worry about becoming a mid-packer only after the CEO Tim Cook and designer Jony Ive -- the other tow members of the triumvirate headed by Steve Jobs -- are no longer with the company .

Until then , perhaps a decade from now , you bet against Apple at your own peril .
