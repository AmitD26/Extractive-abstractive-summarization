-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sir Robert Edwards , a `` co-pioneer '' of the in vitro fertilization technique and Nobel Prize winner , died Wednesday in his sleep after a long illness , the University of Cambridge said . He was 87 .

Edwards , a professor at the university and fellow of Churchill College , Cambridge , and Dr. Patrick Steptoe developed the fertility treatment , which involves fertilizing an egg outside the womb and implanting the newly created embryo inside a woman 's uterus .

Their work resulted in the birth of Louise Brown on July 25 , 1978 -- the world 's first `` test-tube baby . ''

Since then , an estimated 5 million babies have been born worldwide thanks to IVF , according to the International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies , an international nonprofit organization .

When Brown married in 2004 , Edwards attended the wedding . Steptoe died in 1988 .

Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2010 for his work in developing the technique . The next year , he was knighted `` for services to human reproductive biology , '' the university said in a statement .

Both Edwards and Steptoe faced intense publicity and criticism from those opposed to the method , including the Vatican , after Brown 's birth , according to the statement .

Could ` personhood ' bills outlaw IVF ?

`` Bob Edwards is one of our greatest scientists , '' said Mike Macnamee , chief executive of Bourn Hall , the IVF clinic Edwards and Steptoe co-founded , in the statement . `` His inspirational work in the early '60s led to a breakthrough that has enhanced the lives of millions of people worldwide . He is held in great affection by everyone who has worked with him and was treated by him . ''

Dr. Linda C. Giudice , president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine , said in a statement that Edwards `` was a great scientist whose stellar scientific work advanced our understanding of human reproduction , human embryonic stem cells , advanced pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and revolutionized the treatment of infertility .

`` We extend our condolences to his family , and his many friends around the world . ''
