-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Presidential candidate Rick Santorum is unhappy with last week 's compromise over whether Catholic institutions should be required to cover contraception for their employees , arguing that birth control `` should n't be covered by insurance at all . '' The issue , Santorum claims , is `` economic liberty . '' But in the past , he has made his real objection clear , categorizing contraception as `` a license to do things in a sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be . ''

Taken with statements Santorum made in his 2005 book , `` It Takes a Family : Conservatism and the Common Good , '' his opposition to contraception -LRB- as well as to abortion , even in the case of rape -RRB- seems part and parcel of a deep hostility toward efforts to empower women and enhance their status . He has shown nothing but contempt for what his book called the `` radical '' feminist `` pitch '' that `` men and women be given an equal opportunity to make it to the top in the workplace . '' So perhaps it 's not surprising that at the time of publication he did not list his wife as a co-author or contributor , although when asked last week about this and other comments on working mothers , he now says his wife wrote that part of the book .

Whichever member of the couple wrote the section on women , it is worth revisiting a couple of its points . Take the book 's dismissal of programs to help impoverished single mothers improve their job prospects by returning to school : `` The notion that college education is a cost-effective way to help poor , low-skill , unmarried mothers with high school diplomas or GEDs move up the economic ladder is just wrong . '' Or its claim that unnamed `` surveys '' have shown that educated professional women find it `` easier , more ` professionally ' gratifying , and certainly more socially affirming , to work outside the home than to give up their careers to take care of their children . ''

The Santorums ' apparent hostility to women 's educational and professional advancement is insulting and out of touch with today 's world . But it is also odd in light of their purported interest in the welfare of children . It turns out that the most powerful single influence on a child 's educational success is not the mother 's marital status but her own level of education and her educational aspirations for her children , according to education researcher W. Norton Grubb .

Having more education is one of the biggest predictors of women having careers . But it 's also one of the biggest predictors of women -LRB- and their husbands -RRB- doing more child care , according to a forthcoming paper by Paula England , a New York University sociologist and research fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families , and her collaborator , Anjula Srivastava . Educated mothers are much more likely to work outside the home and to return to work within a year after the birth of a child . They also tend to have fewer children than their less educated counterparts . Yet on average , they spend more time in direct interaction with their kids than less educated women .

Well-educated fathers also spend more time in child care than less-educated dads . But , interestingly , the amount of child care a man does is more directly influenced by his wife 's educational level than his own . On average , having a wife with a college degree raises a man 's participation in child care by 3Ã‚ 1/2 hours per week .

Educated parents find more time to spend with their children by reducing time dedicated to home-based activities that involve little interaction with children . They spend less time on sleep and personal grooming , less time doing housework and less time watching television than their less-educated counterparts , regardless of their employment status . This is hardly evidence that they do not find child care gratifying .

No single choice about how to organize work and family life is right or possible -- for every family . And every choice has tradeoffs . Sometimes , having a mom stay home is a big help . On the other hand , when a mother works outside the home , her husband generally does more child care and has higher parental knowledge about his childrens ' friends , routines and needs , cutting across the tendency for fathers to be second-string parents at home .

Every family must make its own , sometimes difficult , decisions about what best fits their particular needs and preferences . We do n't need politicians like Rick Santorum -- or , as he now somewhat unchivalrously claims , his wife -- making those decisions more painful by suggesting that women who choose to pursue careers are worse mothers than those who do not .
