-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forces loyal to Ivory Coast 's former leader , Laurent Gbagbo , used a lull in fighting this week as a `` trick '' to reinforce their positions around the main city of Abidjan , the head of U.N. peacekeeping operations said Friday .

Though Gbagbo 's men said Tuesday they wanted a peaceful solution to the months-long fighting in Ivory Coast , they soon restarted shelling both the U.N. headquarters and the civilian population , Alain Le Roy told reporters at the United Nations .

Forces loyal to Gbagbo have since regained control of two central areas of Abidjan and fighting is continuing , Le Roy said , after briefing the U.N. Security Council on developments in the cocoa-producing nation .

`` They have clearly used the lull of Tuesday as a trick to reinforce their position , '' he said .

Most areas of the capital , however , are now under U.N. or French military control , journalist Seyi Rhodes reported from the French military base in Port Bouet . The French military has been working to reconnect the disrupted water and electricity supply in what is the country 's main city .

Rhodes traveled with the French military through Abidjan on Friday and reported seeing civilians in the streets , including one woman selling food , which he took as a positive sign .

There appeared to be a standoff , however , outside Abidjan 's Golf Hotel , where Gbagbo 's rival and the internationally recognized president , Alassane Ouattara , is staying under U.N. protection , Rhodes reported . He said Gbagbo 's forces are outside the hotel .

Le Roy said that if that hotel comes under attack , the United Nations may have to consider using force against Gbagbo and his men .

Pro-Gbagbo forces have heavy weapons including tanks , mortars , and rocket-propelled grenades and are using them `` as we speak against the civilian population '' and U.N. headquarters , Le Roy said .

`` Those who are saying there are no more heavy weapons -- that Mr. Gbagbo has no more heavy weapons -- it 's a lie , '' he said .

Earlier , French military sources said the French ambassador 's residence in Abidjan came under attack by forces loyal to Gbagbo , but a Gbagbo spokesman said that was `` impossible '' because U.N. forces are surrounding all the ambassadors ' residences .

The spokesman , Ahoua Don Mello , said the U.N. forces fired on the state television station , which is in the same block as both the French ambassador 's residence and Gbagbo 's residence , and that they have broken the antennae .

`` The national TV station was destroyed by the last attack -LRB- two days ago -RRB- , '' Mello said . `` Right now it is still working , and the French do n't want the national TV to work any more and they are now preparing an attack . ''

Le Roy said 23 countries have requested U.N. help in moving their personnel to safer areas of Abidjan . Those countries include India , China , South Africa , the United States , Israel , Mali , and Niger .

U.N. forces also offered to relocate the 35 journalists who were at the Novotel hotel in Abidjan , he said . Many accepted the offer but some have stayed behind .

The United Nations is still hoping political dialogue will resolve the situation , said Nestor Osorio , Colombia 's ambassador and current president of the U.N. Security Council .

`` We hope that additional political actions will be taken , but still the great difficulty here is the absolute reluctance of Mr. Gbagbo to recognize the legitimacy of Mr. Ouattara , '' Osorio said Friday .

French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed his nation 's full support of Ouattara on Friday and said the situation in the country `` remains serious . ''

`` The militia paid by Gbagbo continues abuses , looting , and assassinations , '' he said . `` The population lives in very precarious conditions . Massive humanitarian aid will be needed pending the reconstruction . ''

Juppe 's words came amid a disturbing new report of the type of killings and abuses that have plagued Ivory Coast since the disputed November election .

More than 100 bodies were recovered in the past 24 hours in western Ivory Coast , the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Office said Friday .

Human rights teams found 15 more bodies in Duekoue , the cocoa-rich town where last week several agencies reported a massacre of as many as 800 people . The U.N. rights agency said that so far , 244 bodies have been recovered from that incident , the bloodiest episode yet .

The victims are believed to have been mostly or all Guerre people , who have traditionally supported Gbagbo , and some of the victims were burned alive , the United Nations said .

In the town of Blolequin , human rights investigators said , the perpetrators of killings were Liberian mercenaries who separated the Guerre from the rest and spared them from slaughter .

Le Roy said a commission of inquiry will be appointed soon to investigate the killings .

A report by Human Rights Watch , released late Friday , backed up the U.N. claims . It said forces loyal to both Ouattara and Gbagbo are responsible for `` serious abuses '' including the killing and rape of those believed to support the other side .

The report pinned most of the blame , however , on supporters of the internationally recognized president .

`` People interviewed by Human Rights Watch described how , in village after village , pro-Ouattara forces ... summarily executed and raped perceived Gbagbo supporters in their homes , as they worked in the fields , as they fled , or as they tried to hide in the bush , '' the human rights group said . `` The fighters often targeted people by ethnicity , and the attacks disproportionally affected those too old or feeble to flee . ''

The group urged Ouattara to open an investigation into abuses by both sides as soon as he takes power .

`` While the international community has been focused on the political stalemate in Abidjan over the presidency , forces on both sides have committed numerous atrocities against civilians , their leaders showing little interest in reining them in , '' said Daniel Bekele , Africa director for Human Rights Watch . `` Ouattara should send a strong message to -LRB- his forces -RRB- that such abuses will be fully punished at home or by an international tribunal . ''

Nearly 150,000 people have now fled their homes amid Ivory Coast 's war , displaced within the country or seeking refuge in neighboring nations , the U.N. refugee agency said Friday .

Refugees said they were tired , hungry and exhausted after arriving in Liberia 's Maryland County , which is along the border at the Atlantic coast . Some arrived by foot , others by canoe . Some reported seeing dead bodies along the way .

Sporadic gunfire rang out Friday in Abidjan , the nation 's largest city , where Gbagbo remained hunkered down in the basement of his residence , guarded by about 200 of his men .

Despite being surrounded by Ouattara 's troops and receiving a warning from the U.N. secretary-general that he should seize his last chance for a graceful exit , Gbagbo showed no willingness to budge .

Ouattara has blamed Gbagbo for Ivory Coast 's suffering . He told citizens this week he ordered the military and police to safeguard public places including hospitals and markets .

The November presidential election had been expected to help unify the West African nation , which is rebounding from a 2002 civil war . Instead , the disputed vote sliced the nation in two .

Sporadic post-election violence erupted into all-out war after Ouattara 's troops launched an offensive that swept through the country to Abidjan on the coast .

On Friday , at Ouattara 's request , the European Union lifted sanctions on Ivory Coast entities , including two key ports .

`` Under the measures adopted today , the ports of Abidjan and San Pedro , the Ivorian Refining Company and the Coffee and Cocoa Trade Management Committee are removed from the list of entities subject to the EU assets freeze , '' an EU statement read .
