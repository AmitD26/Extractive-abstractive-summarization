-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the first time Apple stores will soon let iPhone owners trade in their old phones for credit toward a new one , according to multiple reports .

According to Apple-centric blog MacRumors , several sources say Apple store employees are currently being trained on the new program , which could go into effect around Apple 's September 10 event , when new iPhones are expected to be introduced . That would let iPhone owners exchange their older handsets for an iPhone 5S , or whatever the new phone is called .

In June , Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources saying that Apple was working with recycling company Brightstar and that trade-ins could be refurbished by Apple and resold in emerging markets throughout the world .

During Apple 's most recent earnings call , CEO Tim Cook said he was `` not opposed '' to in-store trade-ins .

`` I see channels doing it , and I like the environmental aspect of it , and so that part of it really is encouraging to me , '' he said . The `` channels '' he referred to are third-party vendors of Apple products , such as Best Buy , AT&T and Verizon .

The blog 9to5Mac says some Apple stores , including several in Dallas , Texas , already are running a limited pilot program .

According to the reports , people who bring in an older phone , like an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S would get a gift card that could be applied to an iPhone 5 . Presumably , the 5 would be added to the list of phones that can be traded in for a discount on the next iPhone .

It 's not clear whether earlier models , such as an iPhone 3 or 3G , would be eligible for trade-ins , although given their limited resale value that seems unlikely .

Apple already has a similar mail-in rebate program . But the convenience of doing so in person , and walking out with a new phone instead of waiting for days or weeks , would be a big upgrade in terms of convenience .

If recent history is any guide , Apple 's next iPhone will go on sale in mid - to late September and will likely to be called either the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S . The company has not made an official announcement , but multiple observers expect Apple to announce the phone September 10 and begin selling it in stores about 10 days later .

The company has released a new iPhone model every year , and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall . The iPhone 5 came out in September 2012 , the iPhone 4S in October 2011 , and the three versions before that in the summer months .

The company is also rumored to be working on a cheaper version of the iPhone that would be sold in emerging markets . Other reports have speculated on features ranging from a larger , 4.7-inch display screen to a fingerprint scanner to an option to buy a gold iPhone .
