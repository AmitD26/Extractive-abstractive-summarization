-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A mortar landed near the Russian Embassy in the Syrian capital of Damascus on Thursday , killing a Syrian civilian and injuring nine Syrian security personnel who work for the diplomatic post , Russia 's foreign ministry said .

No Russians were hurt in the attack , according to the ministry , which said it was trying to determine who launched the shell .

The United States condemned the shelling .

`` The United States continues to emphasize that those responsible for atrocities on all sides must be held accountable , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement .

The death was one of dozens reported Thursday throughout Syria , plagued by civil war .

State-run media reported that the regime 's army recaptured the city of Deir Attiya from opposition militants on Thursday . The army killed an unspecified number of militants who earlier this month had taken the city , about 50 miles northeast of Damascus , the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported .

The opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported at least 55 people were killed Thursday , including 20 in Damascus and its suburbs and 10 in Raqqa .

Raqqa , in northern Syria , is where a regime-fired Scud missile hit a market a day earlier , killing about 35 people and wounding dozens of others , according to the main opposition umbrella group , the Syrian National Coalition .

The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement . It is now a full-blown civil war .

The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict , and 9 million have been displaced .

Syria plans to send a delegation to Switzerland early next year to participate in peace talks , but the opposition Free Syrian Army says it will pass . The United Nations announced that the often-delayed Geneva II conference aimed at ending the Syrian civil war starts January 22 in Geneva .

Geneva II is a successor to Geneva I , a June 2012 meeting in which international parties laid out a peace plan for Syria that calls for a transitional governing body . It left open the question of whether President Bashar al-Assad must leave power .

The United States and Russia announced in May that they would try to bring the warring parties to a second conference in Geneva to implement the plan . But the second Geneva conference has been delayed several times .
