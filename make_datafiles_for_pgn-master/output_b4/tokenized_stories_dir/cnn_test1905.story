-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I got a rather weird invitation last week . I am a Republican strategist who often takes to the CNN airwaves to criticize President Obama . When the rather official-looking e-mail arrived inviting me to share my thoughts with the president , well , let 's just say it made me highly suspicious I was getting punked .

But it was n't a joke . Apparently , President Obama 's charm offensive extends beyond Republicans in Congress to occasionally critical Republican pundits .

Last Monday , I joined a small group of U.S. Hispanic leaders in meeting with President Obama , ahead of his trip to Mexico and Costa Rica this week . Before the meeting , several friends asked me : `` Why is Obama going to Latin America ? ''

It 's a legitimate question . It 's not often that U.S. presidents travel to Latin America without the specific purpose of participating in a summit or visiting an area ravaged by a natural disaster . But it seems that President Obama 's only reason for going is to pay the region some attention , recognize the role of these countries as strategic partners of the United States and service the relationship .

Good for him . Every now and then , it 's wise to drop in on neighbors for a friendly visit -- just because . For decades , Latin America has been on the back burner and only became of interest when war or another crisis erupted . My friends there frequently tell me they feel neglected by `` TÃƒo Sam . ''

President Obama laid out a thoughtful and broad approach to the bilateral relationship with Mexico and Central America . Too often when we think of this region , we think only of problems . There are plenty of those : violence , gangs , drug trafficking , border security , corruption , political instability . But plenty of positive things can be highlighted , and it seems that is what President Obama wants to do .

The trip is intended to cast a light on economic opportunities and joint interests in commerce between the United States and Latin America , and competing globally as a united block .

He plans to give a forward-looking speech in Mexico , focusing on how the economies of the two countries are intertwined and how together , they can better compete in the international economy .

A marker of success for this trip would be to convince Mexico that the United States considers it a full strategic partner . In Central America , the president intends to recommit to fostering improved trade with the countries of the isthmus . We have CAFTA , the Central American Free Trade Agreement , which the administration would like to see working better .

Other issues , such as immigration , will always creep into a conversation about Latin America and U.S. ties . The Mexicans and Central Americans do n't like it when we North Americans preach to them about their internal politics , and we would n't like it much more if they did the same to us . Mexico is not the place to go debate or advance U.S. immigration legislation .

But it would make sense to promote the economic benefits of a modernized and streamlined immigration system that would allow the regulated flow of tourists and workers from Latin America .

It 's a good thing that President Obama is making this trip . Afterward , the key question becomes what the tangible followup will be .

In order to develop healthy and productive ties with the region , the engagement has to be long-term and sustained . Our Cabinet secretaries and other high-level administration officials should also be deployed on a mission of strengthening relationships . I suggested to President Obama that he find a way to send U.S. Hispanic civic leaders and professionals as good will ambassadors .

Also , President Obama should issue a statement on the violence and political strife going on in Venezuela since last month 's election . The words of a U.S. president carry great weight . It is important for Venezuelans to know that the international community is concerned about what is happening in their country .

As we left the meeting , I wished President Obama good luck on his trip and left him with one parting thought : `` Keep a close eye on the Secret Service this time ... ''
