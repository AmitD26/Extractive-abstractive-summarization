Near the Israel-Gaza border -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Hopes were briefly raised then dashed Tuesday for an imminent calm between Israel and Hamas as diplomats fervently sought a way to stop the deadly violence .

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in the region , where she met for more than two hours with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . She is expected to meet later with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy , who is working to broker a cease-fire .

Gaza is run by Hamas , which the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization .

Clinton offered Israel the support of the United States and expressed hope for a lasting solution as she spoke to reporters alongside Netanyahu at the prime minister 's office in Jerusalem . She thanked Egypt and especially Morsy for their efforts .

Hillary Clinton 's farewell tour takes detour

`` President Obama asked me to come to Israel with a very clear message . America 's commitment to Israel 's security is rock solid and unwavering . That is why we believe it is essential to de-escalate the situation in Gaza , '' she said . `` The goal must be a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security and legitimate aspirations of Israelis and Palestinians alike . ''

Tuesday marked the seventh day of deadly violence that that has turned life into a nightmare for millions in Israel and Gaza . Rockets rained as the death toll continued to climb .

There was a moment when it looked like the attacks might stop . A senior Hamas official told CNN a `` calming down '' would be announced at 9 p.m. local time -LRB- 2 p.m. ET -RRB- . But that did not happen .

Opinion : How this could be the last Gaza war

Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri later said that Israel had not agreed to terms that would stop the fighting .

Similarly , Egypt 's Morsy said the `` travesty of the Israel aggression on Gaza will end in a few hours . '' But a few hours passed , and Morsy 's office told CNN not to expect any announcement Tuesday night .

A `` calming down '' could halt violence , but it is not the same as an official cease-fire or truce . Israel has said it wants a cease-fire agreement but has not indicated whether one could be imminent .

`` Obviously , no country can tolerate a wanton attack on its civilians , '' said Netanyahu , standing beside Clinton . `` Now , if there is a possibility of achieving a long-term solution to this problem through diplomatic means , we prefer that . But if not , I 'm sure you understand that Israel will have to take whatever actions necessary to defend its people . ''

Netanyahu accused `` terrorist enemies '' of `` doing everything in their power to maximize the number of civilian casualties . ''

According to the Gaza Ministry of Health , 27 people were killed Tuesday , including children , and 137 Palestinians have been killed since the latest hostilities erupted . More than 1,100 people were injured . It 's not clear how many of the victims were militants .

Five people have been killed in Israel , according to Israel 's Soroka Hospital . More than 70 have been injured , including soldiers , Israeli officials have said .

The death toll in Israel moved from three to four early Tuesday when an 18-year-old soldier was killed in a rocket attack in the town of Eshkol , officials said . It climbed from four to five , according to the hospital , when a 30-year-old Bedouin was killed .

Israel said it was holding off on a ground offensive into Gaza to give diplomatic efforts time . Those efforts include talks with Clinton and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon .

A source familiar with discussions in Jerusalem told CNN , `` One of the Israeli demands is that there should be a period of total calm for 24 hours before committing to any agreement . ''

How this conflict reignited

Israeli spokesman Mark Regev told CNN , `` Diplomacy is still ongoing . ''

`` It 's in the hands now of the Israelis , '' Osama Hamdan , Hamas spokesman in Beirut , told CNN earlier by phone . '' ... I think the Egyptians are waiting for some support , promised support , from the United States in order to make an end for that . So we expect to have an outcome of this issue today as President Morsy has said . '' That `` expected '' outcome did n't arrive .

Speaking early Wednesday , Hamdan said he believes Hamas and Israel are close to a cease-fire agreement .

`` I can say that we are close , and we are on the edge . It may happen , and it may not , '' he said . Later , Hamdan added , `` I believe there is a good chance to have a cease-fire , which can fulfill the needs of both sides . ''

A timeline of the Israel-Gaza conflict

Regev said Israel is not interested in a `` time out , '' allowing Hamas to regroup after Israeli strikes have done damage . `` We want a new reality '' in which Israelis do n't live under rocket fire from Hamas , he said .

To succeed , negotiations have to be done `` discreetly , '' he said .

Hamdan said Hamas ' actions have been `` a good lesson for the Israeli government . It 's not good to attack the Palestinians , expecting that they will not react against the attack . ''

Asked whether Hamas would accept Israel 's right to exist , Hamdan said the Palestinian people would not consider it without an end to occupation .

Smuggling weapons to Gaza -- the long way

The onslaught of rockets fired Tuesday into Israel continued to be met by Israeli strikes on sites in Gaza .

Attacks included one aimed at Jerusalem , one that caused casualties in the southern town of Beer Sheva , and one that injured five Israeli soldiers .

Another rocket hit a civilian building in Rishon LeZion , part of metropolitan Tel Aviv , Israel Defense Forces spokeswoman Avital Leibovich said .

Netanyahu , at a news conference with Ban , said Israel was fighting back with `` surgical operations against terrorists at a time when our own population is being bombarded by rocket attacks . ''

`` If we hope to make these tactics illegitimate , they should be condemned in the most forceful terms by all responsible members of the international community , '' he said . `` The moment we draw symmetry between the victims of terror and the unintended casualties that result from legitimate military action against the terrorists , the minute that false symmetry is drawn , the terrorists win . ''

In Israel , Iron Dome ca n't keep the fear away

Speaking later at a news conference with Israeli President Shimon Peres , Ban urged diplomacy and said further escalation would put the region at risk .

`` The world is concerned , gravely concerned , at the rising loss of human lives . Further escalation would be dangerous and tragic for Palestinians and Israelis and would put the entire region at risk . I am here to appeal to all to halt fire and restore calm immediately , '' he said . `` Further escalation benefits no one . Now is the time for diplomacy . ''

Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat said Ban was among those who had to take cover when sirens sounded in Jerusalem , warning of an incoming rocket .

Military officials said the rocket landed in an open area of a village .

Other violence Tuesday included 11 Hamas rockets that hit the Israeli city of Beer Sheva , causing casualties . More than 30 rockets were fired into the area , but most were destroyed by Israel 's Iron Dome interceptors .

In Tel Aviv , a man with an ax attacked a U.S. Embassy security guard , Israeli police said . The attacker , who also had a knife , was arrested , police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said .

In Gaza , too young to understand but not to die

The IDF again dropped leaflets across parts of Gaza warning residents to evacuate their homes and go to central Gaza City . The leaflets told them which way to go and what part of the city to stay in once they arrived .

The leaflets are part of Israel 's efforts to minimize civilian casualties , Israeli officials say .

As a CNN crew was getting video of families fleeing an area in Gaza , an explosion shook the windows of a school , CNN 's Arwa Damon reported . The target was a vehicle around the corner , and the strike killed two people , she said .

Another Israeli airstrike hit a building that houses the local offices of Agence France-Presse in Gaza City . No one from the agency was injured , according to AFP .

Also in Gaza , CNN saw a group of men drag the body of a man through streets from the back of a motorcycle . The men , who carried weapons , yelled in Arabic that he was a traitor and Israeli spy .

Gaza has endured a crippling economic embargo since Hamas won control of the territory from the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority after a landslide 2007 election that was followed by intra-Palestinian clashes .

Many Arab and Muslim nations view Hamas as the victim of Israeli aggression .

Diplomats hope to avoid a repeat of 2008-2009 , when at least 1,400 people died when Israeli troops invaded Gaza after a similar spate of rocket attacks .

CNN 's Dana Ford , Josh Levs , Arwa Damon , Ben Wedeman , Christiane Amanpour , Holly Yan , Mohamed Fadel Fahmy , Saad Abedine , Sara Sidner , Frederik Pleitgen , Kareem Khadder , Reza Sayah and Talia Kayali contributed to this report .
