-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The lone , tattered page from a decimated children 's book sat quietly amid the rest of the rubble . But the words spoke volumes about the pain and nostalgia in the city of Moore :

`` I remember my old house ,

Its rooms so bright and wide .

Its halls will echo for all time ,

With the laughter heard inside . ''

Mark Toney found the battered page while volunteering with LifeChurch.TV .

`` It more than likely came from a house that had been demolished , '' said fellow volunteer Jared Bowie , who was with Toney at the time . `` Then I thought about how many houses were full of laughter and memories . ''

At least 12,000 homes were damaged or demolished from Monday 's abysmal tornado , Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said . The twister killed 24 people , including 10 children , and injured 353 in central Oklahoma .

With everyone missing now accounted for , the daunting road to recovery is underway .

Throngs of volunteers have come to Moore to help . Each has a poignant tale about the breadth of the human condition .

Juan Olivo started searching for survivors as soon as the storm passed . He documented the search on video .

`` Is there anybody here ?! '' he bellowed as he walked past heaps of debris .

In the distance , deep under a mound of shredded lumber , a man 's voice replied : `` Here ! ''

Olivo and other volunteers raced to the wreckage .

`` We 're gon na get you out ! '' Olivo told the man .

He later told CNN 's iReport he was stunned at the discovery .

Basements scarce in tornado-prone area -- here 's why

`` The odds of me filming and capturing this man cry out for help is one -LRB- in a -RRB- million , and I 'm happy he is alive , '' Olivo said .

Demands for storm shelters

Of the 10 children killed by the tornado , seven were inside Plaza Towers Elementary School . The twister crushed the school and reduced it to pieces .

Kyle Davis , 8 , was one of the victims .

`` I am angry to an extent . I know the schools did what they thought they could do but with us living in Oklahoma , tornado shelters should be in every school , '' Kyle 's mother , Mikki Dixon Davis , told CNN 's Kyung Lah .

Her daughter , who was also at Plaza Towers when the storm struck , survived .

`` There should be a place that if this ever happened again during school that kids can get to a safe place , '' Davis said . `` That we do n't have to sit there and go through rubble ... and may not ever find what we 're looking for . ''

Moore Mayor Glenn Lewis said he would push for a law requiring storm shelters or safe rooms in new homes .

`` What we will do is get the stakeholders here in the city ... and we 'll discuss what we think we need to have , '' Lewis said .

`` Anybody that lives in any tornado area should have -LRB- a storm shelter -RRB- , but it 's just the matter of cost . ''

Custom homebuilder Mike Barnett said an above-ground shelter runs $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 ; a small basement would cost $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 ; and a concrete cellar built during new-house construction would cost as little as $ 2,200 .

Looking ahead

On top of the human toll and grief , the cost of the tornado 's destruction is astronomical .

Insurance claims from the area are likely to exceed $ 2 billion , said Kelly Collins , a representative of the Oklahoma Insurance Department .

But the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in `` good shape '' to support the recovery in Oklahoma and other disaster zones , such as New Jersey and New York after Hurricane Sandy , FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate said .

`` We got full allocation last year with the Sandy supplemental funds , '' Fugate said . `` We are looking to continue the response here as well as the previous disasters . ''

But `` if we have another hurricane , we may need more money . ''

As Moore continues its arduous recovery , Bowie pondered the page from the children 's book . It shows a charming yellow house set atop lush green landscape .

He said it does n't just allude to the joy now lost after the storm .

`` It reminds me of the laughter and memories yet to come in the new houses that will be built , '' he said . `` The memories are truly found in the heart , not the house . ''

Moore in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why
