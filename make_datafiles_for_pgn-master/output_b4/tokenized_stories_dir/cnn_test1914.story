-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Train the brain . Until recently , this phrase made me picture Neo from `` The Matrix '' proclaiming `` I know kung fu '' after he had martial arts abilities uploaded into his brain .

But what if we really could harness technology , Neo-style , to help train our brains to better cope with everyday stress ?

For many of us , the days seem to pass in one anxiety-ridden blur after another . Mental health professional increasingly agree that these daily sprints , accompanied by a soundtrack of endless beeps , chirps and vibrations emitting from various devices , set off our stress systems , keeping us in a persistent and physiologically damaging state of fight-or-flight .

`` The way we live our lives now is like running marathons , '' said Dr. Leslie Sherlin , a neuroscientist and chief science officer of Neurotopia , a company that provides brain training to athletes . `` And in some ways , that 's great , but you ca n't run marathons all the time . ''

Keep that pace , says Sherlin , and at some point , you will burn out . You may also suffer from a weakened immune system that can lead to an increased risk of disease .

Most of us have received some kind of formal instruction about diet , exercise , the birds and the bees . So why are n't we training our brains to better manage stress ?

Some of the most compelling training to help prepare people to better handle stress is going on right now with athletes and soldiers .

For these two distinct groups , performance under high stress is a must -LRB- albeit for very different reasons -RRB- . But the technologies being used to train them could benefit the rest of us as well .

Technology could help us reduce stress , too

Training athletes for the field

I became interested in the way athletes train for peak performance in high-stakes environments last year , when I interviewed Michael Gervais , a sports psychologist who works with Sherlin to train elite athletes to perform optimally during high-stress competition . Gervais and Sherlin work with athletes from the NFL , NBA and NHL as well as Olympians , golfers and many others .

What Gervais told me then was that the key to high performance was a disciplined mind . While not exactly news , the methods Gervais and his colleagues use to teach mental discipline were quite interesting . They were using older Eastern disciplines like mindfulness , presence , meditation , deep breathing and neurofeedback .

As part of their training , Gervais and his colleagues hook up athletes to electrodes and perform a baseline qEEG : a quantitative electroencephalogram . They use the results to create an individualized brain map .

The map helps these sports psychologists assess and quantify mental aspects of performance like focus , decision speed , reaction time and stress regulation .

Once the brain is mapped , the psychologists conduct half-hour neurofeedback sessions to teach athletes how to reach optimal brain wave patterns . In a typical session , the athlete will sit before a large screen as sensors monitoring electrical activity in his or her brain are placed on the scalp .

The athlete then focuses on achieving desirable brain wave patterns that , in turn , influence what happens on the screen . It 's bit like controlling a video game with only your thoughts . The version I saw involved cars racing through a desert .

The training is meant to teach athletes how to respond quickly to stressor stimuli , how to focus during stressful situations , how to recover from errors and finally how to shut down and still their minds when it 's all over .

These sports psychologists have collected a proprietary brain bank of assessments over years of working with elite athletes . They use the brain bank to identify optimal brainwave patterns associated with the highest levels of performance .

According to Sherlin , it takes roughly 15 to 20 neurofeedback sessions for elite athletes to learn some of these techniques . -LRB- Probably about 30 for you and me , he says . -RRB-

Your questions about stress , answered !

Originally developed as a technique to measure brain activity in NASA pilots during flight simulation exercises , neurofeedback has shown promising initial results for helping retrain the brainwaves of children with ADHD and autism and people suffering from chronic migraines . In one study , student eye surgeons were trained to significantly improve their surgical skills by regulating their own brainwave activity .

The method is being examined in a diverse number of other contexts , including to help relieve symptoms of chemotherapy-induced nerve damage . Controlled , randomized trials will help validate these promising starts .

The kind of training that the athletes working with Gervais and Sherlin receive is not available to most of us right now , but it may be in our near future .

A few weeks ago , Sherlin 's company , Neurotopia , began beta-testing a dry -LRB- no goo in your hair -RRB- sensor , mobile headphone and tablet system that purports to do the same kind of assessment and training as the older model . At least in theory , this might make the product accessible to the rest of us .

Training soldiers for the battlefield

A conversation with Dr. Albert `` Skip '' Rizzo , psychologist and research professor at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine , is like a lesson in applied science fiction , with your mind reeling from `` Star Trek '' to the original `` Total Recall . ''

Except Rizzo 's jaw-dropping efforts are not fiction , nor are they `` on the horizon . '' They are here , now .

In a collaboration between the military , Hollywood and USC 's Institute for Creative Technologies , where he serves as the associate director for medical virtual reality , Rizzo and his colleagues have developed cutting-edge gaming and virtual reality technologies to serve the clinical needs of soldiers .

One project , Stress Resilience in Virtual Environments -LRB- STRIVE -RRB- , helps train service members to have better resilience and emotional coping skills in realistic virtual-reality combat scenarios before they are exposed to the real stresses of combat .

A second project , called Virtual Iraq -LRB- there is also a Virtual Afghanistan -RRB- , helps soldiers returning from combat work through their trauma by donning a helmet geared with video goggles , earphones and a scent machine , and revisiting the scene in a virtual reality setting , complete with sound and smell . Both STRIVE and Virtual Iraq -LRB- and Afghanistan -RRB- are based on exposure therapy , which has been effective in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder .

The problem with PTSD is that the person often avoids anything that reminds them of the trauma , and this avoidance begins to generalize to everyday things , says Rizzo .

`` It 's a snowball cascade effect . The things that evoke the fear and anxiety are no longer directly tied to the original trauma but generalized to the outside world . You see people with PTSD who will no longer leave their house , and if they do , they 're a nervous wreck . ''

The idea , says Rizzo , is to re-create the stressful environment in a doctor 's office , to help the patients confront and challenge the trauma and to give them the tools to better cope emotionally with what happened .

Both of these technologies require specialists and a clinical setting , but SimCoach , a `` virtual human '' designed for interactive use on the Internet , does not .

Though at this point , SimCoach is targeted toward active-duty military personnel , veterans and their families , it may also have wider utility for everyday stress and anxiety .

SimCoach users can select one of several avatars to talk to when they are feeling stressed out . The virtual human coaches can serve as an `` online companion for anyone who may be too introverted to seek help , someone who may not want to reach out to a clinician or who may feel stigma about seeing a therapist , '' said John Hart , program manager at the Institute for Creative Technologies .

`` SimCoach is not a doc-in-the-box , and it 's not going to make a diagnosis , '' Hart observed . Nor is it meant to replace human interaction .

What SimCoach does do is help those suffering from stress and anxiety symptoms begin the conversation about what they may be going through . It may also provide users with more information about what they may be experiencing , suggest local facilities where they can go for care and perhaps even walk them through breathing exercises or stress reduction techniques .

Hart summed up what I find most compelling about SimCoach : `` Here we are , sitting on a mountain of valuable information about what to do when you 're stressed or feeling depressed . You can see how SimCoach can help people access the right information when they need it . ''

Imagine the possibilities ! An interactive virtual-reality source for information on stress , anxiety and PTSD -- the precursor , perhaps , to a real-life version of `` Star Trek 's '' Emergency Medical Hologram Doctor .

Home sweet home

I recently attended a conference in Portugal . As I made my way through customs at Philadelphia International , a customs agent asked me what I did for a living .

`` I write , '' I said , `` mostly about stress . ''

He stared me down for few moments before saying in a low , gruff tone : `` If you really want to understand stress , then you need to spend a day with us here . ''

And here 's the thing : Regardless of what we do , most of us are feeling that same way about our runaway lives . The genie is out of the bottle , and there is little likelihood of us ever going back to a simpler time -LRB- if there ever was such a thing -RRB- .

So , yes , let 's discuss technology addiction , always being `` on , '' tech fasting and the need to design devices and apps for greater serenity . But let 's also consider how to harness some of these technologies to help us move easier in this new world , Neo-style .

Is personalized medicine a myth ?
