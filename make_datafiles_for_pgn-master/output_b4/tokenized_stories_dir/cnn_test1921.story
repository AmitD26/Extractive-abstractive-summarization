-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Sebastian Vettel led from start to finish to claim the Canadian Grand Prix Sunday to extend his title lead as he searches for a fourth straight Formula One world championship .

The Red Bull star pulled clear from pole position and was never seriously challenged as he finished with a winning margin of over 14 seconds from second placed Fernando Alonso .

Lewis Hamilton , who started on the front row with Vettel in his Mercedes , claimed the final podium spot , overtaken in the closing stages by the charging Alonso , who had started sixth on the grid in his Ferrari .

But up front , Vettel was untouchable , claiming his first win at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal and his 29th career triumph .

It has left him 36 points clear of two-time champion Alonso in the title race . Kimi Raikkonen occupied third spot , a further eight points adrift .

The Finn was way off the pace in his Lotus , but came home ninth to be in the points for a remarkable 24th straight race , equaling the record of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher .

Mark Webber battled a damaged front wing to claim fourth for Red Bull , who increased their lead in the constructors ' race over Ferrari .

Monaco winner Nico Rosberg finished fifth in the second Mercedes ahead of Jean-Eric Vergne in the Toro Rosso .

Britain 's Paul Di Resta , adopting a one-stop strategy in the Force India , finished seventh with Felipe Massa in eighth for Ferrari . Adrian Sutil claimed the final point for Force India .

Vettel was delighted to break his win drought in Canada after coming so close on previous occasions .

`` We had good races here before but it did n't come together to win , '' he said at the victory celebration .

`` I lost it in the last lap two years ago which was my fault but I made up for that today . ''

Alonso , clearly the crowd favorite with the fans , who roared their appreciation as he overtook his old rival Hamilton for second , was pleased to limit his losses on Vettel .

`` I think second tastes of victory , because we scored some good points after a very difficult weekend . ''

Hamilton , who is fourth in the title race , was also satisfied as Mercedes maintained their good start to the season .

`` We just have to keep pushing so we can get closer to these guys . ''

His old team McLaren suffered another disappointing race , with Sergio Perez and Jenson Button in 11th and 12th .

It was the first time McLaren has been out of the points in 64 races .

Young Finn Valtteri Bottas , who was a surprise third on the grid for Williams , also slipped back through the field to come home 14th , continuing his team 's pointless start to the campaign .
