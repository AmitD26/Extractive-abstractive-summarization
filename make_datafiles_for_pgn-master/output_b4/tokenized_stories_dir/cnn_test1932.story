-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The U.S. government pleaded Saturday for North Korean authorities to release 85-year-old Merrill Newman , with a spokeswoman saying officials are `` deeply concerned '' about him and another American being held in the isolated East Asian nation .

`` Given Mr. Newman 's advanced age and health conditions , we urge -LRB- North Korea -RRB- to release Mr. Newman so he may return home and reunite with his family , '' said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden .

Washington 's plea came on the day North Korean state media released print stories and video showing what they called Newman 's `` apology . '' University of California , Berkeley professor Steven Weber characterized it as `` highly scripted political theater . ''

So how did an elderly retired financial consultant and Korean War veteran become the central figure in an international dispute ? Why is there such animosity still tied to a conflict , the Korean War , that ended six decades ago ? And why is this all unfolding now ?

Weber , a former consultant to the U.S. Commission on National Security , has a theory : `` They are trying to get the Western media to pay attention . ''

With the notable exception of its longtime ally China , North Korea is in many ways a pariah state bogged down by what many view as decades of repressive leadership . At the same time , the communist nation has had difficulties getting enough energy to power their country and food for their people .

Largely shut off from the rest of the world , its leaders and state media often use saber-rattling rhetoric to unite citizens against what Weber described as `` nasty outsiders '' -- which , not coincidentally , are chiefly South Korea and the United States , just as during the Korean War .

The discord in recent years has centered mostly on North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs , with the international community taking punitive measures such as economic sanctions to hold Pyongyang in check .

North Korea has n't been alone . Iran , too , has long been an international target because of its nuclear program , though that landscape has changed with the recent diplomatic accord .

That fact may not be lost on Pyongyang , said Weber , who surmised North Korea may be particularly eager to get the world 's focus and , ideally , concessions in the process .

Added Weber : `` If the Iran thing gets settled peacefully , then guess who 's left ? ''

Wife , son beg for his release

Elderly man not only American detained

Newman is not the only American being detained in North Korea . In her statement , Hayden also asked for the release of Kenneth Bae , who was arrested in November 2012 in North Korea .

Last May , Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea 's government found him guilty of `` hostile acts '' and attempts to topple the government .

`` We are thankful that the White House has advocated for the release of both Mr. Newman and my brother , Kenneth Bae , '' said Terri Chung , Bae 's sister . `` It has been a devastating experience for my brother and my family , so we pray every day for his release . Now we 're including Mr. Newman in our prayers . We can not forget about these two men . For every action that the US government takes toward his release , we are thankful . ''

Chung has said Bae suffers from chronic health conditions that require doctors ' care , including hypertension , diabetes and an enlarged heart . On Monday , Chung said ailments her brother suffered before his detainment -- back problems and radiating leg pain -- worsened while he was forced to work long hours daily in a labor camp . He has lost 50 pounds since he was detained , she added .

The Bae family has been in `` sheer pain and agony '' since his detainment , Chung said .

Other detained Americans

Unique case

Newman 's age , and the circumstances surrounding his detention , are unique .

According to his family , the Palo Alto , California , resident had gone on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea in October . From phone calls and postcards he sent , the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem , son Jeff Newman said .

The day before he was to leave , `` one or two Korean authorities '' met with Newman and his tour guide , the son added . They talked about Newman 's service record , which left `` my dad ... a bit bothered , '' according to Jeff Newman .

Then , just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October , he was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities .

Newman 's weeks-long detention is complicated by the fact that , according to his son Jeff , he suffers from a heart condition .

Sweden 's ambassador to North Korea visited Newman on Saturday where he is being held at Pyongyang 's Yanggakdo Hotel and delivered his medication , his family said .

`` As a result of the visit , we know that Merrill is in good health , '' the family added . `` Merrill reports that he is being well treated and that the food is good . ''

The Newmans went on to thank the ambassador and `` express appreciation for the cooperation of the DPRK government in allowing the visit to take place . ''

`` We are asking that the DPRK authorities take into account his health and his age and , as an act of humanitarian compassion , allow him to depart immediately for home , '' the family said . `` All of us want this ordeal to end and for the 85-year-old head of our extended family to be with us once more . ''

Reported apology : ` I have been guilty of big crimes '

Until Saturday , the North Korean government had n't said why it held Newman .

American accused of spying issues ` apology '

The explanation came in the form of a published apology from Newman , as well as accompanying images of him thumbprinting his handwritten note and talking about his experiences .

Atop the first of the four pages is the word `` apology , '' according to video released by North Korea . The end of the last page is dated November 9 -- indicating Newman made his reported admission more than 20 days ago . Why might Pyongyang have waited 21 days , then , to make the admission public ? That 's another one of the mysteries surrounding this case .

In the note , Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit , part of the `` intelligence bureau '' fighting against Pyongyang in the Korean War . He detailed how he commanded troops to collect `` information '' and wage various deadly attacks .

`` After I killed so many civilians and -LRB- North Korean -RRB- soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War , I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people , '' Newman said , according to the `` apology '' reported by KCNA .

The reported message also touches on his return 60 years later to North Korea , admitting that he `` shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers . ''

`` I have been guilty of big crimes against the DPRK government and the Korean people again , '' Newman adds in the `` apology . ''

His statement ends : `` If I go back to -LRB- the -RRB- USA , I will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people are leading . ''

In addition to this statement , KCNA ran a story alleging Newman came to North Korea with a tourist group in October and afterward `` perpetrated acts of infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and slandering its socialist system . ''

This story claimed that Newman tried to `` look for spies and terrorists who conducted espionage and subversive activities against the DPRK . ''

Investigators determined that , as a member of the U.S. military , he `` masterminded espionage and subversive activities ... and , in this course , he was involved in the killings of service personnel of the Korean People 's Army and innocent civilians . ''

`` The investigation clearly proved Newman 's hostile acts against the DPRK , and they were backed by evidence , '' the KCNA story added . `` He admitted all his crimes . ''

Is American man a bargaining chip ?

Newman 's fate , North Korea 's thinking unclear

Just five days ago , his wife , Lee , said she hoped he would be home for Thanksgiving .

`` We need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays , '' Lee Newman told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer . `` And we ask -- respectfully -- for them to release him and let him come home . ''

One day before Thanksgiving , Rep. Charlie Rangel -- who himself was wounded fighting in the Korean War -- released a letter urging North Korean leader Kim Jong Un `` to release him immediately . '' Noting Newman 's medical issues , the New York Democrat implored Kim to `` have the heart to reunite him with his loved ones and those who can provide proper care . ''

Rangel also reflected on the 1950s war , as well as the current state of affairs between the key players .

`` I believe that Mr. Newman , like myself and others who have fought during the Korean War six decades ago , wants to see a united Korea in our lifetime , '' wrote the congressman . `` While progress has been slow on the political front , I am confident it can be advanced on humanitarian grounds . ''

So will there be fresh movement in Newman 's case ? Will his reported apology pave the way for his release or will it be followed , like Bae , with a lengthy prison sentence ?

As of Saturday , nobody -- at least nobody outside of North Korea -- seems to know .

As Weber , the Berkeley professor said : `` When it comes to North Korea , nobody knows very much . ''
