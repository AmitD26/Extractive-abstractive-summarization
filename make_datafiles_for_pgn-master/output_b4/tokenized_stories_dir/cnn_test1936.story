-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jeanne Thomas was sitting at her desk at work when she decided to check the security camera that she installed in her home . The Thomas home had been burglarized before , so she installed a monitoring device where she can watch a live video feed of the camera in her home .

`` He 's in my house . I am seeing him walk around my house . He 's in my bedroom right now , '' she said . The bedroom can not be seen in the video , but the door from the living room into the bedroom is visible .

Thomas watched as the men wandered through her home , taking valuables such as her TV and Wii gaming console .

`` This is unbelievable , '' she told the 911 dispatcher . `` The cat is freaking out . The dogs are hiding . ''
