-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The storm that whipped the Northeast over the weekend with six to 16 inches of snow has blown off to Canada , but more snow is on its way -- maybe just enough to bring out some of that holiday spirit .

The flakes sweeping across the Midwest and Northeast on Monday and Tuesday are n't expected have the heft of the fast-moving storm that preceded them but are predicted to add a couple of inches to the wintry landscape .

For those who like the sight , expect it to last a few days , especially in the northernmost regions , as deep freeze temperatures settle in and are n't expected to relent until mid-week . Especially above Albany , New York , the mercury will plummet hard , well below zero , the National Weather Service says .

Residents may have cleared their walkways from West Virginia to Maine Sunday , but slush should freeze overnight in many places , leaving slippery patches .

Mounds of snow are piled high throughout New York state and New England

Albany got at least 12 inches , the weather service said ; the storm left another 16 inches in Biddeford , Maine .

The big storm came a little early , said one CNN iReporter .

`` We usually get these big snow storms in January and the snow on the ground usually stays until springtime since it 's always cold here in Albany , '' Zeynep Rice said .

`` Last year was a bit weak in snow until end of February actually . So we 're happy to have a solid snow covering on the ground earlier than usual this season . ''

The storm spared major metropolitan areas like Boston and New York City , but some areas in Maine and along the U.S.-Canada border saw significant snow , the weather service said .

The eastward-moving storm dropped snow earlier across the Midwest and western Pennsylvania , with 9 inches reported in Urbana , Illinois .

Millions of people experienced the big chill as the system paved a white swath more than 1,000 miles long .
