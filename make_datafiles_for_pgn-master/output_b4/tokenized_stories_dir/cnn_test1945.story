Bekaa Valley , Lebanon -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tucked between snow-topped mountains , Lebanon 's Bekaa Valley is home to dozens of ramshackle camps housing Syrian refugees who have little to protect them against the cold .

It was the image of children with no shoes in the bitter winter and mud that Hala Habib Qiblawi , a designer and mother of three , could n't get out of her mind over the past year .

`` It was the first thing ... the only thing that stayed in my head , '' she says .

This year , she decided to do something about it .

She was in the process of organizing her campaign , procuring winter boots for children , when Lebanon was hit by one of its coldest spells and harshest storms in memory .

That 's when Qiblawi realized she was n't the only one who felt compelled to do something .

`` Everybody was so angry , angry at the government , angry at the silence , '' she says . `` Everybody was thinking of the refugees . And seeing that anger -- and I myself worried and angry -- I launched it . ''

She started a Facebook campaign , `` Rain Boots for Syrian refugee children , '' with a target of 2,000 pairs of boots . The response stunned her . She achieved her goal within the first 24 hours , ending up with thousands more pairs .

And the boots keep coming .

`` It 's like really seeing , realizing that there is still humanity on earth , especially in this part of the world , '' Qiblawi says .

Helping to organize the distribution is Sawa for Syria , a nongovernmental organization started over coffee with friends by Rouba Mhaissen , a 25-year-old Lebanese Syrian .

A Ph.D. candidate living in London , Mhaissen came back to Lebanon two years ago for a visit and just could n't leave .

`` The number of refugees has reached a ceiling of 2 million in Lebanon with a complete chaos in NGOs , a complete lack of institutional coordination . So grass-roots organizations like us and many other initiatives are taking the lead to try and do something , but still the need is very very high . ''

Sawa for Syria now has some 2,000 members , all volunteers , and helps manage and distribute aid to camps across the Bekaa Valley .

Among those waiting for their boots on this day is a group of friends that clamors around us .

Amina , 9 , shows off how she can write her name in English . The other girls chatter about wanting to go back home to Syria .

But Suzanne , a 5-year-old with large brown eyes , stays silent as she slips her hand into mine , clutching it tightly .

The older boys tell us her father is dead , killed by a sniper in Homs as he was riding a minibus . One of her brothers is missing in Syria , presumed detained by regime forces ; another is still recovering from injuries after an artillery strike .

We wade through the sticky mud to her family tent . She and her sisters show us where they shoved cardboard into the makeshift ceiling to absorb the rainwater .

Outour , Suzanne 's 13-year-old sister , has n't been able to register in school . Over the summer she and one of her brothers worked in the fields . Without a father , it 's the children 's burden to help make ends meet .

As we chat their mother arrives , her face etched with pain , eyes weary .

`` My eldest , her husband died recently too . They had three kids , '' she says , her heart so broken she seems numb to it all . As for so many other Syrians , hardship and pain are the norm .

In another world , Outour says , she would have continued her education -- she wants to be a journalist . One of her younger sisters wants to be a dentist , and Suzanne says she wants to be a doctor . But these children know the harsh reality of life too well .

At least while they are getting fitted for their boots and showing us what they ended up with , there are those brief smiles and giggles .

`` Sometimes you feel like no matter what you do , you are just doing 1 % of the need , '' Mhaissen says . `` But at the same time when you see a child smiling , a mother happy that her son got something , those moments do count . ''

As Qiblawi says one of her friends put it : `` It 's like giving them a Cinderella moment . It 's true -- seeing the happiness on the children 's faces , with dignity , they were all so proud and dignified . ''
