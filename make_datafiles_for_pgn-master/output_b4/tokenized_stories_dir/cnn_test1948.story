-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Eastern European gang of hackers bent on stealing company secrets was responsible for recent attacks on Apple , Facebook and Twitter as well as dozens of other less-publicized hacks , according to new reports .

Two unnamed `` people familiar with the matter '' told Bloomberg that the hackers appeared to be looking for research , intellectual property or other private information that they can sell on the underground market .

Apple confirmed Tuesday that some of its employees ' computers had been compromised after they visited a hacked website for iPhone developers . That site exploited a vulnerability in the Java browser plug-in .

Weeks earlier , Facebook said that some of its computers were also compromised after employees visited a developer site .

Both Facebook and Apple said no user data were accessed in the attacks .

Earlier in January , Twitter said it , too , was attacked and that about 250,000 user accounts may have been compromised , with names and e-mails possibly being uncovered .

As news of the intrusions spread , suspicions turned toward hackers in China . The nation 's government denies it supports hacking .

But experts said it would n't be surprising if the attacks originated in Eastern Europe instead .

`` We 've all been watching China , but they 're not the most advanced cybercriminals , '' said Tom Kellermann , the former commissioner of President Barack Obama 's cybersecurity council and head of security at Trend Micro . `` The most advanced are from the Eastern Bloc and Russia . ''

Kellermann said that a `` giant arms bazaar '' has developed in Eastern Europe by which criminals sell cybertools to others . That way , he said , organized crime elements and even terror groups end up with the same kind of advanced tools some governments possess .

`` That 's what I 'm most worried about , '' Kellermann said . `` I wish this stuff were just nation-state on nation-state , so then we could crank up our diplomacy . But regimes do n't have a monopoly on Big Brother , and they do n't have a monopoly on cyber capabilities . ''

The recent hacks appear to have used what cybersecurity experts call a `` water hole '' attack . Like a lion waiting for those speedy gazelles to slow down and have a drink , criminals hack and load viruses onto sites they suspect attractive targets will visit , then wait .

They do n't know exactly who their victims will be . But once the victims are infected , the hackers can follow them back to their own businesses ' networks to snoop around .

One site used in the attacks appears to be called iPhone Dev SDK , a forum for developers who work with Apple 's mobile operating system .

`` iPhoneDevSDK has learned it was used as part of an attack whose victims included large Internet companies , '' read a message at the top of the site 's home page Wednesday . `` We have no reason to believe user data -LRB- were -RRB- compromised , but to be safe , we 've reset all user passwords . ''

Security holes in Oracle 's Java programming language have been responsible for a number of the recent attacks . The Department of Homeland Security released a warning about the software in January .

Apple pointed out in its statement that Macs running the most recent operating system , OS X Lion , have not come with Java pre-installed and that the computers automatically disable the plug-in after 35 days of inactivity .
