CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Celebrating 20 years of commercial-free news for the classroom , this is CNN Student News ! This show is awesome . I 'm Carl Azuz . You know how we look now ; over my shoulder , you can see our sweet graphics from the 1980s . A look back is coming up after our top stories . Let 's go !

First Up : Terror Indictment

AZUZ : First up , a new charge against Najibullah Zazi , one of the suspects arrested in connection with a terrorism investigation . He 's been indicted on a charge of conspiracy `` to use weapons of mass destruction . '' Zazi was arrested last weekend . This is all part of a Justice Department investigation into an alleged plot to set off explosives in the U.S. . In a hearing yesterday , another suspect , Ahmad Afzali , who was arrested on charges of lying to authorities , was released on bail of $ 1.5 million . But his travel is being restricted .

Security Council

AZUZ : Meanwhile , the United Nations Security Council is looking to stop the spread of nuclear weapons . All 15 countries who are members of the group voted for a resolution that would tighten control on nuclear materials . The measure also supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy . The presidency of the Security Council rotates between the member nations . This month , the U.S. has it , which is why President Obama ran yesterday 's meeting .

Pittsburgh Summit

AZUZ : After the U.N. summit , he and other world leaders headed to Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania for a gathering of the G-20 , a group of the world 's leading economic powers . They 're not the only ones in town , though . Protesters have flocked to the city to take part in demonstrations . Yesterday , an unauthorized march turned violent as protesters clashed with police officers . As for the G-20 , the global economy has improved since the last time it got together . But as Ed Henry reports , there 's still a lot of work to do .

ED HENRY , CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : When these 20 leaders last met , it was spring in London and the global recession was still catching fire . But as President Obama wrapped up his first big moment on the international stage , he declared they were putting out the flames .

U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : We finished a very productive summit that will be , I believe , a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery .

HENRY : Five months later , there are signs the recession is coming to a close . But unemployment is still sky-high , helping to fuel protesters already waiting for the leaders in Pittsburgh .

-LRB- SOUND OF PROTESTERS -RRB-

HENRY : The president acknowledged to CNN 's John King that unemployment may get worse in the next few months , which is why he will be pushing his counterparts to sign on to a specific pledge to make the global economy more balanced .

OBAMA : We ca n't go back to the era where the Chinese or the Germans or other countries just are selling everything to us , we 're taking out a bunch of credit card debt or home equity loans , but we 're not selling anything to them .

HENRY : But getting the Chinese to sign on will be difficult , especially after Mr. Obama slapped a tariff on Chinese tires , which raised questions about whether leaders are reneging on free trade promises they made in London .

STEVEN SCHRAGE , CENTER FOR STRATEGIC & INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : So , is the United States going to be standing up and stopping this slippage ? Or is it going to be further pushing the world down towards trade conflicts and possibly a downward spiral of new types of protectionism ?

HENRY : Another potential dispute : European leaders continue to push hard for a crackdown on bonuses paid to bankers . And while Mr. Obama last week reiterated his call for broader reform of Wall Street , his hand has been weakened by inaction in Washington .

SCHRAGE : The U.S. is really handicapped by the fact that its own reforms have n't gotten out of Congress . So , while they can talk about these broad reforms , until the United States is really active , it 's hard for them to set the course .

Disaster Declaration

AZUZ : Catching up on a couple other headlines now , starting with the recovery process in Georgia following this week 's deadly flooding . President Obama has issued a Federal Disaster Declaration for four counties in the state . That will free up money and aid to help with the relief efforts . Requests for federal aid in other counties are being reviewed .

Kennedy Replacement

AZUZ : And the governor of Massachusetts has picked Paul Kirk , who you see here , to fill the U.S. Senate seat left empty by the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy . He 's only taking over the seat temporarily , however . A special election for a permanent replacement is set for January . Kirk has said he does n't intend to take part in that process .
