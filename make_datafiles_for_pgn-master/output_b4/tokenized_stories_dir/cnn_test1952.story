-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- That Africans today so dominate distance running is in part testament to the career of Kipchoge -LRB- Kip -RRB- Keino .

Keino claimed an unexpected victory in the 3,000 m steeplechase in Munich in 1972 .

The first black African to break onto the international stage at the beginning of the 1960s , Kip Keino won two Olympic golds and was a formidable force in the sport for 12 years .

Other athletes would win more golds , but few would win races and hold records at all distances from 1,500 meters to 10,000 meters .

Keino was 24-years-old before he competed at his first Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 where he finished 10th and fifth in the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters respectively .

In 1965 he broke two world records : the 3,000 m at Helsingborg in Sweden in seven minutes 39.6 seconds -LRB- his first attempt at the distance -RRB- ; and the 5,000 m in Auckland in 13 minutes 24.2 seconds .

His form looked good for the high-altitude games of Mexico City in 1968 , but stomach cramps forced him out of the 10,000 m with just two laps to go .

He recovered to win a stunning gold in the 1,500 m. Knowing that race favorite , Jim Ryun had a devastating kick in the final hundreds , Keino decided to hit the front early .

He managed to hold on and finished 20 meters ahead of Ryan -- the largest winning margin and the second fastest time in the event 's history .

Born to run

In the same year he also took a silver in the 5,000 m . He had run six races in just eight days despite a gallbladder infection .

But it was at the Munich Games of 1972 that the untrained Nandi tribesman from Kipsano , in the high plains of Kenya , proved he was born to run .

In the steeplechase , with only one win from his previous four competitive attempts at the event and twenty-three others lining up with better personal times , Keino was not even expected to make the final .

Yet , somehow he staved off challenges from his more experienced compatriot , Ben Jipcho , and Finland 's Tapio Kantanen , to win in an Olympic record time of eight minutes 23.6 seconds .

Keino will be remembered for two things : opening up the latent athletic talent of Africa and his disquieting natural ability to conquer all-comers in five distinct events .

When he finally retired after the All Africa Games in Lagos in 1975 , he fittingly returned home to a daughter he and his wife had named Milka Olympia Chelagat .
