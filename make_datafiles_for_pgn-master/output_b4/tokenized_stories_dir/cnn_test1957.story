-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Israel 's President Shimon Peres has pointed a finger at Iran over the carnage in Syria , labeling the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group Hezbollah as `` the main killer '' in the war-ravaged country .

Speaking to CNN 's Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Peres questioned the authenticity of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani 's stated desire for peace in Syria , given its support for the militia .

`` The President -LRB- Rouhani -RRB- spoke really movingly about Syria , about the killing of the dead , '' he said . `` But who 's killing ? The main killer today in Syria is Hezbollah -- who is supporting Hezbollah , who is financing Hezbollah , who is sending them out ? ''

Earlier at Davos , Rouhani had urged an end to the Syrian conflict , arguing that elections were the key to resolving the issue .

Peres was also asked whether the United States and other powers were being `` pulled along in a game '' in relation to a landmark deal intended to curb Iran 's nuclear program , following the Iranian Foreign Minister 's recent comments that the Obama administration had mischaracterized the Islamic republic 's concessions .

`` No , '' replied Peres . `` I say they have difficulties too , but I think President Obama is serious about -LRB- the deal -RRB- , because he knows the outcome if they were to stop it at the moment . It may turn the Middle East into a nuclear region . It 's -LRB- already -RRB- complicated -LRB- enough -RRB- . ''

Despite the tensions between Israel and Iran , Peres said he was still open to meeting with Rouhani should the opportunity arise .

`` The Iranians are not our enemies historically . We do n't have a joint border -- I do n't see any reason why we should have a conflict , '' he said .

`` The problem with Rouhani is his positions ... But if he really -LRB- does -RRB- what they -LRB- say they will do -RRB- , why not ? ''
