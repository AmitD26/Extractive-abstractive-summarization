-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Real Housewives of New Jersey '' stars Teresa and Joe Giudice face new bank fraud charges .

The reality TV couple could spend decades in prison if convicted on the 41 counts alleged in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New Jersey .

The Giudices allegedly faked documents and lied on applications to get more than $ 5 million in loans over eight years before they joined the `` The Real Housewives of New Jersey '' cast in 2009 .

They both entered `` not guilty '' pleas in August to the original 39 counts , including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud , bank fraud , making false statements on loan applications , and bankruptcy fraud .

The husband and wife are due in court in Newark for the added charges on Wednesday , according to U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman . The new counts stem from a $ 361,250 mortgage loan that Teresa Giudice , 41 , got in 2005 , Fishman said .

`` In the course of obtaining the loan , she and Giuseppe Giudice prepared a loan application which falsely stated that Teresa Giudice was employed as a realtor and that she had a monthly salary of $ 15,000 , '' Fishman said . `` Teresa Giudice was not employed outside the home at the time . ''

Giudice lawyer Miles Feinstein told reporters in August that the couple would not be testifying against each other in the case , which he said they expect to win .

Teresa Giudice , in a written statement released after she was charged in July , said she would stand by her man .

`` Today is a most difficult day for our family , '' she said . `` I support Joe and , as a wonderful husband and father , I know he wants only the best for our lovely daughters and me . I am committed to my family and intend to maintain our lives in the best way possible , which includes continuing my career . As a result , I am hopeful that we will resolve this matter with the government as quickly as possible . ''

The indictment accuses the Giudices of exaggerating their income by faking her employment history while applying for loans . They allegedly failed to disclose rental and business income after filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2009 .

The indictment also charges Joe Giudice with failure to file tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008 , during which time he allegedly earned nearly $ 1 million .

The Giudices are free on $ 500,000 bond each , but they had to surrender their passports .

If convicted , the couple faces up to 30 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine .
