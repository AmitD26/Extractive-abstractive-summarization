London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- During the 1970s , Britain 's car industry was the sick man of Europe : many models were poorly designed and built , politicians and the nationalized company management lacked strategic vision while workers were often on strike .

Four decades on , that perception has been turned on its head . Despite the closure of the last British-owned volume car maker , Rover , in 2005 , the country is now building near-record numbers of vehicles while the proportion of cars exported is the highest ever .

Belying the moribund state of the global economy , sales of luxury models are now leading the charge . On Monday Rolls-Royce posted its best results in its 107-year-history with 3,538 cars -- which cost upwards of £ 200,000 -LRB- $ 308,000 -RRB- -- sold in 2011 , a 31 % rise over the previous year 's figure . This growth is powered by surging demand in Asia : China now joins the United States as the BMW-owned marque 's most significant markets .

`` We had an outstanding year in 2011 and we should take a moment to reflect on this Great British success story , '' said the company 's CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos . Rolls-Royce spokesman Andrew Ball told CNN the company was profitable but declined to detail any figures .

The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company , Bentley , posted a 37 % rise in global sales , also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S. . The Volkswagen-owned company , based in Crewe , in northern England , in 2011 sold more than 7,000 cars , the prices of which start at £ 133,000 -LRB- $ 208,000 -RRB- .

The rise in output comes on the back of a huge rise in productivity . In the 1970s , 545,000 people were employed in Britain 's car factories , making 15 million cars during that decade . Between 2001 and 2011 there were only 133,000 workers in the industry , but they produced 16.1 million cars .

Toyota has recently created 1,500 jobs at its plant in Derbyshire in a £ 100 million investment while Jaguar Land Rover said it would double the size of its factory on Merseyside providing 1,000 new jobs .

The success of British car makers is echoed by U.S. car makers which are expected to report their first profits since 2004 . Most analysts are forecasting better industrywide sales in 2012 and beyond . They see sales rising from 12.8 million in 2011 to between 13.5 million to 14 million this year and close to 15 million by 2014 or 2015 .

Detroit automakers are finally making profits

Rolls-Royce 's sales figures are the best since 1978 when the company sold 3,347 cars , mainly of the Silver Shadow II model . The latest Rolls-Royce models share many components with BMW models , such as the 7-series , but cost more than twice as much .

Motoring journalist Iain Reid of What Car ? magazine said part of the reason behind R-R 's success lay in its product range . `` If you make the right models people will buy them . The Ghost car is proving successful because it is a bit more affordable and less ostentatious than the Phantom . ''

The Rolls-Royce brand was doing well , he said , because it married British heritage with BMW 's sales and marketing expertise . Reid added that companies such as Nissan , BMW Mini and Honda had good plants in the UK that were building desirable cars . `` You ca n't go wrong with that mix , '' Reid told CNN .

Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars `` by the meter '' -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles . `` They are surprisingly agile , and do n't feel nearly as big as they actually are . And their attention to detail is unrivaled . ''

Nieuwenhuis , director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School , said Britain had a global reputation for building luxury cars . `` This is something that we are doing well , despite our own car market doing badly . '' He added that the Rolls-Royce sales figures showed that `` rich people still have money '' especially in China .

The rights to use the Rolls-Royce name have been owned by BMW since 1998 when Vickers sold off Rolls-Royce Motors , which also made Bentley cars . Volkswagen paid £ 430 million for the existing factory in Crewe but did not secure the rights to use the Rolls-Royce name on their vehicles . This was bought from Rolls-Royce plc , which continues to make aero engines , for £ 40 million by BMW , which built a new plant in Goodwood , West Sussex , in southern England .
