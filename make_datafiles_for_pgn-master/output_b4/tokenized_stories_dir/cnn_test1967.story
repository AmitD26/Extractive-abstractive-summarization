-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Stanislas Wawrinka has had little time to rest on his laurels after winning his first grand slam title but the new Australian Open champion rounded off a superb day for Switzerland as they took a commanding 2-0 lead over Serbia in a Davis Cup tie in Novi Sad Friday .

Wawrinka battled jet leg after the long haul flight from Melbourne -- where he had beaten Rafael Nadal in Sunday 's final -- to see off Dusan Lajovic 6-4 4-6 6-1 7-6 .

Earlier , former world number one Roger Federer , a late inclusion in a strong Swiss line-up , beat Ilija Bozoljac 6-4 7-5 6-2 to give them the advantage .

Serbia , beaten in last year 's final by the Czech Republic , is fielding a much-weakened team with both world number two Novak Djokovic and Janko Tipsarevic sitting out the World Group match .

Federer came back from 5-2 down in the second set to snuff out any hopes Bozoljac might case an upset and he raced through the third set

`` In the second set I was just glad to take advantage and fight back . The most important thing is that I won the match in straight sets , '' Federer told the official Davis Cup website .

Wawrinka took the first set against world number 102 Lajovic , but was in trouble in the second as the Serbian leveled .

The new Swiss number one raced through the third set , but the fourth was again a struggle and he needed unforced errors from the inexperienced Lajovic in the tiebreak to close out the match .

`` It was a tough match and it was n't easy for me to come here after the last few weeks , '' Wawrinka said .

`` I did n't really have enough time to get ready as I was exhausted both mentally and physically , but I was determined to fight and win the match and I was really happy to get through it . ''

Nadal , troubled by a back injury during his four-set loss to Wawrinka , is missing Spain 's tie against Germany and in his absence they have fallen 2-0 behind in Frankfurt .

Philipp Kohlschreiber was in superb form as he thrashed Spain 's new boy Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2 6-4 6-2 while Florian Mayer came out on top in a marathon battle against Feliciano Lopez to win 7-6 7-6 1-6 5-7 6-3 in just under four hours .

Boris Becker , now in Djokovic 's coaching team , was delighted to see his country performing so well against the five-time champions .

`` And we have 2points against #spain in #frankfurt #DavisCup !!!! '' he tweeted .

Holders the Czech Republic were involved in a tough battle with the Netherlands with Robin Haase beating Radek Stepanek 3-6 6-4 6-7 6-2 6-1 to put the Dutch ahead .

Tomas Berdych leveled for the Czechs with an easy victory over Igor Sijsling , 6-3 6-3 6-0 .

On the WTA Tour , top seed Maria Sharapova reached the semifinals of the Paris Indoor Open with a 6-2 6-2 win over Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium , who had beaten titleholder Mona Barthel of Germany in the first round .

Sharapova will face fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a place in the final as she continues her comeback from an injury which wrecked the second half of her 2013 season .

Pavlyuchenkova beat ninth-ranked German Angelique Kerber , a Paris winner in 2012 , in three sets in their quarterfinal tie .
