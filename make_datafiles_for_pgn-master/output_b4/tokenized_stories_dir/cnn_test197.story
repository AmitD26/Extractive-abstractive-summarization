-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In another clear sign that the severely strained relations between the two sides is slowly improving , North Korea has agreed to a proposal from the South that they resume the reunion of families separated in the 1950-53 Korean War .

The meetings would take place on September 19 , during the Chuseok harvest festival , the North Korean news agency KCNA reported Sunday .

North Korea set off months of unsettling tensions with a long-range rocket launch in December followed by an underground nuclear test in February .

The North 's menacing rhetoric against the United States and South Korea hit a fever pitch in March and April after the U.N. Security Council voted in March to slap tougher sanctions on the regime and amid U.S.-South Korean military drills in the region .

The KCNA report said the North and the South , following an agreement to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Zone , will talk about the possibility of resuming cross-border tours at Mount Kumgang .

The Kaesong Industrial Zone , is an industrial complex the two nations share . It 's been closed since April when the North pulled out its workers .

Mount Kumgang is a North Korean resort where a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean soldier in 2008 after allegedly walking into an off-limits area . The reunion will take place at the resort .

`` The Kaesong Industrial Zone and the tours to Mt. Kumgang resort are valuable works common to the nation which should not be delayed as they are symbols of reconciliation , unity , reunification and prosperity , '' the KCNA report said .

Bittersweet reunions

The tragedy of the divided families dates to the 1950-1953 Korean War , when the Cold War 's division of the peninsula into two nations became permanent .

Amid fighting , millions of Koreans became refugees -- either fleeing the violence or fearing political reprisals from one side or the other . In winter of 1950 , an estimated 650,000 refugees fled North Korea when United Nations forces retreated in the face of a surprise Chinese offensive .

There is no direct telephone or mail contact between the two Koreas , but some families in the South have managed to broker surreptitious voice and written contact with their relatives in the North in recent years , as North Korea 's border with China has become more permeable and illegal cell phones have penetrated the insulated state .

The first family reunions took place following a landmark summit between the two Koreas in 2000 . Since then , 17,100 people representing 3,500 families have been reunited on more than a 18 separate occasions .

The meetings are bittersweet ; the chances of any of the divided family members meeting again are slim .

The last such reunion took place in 2010 .

According to a report at the time , some 80,000 South Koreans registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions , but 40,000 people are believed to have passed away or given up hope , according to the South 's Ministry of Unification . Numbers north of the Korean demilitarized zone are unknown .

Kaesong closing

The shuttered Kaesong complex is one of the main casualties of the recent period of fiery threats and provocative moves by North Korea .

In early April , Kim Jong Un 's regime began blocking South Koreans from entering the manufacturing complex , which sits on the North 's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies .

Pyongyang then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone 's factories , saying it was temporarily suspending activity there .

The North Korean decision to halt operations surprised some observers , since Kaesong was considered an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un 's regime .
