-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thomas Corless has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando , Florida , 101 times .

`` The Disney Parks are unlike anything else on the planet , '' he said .

Corless , who runs the Disney fan site WDWNT.com , will be in Orlando this weekend to celebrate the theme park resort 's 40th birthday .

Since its opening on October 1 , 1971 , Walt Disney World -- or WDW , as it 's often referred to online -- has become the world 's most visited recreational resort . It 's also more than twice the size of New York 's Manhattan island .

People get married there , they go there on their honeymoons -LRB- more than anywhere else in the continental United States -RRB- , and of course it 's a major destination for families .

For those who go over and over again , like Corless , there is a big nostalgia factor . He counts attractions that no longer exist at the park among his favorites .

`` I think the fascination is partly nostalgia for characters & childhood memories and partly the promise of fun , '' the iReporter said . `` You know when you go to Walt Disney World , you are going to have fun . There are n't many places you can take the family and have that guarantee . ''

For other repeat visitors , like Pete Werner , a visit to the resort can mark an important point in their lives .

`` I was newly sober and only had one day to spend at Disney World while in Orlando for business -LSB- in 1993 -RSB- , '' he said . `` My first park was Epcot , and as a result of that visit , I became enamored with everything Disney . I promised myself for each year I stayed sober , I would reward myself with a visit to WDW . ''

Werner eventually moved to Orlando and started the websites WDWinfo.com and DISboards.com .

Werner does n't think one thing in particular makes the parks so special . Like him , many who visit the parks have one special memory they take with them .

`` Everyone has a story -- a memory -- that they relive every time they return , '' he said . `` Disney is really its own world -- and a place where you can escape from reality without any of the negative consequences that usually come with other forms of escapism . ''

Ryan Wilson , another hard-core fan , iReporter and creator of Main Street Gazette , said he remembers specific moments instead of rides or attractions : `` Sharing a great meal with a great collection of friends , watching my wife 's face light up as she watches fireworks burst overhead , or wandering old stomping grounds with my mom and dad . Walt Disney World is , for me , the magical place that means so much to my friends and family , and they are the heart of my experiences there . ''

Just before packing for his 102nd trip to the parks , Corless said that he believes Walt Disney World is `` unlike anything else on the planet . Sure , there are other theme parks , but they are n't even close to Walt Disney World in popularity , quality , and most certainly in meaning to American culture . ''
