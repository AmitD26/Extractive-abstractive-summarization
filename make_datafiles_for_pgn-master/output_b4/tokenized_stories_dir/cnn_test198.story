-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The gunshot wounds to two Ohio boys found dead in their grandparents ' home are consistent with a homicide-suicide , a coroner said Friday .

The two boys , who were half-brothers , were found Wednesday in Jackson , Ohio , about 75 miles south of Columbus . They were identified as Austin Wiseman , 12 , and Blake Campbell , 9 .

Both boys suffered gunshot wounds to the head .

The nature of the wounds and the bullets in their bodies indicated that the killings were a homicide-suicide , but it is not known whether they were accidental or intentional , said Dr. Gregory Hawker , the Jackson County coroner .

`` We ca n't tell -- we might not ever know , '' he said .

Family and friends have suggested that the older boy accidentally shot his younger brother and then was overcome with grief and turned the gun on himself , but there is no way to prove that forensically .

`` Authorities have taken the older boy 's computer to make sure there 's no indication of ill intent , '' Hawker said . The older boy had become obsessed with guns in the last few weeks , he said .

The boys lived with their grandparents and were unsupervised when the shooting happened , he said .

The shooting occurred in an upstairs bedroom .

`` That 's crazy to think two young boys are dead , and no one knows anything about it , '' neighbor Michael Hatley told CNN affiliate WSAZ .
