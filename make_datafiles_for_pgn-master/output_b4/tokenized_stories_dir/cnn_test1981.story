-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The majors have been and gone for another year , but golf has officially entered its most money-spinning phase of the season .

As the 2013 campaign reaches its climax an eye-watering $ 67 million in prize money will be on offer in the four FedEx Cup playoff events .

Last year 's winner , Brandt Snedeker , picked up over $ 12.5 million for 16 days ' work at tournaments backed by heavyweight sponsors like BMW , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and Coca Cola .

It reflects an industry battling back from recession , and one that is contributing more than you might think to help boost what is still a fragile economy in the United States -- which has a public debt of almost $ 17 trillion and rising .

The World Golf Foundation 's Golf 20/20 report estimates that the industry generated $ 68.8 billion in goods and services in the U.S. in 2011 , with a total economic impact of $ 176.8 billion .

`` The golf industry is larger than the spectator sports and performing arts industries combined , '' WGF chief executive Steve Mona told CNN .

`` That 's pretty substantial compared to those two . Beyond the monetary contribution it makes , it also employs close to two million Americans with a combined wage income of $ 55.6 billion .

`` What 's important about that is when people think about people employed in golf , they generally think about the Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelsons of this world .

`` That 's true , but they are at the higher end of the scale -- what people do n't tend to think about is a lot of the jobs in golf are everyday kind of jobs filled by people who are trying to slug out a living , and feed their family .

`` They 're working at restaurants , in the grill room , working on the course , taking bags out of your car , cleaning your clubs . Believe me those people are not getting rich , but that is the real backbone of the golf industry . ''

Golf is nothing if not resilient .

The deep recession of 2008 in the United States did not spare the sport , but in recent years it has come out swinging as it moves back towards the $ 75.9 billion the WGF estimates it generated in 2005 .

Those figures surely wo n't be lost on one of golf 's biggest fans , who also happens to be the President of the United States .

Barack Obama is an avid golfer -- he enjoyed a February round with the world No. 1 Tiger Woods in Florida and spent a good chunk of his recent vacation in Martha 's Vineyard on the course .

A report released by the Government Accountability Institute in April even suggested Obama has spent more hours on the golf course during his presidency than in economic meetings .

Counting the Commander in Chief as one of the game 's biggest and most influential supporters can only serve as a great advert for the game , according to Mona .

`` There are a couple of things about the President that are really very positive , '' he said .

`` One , he 's arguably the busiest man in the world with the toughest job in the world , but he can make time to play . He played five times on his recent vacation in Martha 's Vineyard .

`` That leads to the second point : the fact that he plays it by the rules , and he 's enthusiastic about it and tries to play whenever he can , speaks to the magic of the game .

`` It can be addicting in a good way and it clearly has been for the President . ''

As well as counting the most powerful man in America as a golf fan , the game has strengthened its presence on Capitol Hill in recent years .

A series of events have been designed to trumpet the growing portion of the economy that golf supports to Washington 's power brokers .

`` It 's important for us to communicate effectively in terms of the impact golf has on the economy generally and the kind of jobs it creates for everyday Americans , '' Mona explains .

`` Because when laws and regulations are being made , it 's important the golf industry is treated like any other industry of our size and scope . That relates to the second audience we 're trying to make sure understands the facts about golf , and that is the influencers of society generally . ''

However , not all politicians are in love with golf 's financial contribution -- a U.S. Congress Senator is seeking to overturn the not-for-profit status enjoyed by the PGA Tour and other sporting bodies such as the NHL and NFL which means they are exempt from federal taxes .

Forbes reported in May that of the $ 130 million the PGA Tour gave to charity last year , most of it went to the WGF -- whose main purpose is to promote golf .

`` It 's important for golf to have a good reputation in the court of public opinion and not be viewed as a sport for the privileged few played on private clubs by the affluent few , '' Mona said .

`` It 's not that game at all but it gets perceived sometimes to be that kind of sport . ''

That point of view might get temporarily sidelined while the game 's stars are in the thick of FedEx Cup action .

But while the vast sums on offer might turn some of the public off , seeing golf 's top players battle it out with such huge prizes at stake is a surefire way to get viewers to turn on . More than 30 PGA tournaments this year offer a winner 's purse of greater than $ 1 million -- by contrast the European Tour lost several events from its calendar this year due to the downturn .

And the bigger the prize pot , the more money that drips down through the system , says Mona .

`` I think it makes a very strong statement about the health and vitality of the golf industry when you have these world-class brands who want to associate with golf , '' he added .

`` They 're willing to put up significant sums to be associated with those events , and the players have the opportunity to play for the kind of money reflects very favorably on golf .

`` I always say there are two economies in golf . There 's the participation economy which is about the everyday golf facilities , trying to attract golfers and current players to play as much they can .

`` Then there 's the entertainment side of golf too and that 's where the professional tours come in . that relates to the interest of the game .

`` If we can enhance interest in the game that can lead later down the line to participation . We also know that interest in the game spawns what you 're seeing over the next few weeks .

`` When people come out to an event itself or tune in on TV , that 's why the Barclays of this world affiliate with those events .

`` It certainly an indicator of the health of the industry for sure . ''
