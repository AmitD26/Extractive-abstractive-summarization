Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The National Security Agency notched a much-needed win in court Friday after a series of setbacks over the legality and even the usefulness of its massive data collection program .

A federal judge in New York ruled the NSA 's bulk collection of data on nearly every phone call made in the United States was legal .

The ruling contrasts with another ruling last week by a federal judge in Washington , who called the same program `` almost Orwellian '' and likely unconstitutional .

In his ruling Friday , U.S. District Judge William Pauley said the NSA 's bulk collection of phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was legal . The program was revealed in classified leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden .

`` But the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of government to decide , '' said the ruling by Pauley , an appointee of President Bill Clinton .

The American Civil Liberties Union , which brought the case , said it would appeal Pauley 's ruling .

`` We are extremely disappointed with this decision , which misinterprets the relevant statutes , understates the privacy implications of the government 's surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections , '' said Jameel Jaffer , the ACLU 's deputy legal director .

Review : NSA snooping program should stay in place

President Barack Obama is examining a review of the surveillance efforts that recommended changes in how the NSA program was conducted . Obama said last week he would decide what to do about it in January .

Last week , U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said the NSA 's bulk collection of metadata -- phone records of the time and numbers called without any disclosure of content -- apparently violates privacy rights .

His preliminary ruling favored five plaintiffs challenging the practice , but Leon limited the decision only to their cases .

`` I can not imagine a more ` indiscriminate ' and ` arbitrary invasion ' than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval , '' said Leon , an appointee of President George W. Bush . `` Surely , such a program infringes on ` that degree of privacy ' that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment . ''

Leon 's ruling said the `` plaintiffs in this case have also shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of a Fourth Amendment claim , '' adding `` as such , they too have adequately demonstrated irreparable injury . ''

He rejected the government 's argument that a 1979 Maryland case provided precedent for the constitutionality of collecting phone metadata , noting that public use of telephones had increased dramatically in three decades .

Leon also noted the government `` does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA 's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack , or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature . ''

However , he put off enforcing his order barring the government from collecting the information , pending an appeal by the government .

A Justice Department spokesman said in response to Leon 's ruling that `` we believe the program is constitutional as previous judges have found . ''

Explosive revelations this year by Snowden triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks .

Snowden 's disclosures led to more public disclosure about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance .

The NSA has admitted it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies , including Microsoft , Apple , Google , Yahoo and Facebook .

The case before Leon involved approval for surveillance in April by a judge at a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for `` foreign intelligence purposes . ''

Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s , the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States .

The Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government 's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad , eventually including the metadata collection .

In order to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate it is `` relevant '' to an international terrorism investigation .

However , the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide : `` A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States , interfere with a criminal , counterterrorism , or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person . ''

In defending the program , Gen. Keith Alexander , the NSA 's director , told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that `` 15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 -LRB- of the Patriot Act -RRB- authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations . ''

Initially , telecommunications companies such as Verizon were the targets of legal action against Patriot Act provisions . Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private businesses .

The New York ruling makes it more likely that the U.S. Supreme Court will have to tackle the issue of privacy and settle the dispute over the the NSA program .

For years , the courts have relied on a 1979 Supreme Court precedent that found privacy rights did n't extend to personal information people give to third-parties such as the phone companies , which store basic data on calls made . The secret court that oversees the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has relied on that ruling to periodically reauthorize the NSA phone data program .

But technology has come a long way since then ; modern cell phones are in constant communication with phone towers and tell a lot more information about phone customers than old land line phones . And at least some justices may be ready to take on the issue again .

Ruling last year in an unrelated case , Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the 1979 standard may be `` ill suited to the digital age '' because people reveal a lot more information in seemingly mundane tasks .

`` It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties , '' she wrote .
