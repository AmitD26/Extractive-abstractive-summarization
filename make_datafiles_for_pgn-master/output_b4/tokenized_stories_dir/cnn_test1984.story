-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The mother whose toddler died in a hot car near Atlanta last month says she finds comfort in faith but struggles to get through each day .

`` Leanna Harris is living every parent 's nightmare -- the child she bore and loved every moment of his life has died . For most parents , it is difficult , if not impossible , to comprehend such a thing .

`` But for Leanna , that nightmare is all too real . She will never again be able to tuck him into bed at night and return later to check on him , '' her attorney said Tuesday in a statement .

The statement marked the first time Leanna Harris has publicly described her feelings since she made remarks at the funeral for her 22-month-old son , Cooper .

His death in a hot car tapped parents ' outrage , garnered national headlines , and sparked a wide-ranging debate about whether more can be done to prevent such deaths .

`` She mourns Cooper 's death deeply , in her own private way . She takes comfort from a strong faith in God , but the loss is still overwhelming . Getting through each day seems almost impossible , '' said Harris ' attorney , Lawrence Zimmerman .

He asked for privacy for his client , comparing her situation to that of vindicated Atlanta Olympic park bombing suspect Richard Jewell .

`` She asks that she be allowed to grieve in private without reporters calling , following or watching her home . Since his death , she has been unable to have that time of mourning that every bereaved parent needs . Please allow her the dignity to mourn her son in private , '' Zimmerman wrote .

` Constant speculation and innuendo '

Police say Leanna Harris ' husband , Justin Ross Harris , left Cooper strapped into a car seat in his SUV for seven hours while he went to work on June 18 .

Records show that the mercury topped 92 that day , and police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the boy was pronounced dead in a parking lot not far from his father 's workplace .

Ross Harris has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and child cruelty . He remains in jail .

Leanna Harris is not a suspect , although police have alleged she behaved strangely in the days before and moments after the death of her boy .

For example , Ross and Leanna Harris took turns dropping off and picking up their son at day care , and on the day Cooper died , Leanna arrived and was told that Cooper had n't been dropped off that morning .

`` Ross must have left him in the car , '' she allegedly told day-care employees .

The day-care workers told police they tried to tell her that there could be a multitude of reasons that Cooper was n't dropped off , but she insisted that Ross left him in the vehicle , Cobb County police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a hearing for Ross Harris .

He also said that Leanna Harris made an odd remark to her husband while the two were in an interview room after Ross Harris ' arrest .

`` She asked him -- she had him sit down , and he starts going through this . And she looks at him , and she 's like , ` Well , did you say too much ? ' '' the detective testified .

Leanna Harris ' attorney did not address those specific allegations in his statement , but warned against jumping to conclusions .

`` Reporters have delved into Leanna 's upbringing , her employment , quizzed people for information about her marriage , and her sex life . The constant attention has prevented her from returning to work , '' Zimmerman wrote .

`` Dealing with her grief has become more difficult as the days go on , however , in large part because of the constant speculation and innuendo in the media . Newspapers , television and online media have fostered a poisonous atmosphere in which Leanna 's every word , action and emotion -- or failure to cry in front of a crowd -- is scrutinized for some supposed hidden meaning . ''

` I miss him with all of my heart '

Leanna Harris told CNN at the beginning of the investigation that a lawyer had advised her not to speak to the media , so not much is known about her .

She did not testify at her husband 's probable cause hearing , but arrived before the proceeding began and took a seat with family members , holding hands with the woman sitting next to her .

She did speak at her son 's funeral . She told mourners in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , that before Cooper 's birth , she was concerned `` about never being able to have a child . ''

Leanna Harris described the toddler as perfect and told how he changed her and her husband 's lives .

`` As children do , he turned our lives upside-down , '' she said . `` Cleaning , changing diapers , dinner , bath time . Finally , what I would call mommy time . I would n't trade it for the world . ''

Leanna Harris said Cooper had had trouble sleeping of late , and he had slept with her and her husband the two nights before he died , `` snuggling in between both of us . ''

`` I remember turning over in the middle of the night . His mouth was open and his full toddler lips just breathing right into my face . I will cherish that moment forever . ''

She said she was `` happy '' that Cooper would miss some of life 's letdowns , including his first heartbreak , his parents ' and grandparents ' deaths and who to sit with at lunch at middle school .

`` I miss him with all of my heart . Would I bring him back ? No . To bring him back into this broken world would be selfish , '' she said .

The mother closed by saying that she was n't angry with her husband and that Cooper `` meant the world '' to Ross , whom she described as a `` wonderful daddy . ''
