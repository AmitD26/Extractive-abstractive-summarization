-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As a social network and identity platform , Google + has had a lukewarm reception . But the service has had a pair of breakout features : Hangouts and photos .

Google announced updates to both tools on Tuesday in a San Francisco art gallery decorated in photos taken by Google + users .

The company has spent the past two years forcefully pushing Google + into every nook and cranny of Google products . It says there are now 540 million active Google + users across Google , meaning they use some Google + - ified Google product in some way or another .

The number of people actually opening up Google + and checking out its stream of posts is lower , at 300 million visitors a month . For comparison , Facebook has just more than 1 billion monthly active users .

The problem with pictures

One number that does pop out is the amount of photos people are sharing to the service . Google says 1.5 billion photographs are uploaded every week . -LRB- Facebook says it has about 2.4 billion a week , or 350 million a day . -RRB-

Digital photography and mobile devices with decent cameras have created a monster . People have thousands of photos , hours of videos , and not enough time to cut through the noise , edit and share images .

`` Photography today is too hard , '' said Google senior vice president of engineering Vic Gundotra at the press conference . `` People have beautiful treasures that have become stranded in these devices . ''

Google has been focusing on making tools that automate as much of the process as possible . Hobbyists and professional photographers might enjoy carefully editing images , but average people just want to share their best vacation or family photos and move on .

When you upload photos to Facebook or Instagram , the images are compressed . For the people who use social media as a kind of backup , this can be a disadvantage down the line when they want a higher-resolution version of their image . Google + is automatically uploading images at their full resolution , and soon the feature will come to iOS .

Auto highlights , which was first was announced at the Google i/o developers conference , digs through all your images and picks out the best shots , eliminating duplicates , looking for sharpness and good exposures , and finding people it knows are important to you .

The search feature has added thousands of new automatic tags like waterfall , sunset and beach , as well as less obvious categories like `` hedgehog '' and `` manicure . '' That means you can search for pics of your daughter Sally in front a waterfall wearing sunglasses -LRB- and possibly holding a hedgehog -RRB- and get the exact images that fit that description .

There are also improved editing features , like auto-enhance , which can be toggled to high or low . If you agree with Google 's taste in photos and editing tweaks , it can save you hours of work .

Videos are even more labor-intensive than photos . The humbly named `` Auto Awesome Movie , '' takes over in much the same way Apple 's iMovie automatically creates trailers . It can stabilize videos , sync the action with music tracks , add filters and edit clips together with minimal input from the user .

`` This is not some little local client editing system , '' said Gundotra . `` This is the power of Google -- of machine learning applied to photos and videos . ''

Hangouts are for texting and GIFs

Hangouts is Google 's communication tool that dabbles in chatting , video conferencing and live broadcasting .

Hangouts on Air is popular for politicians and celebrities who want to broadcast a live chat . President Barack Obama has done Q&A s using the tool in the past . Google added features to schedule and promote Hangouts On Air before they happen , more control for producers screening questions and moderating viewers , and auto-enhance features to improve video quality .

Video calls are now higher quality and can go fullscreen . If you 'd like to make your call look more like an Instagram stream , you can add filters or auto-enhance .

FInally , to fully cover all the communication options in chats , Google is adding SMS support so people can send text messages directly from the Hangouts app . Most important , Hangouts now support our most advanced method of communication , the animated GIF . -LRB- It already allowed the second-most advanced method , the emoji . -RRB-
