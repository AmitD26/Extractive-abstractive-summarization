-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- David Beckham was always adept at curling the ball around a wall -- but when it came to the barrier of homosexuality in football , he broke straight through it .

Former England captain Beckham , who announced his retirement from football Thursday , was the first superstar footballer to embrace his `` gay icon '' status , freely giving interviews to gay magazines and openly talking about his gay fan base .

That attitude was the catalyst for a change , according to author and journalist , Chas Newkey-Burden .

`` What David Beckham did was break the long silence about homosexuality in football , '' Newkey-Burden told CNN .

`` Before Beckham came along , it was basically a taboo but he changed all that .

`` He openly courted his gay fan base , saying he loved being a gay icon and was happy for his wife to broadcast that around .

`` He was the first to give interviews to gay magazines -- before that , no footballer would have done that .

`` He also changed the way footballers were looked at . He was inherently good looking , but it was that he paid so much attention to his appearance that was unprecedented . ''

In an interview with the BBC given in 2007 , Beckham spoke of his pride at being tagged as a `` gay icon '' .

`` Maybe it 's things like -LRB- the fact -RRB- I like to look after myself , I like to look smart and presentable most of the time , '' he said at the time .

`` I always liked to look good , even when I was a little kid . I was given the option when I was a page boy once of either wearing a suit or wearing knickerbockers and long socks and ballet shoes -- and I chose the ballet shoes and knickerbockers . ''

Once Newkey-Burden spent five months trying to organize an interview with the midfielder , only for the player himself to sanction the piece after reading one of the journalist 's articles on football and homosexuality in Four Four Two magazine .

`` David read the piece I did about how far football had come in dealing with homophobia , '' Newkey-Burden recalled .

`` I know he was very moved by the fact I wrote how he had opened the door to change and that is what swung getting me the interview with him .

`` Look , there are 92 league clubs in England with each squad having around 20 players , so statistically , there must be some gay players , '' added the journalist .

`` One day it will be common place for footballers to come out and David Beckham will have played a part in that .

`` He opened the door and it is the person who opens the door who makes the difference .

`` Beckham said to the world : ` I 'm straight , I 'm the England captain and I think it 's cool people are gay . ' ''

Despite Beckham embracing his `` gay icon '' status , football continues to struggle with homophobia .

Last February , U.S. football star Robbie Rogers announced he was retiring from football after `` coming out '' -- leaving Swedish player Anton Hysen as the only openly gay player in Europe .

Rogers might yet make a return given he has been training with Los Angeles Galaxy .

Beckham was also key in footballers becoming fashionistas and attracting interest from the mainstream media , according to Newkey Burden .

`` Gay football fans do n't want 11 neatly coiffured and manicured players to admire , '' said the journalist and celebrity biographer who has written books about Adele , Brangelina , Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton .

`` They 're more attracted to the old-fashioned kind of player like Vinny Jones or Alan Shearer if I 'm honest .

`` But Beckham was someone who was proud to be a gay icon and made it cool too .

`` Just look at the number of metrosexuals who have emerged since Beckham .

`` It 's now OK for players to have silly , floppy hair and dress in the way they do . He did that . ''

Players now try to trend it like Beckham more often than they try to bend it like Beckham .

From wearing his wife 's underwear to parading around in a sarong , the former Manchester United , Real Madrid , LA Galaxy , AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain man has never been one to shy away from experimentation .

While former Spice Girl Victoria has gone on to establish herself as a leading fashion designer , it is Beckham who brought men into the 21st century with his eye for the latest trends .

From his outrageous hair styles to his love of grooming and moisturizing , Beckham relaunched the notion of the metroxsexual along with his very own brand of cologne .

Whether it was by provocatively modelng in his Armani underwear or being paraded in front of the press in another exquisitely tailored suit , Beckham set the bar high when it came to looking sharp .

`` Beckham was the antithesis to the godawful lad culture of the late Nineties , '' GQ.co.uk fashion editor Nick Carvell told CNN .

`` Being a footballer who was clearly motivated by fashion trends and absolutely loved clothes , he turned the idea of what it meant to be a stylish sportsman at the time on its head .

`` Sure he made some mistakes along the way -LRB- cornrows -RRB- , but that 's what made him a trendsetter -- he always led and never followed .

`` He was certainly one of the first celebrities to de-stigmatize grooming pursuits that were previously seen as girls-only -LRB- his early penchant for highlights comes to mind -RRB- .

`` Lots of people would say that it helps he has an athlete 's body , but there are plenty of sportsman who dress appallingly .

`` I think it 's his willingness to try new things combined with a clear appreciation for a good tailor .

`` He might have worn the occasional eye-raising get-up when he was younger , but it always fitted perfectly . ''

That infamous sarong , which he was pictured wearing in 1998 , was certainly one `` eye-raising item '' but as Newkey-Burden explains , Beckham had no regrets .

`` When I interviewed him in 2006 , I asked Beckham if he regretted wearing that ` dress ' . He said : ` No , that 's one of the things I 'd do again ! ' ''
