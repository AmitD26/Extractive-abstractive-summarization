Dubai , UAE -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Call it a perfect market storm of wealth creation .

Since the start of 2013 , the Dubai stock market has registered a near 200 % gain to become the best performing financial market in the world .

The Gulf emirate 's securing of the World Expo in 2020 is likely one factor behind this success as is the wider UAE 's reputation as a safe-haven in a region riddled with uncertainty .

Oil averaging more than $ 100 a barrel for three years running , meanwhile , is driving growth towards record spending on infrastructure .

The UAE has `` a strong balance sheet '' and lot of `` promising prospects , '' said Alia Moubayed , research director at Barclays when asked about the reasons behind investor bullishness over the last 18 months .

Some even believe there 's more to come before the Dubai Index tops out .

`` The Dow Jones exceeded 165,000 points , '' said veteran Dubai trader Zakaria Al-Assar . `` Still , Dubai -LRB- is at -RRB- 5,000 , we are looking for more , inshallah . ''

These strong expectations have led to an upgrade for the UAE from the riskier investor category of frontier market to emerging market by financial index firm , MSCI .

Alongside neighboring Qatar , which was also upgraded this week , the UAE is now considered by MSCI to have the same investment status as the likes of China and Brazil .

This change while likely increase investor confidence in the region leading to an increased flow of investment dollars into the Persian Gulf states .

`` You will get a level of comfort as an EM -LRB- emerging market -RRB- fund manager when you are upgraded to this level , '' said head of equities at NBAD Asset Management , Saleem Khokhar .

`` On top of that you will see more and more institutions beginning to play in this space so yes it is a game changer but do n't bring it into a short time frame . ''

Achieving emerging market status has been a long journey for both Qatar and the UAE .

The UAE has been knocking on the door since 2009 . But some fund managers suggest this delay actually helped the country 's markets and companies mature .

Nine companies will represent the UAE in the MSCI index , including property groups Aldar , Arabtec and Emaar . The gigantic port company DP World and the Dubai Financial Market itself will also feature .

Yet with recognition comes attention and volatility .

The trading floors in Dubai , Abu Dhabi and Doha may be quaint , with limited trading sessions , but they are active .

On the day CNN visited the Dubai exchange , banking stocks were trading up 15 % after a wild correction earlier in the month .

`` You have to remember just a couple of weeks ago we went through quite a correction and a number of blue chip stocks we were looking at came down between 20-30 % , '' said Khokhar .

After being overlooked for many years , these markets are just coming into focus for many international investors .

Expect more bumps , shocks and opportunities along the way .
