Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Domestic dispute or terror thriller ? Carol Anne Laletta Bond 's story can not be both , and now it may be left to the Supreme Court to sort out the dramatic and often confounding facts of this convicted federal felon 's appeal . Put simply , we 'll call it `` The Case of the Poisoned Paramour . ''

At issue is whether Congress may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is properly the domain of the states . Bond was given a longer prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons .

Oral arguments in the case will be heard by the justices Tuesday morning .

This case of toxic love has soap-opera elements , but Bond 's lawyers argued she was being treated like an international terrorist or a rogue state engaged in chemical warfare instead of someone caught up on the wrong end of a love triangle . They say she should have been tried in the state system , where Bond may have faced a simple assault charge and just a year behind bars .

The implications go far beyond this case , and could establish important precedents on the strength and purpose of the Constitution 's 10th Amendment , which limits federal authority . It is also an issue roiling the current political debate , especially among tea party conservatives in this post-9 / 11 , security-conscious environment .

The appeal barely made a ripple in local media and had been all but ignored until the high court first heard the issue two years ago . Now the sequel promises to answer larger questions of the limits on Washington 's power .

Bond , a native of Barbados , lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist . As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : `` Bond was excited when her closest friend , Myrlinda Haynes , announced she was pregnant . Bond 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , Clifford Bond , was the child 's father . She vowed revenge . ''

The woman -- known to her family as Betty -- struck back by putting her science training to ill use . The 42-year-old stole a dangerous chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine , to be exact -- from her company , and obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet . Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic , even lethal harm with very little physical contact . She then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox .

While she suffered no more than a chemical burn on her thumb , Haynes noticed something was amiss -- one of the chemicals is a bright orange powder -- and called local police in Lansdale , Pennsylvania , who merely suggested she wipe her car and doors regularly . Unhappy with that response , Haynes contacted her local mail carrier , and federal postal inspectors quickly jumped into the mystery . Surveillance cameras were set up and sure enough , Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and car muffler , court records show . She was soon arrested .

Her lawyer said Bond admitted her guilt early on in what they considered a case of a woman emotionally traumatized by the betrayal of two people once very close to her .

`` I did n't think that the federal government had any role to be in this case and I tried to convince them not to bring the case or just dismiss the charges , '' Robert Goldman , Bond 's defense attorney , told CNN . `` And I promised them in writing that we would go over to county court and plead and let her do her jail time in county court . I tried to convince them that by misapplying the law they could jeopardize the statute even surviving the case . But they decided to go ahead and bring these charges . ''

Bond claimed she never meant to kill Haynes , but only wanted to cause her `` an uncomfortable rash . '' The defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an `` emotional breakdown '' that made her act in such a shocking fashion .

`` The statute itself is so broad as ... to be meaningless , '' Goldman said . `` It prohibits the use of any chemical weapon . And what 's a chemical weapon ? It 's any object , any item that has toxic chemicals . If in the case of an angry spouse throwing a can of Ajax '' -- a bleach-based cleaner -- `` at his wife , or vice versa , that would be considered to be use of a chemical weapon and the terrorism statute would apply . I ca n't imagine that the people that were involved in the treaty would anticipate such a broad application . ''

When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed . She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution .

An appeals court ultimately rejected her claims , citing a 1920 Supreme Court precedent giving Congress the power to enact treaties , even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws . Before she could take the challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court , she needed a ruling that she had `` standing , '' or authority , to press her larger constitutional claims . The high court recognized that standing In a unanimous 2011 decision . She now gets her second date before the court and perhaps a final resolution .

The Obama administration still believes Bond 's federal conviction was valid .

`` The Constitution does not prohibit federal prosecution in an area of overlapping federal and state authority , '' the Justice Department said in its brief to the high court , rejecting Bond 's assertion the treaty makes an exception for chemicals used for `` peaceful '' purposes that are not `` warlike '' in nature . `` No reasonable construction of that phrase would cover petitioner 's conduct . Petitioner 's deployment of highly toxic chemicals with the intent of harming Haynes can hardly be characterized as ` peaceful ' under that word 's commonly understood meaning . ''

The government says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can `` cause death , temporary incapacitation , or permanent harm '' to another person -- exactly what Bond did here .

Some see hope the right-leaning majority on the bench might use the opportunity to delve further into Act 2 of this legal drama -- the scope of the 10th Amendment , which states , `` The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people . ''

In the broader political context , conservatives , along with a healthy mix of liberals and libertarians , worry that the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states , especially in the criminal arena .

Many scholars and activists argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh , creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety . They see Bond as an unexpected hero in that fight to return `` the power back to the people . ''

`` There 's a concern that a number of people have , really across the political spectrum , that we have over-federalized crime , that it is too easy for Congress to pass a new law , '' said Paul Clement , Bond 's appellate attorney who was U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush . `` There is some outrage in America when politicians pass a law to create a new federal offense , without people stopping and thinking whether that 's something that local law enforcement can deal with . ''

And it is not just felonies . Areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulation , taxation , health care , and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of a high court decision .

`` You now have a road map -- if you find the limitations on the federal government 's authority irksome , any president has a simple path to get around it . Find any nation in the world , negotiate a treaty agreeing to do what you could n't do otherwise , and if the Senate ratifies it ... then suddenly the federal government has authority it did n't have before , '' said Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , last week . `` The proposition that the Treaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible . ''

As for Bond , the current legal fight will not provide her much practical benefit . She was released from a federal prison in West Virginia 14 months ago , so a second high court victory may only be symbolic .

She has not talked publicly about her case , but her trial lawyer says the husband is supporting Bond in the appeals . When last we checked , the couple was trying to overcome his infidelity and had been working to rebuild their shaky marriage . She had allowed him to visit her while she was incarcerated .

The case is Bond v. U.S. -LRB- 12-158 -RRB- . A ruling is expected by the spring .
