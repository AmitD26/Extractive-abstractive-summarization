-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I 've never understood how someone can eat just one Oreo .

In my mind , those scrumptious cookies are supposed to be eaten in groups of six or eight or more , and it would be a culinary sin not to wash them down with a large glass of milk .

My name is Ron Cothran , and I am a food addict .

I used to fill up on stuff , not really knowing what I was eating but just going through the motions until I got my `` fix . '' Most of the time I was left with guilt , gas and a growing stomach to accompany my gluttony .

People would tell me simply `` do n't eat that '' or `` just do n't buy it '' or `` leave it alone . '' Once in a while , it would work . But most of the time , there was an almost uncontrollable urge to indulge -- I just had to have whatever it was that I thought my taste buds were craving .

Is it possible for a person to be addicted to something that they need to sustain life ? Modern science tells us that the nicotine in cigarettes can be as addictive as heroin . We know that alcoholics are always susceptible to their drink of choice .

But what about food ? There 's compelling research to suggest certain foods affect the brain 's pleasure centers the same way addictive substances do , but experts disagree on whether the cravings rise to the level of addiction .

Diabetes took my teeth but not my life

After my gastric bypass surgery , I had to eat only soft foods for two weeks . During that time , a national chain was advertising its chicken-fried steak sandwich . That was the last thing I needed after what I had just put my body through . But the urge was so strong that I ended up going to the restaurant , ordering the sandwich , and bite by bite , chewing each morsel , then spitting it out back into the bag .

How stupid was that ? I could have endangered myself if I had swallowed , but I felt I had to satisfy the craving .

My name is Ron Cothran , and I am a food addict .

I know now that my addiction to food was a symptom of a much deeper problem . I ca n't tell you when it started , but food had become my confidant . It would n't openly condemn me ; it would n't make fun of me . It made me feel good -LRB- while I was eating it -RRB- , and it was always there when I wanted attention . It was my little secret -- my reward for working so hard for everybody else .

Fit Nation : Too young not to run

I did n't realize this about myself until I had gone through my surgery and was forced to find a new way to deal with difficult circumstances . I no longer could eat to feel better ; I needed to find a healthier way to deal with life .

I chose to make a healthy lifestyle my goal , and notable successes I found along the way became the warm fuzzies I needed to validate that I was a worthy individual . I believe that my food addiction is real . I have been `` sober '' now for six years and two months , and I feel great .

Here 's the good news : As long as you have breath , you have the ability to change . It is not a battle of the tongue , but a battle of the mind . Yes , I used weight loss surgery to start the process , but it is only a tool , not a cure . I had to hit rock bottom before I realized that I have the ability to decide each day how my life is going to go .

Once I made the decision to live the second half of my life better than the first , a new journey began . It has been rough at times . I still get a craving now and then , but the difference is in how I respond . I have let things into my life that have so much more value than the satisfaction of a chicken-fried steak sandwich .

Nothing tastes as good as the feeling of good health .
