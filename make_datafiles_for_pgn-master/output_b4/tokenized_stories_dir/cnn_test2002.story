GUATEMALA CITY , Guatemala -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Guatemalan voters saw the top five top candidates in their country 's presidential race square off in a historic debate Thursday evening , a contrast to the violence and name-calling that has marred the campaign in recent months .

Alvaro Colom , Eduardo Suger , Rigoberta Menchu , Alejandro Giammattei and Otto Perez Molina debate .

A major topic among the presidential contenders was how to reduce Guatemala 's high crime rate and violence .

They also addressed concerns about the illegal migration of Guatemalans to the United States , with two candidates calling the migrants `` heroes . ''

The televised debate , co-sponsored by CNN en Espa√±ol and Guatemala 's Channel 3 , came 10 days before the general election in which 5 million Guatemalans are eligible to go to the polls to select a president and vice president , along with 158 congressional deputies .

The debate was viewed as a landmark step forward for Guatemala 's democracy and was televised throughout the Western Hemisphere .

While there are 14 candidates in the presidential race , only five have registered significant support in public opinion polls . If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of all votes cast September 9 , a runoff would be held November 4 .

Alvaro Colom of the center-left National Union of Hope , considered a front-runner , said reducing poverty would help reduce crime .

`` Crime is not just about prosecution ; it 's not just about justice , '' Colom said . `` Crime also has its origins in Guatemala 's profound social problems -- poverty , marginalization , discrimination , neglect . Our comprehensive program has a part that is about security , but the counterweight to it is the human solidarity program , so that we really have health , housing , jobs , and we can truly build a better Guatemala . ''

Retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the conservative Patriot Party , also considered a front-runner , said he would strengthen Guatemala 's police and military while getting tough with criminals . Molina said the death penalty , which he said was on the books but `` in limbo , '' was needed .

Molina warned criminals that they would face a strong president who would protect Guatemalans if he were elected .

Prisons Director Alejandro Giammattei , the candidate of outgoing President Oscar Berger 's Grand National Alliance party , said he would work to keep high-risk youths from joining gangs . Giammattei also called for gun control laws and measures to battle organized crime and its financing .

Rigoberta Menchu of the Encounter for Guatemala party , a 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner , said the national police force should be purged and corrupt politicians prosecuted . Menchu also criticized the system of white-collar privilege in the country 's prisons . She said no one in Guatemala has had the courage to fight organized crime .

Eduardo Suger of Center for Social Action called for the country 's judicial branch to be depoliticized . Suger said the creation of Guatemala 's Commission Against Impunity was an acknowledgment that the government was not doing its duty to protect citizens .

The political debate has been overshadowed by a wave of violence that has seen more than 40 candidates , activists and political leaders killed since the campaigns officially kicked off May 2 .

The `` extremely concerning '' level of violence led Amnesty International to release an open letter to candidates this week asking that they `` ensure the electoral campaign is conducted in a manner consistent with respect for the rule of law and human rights standards . ''

The human rights group also called for an end to `` clandestine groups who operate with absolute impunity '' 11 years after the country 's long-running civil war officially came to a close .

Colom , whose National Union of Hope has been hit hardest by the killings , told international reporters this month : `` Of 18 assassinations of our people , 14 were without any doubt carried out by organized crime . ''

All five candidates generally agreed on the issue of illegal migration to the United States , saying their government needed to improve living conditions in Guatemala so there would be less incentive to leave . They also agreed that the Guatemalan government should work closely with Washington to make life better for those who do migrate .

Molina estimated that 60 percent of the 1.3 million Guatemalans in the United States were undocumented , but he said they provide Guatemala with its main source of foreign currency .

Menchu called it `` an embarrassment '' that Guatemala could not negotiate for better living conditions for citizens who have moved to the United States and `` are building houses and schools '' there . She said she would create a negotiating team to push for the well-being of Guatemalans in the United States .

Giammattei called the migrants `` national heroes '' who risk their lives for a better future but labeled the situation a `` badge of shame '' for Guatemala because the country has n't generated opportunities for its people at home .

Colom said the migrants to the United States were `` true heroes who go there to work , not to bother anyone ; they go there in search of a dream . '' Colom said he would `` build a great nation that will generate hope here in Guatemala and bring hope back to Guatemala . ''

Suger said that as president he would negotiate a 10-year program with the United States to provide educational programs for Guatemalan migrants so they could finish school , which he said would allow them to return to Guatemala with new skills and money saved . E-mail to a friend
