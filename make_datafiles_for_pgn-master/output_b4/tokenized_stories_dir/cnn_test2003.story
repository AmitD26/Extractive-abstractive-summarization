Tokyo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police have detained two American men as part of an investigation into the strangling death of an Irish exchange student in Tokyo , Japanese authorities said Sunday .

Nicola Furlong , 21 , was found dead in a hotel room with one of the men , according to Tokyo police .

The men were not charged in Furlong 's death . Rather , police arrested the men on suspicion of improperly touching Furlong 's friend in a taxi early Thursday , as the four headed back to the hotel , authorities said .

Authorities would not say how the four ended up together , but Japanese media reported that the women were attending a Nicki Minaj concert in Tokyo when they met the men and decided to accompany them to their hotel rooms .

Police said both men in custody were entertainers -- a 19-year-old musician and a 23-year-old dancer -- but did not say if they were part of Minaj 's entourage .

The hotel staff found Furlong unconscious after customers complained of loud noises coming from the room , police said .

When the staff got to the room , they found her in the room with the 19-year-old and called the fire department , Tokyo authorities said .

The death is believed to be as a result of suffocation by cervical compression , police said .

Furlong 's parish priest , the Rev. Jim Fitzpatrick , described her as an `` outgoing , bubbly sort of girl and very well liked , '' and said she was looking forward to coming home after having been in Japan since October .

`` Everyone 's a little devastated , '' in her close-knit rural community , which has only 300 or 400 families , he said .

`` When the death of a young person happens , everybody knows and is in some way involved or concerned , '' he said . `` When it happens in tragic circumstances and so far away from home , it has a double impact on people . ''

Her parents last spoke to her the day she died , he said .

She was `` very close '' to her siblings , particularly her sister Andrea , Fitzpatrick said .

The U.S. State Department confirmed the arrests , but could not provide additional details , citing privacy concerns .

CNN 's Jamie Crawford , Randi Kaye and Bharati Naik contributed to the report .
