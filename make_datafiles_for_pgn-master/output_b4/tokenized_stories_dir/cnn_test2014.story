-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A major general who formerly headed U.S. Army operations in Japan will be forced to retire and do so at a lower rank after the military concluded that he failed to `` properly address '' sexual assault allegations in his command , the Army said on Wednesday .

Army Secretary John McHugh has directed that Maj. Gen. Michael T. Harrison `` be retired '' as a brigadier general , according to a statement .

The Army said federal law requires that officers retire `` at the highest grade '' at which they served satisfactorily and McHugh determined that in Harrison 's case , it was one step below his current rank , the statement said .

Reports of military sex assault up sharply

An Army investigation found that Harrison mishandled sex assault allegations reported to the command , Lt. Col. Alayne Conway said . No other details were provided .

Harrison was suspended from his post as head of U.S. forces in Japan last year amid the investigation .

The military has struggled with the issue of sexual misconduct reports within its ranks .

Survivors of military sex assaults frustrated with legislation

Under current guidelines , military commanders have the authority to decide whether their subordinates should face prosecution when such allegations emerge .

A debate in Congress over whether to remove that decision-making process from the command structure was the subject of political infighting earlier this year .

Harrison joined the Army in 1980 served in numerous capacities around the world . He is due to retire in October .
