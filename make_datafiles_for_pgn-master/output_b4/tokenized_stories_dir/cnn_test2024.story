-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The `` conservagencia '' is starting to give Jon Huntsman a second look . He deserves it . But the stirrings of respect may be too little , too late . Too bad , because he might stand the best chance of beating President Barack Obama .

RINO hunting has become a reflexive sport inside the Republican Party . And so when Jon Huntsman entered the presidential race , the impulse was to smack him on style points as a Republican in Name Only . It made some sense on the surface -- after all , he was the former Obama ambassador to China , in addition to being the conservative former governor of Utah . At a time when tea party enthusiasm tended toward the hot , Huntsman was cool , promising a campaign of civility and ideas .

He seemed to be courting independents and centrists at the outset of the GOP primary , openly dissing the anti-intellectualism of conservative populist candidates such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann . In one infamous tweet , he pined : `` I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming . Call me crazy . ''

All this was very out of step with the partisan tone of the times . And so his actual record as governor and his policy plans as candidate were overlooked . Forget the record of cutting taxes , reforming government , improving the business climate and balancing the budget . Forget that he was the one candidate with real-world foreign policy experience . He was an apostate in a cult-like atmosphere where any dissent is seen as disloyalty .

No one was happier than the White House , which was apparently most worried about running against Huntsman -LRB- `` I think our guys were worried about Huntsman . I think he was the one who people were most worried about '' recounted one Obama aide in Politico writer Mike Allen 's and author Evan Thomas ' new e-book , `` The Right Fights Back '' -RRB- .

So Huntsman had the buzz but no support -- he seemed stuck in the low single digits and even would-be supporters shrugged their shoulders .

It seemed to say more about the current makeup of the Republican Party than it did about Jon Huntsman .

After all , he was the first candidate to embrace U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan 's plan for deficit reduction . His jobs plan was touted by The Wall Street Journal in uncommon terms : `` Mr. Huntsman 's proposal is as impressive as any to date in the GOP Presidential field , and certainly better than what we 've seen from the front-runners . '' He even had the guts to proclaim a determination to end the collusion and market distortion of `` Too Big to Fail '' -- a cause that could unite Tea Partiers and Occupy protesters .

But even though 70 % of Republican primary voters say that economic issues are their primary focus , Huntsman 's conservative substance could not seem to override the centrist style : He would not pander or throw radioactive red meat .

Even the statistical analysis by the fivethirtyeight blog at The New York Times , which found Huntsman would have the best chance of actually beating Obama in the 2012 general election , did not seem to change hearts and minds .

But as the revolving door of not-Romneys spun faster and faster , spitting out candidates from Bachmann and Perry to Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich , a desperate search for an electable conservative alternative to Romney commenced .

And now , all of a sudden , the Utah governor has started to get some respect .

CNN contributor Will Cain was an early advocate of Huntsman 's substantive record as a conservative , in contrast to the style he evinced at the start of his campaign .

`` In this Republican primary , a candidate 's conservativeness seems to be measured by his venom toward Barack Obama , '' Cain wrote in The Blaze . `` And I 'm afraid we 've elevated style to such a degree that it 's clouding our view of what is conservative . ''

RedState.org editor and CNN contributor Erik Erickson is another unexpected voice lately arguing that Huntsman might just be the real conservative in the race : `` His record as a governor is more conservative than Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney combined . He is more pro-life than either of them . He is more economically wedded to the free market than either of them . He has better foreign policy experience than either of them . Huntsman should be a conservative hero in this race . ''

Conservative wise man George Will even seems to be making the case in comments delivered on the `` Laura Ingraham Show , '' saying : `` I think if you look at Jon Huntsman 's record , what he 's laid out , his proposals for taxes and the economy , his opposition to No Child Left Behind , you could make a case that he deserves a searching second look from conservatives . Huntsman 's position on foreign policy is the most conservative . That is , it is the most modest in assessing the need and ability of the United States to control distant events . ''

Jon Huntsman is putting all his chips on New Hampshire , where he 's been inching forward in the polls . Unlike the Iowa caucus , it 's a state with an open primary where independents can vote and a principled center-right perspective might be rewarded .

Tonight he will get a chance to shine in a Lincoln-Douglas style debate with Gingrich in New Hampshire . It might prove to be a highlight of the 2012 campaign -- a substantive and civil debate about ideas , providing more light than heat .

As conservatives consider the choice between the two flawed front-runners , Gingrich and Romney , they might reconsider the wisdom of purging center-right candidates like Jon Huntsman on matters of style versus substance . In the process , they just might finally find the perfect marriage of ideology and electability for which they have been looking .
