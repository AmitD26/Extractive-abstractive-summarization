Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Afghan Taliban are prepared to open an `` office outside the country for talks with foreigners , '' a purported spokesman for the movement said in a statement released Tuesday .

The statement could signal the Taliban 's public willingness to talk to the United States for the first time .

Calling himself `` Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan spokesman , '' Zabiullah Mujaheed said the Taliban have a `` preliminary agreement with Qatar and other respective sides . ''

The Taliban are asking for the release of prisoners from the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , in exchange for opening the office , he said .

He said the group is also `` ready for talks and negotiation inside the country . ''

It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001 , when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country .

It is not clear if the purported spokesman speaks for all parts of the loose-knit Afghan Taliban .

His statement was released in Pashto , a local language .

`` The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to solve any problem with its opposite side through talks , '' the statement said .

The U.S. Embassy in Kabul responded cautiously to the statement .

`` We support an Afghan-led reconciliation process in which the Taliban breaks with al Qaeda , renounces violence and accepts the Afghan constitution , especially protections for minorities and women , '' said Gavin Sundwall , a U.S. Embassy spokesman .

In Washington , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States is prepared to support an Afghan-led reconciliation . `` But this process will only be successful if the Taliban are prepared to renounce violence , break ties with al Qaeda , support the Afghan constitution in all of its elements , including human rights for all citizens , and particularly for women , '' she said .

Nuland said U.S. officials are not aware of any formal announcement , `` but we are prepared to support a process that the Afghans support . ''

A top Afghan peace official said he was `` cautiously optimistic '' about the Taliban statement .

`` We are optimistic that they want to come to the negotiating table , but we have to be cautious because words alone are not enough , '' said Ismail Qassemyar , a member of the country 's High Peace Council .

He agreed with the Americans that talks had to take place between Afghans .

The peace talks are `` an Afghan process ... . Americans ca n't give them anything in Afghanistan because America ca n't make any decision on behalf of the Afghan nation , '' he said .

Last week he warned against the United States or other nations trying to strike their own peace deals with the militants .

`` We ask our international friends not to hold any kind of talks with the Taliban leaders , '' Qassemyar said December 27 .

Recent media reports have said the United States and other foreign governments with a stake in the Afghan war may try to strike a separate deal with the Taliban .

The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the Taliban 's public renunciation of international terrorism and the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay .

The deal collapsed , the Post said , because of Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's objections .

Any talk of a peace process slowed in September when suicide bombers killed senior Afghan peace negotiator and former President Burhannudin Rabbani .

Karzai told CNN in December that the government can not hold talks until the Islamic militia identifies a representative with the authority to negotiate .

Karzai said Rabbani 's death showed that `` we were actually talking to nobody . ''

`` A man who came in the name of a messenger for peace turned out to be a suicide bomber , '' Karzai said . `` Therefore , we have now clearly said that we will welcome a Taliban address , but that address must have the clarity that this representative is authorized and is representing the Taliban movement as we see it . ''

Qassemyar said a Taliban office in Qatar would by no means legitimize the Islamist group .

`` We accept an address for the Taliban in Qatar if they come there as a movement or a group , not a government or use it as a propaganda venue , '' he said .
