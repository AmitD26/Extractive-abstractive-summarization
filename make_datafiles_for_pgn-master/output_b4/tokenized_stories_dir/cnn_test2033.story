-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- You never know what you 're going to find in an unused storage room . Employees at the National Institutes of Health , for example , recently discovered some old vials of variola .

You may know variola by its less formal name -- smallpox . Yes , the deadly virus that was the scourge of civilization for centuries . It 's been considered an eradicated disease ever since 1980 , following successful worldwide vaccination programs . The last known outbreak in the U.S. was in 1947 in New York .

Childhood vaccination programs are safe , seriously

The vials appear to date back to the 1950s , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which released a statement on Tuesday about the discovery .

Scientists made the discovery when they were preparing to move a lab from the Food and Drug Administration 's Bethesda , Maryland , campus to a different location . The laboratory had been used by the NIH but was transferred to the FDA in 1972 . The vials were located in an unused part of a storeroom .

When the scientists found the vials , they immediately put them in a containment lab and on July 1 notified the branch of the government that deals with toxic substances , called the Division of Select Agents and Toxins .

The CDC says there is no evidence that any of the vials was breached , nor were any of the lab workers exposed to the virus .

On Monday , law enforcement agencies transferred the vials to the CDC 's high-containment facility in Atlanta . Testing confirmed that there was variola virus DNA in the vials . Scientists will do some more testing to see if it could grow in tissue culture . Once the tests are done , the CDC will destroy the samples .

The CDC is one of only two official World Health Organization designated repositories for smallpox . The other is in Novosibirsk , Russia . The CDC let the WHO know about the find and invited the WHO to witness the destruction of the vials , which is the standard protocol any time anyone finds smallpox samples unexpectedly .

The FBI is investigating how the samples ended up where they did .
