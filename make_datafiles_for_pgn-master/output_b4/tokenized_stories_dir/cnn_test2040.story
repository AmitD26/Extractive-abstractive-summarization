-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The brand name Yukos no longer exists and its former founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky has left Russia after being freed from jail , but a landmark ruling in the Hague released Monday ensures their legacy will live on during a sensitive period of time for Vladimir Putin .

Yukos was one of Russia 's oil giants through the 1990s and until the early 2000s , when its assets were expropriated by the state after a political battle with Khodorkovsky .

Now the Permanent Court of Arbitration , in what is considered a landmark judgment , has ordered payment of damages to its former shareholders , totaling $ 50 billion and including interest and fees for violation of a treaty covering Russia 's energy assets .

This case goes back to 2005 and strikes at the heart of Putin 's tactics to strip Yukos and Khordorkovsky under charges of tax evasion .

The three judge panel called the Federation 's move `` equivalent of expropriation of claimants ' investments . '' Those claimants , representing Group Menatep Ltd. or GML , include former Yukos CEO Platon Lebedev and four others who were seeking damages of up to $ 114 billion .

The main asset of Yukos , known as Yuganskneftegaz , was auctioned in late 2004 for just $ 9.3 billion and purchased by state-run Rosneft , which is now run by Putin confidant Igor Sechin .

The Russian president has big plans for Rosneft to be one of the top energy players in the world . It now has an enterprise value of $ 115 billion , but that is just a start with agreements signed with Exxon-Mobil , ENI of Italy and its largest shareholder BP , which has a 20 % stake in the group .

Rosneft holds the position that it did not participate in the arbitrations and therefore is not bound by the rulings . In a statement it said , `` Rosneft believes that all of its purchases of former Yukos assets , and all other actions taken by it with respect to Yukos were entirely lawful and proper applicable law . ''

The response from Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during a press conference Monday was equally unforgiving about the actions taken .

`` The process is not over ; appellations are allowed , '' Lavrov said . `` The Russian side , as well as agencies representing Russia in this trial will use all available legal possibilities to defend their stance . ''

This ruling comes as Moscow faces intense scrutiny for its support of the ongoing fight by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine . Another round of European Union economic sanctions are pending after Washington proceeded to tighten the noose earlier this month .

Khodorkovsky was not part of this case , but an attorney who represented the former oligarch during his trial on charges by the Russian state said the ruling serves as a partial vindication for his former client .

According to Robert Amsterdam , `` this is a very important decision to be read by all those who lose assets to autocrats . '' The arbitrators , he said , had `` very heroically '' cut through `` mistruths '' to find in favor of the claimants .

This ruling could not only influence Western-led sanctions on Moscow , but could potentially strain talks to find common ground between Russia , Ukraine and the European Union over future gas supplies into Europe .
