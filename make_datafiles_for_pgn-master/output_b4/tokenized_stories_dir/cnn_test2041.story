-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- I have n't had a single Diet Coke in 2014 . It was a conscious health decision , and the only real side effect , now , is that the world is awful and I hate everything .

Including puppies .

Quite frankly , my life was much better when I drank Diet Coke . It had purpose .

Mind you , that purpose was to spend seven hours a day in front of a urinal . But some really good ideas came out of that .

`` Andrew , we should totally build an ark . ''

I 've actually written before about my Diet Coke addiction . It was legitimately bad . There was even a short period where it was pretty much all I drank .

For instance , I would come home from a jog , tired and dehydrated having just spent a whole 20 minutes mildly exerting myself , and then I 'd take long , deep pulls from a two-liter bottle , fresh and cold right out of the fridge .

Just do it .

Of course I miss Diet Coke , and I still get the urges . But it usually ends after about an hour when one of the neighbors sees me crying in the street without pants and calls the cops .

Thankfully , however , all that seems to be a thing of the past , because now there 's a new virtual reality video game that lets you digitally enjoy the greatest pleasure in all the world .

It 's called Soda Drinker Pro . And it 's totally real .

I played it .

The game was created by 33-year-old Will Brierly of Cambridge , Massachusetts , and , like all good innovations , it was inspired by laziness .

`` I woke up in the middle of the night and needed a soda , '' he told me via e-mail . `` Unfortunately , I did n't have one , so I decided to make a simulated soda . ''

Amazingly , over the course of one day , Brierly created the first five levels of Soda Drinker Pro . Which is probably why the graphics are what some experts might call complete and utter crap .

But that 's part of the Soda Drinker Pro charm . It 's purposefully absurd , and , remember , this thing was built in a day .

So , the game is n't exactly Rome .

It 's more like Tulsa .

And the rules are pretty simple . You walk around different environments with a virtual soda in your hand , click left to put the straw up to your mouth , and then click right to simulate drinking .

You hear the sound of draining fluid , and your soda levels deplete as you hold down the click .

And that 's pretty much it . May the odds be ever in your favor .

Truth be told , I did n't actually play long enough to get past levels one and two -LRB- the beach and the park , respectively -RRB- , but I 'm sort of hoping that one of the now 100-plus levels is a drainage ditch in Tijuana so I can recreate some of my darkest moments with Diet Coke .

`` SeÃ ± or , usted estÃ ¡ asustando a los niÃ ± os . ''

Now , this might all sound a bit silly , and the bad graphics and simplistic game play are fine for goofing off on your Mac or PC , but Brierly has actually taken his `` first person soda '' to the next legitimate level of gaming .

He proudly boasts that it has Kinect support for Xbox One , and that console will also offer exclusive levels of drinking soda throughout time .

Like the Roaring 20s . Or , say , 1972 .

And Soda Drinker Pro even has Oculus Rift support .

-LRB- Note to Dad : Oculus Rift is that incredible virtual reality software Facebook bought for $ 2 billion . -RRB-

-LRB- Note to Dad : Facebook is that website mom is always on . -RRB-

-LRB- Note to Dad : Virtual reality is ... oh , screw it . Never mind . -RRB-

Beyond the fact that it 's catching on at all -- albeit ironically -- it 's also interesting that it 's happening now . Brierly created the game six years ago , but it took a rather captive audience to get it off the ground .

He explains , `` I did n't show anyone except some friends , but last year I did a presentation of Soda Drinker Pro at a soda drinking convention in Providence . ''

You read that correctly .

There 's literally something called the Providence Soda Club , and apparently they hold a convention .

Which , I suppose , should n't be that unexpected . Rhode Island is so weird . It 's not even an island .

It 's more like Tulsa .
