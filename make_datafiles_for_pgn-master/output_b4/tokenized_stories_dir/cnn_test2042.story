-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been described as the symbolic voice of God .

You can hear it trumpeting across Israel and Jewish communities everywhere during the Jewish New Year , Rosh Hashanah , which begins at sundown on September 24 .

Crafted from the horn of a kosher animal , the shofar is `` an instrument that releases , symbolically , God 's voice , '' according to shofar expert Robert Weinger . `` We are waking up our spirituality . To return to god to actually cleanse ourselves . ''

Weinger , an American , worked in the food and beverage industry for over 20 years before he found his calling . Now , he imports shofars to the United States from Israel .

Aside from importing shofars , Weinger also plays it for people and at synagogues . But when he does , he says it 's not about him .

`` I do n't strike a pose and have the focus on me , '' says Weinger . `` The focus is on the breath of God , which is being released through me . ''

The instrument is almost as old as Judaism , dating back thousands of years to the time of Abraham and Isaac .

`` First , during Rosh Hashanah , we sound the shofar to coronate God as the king , '' says Rabbi Meir Schweiger of the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies . `` The second , is that the shofar is seen as an alarm , a kind of wake-up call . Take stock of what you 've done over the past year . ''

The Jewish calendar enters the year 5775 . Rosh Hashanah marks the time Jews believe God created man . `` It also marks the day when Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil , '' says Schweiger says .

But first , this alarm needs to be created .

In a nondescript workshop in Tel Aviv , Eli Ribak grinds down the rough edges of a ram 's horn . Surrounding him are sacks of raw horns fill every corner , rising to the ceiling .

Ribak 's family has been crafting shofars for three generations -- and his partner 's family since the 14th century . Their company , Shofarot-Israel , is one of the biggest producers of shofars in the world .

Around the Jewish New Year , the horn blasts fill his small showroom . Boxes of all types of shofars line the walls . There are some made out of long and spiral antelope horns , curved rams horns and buffalo horns . But not every horn can be turned into a shofar .

`` According to Jewish law , the shofar has to be something that is actually hallow inside , '' Schweiger says . `` You ca n't have the shofar of a cow and in fact the preferred shofar is a ram 's horn . ''

Customers at Ribak 's shop test each one trying to find that perfect pitch .

`` We need to select the right shofar to the person , '' says Ribak . `` If a good shofar works for you . It wo n't necessarily be a good shofar for someone else . ''

If a customer does n't know how to play the instrument , Ribak can teach them . Much like the trumpet `` you have to ensure that no air escapes from a very tiny hole in your lips , '' says Ribak . `` Straight and fast , that is how you blow a shofar . ''

For Weinger , he is listening for a specific sound .

`` I am listening for the heart of god . I am listening for that pure sound that is in complete harmony . ''
