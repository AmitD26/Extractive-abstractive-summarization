-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On Wednesday , Apple is expected to unveil the newest version of its iPad with all of the breathless hype that typically attends the consumer-tech juggernaut 's public events .

But some folks , many of them Apple customers and self-described fanboys and fangirls , are n't celebrating . Instead , they 're calling on the company to shore up human rights concerns by manufacturing an `` ethical iPad 3 . ''

The creator of a campaign asking Apple to ensure safer conditions for workers at the Chinese plants that make its products is asking supporters to take to Facebook on Wednesday , posting pleas to Apple on the iTunes Facebook page .

Last month , Mark Shields , a self-described `` Apple person , '' started a petition on Change.org . The petition has more than 241,000 signatures and asks , among other things , for Apple to create a worker-protection strategy around the release of new products such as the anticipated new iPad .

Worker-rights groups say that Foxconn , the Chinese manufacturer that produces products for Apple and other tech companies , has a stringent , militaristic culture of surveillance and obedience . It 's a culture that labor groups say contributed to a slew of suicides in 2010 at the company 's Shenzhen plant -- prompting Foxconn to install nets in an effort to prevent employees from jumping -- as well as worker injuries and even deaths .

`` Many of the people who have signed Mark 's petition have expressed concern that without a strategy to prevent forced overtime , impossible production quotas and worker injury , that worker abuse , accidents , and even death may increase around the release of the iPad 3 , '' said Amanda Kloer , campaign director at Change.org .

`` Mark hopes that if Apple customers ask the company about how the iPad 3 was made , Apple will respond to his request for a worker protection strategy for new product releases . ''

Shields was traveling Tuesday and not able to be reached for comment .

Contacted by CNN on Tuesday , Apple did not have any comment . In a statement to CNN last month , Apple said it cares about all of the workers in its worldwide supply chain .

`` We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made , '' the company said . `` Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple . ''

After a wave of publicity last month that included a CNN interview with a Foxconn worker , Foxconn announced it had given workers a pay increase and was allowing an international labor-rights group to visit one of its facilities .

Kloer said Shields has never gotten a response from Apple about creating a worker protection strategy , even though he was promised one by the manager at a Washington , D.C. , Apple store where he delivered the petition .

Shields and Kloer are asking supporters on Wednesday to post on the iTunes page on Facebook `` asking for an ethical iPad 3 . ''

Apple has not officially said what Wednesday 's announcement will be , but all speculation centers on a new iPad . Many reports suggest it may actually be called the iPad HD to showcase a new , high-resolution display screen .
