Donetsk , Ukraine -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the city of Donetsk , the devastation wrought by weeks of fighting between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces is all too apparent .

And as the civilians caught in the crossfire sweep up the debris of their homes and livelihoods , they are hardened against a president they say is killing his own people .

Alexander Omelyavenko , a Donetsk resident , told CNN , `` We are Ukrainian but they kill us , so we probably need our own country . Because these people in Kiev , they are not brothers for us . ''

Another resident , Victoria Khrushova , wiped away tears as she told how her family had been forced to hide from the shelling in cellars .

`` We live underground . It was so hard for two weeks -- especially 27th , 28th , 29th -- but only today is quiet , '' she said .

The husband of a 34-year-old woman killed outside a block of flats last Wednesday would n't talk to CNN , saying he was in shock . He made it down to the cellar with their small child but she simply did n't have time . A 50-year-old woman was killed with his wife .

It 's a story which repeats itself over and over in dozens of apartment blocks , with civilians being killed by the constant shelling around Donetsk . Windows are shattered , holes blasted in walls and blackened rafters which once supported the roofs of homes stand in bleak outline against the sky .

The victims are the human face of a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding even as diplomatic efforts to curb the fighting plow on .

The United Nations ' refugee agency , UNHCR , said Tuesday that the number of people displaced in Ukraine by the fighting , particularly around Donetsk and Luhansk , had more than doubled in less than a month .

While an estimated 117,000 had fled their homes as of August 5 , the agency puts the number displaced as of September 1 at 260,000 .

UNHCR believes the actual number displaced is higher , as many are staying with families and friends and choose not to register with the authorities . Nearly 95 % of those forced from their homes are from eastern Ukraine and most remain in the region , its report said .

` Be human ... Stop this war '

Donetsk , once-thriving , is now half-empty , shop fronts shattered and its railway station bombed .

Its trauma hospital is filled with the civilian wounded who were unable to reach safety in time as the shells rained down .

Medical teams treat market traders with shrapnel embedded in their legs or the broken limbs of pensioners too old or sick to run .

`` There was one war and this is the second war . I was born in 1940 in World War II and I will probably die before this war is over , '' said elderly resident Valentina Sergeyevna .

Valentina Popova , in the ward next door , has lost her leg and her arm to indiscriminate artillery shells .

Switching to the Ukrainian language , she made a heartrending plea to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko .

`` We used to dance , sing , do everything in Ukrainian . Poroshenko , Mr. Poroshenko -- please listen to us . Why do n't you understand your people ? Be a man . Be human . Please stop your aggression . Stop this war . ''

Russia accuses the Ukrainian government of precipitating the humanitarian crisis by pursuing its campaign to regain territory seized by the rebels .

Meanwhile , Poroshenko and some Western allies have said thousands of Russian troops are in his nation 's east , helping the separatists .

NATO members meeting this week in Wales are expected to create `` a very high-readiness force '' to deal with Russian aggression in Ukraine and other international conflicts , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday .

European Union leaders are expected to decide on further sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine by Friday , Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini said Tuesday .

Lavrov : ` Let us sit down and talk '

Though Russia has denied sending its troops to Ukraine , it has defended the rebels ' action in the east .

`` Washington and Brussels need to ask Kiev authorities to stop shelling the houses , schools , hospitals and so on because you leave militia with no choice but to stand up to protect their people , '' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said .

`` Let 's not ask militia to lay down their weapons and allow themselves to be killed . ''

Lavrov said negotiations , not threats , would help resolve the crisis between the two neighbors .

`` Let us sit down and talk instead of threatening with sanctions and stubbornly making absolutely unrealistic demands of the militia laying down arms , '' he said . `` This is what the peace plan of Poroshenko is about . ''

The continued fighting means it 's difficult for humanitarian workers to assess the full scope of the crisis , the UNHCR said in its report , while damage to roads and other infrastructure makes it hard to get aid in .

As of September 1 , some 2.2 million people remained in conflict areas according to the Ukrainian authorities , the agency said , many with limited access to food , water , and other basic necessities .

`` In Donetsk , Makiivka and Gorlovka the regional authorities estimate there are 20,000 people with disabilities and needing help , '' it said . `` In Luhansk , residents have been without proper supplies of food and water , and dealing with electricity shortages and communications problems for a month . ''

The number of people using `` humanitarian corridors '' set up by the authorities to flee has dropped off since a number of civilians died in attacks , the UNHCR said .

Statehood question ?

Russia annexed Ukraine 's Crimean Peninsula in March following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month .

Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April when separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev .

Since then , the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has killed more than 2,500 people , according to the United Nations .

A Human Rights Watch report released Monday claimed `` unlawful government and insurgent attacks '' in and around Luhansk were contributing to rising civilian casualties .

It cited a Luhansk morgue doctor as saying explosive weapons have killed more than 300 civilians in the city since May . HRW researchers spoke to more than a dozen people who had witnessed artillery , mortar or rocket attacks in civilian areas .

`` Many of the attacks appeared to be indiscriminate , in that they did not or could not distinguish between civilians and combatants , '' the rights group said . `` Indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law , or the laws of war . ''

A report last week by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights documented `` a wide array of serious human rights abuses '' committed primarily by the rebel fighters .

Violations have also been committed by members of the Ukrainian military as they try to recapture rebel-held territory , it said .
