Joliet , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The trial of former Chicago-area police Sgt. Drew Peterson , accused of killing his ex-wife , focused Wednesday on an incident in which he allegedly had threatened to kill her with a knife .

Defense attorneys sought to discredit Kathleen Savio 's account of the July 2002 incident , in which she had said Peterson pushed her down the stairs of her home , upset about their divorce proceedings , and told her to turn her head so he could kill her .

Peterson , 58 , is on trial , charged with the murder of Savio , his third wife , who was found dead in her dry , clean bathtub March 1 , 2004 .

A classic case of domestic violence ?

The case did not arise until after Peterson 's fourth wife , Stacy , went missing in October 2007 . It was during the search for Stacy Peterson , who has never been found , that investigators said they would look again at Savio 's death , which was initially ruled a drowning .

Savio 's death was ruled a homicide in February 2008 , and Peterson was later arrested and indicted on first-degree murder . The court heard Wednesday afternoon from the forensic pathologist who conducted the second autopsy that led to the homicide ruling .

Peterson has been called a suspect in Stacy Peterson 's disappearance , though he has never been charged in that case .

Wednesday morning 's testimony began with the cross-examination of Bolingbrook , Illinois , Police Lt. Teresa Kernc , who took a police report from Savio about the alleged knife incident in 2002 . Prosecutors examined Kernc on Tuesday .

Savio had written in the police report that Peterson pushed her down the stairs and told her not to get up , then told her how `` awful and bitchy '' she was and that she should stop being so terrible to him .

Savio had written that she grew tired of his rant , so she told him , '' ` Go ahead , just kill me . ' He said , ` Where do you want it ? ' and I said , ` In the head . ' He said , ` OK , then turn your head , ' and I did it . And then he said that he would never be able to hurt me . And then he left . ''

Kernc testified that Savio told her verbally that Peterson threatened her with a knife , but that she did n't include it when she wrote her statement .

`` I told her to put in the report what happened . I said , ` The knife part is n't in here . You need to put in here what actually happened , ' '' Kernc testified . `` Then she wrote it in there , and a short time later she crossed the knife part out . She expressed concern about him being arrested and losing his job . ''

Defense attorney Steve Greenberg noted the incident is alleged to have happened July 5 , 2002 , but that Savio did n't call Kernc to make the report until July 18 . He also pointed out that Peterson had served Savio with a criminal complaint just `` 10 or 15 minutes '' before she filed the police report , but that she never mentioned that to Kernc .

Is the defense team too confident ?

Savio had told Kernc that after Peterson left she immediately called several people , including friend and neighbor Mary Pontarelli , and told them about the knife incident . But according to Greenberg , Pontarelli said Savio described only a `` nice conversation '' with her husband .

That description was `` consistent '' with what Peterson told Kernc when she interviewed him about the incident , Greenberg said .

Kernc ended her testimony by saying she was n't sure whether Savio was telling the truth about Peterson wielding a knife .

`` You had some concerns about whether that actually happened ? '' Greenberg asked .

`` Yes , '' Kernc replied .

`` And that was based on your complete investigation ? '' he asked .

`` Yes , '' Kernc said .

The afternoon session of the trial was expected to include testimony by the doctor who performed Savio 's second autopsy , and by Scott Rossetto , Stacy Peterson 's friend .

In the afternoon , the court heard from Dr. Larry Blum , who performed the autopsy on Salvio 's body after she was exhumed in 2007 .

Blum testified that Savio suffered a laceration to the back of her scalp , which led to dried blood on her face and around the drain when she was found . He said it would have been `` impossible '' for the blood to have dried like that had there been water in the tub .

He also testified that Salvio had a number of fresh bruises -- less than an hour old -- on the front of her body , including to her hip bones , thigh , shins , and hands .

Blum said he also found a fresh abrasion on her buttocks that `` would not be consistent with someone 's slip and fall . ''

He did not testify about why the first autopsy would have ruled her death accidental .

The Peterson trial began July 31 and is expected to last about four weeks .

Repeated missteps by the prosecution are angering Judge Edward Burmila and the defense . At least four times since the trial began , prosecutors have allowed witnesses to testify to details Burmila has told them not to go into -- such as whether Savio had a protective order against her husband or allowing Blum to demonstrate climbing into the bathtub .

In some cases the defense has sought a mistrial and in others they have asked the judge to strike entire testimony . Burmila has instead ordered the jury to disregard elements of the testimony that went against his orders .

`` The disrespect to the court is shocking , '' Burmila told the prosecution Wednesday .

Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales , whom he would later marry . Savio and Peterson filed for divorce in October 2001 and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years .

Bolingbrook police records indicate officers were called to Savio 's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004 . Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence , though she was found not guilty in both cases .

Savio 's order of protection

On February 27 , 2004 , Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio 's home , spending the next two days with them . Prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed Savio .

At the time of her death , which authorities initially treated as an accident , a court was mulling how the couple 's marital assets would be divided , and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson 's pension and other support .

The defense contends Savio fell accidentally , hit her head , and drowned .
