-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- African-Americans deserve reparations . Discuss .

The idea of reparations -- that the descendants of slaves should be compensated by the national government for the wrongs and the legacy of slavery -- has always been controversial .

When Ta-Nehisi Coates of The Atlantic wrote the June cover story , `` The Case for Reparations , '' he set a traffic record for the magazine 's website . He provoked responses from across the political and ethnic spectrum . Some of his critics did him the courtesy of reading the entire 16,000-word piece . Others , particularly in the Twittersphere , reacted viscerally to the headline and to reactions to the headline .

Through many of these responses , whether thoughtful or tossed-off , there 's been a certain thread of uneasiness ; a reflexive move to find reasons why reparation could n't be done or why it would n't be workable or fair .

To me , this reflex is as interesting as the original argument . And it suggests that before America could ever actually do reparations , America would have to first be able to imagine the necessity of reparations . The greatest obstacle to considering reparation is n't practicality ; it 's a dearth of moral imagination .

Coates makes a powerful and persuasive case . He describes not just the obvious injury that demands redress -- namely , slavery -- but also the way in which whites after emancipation systematically and over most of the ensuing 150 years built a nation premised on second-class status for blacks and on supremacy for whites .

The obvious example is the latticework of code and custom that we call Jim Crow . But as Coates reminds us , white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation ; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity , like parts of the New Deal , which contained many devil 's bargains with conservative Southern Democrats to exempt African-Americans . And it plays out in today 's criminal justice and incarceration regimes .

What Coates recounts in painstaking detail is an un-whitewashed history of African-American citizenship . It comes as revelation only if you really did n't want to know the truth . Anyone black , by telling their family history , could have told you this history and anyone not black could have read about it .

But his article is in some ways mistitled . Coates is not quite making a case for reparations . He 's making a case for a discussion of reparations . He does n't pretend to spell out all the operational policy choices that would have to be made to put reparations into effect . The closest he comes to a legislative recommendation is to tout a perennially neglected bill that Rep. John Conyers , D-Michigan , introduces every session of Congress , which calls simply for a public study of the possibility of reparations .

This is n't a shortcoming of Coates ' argument ; it is its purpose . What we need to do is to study the issue in earnest . To have a hearing , in the deepest sense . To listen to the difference between Americanness and whiteness , and to notice the manifold ways that whiteness was -LRB- and is -RRB- an identity fabricated from the myth of blackness .

To be sure , every ethnic group that 's not called white has experienced suffering in American life . But the experience of African-Americans is exceptional in its systematic , multigenerational , reverberating effects . And it 's exceptional in its centrality to the founding and building of our nation . No experience reveals more than the African-American experience both the hypocrisy and the possibility of our national creed .

Does any of this answer the question everyone wants to rush to , the question of implementation and how reparations would actually work ? How to decide which people are called `` black '' or `` black enough '' to get compensation ? How to allocate reparations ? How to decide how much ? How to decide who decides ? How to begin the process without it leading to the unraveling of every aspect of institutional wealth , privilege and power in our country ? No , Coates does n't answer these questions . He asks for a hearing .

And the point of a hearing on reparations -- and making it a civic experience as profound and prismatic as the Watergate hearing -- is not to get the American public to `` how . '' It 's to get us to `` why . '' For only when we understand why reparations are justified , even if in good faith we can not yet figure out how or even whether they could be feasible , will we have a shot at being `` beyond race . ''

Maimonides said , `` Teach thy tongue to say ` I do not know ' and thou shalt progress . '' On a topic as charged as race , and as woven into the warp and woof of American identity as whiteness , the temptation is always to speak emphatically from fear or pain . But if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say , `` I do not know -- but I wish to understand , '' then we will be making true progress .
