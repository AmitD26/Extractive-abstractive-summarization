Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Excited '' after a meeting Thursday with Mitt Romney , tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint urged fellow Republicans to be realistic and rally around the party 's eventual nominee , making his plea the same day the ex-governor 's chief rival suggested voters would be as well off with President Barack Obama as they would Romney .

In addition to fundraising events , Romney was in Washington to hold talks with DeMint as well as legislators from Pennsylvania and Wisconsin , which hold primaries next month . The legislators included House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan , according to GOP aides .

`` I 'm not only comfortable with Romney , I 'm excited about the possibility of him possibly being our nominee , '' said DeMint , a well known conservative , claiming he was impressed by Romney but stopping short of giving him a full endorsement .

Adding that `` I just think we just need to look at where we are , '' DeMint strongly suggested that rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich should drop out to end the nomination fight and focus the party 's efforts on defeating Obama in November .

`` I just hope at some point they 'll realize whether they can win or not , '' DeMint said of Romney 's top opponents . `` If they ca n't , the best thing they can probably do is to help the one who is going to win . ''

This apparent call for unity contrasted sharply with the message offered Thursday by Santorum , who has been Romney 's foremost challenger in large part thanks to support from conservative voters .

The former Pennsylvania senator said in a San Antonio speech that the only way for Republicans to win was `` by giving people the choice ... not someone who is just going to be a little different than the person in there . ''

`` If we are going to be a little different , we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk in what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate , '' Santorum said .

He was referring to earlier comments from a top Romney adviser , Eric Fehrnstrom , who said his campaign will `` hit a reset button '' to take on Obama in the fall if Romney wins the GOP nomination . He added , `` It 's almost like an Etch A Sketch . You can kind of shake it up , and we start all over again . ''

Romney quickly blasted Santorum 's remarks , saying in a statement he was `` disappointed to hear that Rick Santorum would rather have Barack Obama as president than a Republican . ''

`` Any of the Republicans running would be better than President Obama and his record of failure , '' he added .

In this swift retort , Romney was able to turn the tables on an opponent who , along with Gingrich , had sought to play up Fehnrstom 's Etch A Sketch remarks for a second day .

They said the adviser 's remarks bring into question whether Romney will drop his conservative stances , some of which are different from others he 'd taken earlier in his career , in favor of more moderate positions ahead of the general election .

On Wednesday , Santorum 's campaign posted a photo on Twitter of the candidate using an Etch A Sketch , saying it showed him `` studying up on -LRB- Romney 's -RRB- policy positions . ''

A website unveiled Thursday by the Gingrich campaign features the Fehrnstrom quote above an Etch A Sketch that highlights Romney 's policy shifts when viewers hit a prompt labeled `` shake . '' Written on the drawing toy is `` Mitt 's Etch A Sketch Principles . ''

`` You have this over-and-over process where he 's pro-choice and then he 's not pro-choice ; he 's pro-gun control then he 's an NRA member who hunts varmints , '' Gingrich said of Romney at a campaign event Thursday in Houma , Louisiana . '' ... If you 're serious about changing Washington , D.C. , you ca n't use an Etch A Sketch . You ca n't have a child 's toy for a president . ''

On the Tea Party Nation website , blogger Judson Phillips wrote Thursday that the Etch A Sketch image `` is what conservatives have been warning about for months with Romney . ''

`` He is a liberal . He has no core convictions and as soon as he becomes the nominee , he will move far to the left , '' Phillips continued .

Romney , who scored the prized endorsement of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday , explained the Etch A Sketch remark by saying , `` Organizationally , a general election campaign takes on a different profile . ''

`` The issues I am running on will be exactly the same , '' he said . `` I am running as a conservative Republican . I was a conservative Republican governor . I will be running as a conservative Republican nominee , at that point hopefully , for president . The policies and positions are the same . ''

The caricature of Romney as a politically motivated flip-flopper extends far beyond the Republican campaign and right-wing blogosphere .

In an interview broadcast Thursday on Public Radio International , Obama said Romney was `` pretending '' the health care plan he helped institute as governor of Massachusetts differed from the national plan that Democrats in Congress passed two years ago .

Santorum and other conservatives have repeatedly attacked Romney over the Massachusetts health care plan , while Romney says he never called for implementing such a program at the federal level .

In the radio interview , Obama pointed to similarities between the two plans without mentioning the Republican front-runner by name .

`` We designed a program that actually previously had support of Republicans , including the person who may end up being the Republican standard bearer and is now pretending like he came up with something different , '' Obama said .

This week 's Illinois result gave Romney at least 41 of the 54 delegates at stake in the contest to face off with Obama , increasing his total to 562 , according to CNN 's estimate . Santorum is second with 249 , Gingrich third with 137 and Texas Rep. Ron Paul last with 69 .

A total of 1,144 delegates is needed to clinch the GOP nomination .

Santorum said he expects to do better in coming primaries and caucuses , including Louisiana on Saturday .

The former senator has made a strong showing in traditionally conservative Southern states , winning Alabama and Mississippi a week ago while Romney finished third .

`` This is the last chance , in a sense , for the conservative area of the country to plant their flag , and we felt very good about what Alabama and Mississippi did , '' Santorum said in an interview Thursday with New Orleans radio station WWL . `` They restarted this race again . ''

Another Santorum victory in Louisiana would continue the pattern of the race , while a Romney win would signal growing support from the conservative base that he needs to finish off his rivals .

Gingrich , who appears increasingly unlikely to mount another comeback after two previous campaign surges , said Thursday he is used to fighting from behind .

`` Almost everywhere I 've campaigned , because of the way of the money , we start behind and then we gain ground , '' Gingrich told about 100 supporters in Lafayette , Louisiana .
