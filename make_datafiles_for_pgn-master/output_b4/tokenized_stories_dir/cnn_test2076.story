Gat and Lita , Cheetahs , Smithsonian National Zoological Park , Washington , D.C.
Gat and Lita came into the world , this spring , under harrowing circumstances . Their mother , Ally , 5 , birthed Gat , then underwent a cesarean section to deliver three more cubs , but only one , Lita , survived . Mom and the two cubs spent several days afterwards in intensive care and have since fully recovered -- and bonded . Cheetahs are the fastest land animals , and because they were born in an Olympics year , the cubs were named after the speediest American man and woman at the London Games . `` Gat the Cat '' takes his name from Justin Gatlin , who won bronze in the men 's 100-meter sprint , and `` Lita the Cheetah '' was named after Carmelita Jeter , who won silver in the women 's 100 meters .

Bexley , Matschie 's Tree Kangaroo , Saint Louis Zoo
Though he was born in early 2012 , Bexley , a Matschie 's tree kangaroo , only recently started venturing from his mother 's pouch to walk around and explore . As he gets bigger , the furry marsupial will be able to jump great distances , too -- tree kangaroos , native to Papua New Guinea , can leap as much as 30 feet , from a treetop to the ground .

Amur Tigers , Columbus Zoo , Ohio
Mara , 5 , and Foli , 9 , became the parents of two male cubs in June 2012 . They weighed just two to three pounds apiece and were placed into intensive care when one did not nurse for a dangerously long time . Luckily , the two youngsters are now healthy and living together in their habitat . The orange-and-black-striped cuties are still waiting on their names -LRB- the rights to name them were recently auctioned off at a zoo fundraiser -RRB- , but in the meantime , they 're happy to pass their days eating , dozing , and exploring their surroundings .

Southern Hairy-Nosed Wombat , Brookfield Zoo , Illinois

The Brookfield Zoo 's female wombat is the fourth child of 12-year-old Kambora , who was born at the San Diego Zoo , and the second of Wilbur , 20 , from Australia , the native country of wombats .

Qinisa , Elephant , San Diego Zoo Safari Park
This playful elephant calf is hitting developmental milestones faster than any other pachyderm at San Diego Safari Park ; at one week old , she was already using her trunk to pick up objects . Maybe it was only natural for a baby whose name means `` to act with determination '' in Siswati . Qinisa 's mom , Swazi , was one of four elephants who were rescued from a game park in Swaziland in 2003 .

Karoo , Black-Footed Cat , Brookfield Zoo , Illinois
Love cats ? Then you 'll swoon for Karoo , the Brookfield Zoo 's big-eyed black-footed cat . The species is the smallest of all the African felines ; grown black-footed cats are about half the size of your average domestic tabby . Like most felines , Karoo spends lots of time catnapping , but when he 's awake , he 's up and about and curious about his human guests .

Adelina , Western Lowland Gorilla , Little Rock Zoo , Arkansas
One could say that Adelina is Arkansas 's most popular primate .
