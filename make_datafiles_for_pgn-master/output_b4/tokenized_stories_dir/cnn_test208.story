-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- My relationship with the who-should-play-Christian-Grey timeline goes as follows : I wanted Matt Bomer the entire time I read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy ... right up until Charlie Hunnam was announced . Then I inexplicably got very excited for Hunnam 's portrayal of the troubled billionaire . And now that Hunnam has dropped out of the film , I 'm left feeling 50 shades of empty and confused . Do I want Matt Bomer again ? Or do I want someone like Hunnam , with a lesser-known face -LRB- or one that 's usually covered in hair -RRB- ?

Before I could make sense of any of it , I read that Oliver Stone told The Wall Street Journal that Leonardo DiCaprio was his choice for the coveted role . At first , my thoughts reflected my feelings about Ben Affleck being Batman : No , thank you . But after some soul searching and many Google Images , I ca n't help but think DiCaprio would make one intriguing Christian Grey . It 's definitely a film I would see , and here 's why it would work :

He 's got those eyes . If you want to be literal about it , DiCaprio does have some gorgeous blue-gray eyes . And he almost has that copper hair E L James wrote of so fondly . I 'll be the first to admit that his heartthrob phase is behind him , but at the end of the day , DiCaprio is still quite pretty . Plus , he 's always stayed in good shape , and getting Christian 's abs is just a matter of a good personal trainer and a few months of dieting .

He 's good at dark-and-twisted . Christian Grey is a tortured soul . His journey is a dark one , and his obsessions all stem from a very raw , emotional place . And if DiCaprio can do anything , it 's play a character that is so layered and broken down and yet puts up this playboy front for the crowd -LRB- Gatsby , anyone ? -RRB- .

He can be scary . Let 's keep it real here : Christian Grey can be one scary dude , whether he 's defending Anastasia or punishing her , and that aggressive side of a character is another element DiCaprio is darn good at â € '' even when the veins are n't popping out of his forehead .

He would give the film a certain credibility . No one can deny that seeing DiCaprio 's name on the Fifty Shades of Grey poster would add an additional level of credibility to the film , both in that the standard of acting would automatically increase , and DiCaprio 's acceptance would mean that the role intrigued him . And to be honest , I can see how it would . The books might be considered soft porn to some , but Christian really is a fascinating character , if you 're able to look past the exterior .

He would expand the film 's audience . Much like I argued that Hunnam would bring in a new Sons of Anarchy audience , DiCaprio 's universal appeal would reach out to many more than just those who read the books .

He 's a great romantic lead . Christian has many sides as a character , and one of those is extremely romantic . And if Titanic taught us something -LRB- other than to stay away from icebergs -RRB- , it 's that DiCaprio is very good at being the romantic leading man , even one with a twisted mind .

I know he 's a bit old , but this is Hollywood , people . And have you seen him in a suit ?

Although I by no means expect this casting to happen , it certainly expanded my views on who could play Christian . What about you ? Are you still waiting on Matt Bomer , or are you ready to accept the next twist thrown at you ?
