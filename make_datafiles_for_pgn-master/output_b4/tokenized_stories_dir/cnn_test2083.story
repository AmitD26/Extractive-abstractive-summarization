-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For most couples , a few differences -- whether philosophical , religious , or simply about whose turn it is to do the dishes -- are hardly newsworthy .

But for vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan and his wife Janna , political dissimilarities were enough to land them an article in The New York Times .

This may not seem like a big deal to the couple themselves -- she 's a `` practical conservative '' from a prominent Democrat family and he 's , well , a staunch Republican . Yet such seemingly major differences can be mind-boggling to many people , particularly in the heat of election season .

Of course , the Ryans are n't the first couple to agree to disagree politically in the name of love . Political strategists James Carville and Mary Matalin famously butted heads on the campaign trail , then stunned America when they fell in love , got married and raised a family .

And there have always been rumors that some first ladies have n't agreed with their presidential spouses on every issue ; Laura Bush is one example .

It may surprise those of us who are in agreement with our partners -- or who ca n't imagine dating a Republican or Democrat -- but political differences can actually be a benefit to some relationships .

`` If a couple who does n't share political views has a healthy relationship , then that speaks to other strengths , '' says psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert , author of `` Be Fearless : Change Your Life in 28 Days . ''

`` For example , they may have good communication and conflict resolution skills , a healthy sex life , shared goals , and similar interests -- all of which are possible even if their politics differ . ''

But how does that conflict play out in the bedroom ? Democrats and Republicans may be able to agree to disagree , but their differences appear to continue between the sheets .

According to a recent survey by Binghamton University and dating website Match.com of more than 5,000 single American men and women , politically liberal respondents were more likely to have sex more often , but conservative respondents reported having `` better '' sex .

Specifically , 53 % of those who described themselves as conservative Republicans said that they reached orgasm every time they had sex , compared with 40 % of liberal Democrats .

`` Orgasm , particularly among women , takes practice and knowing one 's body , '' suggests Justin Garcia , a postdoctoral fellow at The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction and a co-researcher on the study .

`` Conservatives tend to be more traditional and rigid . So , it reasons that this might also manifest in the bedroom -- once they 've found something that works , they stick to it ! ''

That 's just a guess , of course . But the survey also uncovered some other interesting sexual-political tidbits .

For example , the liberal Democrats surveyed placed more importance on sense of humor , independence and equality in a partner , while conservative Republicans were more likely to seek out someone of the same background and political party and were more apt to want to get married .

Overall , such fun facts make for excellent cocktail party fodder , but they may not have much of an impact on real relationships .

In fact , the survey found that just 17 % of men and 20 % of women said they must be with someone who 's in their political party .

`` The interesting message from this survey is that , regardless of political affiliation , almost everyone in America recognizes the importance of love and sex , either in their lives or the world around them , '' Garcia says .

`` This is an important message during an election year -- human sexuality should not be a politically divisive issue , since it truly concerns us all . ''

If you do find yourself in a relationship with someone of the opposite political party , take heart -- and follow Alpert 's advice .

`` Do n't define yourself by your political affiliation . You 're a husband , a wife , a brother , a sister , a daughter , a son , '' he says . `` Use the different opinions to learn something new . With every political view is a possible discussion where you can learn about your partner . Set ground rules about when to argue -- and know when to walk away . ''

So this election season , look past the parties and cast your vote for a happy , healthy relationship .
