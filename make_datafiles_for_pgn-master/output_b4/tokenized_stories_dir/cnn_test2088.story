-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It was the threats that took the fun out of `` Family Funday . ''

A Muslim group had sold more than 4,000 tickets to the private event , set for this Sunday at a theme park in suburban London , when park officials canceled it last week .

This week , officials went a step further , also closing the 150-acre park 's 150-room hotel for the weekend , a park spokeswoman said Thursday .

The event was to have been held at Legoland Windsor Resort , 30 miles west of London . It was to have been `` open to people from all faiths and cultures in an open and welcoming environment without the promotion of any particular ideology , '' according to the website for the Muslim Research and Development Foundation .

But now -- after critics of the group filled the park 's Facebook page with threats -- it 's not open to anybody .

`` Sadly , our right-wing extremists took a huge offense to it , '' park spokeswoman Liz Edwards said . `` It 's the saddest thing . ''

The hotel 's closure was also based on concern over safety , she said . `` We wanted to just ensure that the whole site was secure , '' Edwards said .

Those who had booked rooms were given refunds , but the move did n't satisfy Sarah Shenton Plews , who posted on the park 's Facebook page that she was `` Extremely upset ! '' and asked , `` Can u arrange for someone to come round and tell my 5 yr & 8 yr ???! Well ?? ''

In response to the posting , the hotel cited the threats : `` Your Safety and security is our number one priority so we 've made the decision to close the whole Resort , including the Hotel for the weekend . ''

Legoland said it took down its Facebook page for a couple of days at the request of the Thames Valley Police .

The Muslim Research and Development Foundation cited far-right groups linked to the English Defence League and `` Christian patrols '' for the decision to cancel . `` We should not be intimidated by violent threats to our way of life , '' the group said , adding it 's a charity that has consistently promoted nonviolence .

`` Unfortunately , during the last few weeks leading up to the event , several right-wing groups including the -LRB- English Defence League -RRB- and Casuals United along with others threatened both the visitors and employees of Legoland in relation to this planned event . They threatened staff at Legoland , staff at MRDF and aimed to disrupt families on the day of the event . ''

The Muslim group did not immediately return a call and e-mail seeking further comment .

A posting on Casuals United 's blog denied its members had made any threats . `` We are hardly Nazis , we are British people who are standing up for our country , '' the entry said . `` Call us Nazis all you want , we do n't care . We stop Islamic extremists , we get results . Any venue this group -LRB- tries -RRB- to book will get the same treatment . ''

The English Defence League describes itself as a human rights organization working `` to protect the inalienable rights of all people to protest against radical Islam 's encroachment into the lives of non-Muslims . ''

It says it is not a far-right group .

In a statement , the group accused the Muslim Research and Development Foundation of being led `` by a notorious hate-preacher who has made it quite clear that he is opposed to almost every standard of democracy , decency , morality and inclusiveness that we British see as the cornerstone of our culture '' and said it was pleased the event had been canceled .

The foundation 's chairman , Sheikh Haitham Al-Haddad , has denied he is extremist .

The English Defence League added it `` wholeheartedly '' condemned any threats of violence . `` In a country with a long and honorable tradition of peaceful protest there is absolutely no excuse for this and the EDL affirms its commitment to nonviolent action . ''

In a statement , the Thames Valley Police said it initiated an investigation after being notified about the online threats February 11 but had made no arrests . `` As there is an ongoing police investigation , it would be inappropriate for us to comment further , '' police said .

In November , another event by the Muslim group -- held at the Chessington World of Adventures , Legoland 's sister park about 45 minutes away -- went off without threats or complaints , park spokeswoman Edwards told CNN . `` We have no idea why this has been different . ''

Sunday 's cancellation is the first by the park since it opened in 1996 , she said .
