-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A court in Jordan acquitted radical preacher Abu Qatada of charges of plotting to bomb millennium celebrations in Jordan in 2000 , semi-state owned newspaper Addustour reported Wednesday .

The court ordered his immediate release if no other cases are raised against him , the newspaper said .

Qatada , whose real name is Omar Othman , was cleared in July of charges of conspiracy to bomb a U.S. school in Jordan in the late 1990s , state media reported .

The cleric was deported from the United Kingdom last year , ending a years-long legal battle to force him to leave the country .

A Jordanian national , he was wanted in his home country , where he had been convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions .

Britain had been trying to deport him since 2001 , but his legal appeals kept him there until last year .

Home Office : He 's not coming back

Following the news of his acquittal , a Home Office spokesman told CNN that Abu Qatada would not be returning to Britain .

`` Abu Qatada 's retrial in Jordan was made possible thanks to this government 's determination to successfully deport him from the UK to face the courts in his own country , '' he said .

`` It is right that the due process of law has taken place in Jordan . The UK courts agreed that Abu Qatada posed a threat to national security in the UK , so we are pleased that we were able to remove him .

`` Abu Qatada remains subject to a deportation order and a United Nations travel ban . He is not coming back to the UK . ''

Torture fears

In January 2012 , the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan over fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at trial .

British authorities said he raised funds for terrorist groups , including organizations linked to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , and publicly supported militants ' violent activities .

Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States , including ringleader Mohammed Atta .

Abu Qatada had denied the allegations against him .

He arrived in the UK in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities . He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport , according to court documents , and claimed asylum for himself , his wife and their three children .
