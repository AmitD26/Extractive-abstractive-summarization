-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Not even on Valentine 's Day am I much of a romantic . I hardly ever think to buy flowers for my wife or plan fun getaways , and I rarely remember our anniversary . To be fair , neither does she . We 're usually reminded of our anniversary only when her mother 's congratulatory card arrives with a little check tucked inside .

Oh yeah , we think . It 's that time of year again . How many years has it been ? Which anniversary is this ? Paper ? Copper ? Sometimes I have to take off my wedding ring and look at the date , which is etched inside .

In the card my mother-in-law will have written : `` Spend this on a nice dinner out for the two of you ! ''

`` How sweet of her , '' Cathi will say .

`` She 's so nice to do this every year , '' I 'll say .

And then we 'll deposit the check in our mutual checking account and promise ourselves a nice dinner out , which usually fails to materialize . Maybe a portion of that check will go toward the electric bill , which powers our air conditioner , which keeps us cool and comfortable in the hot summer months . That 's kind of romantic , right ? Not really . What can I say ? Romance just is n't in our DNA .

And yet I spend my days reading other people 's love stories . For the past 10 years I 've edited a column in The New York Times called `` Modern Love , '' in which strangers write personal essays spilling the details of their love lives for a mass audience . A lot of their stories are n't very romantic , either , but many of them are : tales of swooning singletons traveling great distances for love , or planning elaborate proposals , or pouring their hearts out in ways that expose them to crushing rejection .

Stories like that make me think I should be more romantic .

But at this point , Cathi and I have been married almost 22 years . Our patterns are kind of established . We love each other and support each other 's work and aspirations . We 're good parents together . We 're really good at making each other laugh . At dinner parties , we 'd still rather sit next to each other than be broken up and forced to talk to other people . Is n't that enough ? I know what you 're thinking . This guy is hopeless ! And not in the sense of being a hopeless romantic !

Some say romance is dying in this age of commercialized and computerized matchmaking . They say romance is being killed by a world of constant communication . How can you miss someone when you can FaceTime with him or her 24/7 ? Where is the mystery when you can follow each other 's Twitter feed and Facebook posts at work during the day or when away on a business trip ?

I 've even heard of husbands and wives using `` Find My iPhone '' to locate their spouses if they 're not answering calls or texts , as if the thing was invented to serve as a GPS tracking device . And after our laptop locates the signal , we think : Oh , she 's just at CVS . Oh , he 's just walking the dog down by the river . Not a lot of mystery there .

Nothing to wonder about . If absence makes the heart grow fonder , what does continual presence do ? Make the heart grow bored ?

With Cathi and me , technology has nothing to do with our unromantic affliction . Our love has sidestepped romantic traditions from the beginning . We got engaged on a ferry boat in San Francisco Bay . That 's romantic , right ? Well , not for us . We had departed from Fisherman 's Wharf , bound for Sausalito , when Cathi said , `` So are we getting married , or what ? ''

`` Yeah , we should , '' I said .

And that was it . We had become engaged . Even though I had n't proposed . Had n't knelt . Had n't pulled a hidden ring box from my pocket or sock and presented it to her with a big , goofy smile . Had n't memorized or delivered any heartfelt lines . I do n't even think we kissed .

By then we had been together for almost two years . We were both 29 , nearing the end of our graduate school days , and obviously had to figure out what was next for us . Our marriage and family clock was ticking , and our parents ' expectations were mounting . I wanted to marry Cathi and assumed we would get married , and yet I had n't taken a single step in that direction .

Why had n't I ? I wish I could claim some standard excuse like cold feet or commitment issues or a laundry list of doubts , but it would n't be true . I was n't worried about Cathi specifically or about marriage generally . I expected it would all work out fine . I was n't concerned about joining her family or her joining mine . I was simply procrastinating because I did n't want to face the work and stress that proposing and then planning a wedding would require .

As we steamed past Alcatraz Island -LRB- no prison symbolism intended -RRB- , Cathi asked if I had any thoughts about a ring .

`` No , '' I said . `` But I 'll ask my mother . ''

Oof .

In the end , though , my mother delivered . She had a family heirloom kind of ring with a little diamond chip that we got sized for Cathi 's finger , and that made it official . Some months later , during our pre-wedding planning , we went to a strip mall in West Orange , New Jersey , and ordered matching gold bands . As we walked out , I felt a little misty eyed , and I do n't think it was just because of the pollution .

Some months later we walked down the aisle . We said our vows . We kissed . We danced . We celebrated . And later that night we strode into our fancy hotel room , where I pulled from my pockets the cash and checks people had given us , and I scattered the loot all over the bed . No one had told me that people tend to stuff money into the groom 's pockets at weddings , and I have to say it felt really romantic to lie in all that cash together on a king-size hotel bed .

We 'd done it . We had turned our love into marriage . It was the start of everything . It 's a date that will be etched forever in -- my ring .
