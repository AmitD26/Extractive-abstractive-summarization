-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Gmail does n't cost any money to use , but it 's not free .

Google 's popular online e-mail service , which turns 10 Tuesday , may not charge for its Gmail accounts . But the company is still collecting payment in the form of massive amounts of personal information about the people who use it .

With an estimated 500-plus million users , Gmail has grown to dominate the Web-mail world . It has also repeatedly found itself in hot water over privacy . Gmail is facing multiple privacy lawsuits in the United States and Europe , some accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for scanning the content of e-mails .

Google reported $ 16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone . One way it makes money from Gmail is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users .

`` The basic premise of Gmail is , we 'll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we 're scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant , '' said Eric Goldman , a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law .

Scanning and ads

Gmail looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context , then matches the e-mail up with related ads . A conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class , for example , might trigger an ad for a weight-loss product .

Data gathered through e-mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting .

What many consumers do n't consider is that companies such as Google can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search , maps , e-mail and Google + , its social network .

`` Nothing in life is free , and as a result it is important for people to understand what value they bring to a free service of any kind , '' said Behnam Dayanim , a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Washington .

When people send and receive messages using a free e-mail service , they are sharing details about their interests , who their connections are and what their finances look like . That information might seem mundane on the surface , but when extracted and organized , it 's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers .

All the major e-mail providers , including Microsoft Outlook and Yahoo , benefit one way or another from offering a free service . The provider might serve up general or targeted ads , generate a user base for marketing other services , or just use the e-mail service to build brand recognition .

And while Gmail may have popularized it , targeted ads based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies . It 's how social media companies such as Facebook and search engines such as Bing make money as well as a huge number of apps that scrape contact and location information from users . It 's also led to a number of similar privacy lawsuits against other companies , including LinkedIn , Yahoo and Facebook .

Any company that collects personal information has to advise its customers what it is doing with their information and comply with any relevant privacy laws , Dayanim said . These are usually laid out in the lengthy terms and conditions and privacy policies that customers barely skim before hitting `` agree . ''

However , many of the details about how exactly Google 's program works have been kept confidential . And critics say the service does n't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers ' information .

Legal action

When Gmail made its debut in 2004 , it was upfront about the fact that it would show contextual ads targeted to match the topic of e-mail threads . People still lined up to be accepted as early beta users of the service because it was slickly designed , included ample amounts of storage , and was excellent at filtering out spam . And it did n't cost anything to sign up .

One problem is that not all the people affected have agreed to Google 's privacy policy . One group of plaintiffs in a recent class-action lawsuit were non-Gmail users who sent messages to Gmail accounts . Google responded that non-Gmail customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e-mails to people who did use the service .

Google has defended its e-mail scanning program by pointing out that it 's automated and handled by computers picking out keywords . Google 's employees are n't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers ' spat .

Google also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam , and for features such as Priority Inbox and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories .

A federal judge dealt a blow to the case this month , ruling it could n't proceed as a class-action lawsuit because the different groups were n't cohesive enough . A class-action lawsuit could have cost Google trillions of dollars in damages .

A changing landscape

When Gmail debuted in 2004 , the rules for collecting user information were looser . But the privacy landscape has changed drastically over the past 10 years .

Several U.S. states have passed laws that restrict the use of personal information , the Federal Trade Commission has been more active pursuing privacy violations , and the industry has adopted best practices about what 's acceptable .

One thing that has n't changed is the federal law with the biggest impact on how and when companies can share data with third parties . The Electronics Communication Privacy Act is a dusty piece of legislation passed in 1986 , long before the era of cloud-based e-mail . Many legislators and technology companies -LRB- including Google -RRB- have lobbied to have the law updated to reflect the times .

Meanwhile , consumers must increasingly weigh the value of using a free e-mail service such as Gmail against their personal privacy .
