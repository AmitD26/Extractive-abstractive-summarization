-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Joe Woyjeck last talked to his son Kevin , the outdoors enthusiast who took up his father 's firefighting profession , on the phone just hours before Kevin died .

`` He said , ` Dad , we got a fire in Yarnell , Arizona . ... I 'll give you a call later , ' '' the elder Woyjeck told `` Anderson Cooper 360 '' on Monday .

Joe Woyjeck is having a hard time accepting that he wo n't get that return call .

Kevin Woyjeck , 21 , was one of 19 members of an elite Arizona firefighting unit who died Sunday while battling the Yarnell Hill wildfire , which has consumed more than 8,400 acres northwest of Phoenix .

The deaths are under investigation , but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under fire shelters , blankets meant to protect against flames and heat , as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them .

Kevin Woyjeck , following in the footsteps of his father , a Los Angeles County Fire Department fire captain , joined the Prescott Fire Department 's Granite Mountain Hotshots just three months ago , Joe Woyjeck said .

For Hotshot firefighters , no such thing as a routine wildfire

He appeared suited for a hotshot crew , a group of top-shelf wildfire battlers who are called to get close to the blaze , dig barriers and clear out the brush and other material that otherwise would fuel it .

`` Always wanted to be a fireman . He loved the outdoors . Sleeping in the dirt was not a big deal to him ; he actually enjoyed it , I think , '' Joe Woyjeck said , remembering a son who always had a fishing rod in his car . `` Just a great kid , not a mean bone in his body ... always looking forward to becoming a firefighter like his dad .

`` Words ca n't describe the loss that our family is feeling right now . ''

Kevin Woyjeck was n't the only firefighter 's son in the Granite Mountain crew . Christopher MacKenzie , 30 , was the son of Mike MacKenzie , a retired captain for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .

The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a largely youthful group : 14 were in their 20s . The eldest , unit superintendent Eric Marsh , was 43 .

The 19 firefighters who were killed Sunday

Also killed Sunday were : Andrew Ashcraft , 29 ; Robert Caldwell , 23 ; Travis Carter , 31 ; Dustin Deford , 24 ; Grant McKee , 21 ; Sean Misner , 26 ; Scott Norris , 28 ; Wade Parker , 22 ; John Percin , 24 ; Anthony Rose , 23 ; Jesse Steed , 36 ; Joe Thurston , 32 ; Travis Turbyfill , 27 ; William Warneke , 25 ; Clayton Whitted , 28 ; and Garret Zuppiger , 27 .

`` It 's a younger man 's game , '' Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo told reporters Monday . `` These people keep themselves in exceptional condition . They have considerable weight to carry , and they walk -LRB- miles -RRB- to get to strategic locations . ''

The physical challenge appealed to Ashcraft , a father and husband who wanted to be a firefighter since middle school .

Ashcraft `` wanted to do hotshot work until he physically no longer could do it '' and trained feverishly , said his mother , Deborah Pfingston .

Deployed for the summer , the group missed their families but enjoyed the camaraderie , Pfingston told CNN on Monday .

`` They loved each other . It was almost a band of brothers . These guys ate together , they slept on the ground together when they were fighting fires , these were his comrades , '' she said .

The group 's website speaks to their fitness : `` Environmental extremes , long hours , bad food , and steep , rugged terrain , demand that we train early and often by running and hiking , doing core exercises , yoga , and weight training . ''

Joe Woyjeck said his son `` wanted to be in the weeds , because I started out as a wildland firefighter . ''

`` He worked out as a cross country runner , -LRB- but -RRB- he did n't even excel in running until he graduated from high school , because he knew the hotshot thing , you had to be the best , '' he said .

Now , the elder Woyjeck says he and his wife feel stuck in a sleepless nightmare , coming to terms with their loss .

`` My wife and I and our daughter and my other son have kind of sheltered ourselves from the exact incident , '' he said . `` When the time is right , we 'll dig in and figure out exactly what happened . ''
