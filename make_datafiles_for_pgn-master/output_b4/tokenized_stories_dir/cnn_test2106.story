Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Americans still strongly support airstrikes against ISIS -- but they 're losing confidence that the strikes will wipe out the group 's military capability , a new poll shows .

The air strikes already ordered by President Barack Obama are supported by 76 % of the public , a CNN/ORC International survey of 1,018 adults , conducted Oct. 24-26 , found .

However , only 48 % of those polled say the U.S. effort is going well -- while 54 % say they 're confident the strikes will degrade and destroy the military capability of ISIS . That figure is down from 61 % last month .

As the public loses confidence in air strikes ' effectiveness , Americans are increasingly supportive of sending U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The poll found 45 % support for such a move -- up from 38 % in September . A majority still oppose it however .

And if ISIS were to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad , that number would shift much more dramatically , with 72 % saying they 'd then support sending ground troops to the region .

`` Support for sending U.S. ground troops into combat operations against ISIS forces is growing , although a majority continues to oppose ` boots on the ground ' in Iraq or Syria , '' said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . `` But that could change in a hurry if the situation worsens in Iraq . ''

The poll also found a war-weary public with little faith in Obama , high confidence that a terrorist attack on U.S. soil will happen again soon and expectations that fighting ISIS will be a drawn-out engagement .

Those surveyed said they are n't expecting to see ISIS quickly defeated . More than four in five said U.S. military action against the group will be long and difficult .

Opinion : Is killing ISIS leader a good idea ?

Only 32 % said they believe Obama has a clear plan for dealing with ISIS . Meanwhile , 59 % said further acts of terrorism in the United States are likely over the next several weeks .

That number is up from 55 % in a September poll -- a small enough increase , Holland said , that it ca n't be attributed to a changed public mood after last week 's attacks on the Canadian government .
