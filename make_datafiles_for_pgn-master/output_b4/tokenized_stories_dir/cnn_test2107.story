Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's second attempt to seat a new Cabinet failed Saturday with the parliament rejecting a majority of his selections .

The parliament approved seven ministers out of 17 nominees . They include Karzai 's former national security adviser , Zalmai Rasoul , as foreign minister and Amina Afzali , one of three female nominees , as social affairs chief .

Nominees for ministries of Justice , Haj and Islamic Affairs , Economics , Counter-Narcotics , and Rural Rehabilitation and Development also were approved .

But the rejection of 10 names does not bode well for Karzai , who is under both international and domestic pressure to stamp out widespread corruption in Afghanistan and establish legitimacy for his administration , tainted by allegations of vote fraud in August .

Among those rejected were candidates for higher education , public health and women 's affairs . Parliament members have complained that Karzai 's nominees are either corrupt or linked to warlords .

Meanwhile , 14 militants and three international troops died in fighting over the past 24 hours in Afghanistan , authorities said Saturday .

Eleven insurgents died in an overnight raid by Afghan and NATO-led troops in Sistanay , a village in the Nad-e-Ali district of Helmand province in southern Afghanistan , NATO 's International Security Assistance Force said .

A `` sizable amount '' of black tar opium and a small weapons cache and bomb-making materials were found in the operation , it said .

In eastern Paktika province Friday night , forces called in an airstrike against militants planting roadside bombs , the NATO-led mission said . Three militants , including a commander of the Haqqani network , were killed .

In Khost province , north of Paktika , a roadside bomb Saturday struck the vehicle of the Bak district 's sub-governor , who suffered minor injuries .

The British Defense Ministry said two British soldiers were killed while on foot patrol Friday in Helmand . The NATO command said an ISAF service member was killed Saturday but did n't list the nationality or location of the incident .
