Panama City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega arrived Sunday evening in his home country , nearly 22 years after U.S. forces forcibly removed him from office .

The 77-year-old was taken straight to El Renacer prison to serve time for crimes committed during his rule . Reporters flooded the medium-security facility in Gamboa , but the former leader was shielded from public view . Officials later confirmed that he was there .

Earlier , Noriega arrived at the Tocumen International Airport in Panama City , where security was tight .

`` I think it has historic and symbolic significance , '' said Michael Shifter , president of the Washington D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue , about Noriega 's return .

`` It 's a sense of closure for the Panamanian people . He clearly was a dictator for six years and presided over assassinations , disappearances and killing of opposition leaders . And so I think that it 's something that was unfinished business and I think it 's important for Panama to have a sense of closure , '' he said .

Noriega 's extradition process began Sunday morning with a flight from Paris to Madrid . He was in Spanish police custody during a four-hour layover before leaving Madrid Sunday afternoon on a flight to Panama City , a spokesman for Spain 's airport authority said .

Last month , a French court authorized his extradition to Panama , where officials want Noriega to face justice in the killings of Hugo Spadafora , his political opponent , and at least one other person . He was convicted in absentia .

Speaking outside of the prison complex in Gamboa , Noriega 's attorney said his client deserves fair representation .

`` He -LRB- Noriega -RRB- wanted to return to the country and face in this land the charges for which he was tried in absentia , '' attorney Julio Berrios told reporters .

`` General Noriega is accused of having participated in three homicides . U.S. President George H.W. Bush invaded us and that cost 4,000 deaths . Has anybody said anything against Bush ? '' he said .

Noriega has been in France since 2010 , after two decades in an American prison .

Authorities have strengthened security to guarantee his safety in Panama , according to Panamanian Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez .

`` We have to be ready for all the possibilities in all aspects . Noriega inspires very big emotions , and Noriega 's life could very well be at risk in Panama , '' Henriquez said .

Interior Minister Roxana Mendez said Noriega will receive the same treatment as other inmates in the Panamanian prison .

`` The Panamanian state has no special consideration when it comes to him serving his sentence inside the prison complex , '' Mendez said . `` However , based on our laws , and if there 's a valid request from his attorneys , they can ask that he be transferred from the prison to house arrest if the inmate 's health is in jeopardy or if the inmate , being over 70 years old , may face risks inside the prison complex . ''

Last year , a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering 2.3 million euros -LRB- $ 2.9 million -RRB- through banks there . He was ordered to pay the money back .

Noriega denied the charges .

For almost two decades , Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal , the key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas .

Amid growing unrest in Panama , then-U.S. President Bush ordered the invasion of Panama in December 1989 , saying Noriega 's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property .

Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City .

He surrendered in January 1990 and was quickly escorted to the United States for civilian trial .

Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering , laundering drug money and drug trafficking . He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar 's notorious Medellin cartel and , in the process , amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune .

He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes in the United States .

While in U.S. custody , he suffered from prostate cancer and a stroke .

The man who once loomed large in Panama , Noriega returned home a shadow of his former self .

`` I do n't think it 's going to change in great measure the politics in Panama , '' said Shifter .

`` The country has moved on . They 're interested in different things . Many young people do n't even know about the Noriega era . But I think for those who do remember I think it is important , '' he said .
