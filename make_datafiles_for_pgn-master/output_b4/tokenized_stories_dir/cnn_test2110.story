-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexico 's foreign ministry has accused a U.S. border patrol agent of fatally shooting a Mexican citizen over the weekend .

The shooting occurred near the bridge that connects Brownsville , Texas , with the Mexican town of Matamoros , the foreign ministry said Sunday in a statement condemning the violence .

The ministry said a Mexican national died after being shot by the U.S. agent , but did not release details about the circumstances surrounding the Saturday violence .

`` The Mexican government has repeatedly expressed that the disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions is unacceptable under any circumstance , '' the foreign ministry said , calling for a thorough investigation .

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said two agents fired shots Saturday morning during `` dangerous encounters '' along the border .

But U.S. officials have not confirmed any deaths related to the shootings .

`` We have been unable to establish a connection between the shootings and a victim reportedly admitted to a Matamoros hospital , '' U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Bill Brooks said .

Agents `` were involved in two dangerous encounters '' in the Rio Grande Valley Saturday morning , he said .

In one incident , an agent fired toward someone who was throwing rocks at him , he said .

`` At approximately the same time , another nearby agent observed a person aiming a weapon at him and fired his service weapon in defense , '' he said .

The FBI is investigating , Brooks said .

In 2010 , the FBI investigated after a border patrol agent shot and killed a Mexican teen along the border between El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juarez , Mexico . Federal officials closed the case in April , saying there was not enough evidence to pursue charges against the officer and that he acted within the agency 's policies for use of force .

The officer received widespread condemnation from critics who questioned his use of deadly force against 15-year-old Sergio Adrian Hernandez Guereca , who authorities said had been throwing rocks at the agent when he was shot and killed .

Opinion : Why ` illegal immigrant ' is a slur

Hernandez had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders , U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN after the shooting .

An appeal is pending in a lawsuit filed by the teen 's parents in U.S. federal court , accusing the officer of using excessive force . The Mexican government filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case last week , noting that its request to extradite the border patrol agent for prosecution had been denied .

`` As a matter of international responsibility , the fact that the victim was on Mexican soil when he was killed does not absolve the United States of responsibility for the acts of its agent , '' the brief said .
