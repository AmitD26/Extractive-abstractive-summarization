-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Late last month in Aleppo , Syria , civilians who have cell phone subscriptions received a foreboding text message in Arabic : `` Game over . ''

Those on prepaid phones -- including many opposition fighters and activists , who tend to throw their devices away after several uses to avoid detection -- did not receive the text , or subsequent messages , signed by the Syrian Arab Army , telling them to surrender their weapons .

`` The government was sending a message to the rebels through people who subscribe , '' says Taufiq Rahim , a Dubai-based Arab affairs analyst -- an act of psychological warfare carried out by cell phone .

The texts have increased Syria watchers ' concerns that the embattled government has realized both the full potential of using the Internet and mobile carriers to communicate with its leaderless opposition , and the importance of the networks as domestic and international lifelines for the rebels .

There are growing fears that the regime could shut down the Internet across the country , similar to what was done in Egypt during its January 2011 uprising , which brought communication in Cairo to a near standstill .

`` There have been enough rumors that the more tech-savvy folks are expecting it , '' says Jillian C. York , director for international freedom of expression for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which works to defend digital rights . `` In Egypt , you could say no one would have expected that . ''

Last month , the network was down for 10 days in Aleppo , the current focal point of the fighting , with activists and rebels communicating largely by satellite phone until service was restored September 20 .

But perhaps the biggest red flag came in July , when the government-controlled Syrian Telecommunications Establishment shut down 61 of its 66 networks , effectively cutting off the country 's Internet for about 40 minutes .

Since the summer , smaller , infrequently reported outages have plagued Damascus , Aleppo and other hard-hit cities .

`` Since it 's state telecom that provides access , it 's safe to say the government could turn the Internet off at any point , '' says Doug Madory , senior analyst at Renesys , a firm which tracks Internet data and intelligence and has been monitoring the situation in Syria .

`` The outages we 've seen in the last couple of months appear to be because of physical damage from fighting , or from power outages . They 're short-lived , they flicker on and off . We 've seen some Internet being -LRB- purposely -RRB- disabled in more disruptive parts of the country , like Aleppo . ''

Two weeks ago , rebels angry with the government 's mass text intensified their attacks against forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . The escalation resulted in the partial destruction of Aleppo 's storied covered souk , a heritage site since its days as a Silk Road trading post .

It also triggered an increase in violence in the decimated city , where rebels Tuesday continued to advance with the seizing of Maaret al-Numan , a key strategic town on the road between Aleppo and Damascus .

`` In a military zone , like Aleppo has become , the government can still communicate but opposition forces will have a very hard time '' should the network crash again , Rahim says . `` I think it 'll happen in a case of desperation . I would n't be surprised if for some reason they took down a few towers in Aleppo . ''

Who is arming the Syrian conflict ?

The Syrian Internet market is a state monopoly . Unlike neighboring Lebanon , whose 3 million citizens have access to 900 Internet routes out of the country , Syria 's 30 million people only have 66 .

`` It 's a country with state control over the Internet , '' Madory says . `` There 's no free market . ''

Fadi Salem , a Syrian scholar and activist , believes it 's in al-Assad 's best interest to keep the networks running . `` They 're interested in measuring and assessing what 's happening and trying to listen in , and even penetrate , and spy on activists and collect information , '' he says .

And the regime has a history of discounting the global influence of activist bloggers .

`` They do n't think -LRB- the opposition -RRB- has the ear of the international media anyway , '' Madory says . `` So they want their supporters to be able to voice any opinion that 's -LRB- pro-regime -RRB- . And they 'll want to allow their supporters to use the Internet to voice those opinions .

`` It 's the only reason why they have n't taken it down . ''

But just in case , activists are prepared . `` The standard government-controlled networks are not the only way of communication -- there are also satellite phones and Internet connection and landline phones , '' York says . `` So it would be a setback , but it 's not going to cut off communications if people are prepared for it . ''

`` Much of the opposition rely on satellite phones more than anything else , '' Salem adds . During Aleppo 's 10-day blackout , `` activists there were still able to upload videos and the like . ''

It 's hard to predict twists and turns in Aleppo , where there is general lawlessness .

`` Some groups under the Free Syrian Army are actually doing a lot of bandit-like action , looting government buildings , and for them it 's justified , '' Salem says . `` Activists inside are angry about this , because they want to preserve the state and all its establishments while they try to remove the regime .
