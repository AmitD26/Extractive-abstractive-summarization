New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- He called the widow of Roger Maris a few days ago , a surprisingly bold move that surely resulted in one of the most awkward phone conversations this side of Bobby Kennedy-George Wallace .

Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do .

And , indeed , he was correct . Pat Maris deserved to hear the words `` I juiced '' straight from the artificially enhanced horse 's mouth ; deserved to know why she and her family had unwittingly served as his official cardboard props some 12 years ago ; why her late husband 's single-season home run mark -LRB- arguably the most hallowed standard in all of American sports -RRB- had been tattered by a man boasting all the integrity of a Times Square pickpocket .

Think back , if you will , to September 8 , 1998 , when McGwire hit his record-breaking 62nd homer of the season at Busch Stadium , then immediately walked toward the stands to embrace the Maris children . Later , with tears streaming down his cheeks , McGwire told the media how , earlier that day , he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark . `` I touched it with my heart , '' he said . `` When I did that , I knew tonight was going to be the night . I can say my bat will lie next to his , and I 'm damn proud of it . ''

By all accounts , back then Pat Maris thought the large humanoid erasing her late husband from the record books to be an honorable fellow , one worthy of holding such a distinguished mark .

And now ?

`` I think she was shocked when I called , '' McGwire said yesterday in his interview with Bob Costas on the MLB Network . `` She was disappointed and she has every right to be . ''

In case you have n't received the official memo , protocol dictates this as the time when we 're supposed to forgive , forget and move forward . Yes , Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone . Yes , it was against the law . Yes , they are termed performance-enhancing drugs for a reason . But in the world of Major League Baseball , where the phrase `` manning up '' is traditionally applied to an athlete playing through pain or putting on a particularly clutch display , a new , steroid-era definition has been established :

Manning Up -LRB- verb -RRB- : When someone is caught cheating and , following a lengthy period of silence and/or denial , has no choice but to vaguely express remorse/regret or suffer unofficial banishment and a lifetime of Holiday Inn banquet room autograph shows for $ 15 a pop alongside Erin Moran and the robot girl from Small Wonder . The fawning sports media will immediately compliment his courage and welcome him back with open arms .

So , like Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte and Alex Rodriguez before him , Mark McGwire finally `` manned up . ''

Twelve years after shattering Maris ' record , five years after his embarrassing , I 'm - not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony , the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED , and that he was very , very wrong .

Well , very wrong .

Well , pretty wrong .

Well , sorta wrong .

Well , uh , not really wrong at all .

Between the tears and sniffles and awkward pauses , McGwire apologized for , ahem , nothing . Costas asked whether he thought he would have hit 70 home runs without steroids . `` Absolutely , '' McGwire said . `` I was given this gift by the man upstairs . ''

Costas asked whether the steroids made him stronger . `` The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes , '' McGwire said . `` I did not take steroids to get any gain for any strength purposes . '' Costas asked which drugs he had used . `` The names , '' McGwire said , `` I do n't remember . '' Heck , Costas tossed the ultimate underhand softball question , just to help a guy out -- Did McGwire feel as if he was cheating ?

`` As I look back now as far as my health and my injuries , trying to help my injuries to help me feel normal , I can see why people would say that , '' he said . `` As far as the God-given talent and hand-eye coordination and the genetics I was given , I do n't see it . ''

And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting : Mark McGwire does n't see it .

By using PED , he did n't merely take Maris ' record . No , McGwire made millions in endorsements that should have gone elsewhere . He was selected to All-Star Games that should have featured other players . He won Sports Illustrated 's Sportsman of the Year as other candidates were overlooked . He convinced a nation of baseball fans that they were witnessing history -- real , honest-to-goodness history -- when , in fact , it was all a WWE-styled illusion .

Pat Maris received her phone call . Will you be getting yours ?

He says steroid user apologies have given a new , ignoble , meaning to `` manning up ''
