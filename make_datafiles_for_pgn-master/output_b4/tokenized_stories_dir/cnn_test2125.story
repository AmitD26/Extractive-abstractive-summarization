-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Forget Disneyland ! Costa Rica is the happiest place in the world , according to an independent research group in Britain with the goal of building a new economy , `` centered on people and the environment . ''

Costa Rica is known for its lush rain forests and pristine beaches .

In a report released Saturday , the group ranks nations using the `` Happy Planet Index , '' which seeks countries with the most content people .

In addition to happiness , the index by the New Economics Foundation considers the ecological footprint and life expectancy of countries .

`` Costa Ricans report the highest life satisfaction in the world and have the second-highest average life expectancy of the new world -LRB- second to Canada -RRB- , '' the organization said in a statement .

They `` also have an ecological footprint that means that the country only narrowly fails to achieve the goal of ... consuming its fair share of the Earth 's natural resources . ''

The Central American country , tucked between Nicaragua and Panama , touts its lush rain forests and pristine beaches . Its president , Oscar Arias Sanchez , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for trying to help end civil wars in several Central American countries .

This year 's survey , which looked at 143 countries , featured Latin American nations in nine of the Top 10 spots .

The runner-up was the Dominican Republic , followed by Jamaica , Guatemala and Vietnam .

Most developed nations lagged in the study .

While Britain ranked 74th , the United States snagged the 114th spot , because of its hefty consumption and massive ecological footprint .

The United States was greener and happier 20 years ago than it is today , the report said .

Other populous nations , such as China and India , had a lower index brought on by their vigorous pursuit of growth-based models , the survey suggested .

`` As the world faces the triple crunch of deep financial crisis , accelerating climate change and the looming peak in oil production , we desperately need a new compass to guide us , '' said Nic Marks , founder of the foundation 's center for well-being .

Marks urged nations to make a collective global change before `` our high-consuming lifestyles plunge us into the chaos of irreversible climate change . ''

The report , which was first conducted in 2006 , covers 99 percent of the world population , the statement said .
