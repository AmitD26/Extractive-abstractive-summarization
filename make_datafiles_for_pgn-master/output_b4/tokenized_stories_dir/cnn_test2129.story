-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The biggest case of the Supreme Court 's term involves a three-headed , hot-button appeal combining abortion rights , religious liberty , and Obamacare . It 's also the last one , and a ruling is due on Monday .

The legal and social pique may not reach the heights of two years ago when the justices narrowly preserved the Affordable Care Act and its key funding provision in a blockbuster ruling .

But the stakes are still large , and the decision could serve as a primer for other pending challenges to the health law championed by President Barack Obama and in play as a campaign issue this midterm season .

The issue before the justices is whether Obamacare can mandate contraception coverage specifically for certain businesses that object for religious reasons .

`` This case is n't that practically important , except for the employees and businesses involved . There just are n't a huge number of those , '' said Thomas Goldstein , publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a Washington appellate attorney .

`` But everyone can agree the social questions presented -- about when people can follow their religious convictions , and when people are entitled to contraception care -- are truly important , '' he said .

Hundreds of advocates and demonstrators representing both sides are expected to rally in front of the courthouse on Capitol Hill .

Contraception mandate

The section of law in dispute requires for-profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay .

A number of companies equate some of the covered drugs , such as the so-called `` morning-after '' pill , as causing abortion .

The specific question presented was whether these companies can refuse , on the sincere claim it would violate their owners ' long-established moral beliefs .

The First Amendment says that `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ''

`` How does a corporation exercise religion ? '' asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor at March 's oral arguments , summarizing perhaps the key constitutional question at hand .

`` This is a religious question and it 's a moral question , '' added Justice Samuel Alito , suggesting the businesses have such a right . `` You want us to provide a definitive secular answer . ''

Conestoga , Hobby Lobby

The justices have a good deal of discretion to frame the competing issues and could reach a limited `` compromise '' through narrow statutory interpretation .

They could conclude individual owners can make the religious freedom claim , bypassing the corporate rights argument , but still give female workers the flexibility to get covered drugs .

The court weighed two related appeals from Conestoga Wood Specialties , a Pennsylvania cabinet maker , and Hobby Lobby , an Oklahoma-based retail giant that will have more than 700 arts-and-crafts stores nationwide by year 's end .

Both corporations emphasized their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace . That includes their leaders ' publicly stated opposition to abortion .

The case presented a complex mix of legal , regulatory , and constitutional concerns over such thorny issues as faith , abortion , corporate power , executive agency discretion , and congressional intent .

Health law impact

The political stakes are large , especially for the future effectiveness of the health law , which marks its fourth anniversary this year .

The botched rollout last fall of HealthCare.gov , the federal Obamacare website , has become another political flashpoint along with other issues that many Republicans say proves the law is unworkable .

They have made Obamacare a key campaign issue in their fight to overtake the Senate , and retain control of the House .

Supporters of the law fear a high court setback on the contraception mandate will lead to other healthcare challenges on religion grounds , such as do-not-resuscitate orders and vaccine coverage . More broadly , many worry giving corporations religious freedom rights could affect laws on employment , safety , and civil rights .

The abortion link

The Hahn family , owners of Conestoga , and the Green family , owners of Hobby Lobby , said some of the mandated contraception prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman 's womb , which the plaintiffs equate with abortion .

That includes Plan B contraception , which some have called the `` morning after '' pill , and intrauterine devices or IUDs used by an estimated 2 million American women .

A key issue for the bench has been be interpreting a 1993 federal law requiring the government to seek the `` least burdensome '' and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions .

Chief Justice John Roberts could be the `` swing '' vote as he was two years ago when siding with the court 's more liberal members to allow the law 's `` individual mandate '' to go into effect .

That provision requires most Americans to get health insurance or pay a financial penalty . It is seen as the key funding mechanism to ensure near-universal health coverage .

Searching for compromise ?

But how will the divided court rule this time ?

Unanimous opinions in recent days on separate issues involving presidential recess appointments , cellphone searches by police , and abortion clinic protests suggest Roberts may be on a private campaign to push his colleagues to rule narrowly to reach consensus .

Such an approach usually involves both left - and right-leaning justices reluctantly giving a little .

`` At oral argument it seemed likely a majority of the justices were looking for a compromise , '' said Goldstein , `` in which the closely held for-profit businesses would n't themselves have to pay for contraception care , but the employees would get it , maybe through the exchanges , maybe financed by the federal government . ''

Compromise may be nice , but as other contentious cases earlier this term demonstrated , it is not always easy to achieve .

Separate decisions this spring involving political campaign donations and voter-approved affirmative action limits produced especially sharp 5-4 divisions .

Under the Affordable Care Act , financial penalties of up to $ 100 per day , per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage . Hobby Lobby , which has about 13,000 workers , estimates the penalty could cost it $ 475 million a year .

The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves rules negotiated between the Obama administration and various outside groups . Under the changes , churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate .

Other nonprofit , religiously affiliated groups , such as church-run hospitals , parochial schools and charities must either offer coverage or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer 's direct involvement . Lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts .

Second generation

Monday 's decision could signal how the court will approach other lawsuits against the health care law .

`` We 're now getting the second generation of challenges to Obamacare -- about the actual adoption of the statute , and its core provisions , '' said Goldstein . `` We 're probably going to see cases over the next five to ten years , as more and more details about the law get put into effect . ''
