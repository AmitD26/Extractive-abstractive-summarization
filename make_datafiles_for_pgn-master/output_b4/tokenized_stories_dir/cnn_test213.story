Gut 's previous best finish in a giant slalom race had been third -- in Lenzerheide , Switzerland earlier this year and at Semmering in Austria back in 2008 .

Zettel 's second place earned her a record fifth podium finish in Soelden and the 20th of her career in giant slalom .

`` It 's a big podium here and quite a good beginning to the season . I felt confident before the race and I hoped to get a podium after a good summer of training in New Zealand , '' Zettel said .

Mikaela Shiffrin was the best-placed U.S. skier finishing sixth , but compatriot Julia Mancuso had a disappointing opening day finishing down in 27th .

Last season 's overall World Cup champion Tina Maze was crowned `` Skier of the Year '' earlier in the week but could only finish in 18th place in a race she won 12 months ago .
