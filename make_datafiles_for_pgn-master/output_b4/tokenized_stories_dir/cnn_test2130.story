-LRB- Wired -RRB- -- Military work is physically demanding -- and we 're not just talking about soldiers on the battlefield . Travel down the chain , and you 'll find plenty of positions where strength and stamina are highly valued skills .

Take the Navy for example . The Navy needs ships and those ships need to be built and maintained -- a rough , physically draining job . Sandblasting , riveting , and grinding excess metal off the ships can take a toll on the human body . You 're often carrying tools that can weigh upwards of 30 pounds .

`` There 's a lot of wear and tear on you , '' says Adam Miller , director of new initiatives for Lockheed Martin . `` Skilled workers can maybe do that for three to four minutes then they need to put the tool down and they need to rest . ''

For the past couple of years , Miller has been leading a team of engineers and designers to create one of the first industrial-use exoskeletons . Called the FORTIS , the exoskeleton is able to support tools of up to 36 pounds and transfer that load from a worker 's hands and arms to the ground . The goal is to lighten workers ' loads , ultimately making them more productive and skilled at their jobs .

The U.S. Navy recently bought two of the exoskeletons and plans to test them over the next six months to see how they might be used in an industrial situation .

Compared to something like the TALOS -LRB- Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit -RRB- , a computerized exoskeleton that essentially wants to turn mere mortals into Iron Man , the FORTIS is fairly simple .

`` I would call it elegant , '' says Miller . The anodized aluminum and carbon fiber skeleton weighs 30 pounds , and follows along the outside of a human 's body . It has joints in the parts of the body that would regularly have joints -LRB- ankle , knee , hip -RRB- and flexes from side to side at the waist . Miller says the skeleton was designed for complex environments -- whoever is wearing it can climb stairs or a ladder , squat and generally move business as usual in the exoskeleton .

Tools mount to the front of the FORTIS and that weight is directed through the joints in the hip and down to the floor , relieving stress on the entire body , including the feet and ankles .

Watch and Learn

The design team began by watching how humans walk . `` You have to look at biomechanics of the person because it 's not just a stand ; it 's really something they can move around in , '' says Miller . The FORTIS was designed so it could slip over a worker 's boot -- this is important since feet often communicate the first signs of weariness . It 's like running in a pair of crappy shoes ; it impacts your entire body . Many exoskeletons transfer that weight to the sole of the foot , but this is a problem , says Miller .

`` When the weight of the tools and exoskeleton itself is transferred to the ground , it comes to rest on the sole , '' he says . `` However , a sole can also contribute to user discomfort , increased metabolic cost to the user and introduces instability . '' Instead , the FORTIS uses a stirrup that attaches to the ankle , allowing the foot to rest on the ground as usual .

Why are we so fat ? The multimillion-dollar scientific quest to find out

Early tests show that the exoskeleton has increased productivity anywhere from two to 27 times , depending on the task . The team measured the amount of time a worker could hold a 16-pound grinder overhead without having to rest his arms . `` The longest operators could work continuously without a break was three minutes sustained without augmentation , '' says Miller . `` Using the FORTIS , operators could work 30 minutes or longer without requiring rest breaks . ''

Lockheed Martin has been developing exoskeleton technology for the past five years . Its other exoskeleton , the HULC , is hydraulic-powered and can support up to 200 pounds . The HULC was designed to be used on the field , during battle .

The FORTIS ' capabilities are scaled down , but with its focus on mobility , you can imagine that it could be useful for other industries like construction or mining -- `` anywhere there 's a complex and irregular environment , '' says Miller . `` We 're expecting other industries to see it and say , ` We want something similar . ' ''
