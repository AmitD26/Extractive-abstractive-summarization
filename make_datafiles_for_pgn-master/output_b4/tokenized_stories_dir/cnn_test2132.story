-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The headlines about Ezra Miller may focus on him being the first openly gay actor to portray a superhero in a major motion picture -- but that 's probably not exactly how the actor would phrase it .

`` I 'm queer , '' he told Out magazine in a 2012 interview . `` I have a lot of really wonderful friends who are of very different sexes and genders . I am very much in love with no one in particular . ''

Miller has been cast as the Flash in the DC Comics movie universe , presumably appearing in `` Justice League Part 1 , '' which is set for 2017 , before taking the lead role in `` The Flash , '' scheduled for 2018 . He has attracted attention from critics and fans for his roles in dramas such as `` The Perks of Being a Wallflower '' and `` We Need to Talk About Kevin . ''

Wonder Woman , Aquaman and more headed to theaters

Here are five things to know about the actor :

1 . He started young .

Miller was only 6 years old when the New Jersey native would make treks into New York for a role in Philip Glass ' contemporary opera `` White Raven . '' The arts are in his blood , he has said .

`` My mother is an artist through and through , '' he told Interview magazine . `` She 's a modern dancer . And I think the way she raised her children was with a playful , curious inquiry into the world . ''

2 . He 's still young .

Despite having longevity in the business , winning raves from respected costars like Tilda Swinton and being a bit of a darling of the indie movie world , the actor is only 22 years old . Independent film has been a perfect training ground for him .

`` Everything you do as a young and budding artist will be , in some way or another , independent , '' Miller said . `` And then if you can be doing independent work that is subsidized in some way , that 's a huge , beautiful leap in and of itself . ''

3 . Speaking was n't always easy for him .

The actor can actually thank his career , in part , for having to overcome a major challenge .

Miller had such a pronounced stutter at an early age that he was introduced to singing to help overcome it . And so a career in opera was born .

4 . You may have seen him locking lips with ...

The actor and his `` Beware of the Gonzo '' costar Zoe Kravitz -LRB- daughter of rocker Lenny -RRB- were photographed in a make-out session that sparked speculation the pair had gotten really , really close on set . The 2010 movie about an underground student newspaper was filmed in an actual high school , which may have helped contribute to their possible summer romance .

`` It was fun , '' Kravitz said of filming . `` It was just like being in school again . ''

5 . He 's had some legal trouble .

An arrest in 2011 on marijuana possession charges garnered Miller some headlines and unwanted attention , but there were at least two people who were n't surprised . He told Details magazine that his parents were n't at all shocked when they learned of the charges .

`` My parents had been gritting their teeth for that phone call for a long , long time , '' he said .
