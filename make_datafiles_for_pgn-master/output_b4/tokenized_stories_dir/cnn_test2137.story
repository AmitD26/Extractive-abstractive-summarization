-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Seven months of marathon training have made my 30-year-old knees feel like those of a person decades older . At times , I 've hobbled down stairs and winced unexpectedly . If I owned a cane , I 'd shake it at the trim women who run past me while pushing strollers full of infants -- and the gazelle-ish teens who spring by at two to three times my running pace .

Griping about irritating run-spiration T-shirts that say things such as `` Preserve the Sexy '' is a coping mechanism -- a way to distract myself from the somewhat-frightening marathon I signed up to run , like many of you , in response to the Boston Marathon bombing .

Until Monday , I wondered if I could finish .

That was the day I had a conversation with a Boston bombing victim who , after three surgeries , ran her first marathon a few weeks ago .

Before that , I worried about `` Mile 20 , '' which is when many runners quit . In most marathon training programs , you do n't run farther than 20 miles before race day . It seems natural to a Woody-Allen brain that Mile 20 should induce panic . How are you supposed to get energy for those extra 6.2 miles , which will take me at least an hour to run ?

All of those complaints and fears seemed so childish after I e-mailed with Lee Ann Yanni , a 32-year-old who was standing near the finish line in Boston in April when the bombs went off . Chips of wood and shrapnel the size of a half-dollar lodged themselves in her leg . Her fibula broke through the skin . Her eardrum popped . The doctors thought she was crazy , she said , when she told them she was going to run the Chicago Marathon . Before the bombing , she signed up for the race in honor of her dad , who died of cancer in October 2012 . Injuries were n't about to change her mind .

`` I 'm not letting these fools take my first marathon away from me , '' she told the Boston Herald .

Three months after the bombing , Yanni walked without crutches . In September , she ran for the first time since the surgeries , which removed the shrapnel , repaired the bone and grafted skin across the bottom part of her leg , pulling the flesh from her thigh .

Yanni is a physical therapist in Boston , so she knew what she was up against .

`` I know I was n't ready to run , and I said many times that this was the dumbest idea I had ever had , '' she wrote to me , `` but no one argued with me . Guess they were smart . ''

A friend suggested she walk most of the marathon , but Yanni insisted she would run it within the 6 1/2 hour limit . `` I said , ` NO . ' That 's not even an option . It 's not an option not to FINISH . ' ''

`` My dad fought his cancer for six weeks , '' she added , `` and I could suck it up and do whatever it took for 6 or 6 1/2 hours of ` pain . ' He was a fighter , and I knew that it was in me in some form . ''

The world of running was new to me when I began this process . This spring , two miles stole my breath . I had to do a training program to be able to start the marathon training program . For all their quirks -- the Gu packets , the Band-aided nipples , the overendorphined Instagram feeds -- runners all seem to harness a sense of determination you do n't find in day-to-day cubicle life . It ca n't be a question of whether or not you 'll finish . You will finish .

To believe otherwise is to fail , in a sense .

I believe that now , but only because I 've heard so many stories like Yanni 's . Earlier this year , I traveled to Oklahoma City to watch Sara Hunt finish the marathon she started in Boston but was cut less than a mile short by the bombing . `` Once I hit the point where I stopped in Boston , I was like , ` No more walking . I 'm running this , ' '' she told me . `` This race , this is for Boston . I 'm finishing . ''

There , I also met Gary Woodbridge , whose wife , Ronota Newberry-Woodbridge , was killed in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing . He ran his first marathon in her honor . `` She always wanted to run a marathon , and I finally lost enough weight where I thought I could try , '' he told me . He struggled , but he finished . He had to .

When I 'm running the marathon next week in North Carolina , I 'm sure there will be points when I 'll want to give up -- but I wo n't . I 'll have too many stories with me .

I 'll think of how Yanni 's husband washed her damaged leg while she held a towel over her face and cried , unable to walk and not wanting to look at the limb . About how she only had run about 11 1/2 miles in her premarathon training . She hit `` the wall , '' so to speak , at Mile 22 of her race . `` It was like a wall or a curtain came down , '' she said . Everything got hazy . She does n't remember seeing mile markers 23 or 24 .

`` My legs started to cramp , but I did n't want to stop and stretch because I was scared I would n't be able to get going again . ''

She did keep going , of course .

`` My advice would be just take it one step at a time , '' she wrote . `` We are only a select group of people that make that journey and take the time to achieve such an insane goal .

`` Take each mile and savor it . ''

`` I am glad that I can inspire people , '' she added , `` but I just feel like a normal person who loves running and who is wicked stubborn ! ... I was gon na cross that finish line one way or another . ''

After hearing Yanni 's story , I 'm sure I will , too .

I 'd also encourage you to consider signing up for a race -- of any length -- as part of CNN iReport 's Run for Boston group . Hundreds already have pledged to do so .

The goal is to show support for the truly brave people such as Yanni and others who are taking steps each day toward recovering from the Boston tragedy .

We 're running for them .
