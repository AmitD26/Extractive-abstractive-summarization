-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's just a few minutes after the final whistle has blown and the shiny basketball court of the Al Gharafa Sports Hall in Doha is filled with shouts and cheers .

The sky blue-clad national women 's basketball team from war-ravaged Somalia has just beaten Qatar , the host nation , at the 2011 Arab Games , in a hotly-contested match that ended 67-57 to the East African country .

`` Words ca n't describe how I felt , '' says Canadian-born Somali team member Khatra Mahdi about last week 's triumph . `` We were all jumping up and down , there were tears in the girls ' eyes -- history was made right there , '' she adds .

The victory marked a remarkable feat for the Somali players as it came against a backdrop fraught with difficulties and danger .

Notwithstanding Somalia 's prolonged civil war and shattered sports infrastructure , the team says it had to prepare for the Games in the bullet-ridden police headquarters in Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu . There , the women would train for two to three hours a day under the watchful eye of security officers , tasked to safeguard them against religious militants targeting women playing the sport .

`` We try to protect them outside and inside , '' says Said Duale , the secretary general of the Somali Basketball Federation , adding that the safety of the women is `` taken very seriously . ''

In recent years , many Somali athletes have been threatened by members of the militant Islamist group Al Shabaab who see sport as an `` un-Islamic '' activity , according to Duran Ahmed Farah , the Somali National Olympic Committee -LRB- NOC -RRB- senior vice president for international relations .

In summer 2006 , the Islamic Courts Union -LRB- ICU -RRB- , which then controlled Mogadishu , labelled sport as a `` satanic act '' and issued an order prohibiting women from playing sport , including basketball .

A few months later , the ICU was deposed but Al Shabaab , which has connections to al Qaeda , is still fighting to impose its own interpretation of Islamic law , or Sharia , on the country .

`` The threat is always there -- there are people who will see girls playing sport as a devil 's thing and they will not allow it , '' Farah says .

Women have been stoned to death for adultery ; amputations and beheadings are common while in some areas Al Shabaab has banned listening to the radio .

`` These girls are brave : in that kind of environment they 're still playing their sport , the sport they like , '' says Farah .

Basketball is one of the most popular sports amongst women in Somalia . Duale says that the country 's first national female basketball team was created in the early 1970s but had n't performed at an international tournament since 1987 .

The Islamist ban , coupled with the challenges presented by the lack of sponsorship and destroyed facilities , have all hindered the development of the sport in recent years .

Yet , despite the threats and all the setbacks , Somalia 's national women 's basketball team concluded its participation at the Games on Monday with the very respectable tally of three losses and two victories -- Kuwait also lost to Somalia .

Like some other teams representing Muslim countries , the national team plays in relatively modest uniforms : track pants and shirts with elbow-length sleeves ; players also wear scarves that cover their hair .

Coach Mohamed Sheekh put together an ambitious team comprised of women based in Somalia and the diaspora -- the United States , Canada , UK and Germany . Many of the players had n't even seen their teammates before , let alone played a basketball game with them .

`` I 'm very happy and proud of them , '' says Sheekh of his players . `` They were excellent and everyone was talking about them . ''

NOC president Aden Hagi Yeberow says the team 's success in Doha can act as a unifying factor in a country that 's been plagued by insecurity , political instability , lack of unity and scarcity of resources .

`` We want to use sport as a peace-building tool to bring the Somali people together , '' he says . `` What these young girls are doing in this tournament has laid the foundations , hopefully , of a good future of our people .

`` We would like to capitalize on this and also to move forward and , hopefully , this will be the beginning and the start of the unity of our people . ''
