Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The Senate on Tuesday rejected an amendment to tighten restrictions on federal funding for abortion in the sweeping health care bill it is debating .

On a 54-45 vote , the chamber agreed to table the amendment , which effectively killed it from further consideration . Rejection of the amendment means the Senate health bill , if approved with the current abortion language , would differ from more restrictive language in the House version of the bill passed last month .

The amendment filed Monday by Sens. Ben Nelson , D-Nebraska , and Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , mirrored language in the House bill that prevents any health plan receiving federal subsidies from offering coverage for abortion .

Anti-abortion legislators said the amendment would maintain the current level of restriction by preventing any federal funding for abortion except in the case of rape , incest or a threat to the life of the mother .

Hatch argued Tuesday that the Senate proposal as originally written provides a loophole for the use of federal money to subsidize health insurance that would cover abortion .

`` Taxpayers should not be called upon to pay for abortion , '' Hatch said .

Other GOP senators said the strong opposition by millions of Americans to federal funding for abortion should be respected by passing the amendment to tighten restrictions .

Nelson had warned that without the amendment , he could vote against ending debate on the bill .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nevada , needs 60 votes to close debate on the bill and bring it to a vote , and 51 votes for final passage . In the Senate , the Democratic caucus has 60 members . If Nelson or any other Democrats break with the caucus , Reid will need some Republican support to move forward .

Senate Republicans unanimously oppose the bill .

Opponents of the tougher language argued that the amendment would expand the current level of restriction because women receiving coverage under a federally subsidized health care plan would be barred from purchasing abortion coverage with their own money .

`` Why are women being singled out here ? It 's so unfair , '' said Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-California , adding there is no medical procedure for men that can not be purchased with private funds .

Sen. Debbie Stabenow , D-Michigan , said the real goal of the amendment is to deny women covered by government-funded health care the right to get an abortion .

`` Let 's keep federal policy in place that does not allow federal funding for abortion but respects the women of this country , '' Stabenow said .

Maine 's two Republican senators -- Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins -- both joined Democrats in voting to table the amendment , while seven Democrats voted with the chamber 's other 38 Republicans against killing the proposal .

The House adopted its restrictive language as part of a last-minute concession to anti-abortion legislators who threatened to defeat the health care bill without a vote on the provision .

Reid , D-Nevada , said earlier Tuesday he would continue to work with Nelson on the issue if the Nebraska lawmaker 's amendment failed .

`` I 'm happy to work with him , '' Reid said . `` If , in fact , he does n't succeed here , we 'll try something else . ''

If the Senate eventually passes a bill that gets merged with the House version , the abortion language will be a crucial issue . An anti-abortion bloc in the House threatens to reject a bill without the tougher language adopted by the chamber , while a liberal-progressive House bloc has said it wo n't accept a bill with the more restrictive provision .

Also on Tuesday , liberal and moderate Democrats reached a `` broad agreement '' on the public option portion of the Senate health care bill , Reid said .

Without revealing any details , Reid said the negotiating senators had reached an agreement that `` moves this bill way down the road . ''

Two Democratic sources said the deal includes proposals to replace the public option by creating a not-for-profit private insurance option overseen by the federal Office of Personnel Management , much like the current health plan for federal workers , and another allowing people 55 and older to buy into Medicare coverage that currently is available to those 65 and older .

But Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin , one of 10 Democratic senators working on the deal , said in a statement released after Reid 's announcement that he would not `` support proposals that would replace the public option in the bill with a purely private approach . ''
