-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Flappy Bird '' has flown the coop .

The addictive game that soared to the top of iPhone and Android app downloads disappeared from app stores on Sunday , though players who already have it apparently can keep on flying .

A tweet from the game 's creator suggested that its sudden success had become an albatross .

`` I am sorry ` Flappy Bird ' users , 22 hours from now , I will take ` Flappy Bird ' down , '' developer Dong Nguyen wrote on Saturday . `` I can not take this anymore . ''

Nguyen , a Vietnamese developer with a studio called DotGears , did not reply to CNN 's request for an interview last week and has stayed mostly quiet in the wake of the game 's recent and sudden success .

He gave an interview Monday to Forbes in which he said the game was conceived as a fun way to kill a few minutes but became `` an addictive product . I think it has become a problem . '' The game , he added , is `` gone forever . ''

`` Flappy Bird '' gives players a chance to steer a tiny bird through a difficult obstacle course of metal pipes . But it 's unclear why it shot to the top of the most downloaded charts .

Although new players can no longer download `` Flappy Bird , '' the game remains playable for those who had already added it to their devices .

Hundreds of phones with `` Flappy Bird '' installed have suddenly appeared for sale on eBay at hugely inflated prices .

`` Flappy Bird '' was originally released for the iPhone in May but did n't become the top free iPhone app until mid-January , following a surge in popularity that seems to have kicked off in early December . Observers have voiced several unproven theories about the game 's sudden success , including the use of bots to get it on Top 10 lists artificially , organic enthusiasm on social media and a surge in amusing user reviews in the Apple App and Google Play stores .

Nguyen told Chocolate Lab Apps he created the game in two to three days and says he did not promote the app in any way after its release .

In a series of Twitter posts Saturday , he said he would n't sell `` Flappy Bird '' and would continue to make games .

`` It is not anything related to legal issues , '' he said . `` I just can not keep it anymore . ''

Last week , `` Flappy Bird '' had an average four-star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the Apple App Store and 228,000 on Android . Many of the reviews were lengthy , tongue-in-cheek tales of time lost , marriages ended and people going cuckoo after playing the game .

CNN 's Heather Kelly , Nick Valencia and Maegan Ahern contributed to this report .
