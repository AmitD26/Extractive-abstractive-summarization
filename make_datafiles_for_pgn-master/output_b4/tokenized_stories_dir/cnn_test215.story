-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The cloud sounds amazing .

Set up your entire digital life to sync automatically with a server run by some big -LRB- ostensibly responsible -RRB- tech company , and you never have to worry about losing data again , right ?

Wrong , of course . As a Wired writer 's recent brush with hackers shows , there are plenty of ways for your cloud-based accounts -- Amazon , Apple , Google -- to be hacked . And while both Amazon and Apple responded to Mat Honan 's story -LRB- you should read the whole thing ; he says he lost all his pictures of his young daughter in the attack -RRB- by at least temporarily changing their policies in hopes of better protecting consumers , there are still plenty of cloud-related precautions security experts say you should take .

These go beyond just setting passwords that are n't `` 12345 . '' -LRB- Hopefully you made that switch in 1998 . Hopefully . -RRB-

Here are five of the best cloud-safety tips we could rustle up :

1 . Backup everything -- in the cloud and on the ground .

In his account for Wired , Honan writes that he does n't actually blame the person who hacked him for the fact that he lost all of the data on his laptop . `` I 'm mostly mad at myself , '' he writes . `` I 'm mad as hell for not backing up my data . I 'm sad , and shocked , and feel that I am ultimately to blame for that loss . ''

Robert Siciliano , an online security expert at McAfee , said people should back up their data not only with a cloud service such as iCloud , Mozy or others but also on `` at least two , three or four '' real-life hard drives . For maximum protection , put these backups in multiple locations .

`` You do n't want to have all your eggs in one basket , '' he said .

2 . Use a bunch -LRB- maybe hundreds ? -RRB- of different passwords .

Here 's another one from Siciliano : Create different passwords for every single online account .

`` I have 700 and something passwords , '' he said .

You can use a password management service such as RoboForm or LastPass to generate hard-to-guess passwords and to store them on the devices you use most often . Other security experts recommend writing the passwords down in one place and storing that paper in your wallet -- although that could pose a security risk if your wallet is stolen .

3 . Do n't link all of your accounts together .

This is sometimes called daisy-chaining , and Honan writes that it 's one of the things that did him in . If you use Facebook , Twitter or Google to log in to other social networks or websites , you may run the risk of all those accounts being compromised at once . Siciliano said it 's OK to link accounts sometimes , but you should try to think like a hacker when you 're doing it .

`` Connect accounts , '' he said , `` but you have to reverse engineer the process . What could a bad guy do if he got access to this account ? '' If he or she could get bank account info , reconsider .

4 . Use two-factor authentication on Google and Facebook .

This one is key . Both Facebook and Google offer what 's called `` two-factor authentication '' or sign-in . Google 's Matt Cutts explained this in detail in a recent blog post called `` Please turn on two-factor authentication . '' He writes : `` Two-factor authentication means ` something you know ' -LRB- like a password -RRB- and ` something you have , ' which can be an object like a phone . ''

For example , Google will send you a code via text or voice message when you sign in . You 'll then need your password and the code to log into your Google account from an unfamiliar computer if you have two-factor authentication turned on . `` You can tell Google to trust your -LRB- other -RRB- computer for 30 days and sometimes even longer , '' Cutts writes .

Facebook , meanwhile , has a similar feature that it calls `` Login Approvals . '' It 's used when you log in from an unfamiliar computer . You have to turn both these features on . And , according to Wired 's Kim Zetter , some other services , including Amazon , Rackspace and WordPress -LRB- with a plug-in -RRB- have two-factor authentication , using some of Google 's tools .

Not every online service has these options . But `` when a site has given you additional security options -LRB- like Gmail 's two factor authentication which sends you an SMS when you try to log into your account -RRB- -- USE THEM ! '' Graham Cluley , a senior technology consultant at Sophos , wrote in an e-mail .

5 . Do n't use ` Find My Mac ' on Apple computers .

Here 's another one from Honan . If you use `` Find My Mac , '' which is designed to help you locate your laptop in the event of a theft , you run the risk that a thief or hacker could wipe it clean , which is what appears to have happened to him .

`` When you perform a remote hard drive wipe on Find my Mac , the system asks you to create a four-digit PIN so that the process can be reversed . But here 's the thing : If someone else performs that wipe -- someone who gained access to your iCloud account through malicious means -- there 's no way for you to enter that PIN , '' he writes .
