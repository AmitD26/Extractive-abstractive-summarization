-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Just like those petite waifs that glide effortlessly down the Rue de Rivoli , seen at first-hand the beauty of Paris can be breathtaking .

The Eiffel Tower is one of the world 's most iconic buildings and is just one of the city 's many highlights .

Yet like those same Paris ladies who wear their hauteur like a badge of honor , the city is not without its dark side .

In recent years the French capital has had its elegant facade ruffled by an explosion of discontent among the city 's disenfranchised underclass .

Young men -- many the offspring of North African immigrants -- angry at the lack of opportunities and perceived racism from state institutions have taken to the streets , fighting violent pitched battles with police .

All this has happened in the city 's ghettoized suburbs -- the banlieues . If you stay in the pristine center , you 'd never know it was going on .

The ugly high-rises of the unkempt banlieue are a world away from the tourists ' Paris : a timeless masterpiece of tree-lined boulevards , majestic architecture and white-aproned waiters uncorking bottles of Bordeaux .

The city 's abundant charms give it a unique ability to bring out the romantic side of even the most world weary .

Winding your way along the banks of the Seine near Notre Dame on a spring day can feel like being in beautiful day dream .

Of course , you might find the illusion comes crashing down around you when you sit down at a cafe and discover the rudest man on the planet disguised as your waiter . But what would Paris be without those famously haughty Parisians , regarding you with thinly veiled contempt when you try to order `` deux billet pour le metro '' in a bad French accent ?

For all its classical beauty the city center is actually a fairly modern creation .

The cramped and disease-ridden streets of medieval Paris were torn down in the 19th century . The work commissioned by Napolean III and supervised by the urban planner Baron Georges-Eugene Haussmann transformed the center into the city of wide boulevards and grand squares that you see today .

Haussman 's Paris might look like the set from a sumptuous period drama but it 's not untouched by the modern .

Competing for space alongside the Eiffel Tower on the Paris skyline , is the post-modern strangeness of the Pompidou Center and the sleek glass arch at La Defense .

These modern creations do n't get the approval of all Parisians or of the tourists , and you sometimes get the impression contemporary Paris is slightly stifled by its past -- a victim of its own beauty .

Of course there 's only one way to contemplate this and the many other questions the city raises . That 's with a cafe au lait in hand , seated at a terrasse watching the world , and the waifs go by .
