The pathologist hired by Michael Brown 's family to conduct an autopsy on the Ferguson , Missouri , teenager will testify Thursday before the grand jury that is deciding whether to indict a police officer in Brown 's killing , according to family attorney Anthony Gray .

Dr. Michael Baden , the former medical examiner for the city of New York , conducted a second autopsy on the 18-year-old 's body after a local medical examiner performed one .

Though the grand jury has until January to make a decision , the prosecutor 's office has said that an announcement on whether it will indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson could come as early as mid-November .

Residents nervous ahead of announcement

There 's intense nervousness in the St. Louis suburb as many residents fear that a repeat of the chaos and violence , and clashes between protesters and police , could happen again when the grand jury 's decision is announced .

In the days after Brown 's killing , protesters marched in the streets , enraged because they felt the fatal shooting was the result of an excessive use of force by police .

Witnesses to the shooting say that Brown , an unarmed African-American , had his hands in the air as if he was surrendering when he was shot by Wilson , a white officer . Authorities have said that Brown tussled with Wilson and tried to take the officer 's weapon .

There was also anger when autopsy results from a first procedure were not released , many felt , in a timely fashion .

Brown was shot at least six times , independent autopsy shows

Legal opinions differ

CNN 's legal experts are offering differing opinions about allowing an expert hired by a party in a case to address a grand jury .

CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it 's not an unusual move .

`` Grand juries often hear a variety of evidence from many different sources , '' he said . `` Calling this expert is consistent with the prosecutor 's promise to present all the available evidence to the grand jury . ''

CNN legal expert and longtime New York attorney Paul Callan , who has presented cases to hundreds of grand juries , said it is highly unusual .

`` When a prosecutor says he 's going to present all evidence available , the implication is that he or she is presenting all sorts of objective evidence of non-interested bystanders , '' Callan said .

The Brown family pathologist `` is someone hired by the family and presumably to support a civil lawsuit for money damages later , '' Callan said .

It 's not illegal to call someone hired by an interested party , he added , but the police officer 's side may perceive it as unfair . `` What would stop the cop 's attorney from asking , ` Why ca n't we do our own autopsy now ? ' ''

Baden is a high-profile pathologist , having testified in the murder trials of O.J. Simpson , Phil Spector and Drew Peterson . He was also chairman of the committee of pathologists that investigated the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. .

Opinion : What Michael Brown 's autopsy tells us

The grand jury process

Grand jurors ' work is done in secret . Only a prosecutor and the jurors are present ; the defense attorney is not privy to the proceedings . The jurors can ask a prosecutor to see anything -- including , for example , an autopsy conducted by an outside expert , Callan said . But -- if it 's legal -- it 's at the prosecutor 's discretion whether to give it to them , the attorney explained .

Everything between the prosecutor and jurors is on the record which is made available later to the public .

`` In a case like this which is so controversial , -LRB- the prosecutor -RRB- knows everything is going to be scrutinized , '' Callan said , adding that he suspects the prosecutor is giving a `` complete presentation '' of all material to the jury and informing jurors plainly of the law .

Both Callan and Joey Jackson , a criminal defense attorney and CNN legal analyst , said it 's crucial to balance providing the jury with too much or too little information .

A prosecutor has to `` be careful '' Jackson said on CNN Wednesday . A grand jury should hear information that is explanatory rather than persuasive , he stressed .
