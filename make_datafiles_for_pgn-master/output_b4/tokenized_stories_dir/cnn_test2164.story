You 've heard of crowdfunding -- raising funds through donations on the internet -- well , get ready for `` like '' funding .

An enterprising new startup in Hong Kong has devised a way of harnessing Facebook `` likes '' as a way of getting valuable donations to worthy causes and , at the same time , boosting the corporate social responsibility profile of the companies that provide the cash .

Called Likefunding.me , the small team in Hong Kong 's Science Park district -- the city 's answer to Silicon Valley -- works to bring good stories and brands together .

Co-founder Kelly Yim -- a former actuary with a major bank -- left her job to devise a system that would benefit charities , creative projects and social enterprise projects .

`` We want to rally supporters to share interesting stories on creative projects that carry a sponsor 's logo . Through this sharing we can generate a measurable media exposure for corporate sponsors , '' Yim said , adding that sponsors get their corporate logo embedded with the story which appears whenever the project is ` liked ' or shared .

`` We know creative projects have the capacity to go viral -- just look at the potato salad project . We want to devise a system that allows people with these kind of projects to monetize their media exposure , '' she added .

With corporations donating a purse of a maximum of between $ 1,500 and $ 2,000 , internet users can choose from a menu of projects to `` like . '' Each `` like '' will typically give the project around $ HK2 and each `` like '' will carry the backer 's brand logo .

`` What we do is match-make creative projects with corporates , '' explained Yim . `` We have a database of different projects currently from Hong Kong and then we have contact with the corporate sponsors .

`` After we match-make them based on their corporate social responsibility objectives , we provide a web link for the creative projects , which is for their supporters to share the story with a different Facebook circle . ''

Using a simple embeddable button on the project , all supporters have to do is click the button to make a mini-donation .

The business model for Likefunding is similar to crowdfunding models where the company takes 10 % of the successful funds raised .

For a company that only filed its invention patent five months ago and had a beta-launch in August , it already has more than a few successes under its belt .

One in particular was a Hong Kong school principal who quit his job to start a charity organization to provide free tutorials to underprivileged children .

`` In a matter of just six hours , he generated 5,000 ` likes ' and 8,000 shares , '' Yim said . `` The result was quite impressive because the media exposure that project created was probably worth more than the exposure he got through Hong Kong 's mainstream press . ''

Other projects include work with abandoned animals and medical projects in China .

`` The ultimate objective is to make it like an advertising platform -- corporates can come to us , find the projects they want and at the same time their investment can be supporting interesting initiatives , '' she said .

Good stories , she says , have the capacity to go viral and can be worth more to corporations than the equivalent in advertising .

While there is a cap on the corporate donation so that a compelling and viral story does not sink its benefactor with Facebook `` likes , '' Yim said that a donation of around $ 2,000 can make a big difference to a small charity .

As for Likefunding , the company is looking to break even after next year .

Yim said that while many startups founder within a year , she has high hopes for the group she helped to set up . More than anything , she said , a startup needs money and it needs publicity when it starts out .

She believes the Likefunding model has the capacity to deliver both . Meanwhile , its most difficult task at the moment is educating a skeptical industry .

Digital media specialist Napoleon Biggs said the model was , as yet , largely untested .

`` I 'm really not sure if people are prepared to have sponsors ride their posts in exchange for funding a project . I guess if it 's a cause that you believe in , why not , '' he said .

For Yim , however , the whole thrust of Likefunding is getting corporates to put their money where their Facebook `` likes '' are .

`` It takes a lot of perseverance to get corporations to invest in this type of creative project -- it 'll at least take a year to educate them , '' Yim said , adding that the group have now set their sites on China as its next frontier and is already investigating a tie-up with the mainland digital giant Sina Weibo .
