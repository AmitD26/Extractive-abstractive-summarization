-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A little over two days . That 's how long the grand jury deliberated before deciding not to bring an indictment against Darren Wilson , the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri on August 9 . St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury had heard more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses before reaching its decision , which he said was supported by physical evidence .

Sadly , the grand jury 's failure to return an indictment of Wilson was not surprising . But do n't blame the grand jury ; blame McCulloch . He oversaw the proceedings and bears responsibility for their outcome .

McCulloch compromised the Ferguson grand jury proceedings from the start . He resisted calls to recuse himself , saying , `` I have absolutely no intention of walking away from duties and the responsibilities entrusted in me by the people of this community . '' However , the community would have been better served if he had stepped aside .

Are protests taking place near you ?

McCulloch 's father was a police officer killed in a shootout with an African-American suspect . His brother , uncle and cousin served with the St. Louis Police Department , and his mother worked there for 20 years as a clerk . Newsweek noted McCulloch 's `` long history of siding with the police . '' For the sake of impartiality , McCulloch should have let a special prosecutor take over the case .

The grand jury only needed to find `` probable cause '' to charge Wilson . That 's one of the lowest legal standards in our justice system , below `` beyond a reasonable doubt '' -LRB- required for a criminal conviction -RRB- and `` preponderance of the evidence '' -LRB- the standard in a civil trial -RRB- . The fact that McCulloch did not get an indictment for a killing that shocked the nation raises questions about whether he really wanted an indictment .

`` We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury , '' McCulloch said in August . Yet in grand jury proceedings , the prosecutor typically shows the minimal amount of evidence necessary to establish that a trial is merited . By dumping so much evidence on the grand jury , McCulloch may have overwhelmed them and led them to the wrong conclusion . In the process , he 's opened himself to charges that he was acting to protect Wilson .

Opinion : Why I feel torn about the Ferguson verdict

Consider McCulloch 's time frame for the grand jury , which The New York Times described as `` prolonged and exhaustive . '' Grand juries routinely return criminal indictments in a matter of days . But the Ferguson proceedings dragged on for months , putting a burden on the jurors to recall everything and then decide wisely . Another red flag was that this lengthy process was riddled with leaks , all of which supported Wilson 's account of the events .

Worse , McCulloch declined to recommend charges to the grand jury . Prosecutors normally walk a jury through the charges they are seeking , breaking them down and explaining why they are deserved . McCulloch instead left the Ferguson grand jury to sort through terms such as `` voluntary manslaughter '' and `` involuntary manslaughter in the second degree '' on their own -- making it more likely that they would not seek an indictment .

In fact , McCulloch could have brought charges directly against Wilson , circumventing the grand jury . He chose not to do so , which is a troubling indicator of his interest in aggressively prosecuting this case .

Opinion : Ferguson shows failure at every level

Sure , there are conflicting accounts of what transpired between Wilson and Michael Brown . Was Wilson in fear for his life , as he told investigators , when he and Brown struggled for his gun ? Did Brown have his hands up when he was fatally shot ? We will never know , because there will be no trial . That 's a tragedy for the Brown family and an affront to the fundamental American value that we all are equal under the law .

The grand jury 's decision has implications far beyond Ferguson . Gallup polling has found that African-Americans have less confidence in the criminal justice system than white Americans , while a W.W. Kellogg Foundation report found that 68 % of Latinos report being worried about police brutality . Wilson walking free will likely reinforce the views among communities of color that our justice system is unfair . And when significant segments of our population lose faith in our justice system , our democracy is weakened .

The Ferguson decision reflects poorly on prosecutor McCulloch . His flawed grand jury proceedings ensured that justice was not served for Michael Brown .
