American journalist Steven Sotloff began his last journey into Syria with a surprise gift for his fixer , Yosef Abobaker . It was a small camera .

`` Happy birthday ! '' Sotloff told his guide , whom Sotloff had befriended a year earlier by interviewing Abobaker 's father about the Syrian civil war .

Then came the real surprise for the two men : about 15 masked ISIS gunmen jumped out of three cars and took them captive , beginning a dark tale that eventually led to Abobaker 's release , but ended in Sotloff 's beheading .

In an interview with CNN this week , Abobaker provided a detailed account of how he , Sotloff and three armed guards were abducted in Syria by ISIS fighters in August 2013 , but since then , never once did U.S. officials try to interview Abobaker about his first-hand experience with ISIS and its captivity of Sotloff .

`` No , nobody tried to contact me and I tried to help . Nobody come to me and ask me any questions from the -LRB- U.S. -RRB- government ... . Nobody contact me or ask me about their conditions , '' Abobaker said in occasionally broken English . `` And they can find me . It 's easy . But , no , nobody tried to contact me . ''

A Sotloff family representative who kept contact with Abobaker before and after his captivity reiterated the claims , saying U.S. government or security agencies -- who were made aware of the fixer and his connection to Sotloff -- never talked to Abobaker .

`` That was one of many mistakes , '' Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi told CNN . He declined to comment further .

Abobaker 's assertions that his abductors were ISIS fighters could n't be independently verified by CNN .

FBI officials declined to comment directly on the accusations by Abobaker and Barfi , but asserted they are investigating the Sotloff case .

`` The FBI is actively investigating the savage murder of Steven Sotloff at the hands of terrorists and will not discuss investigative details at this time . We are committed to bringing the murderers of Steven Sotloff to justice , '' said FBI spokesman Paul Bresson .

ISIS ' killing of Sotloff shocked the world because it was the second of three videotaped beheadings of Westerners by ISIS since last month . The first was another U.S. journalist , James Foley , last month . Then Sotloff this month . And then British aid worker David Haines , this week .

A survivor 's torment

Since Sotloff 's decapitation , Abobaker has agonized over the fate of his journalist-friend and the fortune of his own release , as well as that of his brother and two cousins who went along as armed guards .

`` I was very angry , and after that I calmed down and was so , so sorry , '' Abobaker said in an interview conducted in Turkey . `` I put message on Facebook -LRB- to -RRB- tell his mother I am so sorry ... . I did my best to save him ... . My feeling is so sorry , like I lost my brother .

`` He was nice man and good heart I just wish he can rest in peace now , '' Abobaker added .

Abobaker blamed a guard on the Turkey-Syria border for possibly betraying Sotloff 's whereabouts to an ISIS contact . CNN contacted other journalists who worked with Abobaker , and they said he was an established fixer with a good reputation .

`` I think maybe one guard from the border , they call him on the radio , and he said he 's moved from here , you can wait for him : He has this kind of car , '' Abobaker said . Conscious of security , he did n't use his car that day and instead borrowed one , he said

Their harrowing abduction by ISIS occurred just 20 minutes after Sotloff , Abobaker and his relatives as aides entered Syria , on August 4 , 2013 , Abobaker said .

How it began

The moment the journalistic team entered Syria , Abobaker called Barfi to confirm the group was inside Syria .

Barfi was staying in a hotel in Turkey . When asked why he did n't travel with Sotloff into Syria , Barfi told CNN that `` I can not go into details about that . ''

This trip was n't the first time that Abobaker worked as a journalistic `` fixer '' -- or a jack-of-all-trades guide who does translations and arranges interviews . He had 18 months of experience working with at least 100 other journalists , and he was charging Sotloff about $ 80 a day , he said .

Abobaker had also been a rebel fighting for four or five months in Syria with the Tawheed brigade , a moderate Islamist faction . He even got married in his combat fatigues in Aleppo , with comrades firing their weapons in celebration , in February 2013 . That was six months before his ill-fated encounter with ISIS .

When the masked ISIS gunmen confronted Abobaker and his charges , Abobaker pulled out his gun , but he saw he was vastly outnumbered .

`` We were four people , and they are 15 , '' Abobaker said . `` We do n't have any chance to defend -LRB- ourselves -RRB- . ''

How many more Western captives is ISIS holding ?

Knowing all the roads

The ISIS gunmen took Sotloff and his retinue to a textile factory on the outskirts of Aleppo , and that was the last time Abobaker saw Sotloff . The captives were told to close their eyes , and one captor hit Sotloff with a gun and told him do n't look , Abobaker said .

`` I know all the roads . I know if they turn 500 meters , they turn left , they turn right ... , '' Abobaker said .

The captives were held individually in separate rooms , and Abobaker overheard one captor asked Sotloff for his passport , Abobaker said .

At first , Abobaker did n't know who the abductors were because they had accents from Morocco , Libya and Algeria , he said .

As days passed , he wondered whether he would survive the Islamic extremists waging war in Syria and northeastern Iraq in a quest to create a caliphate .

`` Sometimes I say they will kill us all because I work with people from outside , '' Abobaker said .

After 15 days of captivity , Abobaker , his brother and their cousins were freed by their abductors .

`` They ask me , do you know who we are , and I said , yes , I think you are ISIS , '' Abobaker said . `` And they said , yes , we should kill you . You are spy and work with America and CIA and FBI , but we leave you now because you work with -LRB- Tawheed -RRB- , because I have papers ... . But if we hear you work with journalist again , we will kill you for sure . ''

Sotloff 's family believes ISIS paid as much as $ 50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered Syria , Barfi said .

Apprising Sotloff 's family

Once liberated , Abobaker met Barfi several times to give him details about the abduction , Abobaker said .

Later , Abobaker often traveled between Turkey and Syria , and he sometimes asked other former captives of ISIS `` if they know information about any journalist , '' Abobaker said .

`` I go back inside -LRB- Syria -RRB- , and I try to make information , '' he added .

In fact , Abobaker heard one account that Sotloff was moved from the textile factory to an industrial center , also outside Aleppo , he said .

He then heard another unsubstantiated account that Sotloff was moved again , this time to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa , he said .

A year passed , and then Abobaker finally saw the news on the Internet .

Sotloff -- the journalist and one-time bearer of a birthday gift -- was barbarically killed by an ISIS executioner masked in black .

`` I send message to world to say it 's not really Islam , '' Sotloff said of the ISIS killing . `` They are liar . I say that to all the people . They are not Muslims . ''

Abobaker says he has now moved all of his family from Syria to Turkey . Two months ago , he became a father for the first time .
