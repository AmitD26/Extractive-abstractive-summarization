-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Are you running for president ? ''

`` When will you announce that you 're running for president ? ''

`` Why wo n't you just announce that you 're running for president ? ''

`` You would n't be have gone to Iowa if you were n't running for president , would you ?

Despite the world aflame , Ebola spreading and the Washington Nationals in the playoffs , it seems the only thing the political press can do is speculate about a potential Hillary presidential candidacy .

Keep in mind we are two years and two months away from the next presidential election . And yet the urgency is fierce , bordering on indignation : `` Why wo n't she just tell us if she 's running ? ''

Well , why should she ? An announcement now would be stupid , and Hillary is definitely not stupid .

If she were to go Open Kimono on us now it would draw attention from crucial midterm elections , siphon campaign donations from Democrats struggling to hold onto the Senate and possibly even eclipse important debates on how to fight ISIS and whether to shut down the government -LRB- again -RRB- .

There is little such insistence about , say , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie or Indiana Gov. Mike Pence or even two-time loser Mitt Romney . We presume they 're running -- just as most folks presume Hillary is . But we 're not hectoring them at every turn ; we 're not resentful that they have n't made a formal announcement .

Probably because we just do n't care as much about them . They 're not leading in the polls by a million points -LRB- nor will Hillary , if and when a campaign is underway -RRB- , and they simply do not rivet the national attention the way the former first lady , former senator , former secretary of state and future -LRB- ?! -RRB- first female president does .

I have not been in touch with Hillary , so I do not speak with intimate knowledge . But I have known her for -- jeez , 23 years . And I actually believe her when she says she has not completely made up her mind .

Hillary is a wonk who 's had to learn the rhythms of campaigning . That 's very different from , say , Texas Gov. Rick Perry , a glad-handing natural for whom it can be said that if an idea wanted to cross his mind it would need to bring a canteen . Hillary believes politics should be about ideas -- a clash of visions , of competing plans to promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense .

This , after all , is a woman who rings in each New Year by standing and singing `` God Bless America . '' But there are aspects of campaigning that she loves : a vigorous honest , face-to-face debate ; a town hall meeting in which folks ask substantive questions ; meeting people who pour their hearts out to her , who hold their baby daughters up to her , who share their hopes and their heartbreaks with her .

So I can imagine that there is an angel on her shoulder whispering , `` Who needs it ? '' Who needs the phoniness , the vacuity , the mind-numbing , bone-wearying , soul-crushing grind ? But on the other shoulder stands another angel , whispering , `` Because it 's worth it . '' If you care about , say , universal pre-kindergarten -- an issue Hillary has cared about and worked on for decades -- or finding ways to stimulate job growth ; if you care about peace abroad and supporting our military families at home ; if you care about the climate crisis and full equality for LGBT Americans and voting rights and a million other issues : the best way to make turn those ideas into action is through the presidency .

Hillary will decide soon enough . In the meantime , let 's let her listen to both of the angels debating for her heart . And maybe we can even give her a little breathing room as she becomes a grandmother .

We have plenty of other potential presidential candidates . I suspect they 'd love the attention .

The political media wants to know why Hillary Clinton went to Iowa recently

@highlight

Paul Begala : They are almost indignant over why she wo n't declare her candidacy

@highlight

Even if she want to run for president , it does n't make sense to say it now , Begala says

@highlight

He says it 's just as likely that Hillary has not completely made up her mind
