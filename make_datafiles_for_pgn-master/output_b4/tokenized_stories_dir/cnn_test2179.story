-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- This is Linda DeRegnaucourt 's last summer off . When school starts in August , it will be her last year to think about high school classes , advanced placement tests and calculus .

If all goes as planned , this will be her last year teaching at Palm Bay High School in Brevard County , Florida .

She does n't want to go . After 13 years of teaching high-level math , she has a tested stable of learning methods that helped all her students pass the AP calculus exam . Her room is a popular place for students to escape the drama of the high school cafeteria . Few jobs can indulge her excitement for linear functions and matrix calculus .

`` I hate to have to leave it , '' DeRegnaucourt said . `` I really thought I was going to be that teacher , 65 years old and retiring from the education field . That 's not going to happen . ''

She 's quitting , she said , because she ca n't afford to stay .

Two years ago , a divorce left 47-year-old DeRegnaucourt with a single income . Rental properties she owned only caused more financial strain as Florida 's real estate market fell apart in recent years . Despite her years of experience , she earns $ 38,000 , she said , less than she made in the past , when teachers received larger supplements for additional certifications .

Once she made a budget , she realized she did n't make enough money to cover her expenses and save for her future . Changing careers felt like the only wise financial move , she said .

DeRegnaucourt is n't the only one .

Attracting the best students to teaching -- and keeping them -- is tough for schools across the country . Average starting teaching salaries are $ 39,000 , and rise with experience to an average of $ 54,000 , according to `` Closing the Talent Gap , '' a 2010 report by McKinsey & Company . Teacher salaries ca n't compete with other careers , the report said , and annual teacher turnover in the United States is 14 % . At `` high-needs '' high schools , it is 20 % .

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development data from 2007 said the United States ranks 20th out of 29 for starting teacher salaries , and 23rd out of 29 for teacher salaries after 15 years .

But it 's not just the pay , DeRegnaucourt said , `` It 's the way we 're treated . ''

Her colleagues have waited until just before school starts to learn what courses they 'll be teaching , she said . Uncertainty makes it impossible to prepare , hard to succeed .

`` Five years ago , 10 years ago , kids would ask me , should they become teachers ? I was like , ` Oh , God , yes , I love what I do , ' '' she said . `` Now , I tell my kids , ` You 're really , really bright . Why do n't you think about going into -LRB- this or that ? -RRB- ' They have the potential to be doctors , lawyers , nurses , CEOs and scientists . Why would I recommend to my kids , who I absolutely love , to struggle for years ? ''

This year , she 's finishing the prerequisite courses needed to enroll in nursing school . DeRegnaucourt hopes to spend a couple of more years learning , then work in emergency care nursing to gain experience .

`` It 's challenging , '' she said , `` but there 's not a whole lot that 's more challenging than doing upper level mathematics . ''

Here 's what DeRegnaucourt had to say about her decision to leave teaching .

CNN : Why did you go into teaching ?

DeRegnaucourt : When my son was 6 years old , the school system that he was in in Georgia , it did not allow the teacher to take her planning days unless she could find a volunteer sub . She had to ask for parental volunteers . I told her at the beginning of the year , ` I work at night . I 'll take every single one of your days . I can substitute for you . ' I really enjoyed working with the kids . Then I read an article in the paper , and it said that -LRB- most -RRB- boys get the same educations as their mothers . I had not gone to college . I wanted my son to be college educated . It was time for me to go back to school .

I knew that math was an area where I would never , ever worry about getting a job as a teacher . If you 're in math or physics or chemistry , you can write your own ticket .

CNN : Had you always been interested in math ?

DeRegnaucourt : I was not a good student in high school . I really needed a teacher to take me under their wing and go `` Look , you have potential . '' I did n't have that teacher . I missed a lot of school . You ca n't be good at math unless you are present to learn it .

When I went back to school , my first math class was pre-pre-college math ... you did n't even get a grade for it , you just got pass or fail . I remember starting in negative numbers ; I never even knew negative numbers existed , except in my checking account . Whatever I did learn in high school , I had forgotten . I was 29 years old . I had been out of school for 11 years .

I had a teacher for developmental math named Ms. Sifton , and she was amazing . Out of my entire career , she was the best math professor I ever had . I loved math .

CNN : Did that influence how you teach ?

DeRegnaucourt : I did n't take Ms. Sifton for granted . The way she made it so elemental , and gave me that strong base to go ahead and succeed . What I have found is most people are n't awful at math , even if math is not your strength . You can be successful , given the right mentor . It definitely influenced the way I teach .

I have always had a very open relationship with my students . I do n't believe I deserve respect because I 'm older . I deserve it because I 've earned it , and you deserve it because you 've earned it .

The majority of the really , really amazing techniques I have came from students . I worked summers for years . I taught a six-week class where students could either remediate or jump ahead . You taught it for an eight-hour day . I had a young man , Victor Rodriguez . He came up to me , `` Ms. D , we 're just learning and learning and learning . We 're just forgetting and forgetting and forgetting . We need to practice it . '' I asked `` What do you think we should do ? '' He said , `` I think we need to go to the boards . '' Every day , except on test days , my kids go to the board -LRB- to work math problems in front of each other -RRB- . If they finish and they get it right , I give them a thumbs up and they go help another student .

The best teaching technique I have -- it came from Victor Rodriguez .

CNN : Why did you decide to leave teaching ?

DeRegnaucourt : I have had to learn how to budget . In those thoughts , I came to the realization that the money I make is n't enough . It is n't enough to live alone . That realization was daunting . As educators , we make what we make , nothing more , nothing less . In industry , if I 'm valuable , my company can keep me by making the package they offer me more attractive . In education , the principal 's hands are tied . You just never know what the future holds . I still need to plan for the future .

CNN : Why did you choose nursing ?

DeRegnaucourt : I 'm happiest when I feel like I 'm making a difference in another individual 's life . There are other things I could do . I could take actuarial exams . I could easily pass those ; it 's math . Do I want to be an actuary , doing risk assessment for an insurance company with no human contact ? No , thank you . What 's really amazing is that nurses , with a two-year degree , make $ 20,000 more than I do .

CNN : How did your students react when they learned this would be your last year teaching ?

DeRegnaucourt : My students were the first ones to know . One student comes to mind : Just the other day , he e-mailed and asked me to call him . He wanted to confirm again I would be there next year . The ones who were leaving , they do n't care . I 've already done for them what I needed to do . My juniors moving up to calculus , they were distraught . They know I know what I 'm doing . They know what it 's like to have a teacher who does n't know what they 're doing . They 've all had bad teachers . We all have .

CNN : What do you hope your students take away from their time in your classes ?

DeRegnaucourt : Kids come into my classroom , and everyone thinks they 're all math geeks . They 're not . I have so many kids who take my class because they want the calculus credit for college , but they 're not the kind of kid who could go to a college calculus class and meet with success . I want them to get a love not of mathematics , just knowledge , just learning . I want them to always remember how anything was possible .

After a successful 13-year teaching career , Linda DeRegnaucourt plans to quit .

@highlight

She earns about $ 38,000 per year -- too little to cover expenses , she says

@highlight

Nationally , attracting the best students to teaching is hard because of low pay .

@highlight

DeRegnaucourt plans to pursue nursing , which is likely to pay $ 20,000 more per year .
