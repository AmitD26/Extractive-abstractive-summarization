-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jacqueline Woodson 's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke .

After Woodson accepted an award for her memoir `` Brown Girl Dreaming , '' host Daniel Handler shared an anecdote he learned over the summer : that Woodson , who is black , is allergic to watermelon .

`` Just let that sink in your mind , '' said Handler , who writes popular children 's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket .

The non sequitur elicited a few laughs and uncomfortable titters from the audience . Handler went on to say that he advised Woodson to write a book that featured a black girl with a watermelon allergy . Watermelon is historically evoked as a favorite food among black people in racist jokes , and it 's considered by many to be an offensive reference .

Handler said that Woodson , who won the National Book Award for Young People 's Literature , told him he should write the book instead .

`` I 'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you , Cornell West , Toni Morrison , and Barack Obama saying this guy 's OK , '' Handler said , with a laugh .

After a clip from the awards ceremony was posed on C-SPAN , viewers and some prominent writers quickly took to Twitter to denounce Handler 's comments as racist and a distraction from Woodson 's accomplishment .

Handler responded with several apologetic tweets , including : `` My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes , racist . ''

Handler also pledged to donate $ 10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others ' donations for 24 hours up to $ 100,000 .

Woodson 's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler 's joke . The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident .

Other 2014 National Book Award winners included :

Fiction : Phil Klay , `` Redeployment ''
Nonfiction : Evan Osnos , `` Age of Ambition : Chasing Fortune , Truth , and Faith in the New China ''
Poetry : Louise Gluck , `` Faithful and Virtuous Night ''
