-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Smokable herbal blends marketed as `` legal highs '' have become increasingly popular and as easy to buy as cigarettes .

The blends of exotic herbs and other plants have been sprayed or coated with one or more chemicals that , when smoked , produce euphoria . They are commonly labeled as herbal incense to mask their intended purpose . These contain drugs that are dangerous and should be illegal .

`` K2 '' is a brand name for a dried herbal blend that can be smoked . It produces a high similar to that of marijuana but does n't contain tetrahydrocannabinol -LRB- THC -RRB- , the psychoactive chemical in marijuana . Instead , K2 contains synthetic chemicals , known as JWH-018 and JWH-073 , that mimic THC by acting on the cannabinoid receptors in the brain .

JWH-018 and JWH-073 are produced in China and unregulated in the United States . Similar products have been produced and marketed under names such as Spice , Genie , Blaze , Red X Dawn and Zohai . Since 2009 , the Drug Enforcement Administration has been receiving reports of the abuse of these herbal products .

K2 's key ingredients were invented by Dr. John Huffman at Clemson University in 1995 during medical research on the effects of cannabinoids on the brain . He found no medical benefits -- only negative side effects . Unfortunately , marijuana users reproduced the recipe , creating a legal alternative to marijuana .

Although the company manufacturing K2 is unknown , it is legally available for purchase in the U.S. by anyone , including minors .

In late 2008 , herbal incense-type products that were being shipped from Europe to the U.S. were found to contain traces of another potent psychoactive chemical known as HU-210 . It is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance because it is a derivative of THC with a similar chemical structure and pharmacological activity . HU-210 was also developed for experimental purposes and can be from 100 to 800 times as potent as THC .

In 2009 , Germany banned the sale of Spice because tests revealed that it contained JWH-018 and yet another potent chemical , CP-47 497 , developed by a drug company in the 1980s for research purposes . It produces effects similar to THC and is three to 28 times more potent .

Spice is banned by some U.S. military commands , where the potential for its abuse has been recognized . Research has linked naturally produced marijuana to health issues , including schizophrenia . With synthetic marijuana being even more potent , it is frightening to consider its potential damage .

K2 can cause increased heart rate , loss of consciousness , paranoia , hallucinations and psychotic episodes . Users report that smoking small amounts results in intense highs comparable to smoking large amounts of marijuana .

Studies in 2008 revealed that users developed chemical dependencies , withdrawal and addictive behaviors . Increasing numbers of children are purchasing synthetic marijuana products because they are legal and easier to obtain than cigarettes .

Because of the various chemicals being used , these substances are difficult to regulate . But the DEA is determining whether some or all of these products need to be controlled . More research is definitely needed . With young people using K2 more , some states are not waiting for the DEA and are moving to ban it .

Let 's face it : Anytime you consume an uncontrolled or unregulated drug or a drug with unknown effects , you are taking a risk . Products like K2 are not made in a controlled environment , and those who use it are playing Russian roulette .

Schedule I drugs are defined as substances that have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use . At this time , the evidence suggests that these synthetic marijuana substances should be controlled and perhaps classified as Schedule I drugs .

Making these drugs illegal makes it more difficult for dealers to push them to our children . It limits availability and sends a message that the drug is dangerous -- an extremely important message since history has shown that when youngsters perceive drugs to be harmful , they are less likely to use them .

K2 serves no apparent useful purpose , and we do not need more addicted family members , drug-impaired drivers or drug-related deaths .

The sale of synthetic marijuana is banned in Britain , Germany , Poland , France , South Korea and Russia . The U.S. should move urgently to protect the public from yet another dangerous and potentially deadly class of drugs .
