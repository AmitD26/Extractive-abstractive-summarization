Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico .

It 's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala , Mexico . Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence , and 43 students remain missing .

Where are they ? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery .

Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico 's Guerrero state , authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday .

Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves , Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday . The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried , he said , and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them .

A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites , authorities said .

The missing students , who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa , were mostly young men in their 20s , according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search .

`` Help us find them ! '' the website says , offering a reward of 1 million pesos -LRB- $ 74,000 -RRB- for information leading to the missing students .

State officials , who 've faced sharp criticism over the students ' disappearance , released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts . So far more than 30 people have been detained , including 22 local police officers .

The police have denied attacking anyone , according to a government statement on their detention .

But protesters from the school have said officials are n't doing enough .

`` NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL , '' one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said .

Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings .

`` The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had , '' one student from the school told CNN en Español .

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government 's response and called for calm in the face of protests .

`` To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred , I offer all my solidarity and support , '' he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday . `` It would be highly condemnable , those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us . ''

A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26 . A 15-year-old player on the team was killed .

Omar Sanchez , one of his teammates , described the ambush to CNN en Español .

`` We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over . And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns , '' he said . `` It sounded so ugly , the gunshots and my teammates screaming , ` Help , leave us alone , we are injured . ' A teacher said , ` you have already blinded me , please , we are the team from Chilpancingo . ''

The armed men said they were n't going anywhere , ordering the team to open the door .

`` Now you are going to be taken , we are going to kill all of you , '' the gunmen said , according to Sanchez .

When the teacher refused to open the door , Sanchez said , the men opened fire again .

The case has left many troubling questions unanswered . Key among them : Who gave the orders to open fire , and what was their motive ?

State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses , and city police opened fire .

Since then , evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group , and police connected with them , to the shooting and the students ' disappearance , Blanco told reporters Saturday .

In 2013 : 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico

For years Guerrero state , which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco , has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates , a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation .

Figures released by Mexico 's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country .

A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012 , the institute said , but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities .
