Islamabad , Pakistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pakistani authorities are blaming Friday 's deadly attacks in Lahore on militants with ties to the Pakistani Taliban .

Akram Naeem , spokesman for the Punjab police , said the attackers are terrorists from the Waziristan tribal region of Pakistan , where the Pakistani Taliban group maintains a strong presence .

Interior Minister Rehman Malik said there had been intelligence earlier in the month that an attack could happen in Lahore and that Punjab police did take some steps to react .

Then on Friday morning , attackers with bombs and firearms targeted houses of worship in Lahore belonging to the Ahmadi sect , a persecuted religious group . The death toll stood at 98 , officials said Saturday , and dozens more were wounded in the attacks .

The scenario jibes with Malik 's belief that the country will endure more sectarian and ethnic violence . He said he believes `` hostile elements '' like the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups `` are trying to destablize Pakistan . ''

Most of the dead -- 75 -- were killed at the place of worship in the Model Town neighborhood . The remaining 23 were killed in the Garhi Shahu neighborhood , he said .

Witnesses and officials said the attackers tossed hand grenades and fired weapons , including AK-47s . In the Model Town attack , one of the gunmen was critically injured and another was detained , police said .

Ahmadis regard themselves as Muslim , but the government says they are n't , and many Muslim extremists have targeted them . Sunni and Shiite Muslims say Ahmadis are not Muslim because they do not regard Mohammed as the last prophet sent by God .

The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , a nongovernmental organization , deplored the attacks and said it had warned the Punjab provincial government about threats to the Ahmadi community center in Model Town for more than a year . Lahore is the capital of Punjab province .

The movement was founded in 1889 . Its followers believe that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad , who lived between 1835 and 1908 , was sent by God as a prophet `` to end religious wars , condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality , justice and peace , '' the worldwide Ahmadi group says .

The group , which is thought to number between 3 million and 4 million people in the country , endures `` the most severe legal restrictions and officially sanctioned discrimination '' among Pakistan 's religious minorities , according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom .

The religious freedom commission , an independent , bipartisan U.S. government body , said in its latest annual report that `` Ahmadis may not call their places of worship ` mosques , ' worship in non-Ahmadi mosques or public prayer rooms which are otherwise open to all Muslims , perform the Muslim call to prayer , use the traditional Islamic greeting in public , publicly quote from the Quran or display the basic affirmation of the Muslim faith . ''

The agency says it 's illegal for the group to preach publicly , pursue converts or pass out religious material , and adherents are restricted from holding public conferences and traveling to Saudi Arabia for the hajj pilgrimage .

While the greatest number of its followers are in Pakistan and India , Ahmadis have a presence in many European countries , such as Britain , where the religion 's fifth and current spiritual head , Mirza Masroor Ahmad , resides .
