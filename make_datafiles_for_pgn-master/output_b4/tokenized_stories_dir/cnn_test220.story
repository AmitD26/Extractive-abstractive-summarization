-LRB- HLNtv.com -RRB- -- An Ohio man who confessed in a viral video that he killed a man while driving drunk kept his word Wednesday , pleading guilty to aggravated vehicular homicide and driving under the influence .

Matthew Cordle , 22 , appeared in a Columbus , Ohio as he told Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge David Fais that he wanted to change his original plea , entered on September 11 , from not guilty to guilty .

`` Yes , your honor , '' said Cordle , confirming his plea to the judge .

Fais asked Cordle , who wore handcuffs and a khaki jail uniform at the hearing , multiple times about his decision-making on June 22 , the date of the accident . Cordle told the judge he did not remember the events of that night because he `` blacked out '' from drinking too much .

Cordle also told Fais that he has not drunk alcohol since the night of the accident , and he attended a two-week alcohol rehabilitation program .

Cordle made headlines after a video was posted to YouTube on September 3 in which he confessed to driving while drunk and killing 61-year-old Vincent Canzani . In the video , he promised he would plead guilty and `` take full responsibility for everything I 've done to Vincent and his family . '' He also begged people watching the video not to drink and drive .

Several days after the video appeared , Cordle surrendered to authorities and was charged for his involvement in the wrong-way crash .

Canzani was driving a Jeep when he was struck by a wrong-way driver on Interstate 670 near Columbus , according to the Columbus Dispatch .

Fais said in court Monday that he had not seen the video of Cordle 's confession .

Cordle will be sentenced October 10 . Ron O'Brien , the attorney who is prosecuting the case , told CNN that Cordle faces a maximum sentence of 8Â 1/2 years in prison for his charges .
