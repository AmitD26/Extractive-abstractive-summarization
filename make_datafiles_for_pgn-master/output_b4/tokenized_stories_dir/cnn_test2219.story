Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are accusing a YouTube co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new `` foundering '' website .

A lawsuit filed Thursday by the celebrity couple blasts Chad Hurley , accusing him of secretly recording West 's surprise proposal to Kardashian in the middle of San Francisco 's AT&T Park on October 21 .

The video shows West kneeling near second base to ask Kardashian to marry him while a large orchestra plays in center field . The leak diminishes the value of the video of the event that Kardashian and West own , the suit said .

Hurley `` finagled entry '' into the birthday party that West threw for his girlfriend , although only `` several dozen people '' were invited , the lawsuit said . Although he tagged along with someone who was invited , he was permitted to stay `` only after giving his word -- including in writing -- that he would not publish any aspect of the event . '' The court filing includes a photo of Hurley purportedly holding the signed confidentiality agreement in his hand .

`` Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event , '' Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit , a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo , California , company , it said .

The lawsuit slammed Hurley , 36 , as a failed entrepreneur who leaked the video `` out of desperation . ''

`` Despite his extraordinary financial success in creating YouTube , which was sold in 2006 , Hurley has ever since sought his ` second act , ' '' the lawsuit said . `` This has become exceedingly elusive to Hurley . ''

It cites his failed Formula One racing team and his `` Web service named Zeen , which also failed and has been slated for closure in 2013 . ''

His newest venture -- MixBit -- `` also quickly ran into trouble '' after launching in August , the lawsuit contends . `` Following a lackluster launch and unsuccessful ensuing debut , Hurley sought to salvage MixBit from its dour beginning , '' the suit said .

`` An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21 , 2013 , event featuring West and Kardashian , '' it said .

The video is titled `` PLEEESE MARRY MEEE !!! Congrats Kim and Kanye ! ''

It is still posted on the website , and the counter indicates it has been viewed 1.6 million times .

Hurley knows better , the lawsuit said . The terms of service on his own website warn users against posting any video that would violate copyrights , it said .

`` Undeterred by the contractual restrictions to which he had just agreed , Hurley opted to exploit and capitalize upon the extreme public interest he knew would attach to the event , in order to boost the fortunes or his underperforming business venture , '' the suit said .

Hurley and his company did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment on the lawsuit .
