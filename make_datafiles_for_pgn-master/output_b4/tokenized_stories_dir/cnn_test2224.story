There may be a number of good reasons to vote against Mitt Romney , but based upon what we know so far , his honesty about his tenure at Bain Capital does not seem to be one of them .

Let me acknowledge upfront what I have said several times on CNN : I have a past relationship with the top partners at Bain that is both personal and financial . I have worked with them in support of nonprofit organizations such as City Year . I have given a couple of paid speeches for Bain dinners , as I have for many other groups . I was on the board of a for-profit child care company , Bright Horizons , that was purchased by Bain Capital . It was a transaction with financial benefits for all board members and shareholders , including me .

So , yes , I have a bias . But let me also add how that bias plays out : I have come to admire and like the leaders of Bain Capital because I have learned firsthand that in a private equity industry , where there are obviously some predatory companies , Bain stands out for the respect in which it is generally held and for the generous philanthropy of some of its partners . Nothing I have seen so far has shaken that view .

With that on the table , let 's turn to the controversy and offer answers to some basic questions :

Are President Barack Obama and his team right to demand close scrutiny of Romney 's leadership at Bain ? Absolutely . Central to Romney 's candidacy is his claim that he will be better at creating jobs and growth than Obama because of his experience at Bain . Just as Republicans have relentlessly questioned Obama 's record -LRB- often to the point of sheer demagoguery -RRB- , it is absolutely fair to question Romney 's .

And given that critics have argued that Bain helped outsource jobs through its investments in the years immediately after Romney 's departure to head the Olympics , it would be a significant revelation if it turned out that in fact he had still played a meaningful role in the company .

Has Romney handled the scrutiny well ? No , he has n't . He and his team should have prepared a thorough , written record of his time at Bain and made it publicly available long before this stage of the campaign -- a record that would have explained in advance his accomplishments and failures while at Bain , the manner of his departure and the conflicts that have arisen over what he has said and filings Bain has made with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Had he been proactive in laying it all out , it is unlikely he would be facing the barrage of today .

-LRB- In another life , I made a similar argument to Bill and Hillary Clinton -- people I enormously respect -- over Whitewater and that went nowhere ; naturally enough , politicians are not inclined to put out documents that may be discomforting , even if they also help clear the air . -RRB-

Donna Brazile : Why Obama 's Bain charges are working

Should Romney disclose his tax returns and other information relating to off-shore accounts ? Yes , he should . Like many others who have been financially successful and as a result have complicated financial histories , Romney has shown a deep reluctance to disclose anything more than the bare minimum and has only released his tax return for one year . But he is asking voters to entrust him with the most powerful and important office in the world . In return , voters have a right to know who he is and how he got here . Put it out , take whatever hits are coming , and move on . If he has been as honest as all his friends believe , he will ultimately be a stronger candidate and can refocus on what matters : the country .

Has Romney basically lied about when he actually departed Bain ? Has he tried to mislead the public or investors ? Here we come to the heart of the recent controversy . I may be wrong but based on what we know so far , I would conclude that we do not have persuasive evidence to show that he has .

Romney has argued for years that after he was called in to rescue the Salt Lake City Olympics in February 1999 , he turned his full attentions there and no longer exercised active management at Bain . The story is a complicated one because Bain was a complex partnership and because the company filed various SEC papers after February 1999 still listing Romney in various key roles , including CEO and chairman . But if one takes time to look behind the SEC filings , what emerges is much more supportive of Romney 's statements .

David Frum : Mitt Romney 's painfully bad week

When the story first broke Thursday in The Boston Globe suggesting that Romney and Bain had fudged , CNN asked if I would do some reporting . I reached two of the top people whom I know in the company and , on background , they told me the same story that Bain sources told CNN 's John King : When the call came from the Olympics that February , Romney met with his partners and said he and wife , Ann , had concluded that they had to do this and as difficult as it would be for the partnership , he had to leave in a matter of several days .

That set off consternation within Bain because the company had exploded in size and Romney was not only CEO -LRB- or managing partner -RRB- but was also deeply tied into a variety of investments and partnerships . The partners had to turn quickly to reorganizing their teams and the way they ran their business . That was their priority .

Had they known that one day Romney would be running for president , they might have acted with equal haste on cleaning up the many filings and paperwork that bore Romney 's name but at the time , they did n't think that was an urgent task . So , as the company slowly unwound its records , some papers from Bain continued to list Romney even though he had left the partnership .

A sloppy mistake ? Yes . An attempt to mislead ? The evidence so far does n't show that . Also of note : At the time , it seemed that he might return from the Olympics to active management , but in any event , he did not . Secondly , I do not know of -LRB- nor is there any controversy suggesting -RRB- his involvement in other companies during that time .

As the New York Times reports Monday , there was an expectation at first that Romney might return to active management of Bain so he did not sever his ownership ties right away -- an additional reason why his name was not struck from documents for a while . The Times account goes on to say there is no evidence that during this interim he was actively engaged in managing the firm .

Both partners with whom I spoke firmly and unequivocally said that after he physically left in February 1999 , Romney no longer made decisions for Bain regarding investments , hiring , firing or any other management issues . Subsequent to that February , the firm in 2000 offered another round of financing and , according to Bain , the investors well understood that Romney was no longer actively managing the company .

Could these Bain partners now be lying ? Possibly . On a rare occasion in the past , when I was wearing a reporter 's hat , a friend has lied to me for self-protection . But based on relationships over several years , I trust his or her account . Even so , knowing my bias , you may well ask : Is there any corroborating evidence ? As it turns out , there is .

FactCheck.org , a respected website that nails candidates for inaccuracies , earlier investigated the whole issue of Romney 's departure and reached a conclusion that he was telling the truth . Last week , little noticed by Romney 's critics , FactCheck went back , reviewed the evidence again , and based on what we know so far , reaffirmed its earlier conclusion . FactCheck 's recent article was co-written by a man who was once a top investigative journalist for CNN . -LRB- The piece last week also recalled an Associated Press report on the Olympics that said in his early tenure at the Olympics , Romney was working 112-hour weeks to save the Salt Lake City games . Does this sound like a man who was also managing a private equity firm on the East Coast ? -RRB-

Last week , in another article that critics tend to ignore , Fortune reported that it had obtained confidential documents that Bain gave to prospective investors in advance of that seventh round offering in 2000 . The prospectus is the way a company such as Bain informs possible investors who will manage their money . The prospectus listed 18 managers at Bain who would have responsibility . Romney 's name was not among them .

It remains possible , of course , that new evidence will emerge that could sharply contradict both Romney and Bain . If so , that will be a whole new ball game . Both he and the company would be grievously damaged .

But judgments today can only be fairly made on the evidence at hand and the reputations of the people who are coming forward . From my perspective -- yes , with a bias -- the weight comes down on the side that as he has said all along , Romney ended his active management at Bain when he left for the Olympics . Again , there are many other reasons why one might oppose his candidacy , but this does not strike me as a fair one .

As long as fairness is the standard , it would be reassuring if some of the harshest critics of Romney and Bain would acknowledge their own biases . And for goodness sake , will the Obama campaign please withdraw its heavy suggestion that Mitt Romney could well have committed a felony ? That was an injustice to both Romney and the president .
