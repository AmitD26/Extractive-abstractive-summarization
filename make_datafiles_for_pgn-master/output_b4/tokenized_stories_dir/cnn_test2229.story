The four remaining GOP candidates played to their individual strengths on Thursday and tried to leave a lasting impression in a final , boisterous debate two days before South Carolina 's pivotal primary .

In a campaign cycle where debates have had direct consequences on the ebb and flow of the race , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich turned his contempt for the media into one of his strongest performances yet . When CNN Chief National Correspondent John King opened the debate with a question about open marriage , following an interview by Gingrich 's ex-wife saying that he had sought one , the Republican chastised him .

`` To take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question in a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine , '' Gingrich told King , the moderator of the debate .

Gingrich 's response elicited loud applause from the audience .

The debate came at the end of a ground-shaking day that saw former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum being declared winner of the Iowa caucuses more than two weeks after his apparent second-place finish to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropping out of the race and throwing his support to Gingrich .

Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the fourth candidate in the debate .

An angry Gingrich chastised CNN for starting off with the question about his marriage .

Hours before the debate , ABC News and The Washington Post released interviews with Marianne Gingrich in which she alleged Gingrich asked for an `` open marriage '' before their divorce .

Marianne Gingrich told The Washington Post that a day after her husband told her about his affair with Callista Bisek in May 1999 , the former House speaker delivered a speech titled `` The Demise of American Culture '' to a group of Republican women in Pennsylvania .

`` How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people ? '' Marianne Gingrich said in her interview with the Post .

Gingrich said the story was false .

The three other presidential candidates on the stage passed on the chance to criticize Gingrich over the allegations by his ex-wife .

Romney took the steady , cautious route that he has throughout the campaign , responding to his rivals only when attacked .

Santorum presented himself as a more conservative option to Romney than Gingrich and as the candidate who could draw an effective contrast in the fall with President Barack Obama .

As the debate was going on , Gingrich 's campaign released his tax returns as he had promised to do earlier . Romney was asked if he would follow his father 's lead in releasing 12 years of tax returns . Romney 's father , George , ran for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination .

`` Maybe , '' Romney said , before highlighting his business experience and his personal success . `` I did n't inherit money from my parents . What I have , I earned . ''

As he had earlier this week , Santorum said he filed his own returns and they were at home on his computer and he would release them once he returned home . Paul said he had no intention to release his returns , arguing that congressional financial statements are revealing enough .

The issue of electability was hotly debated . Earlier this week , Gingrich called for both Perry and Santorum to drop out of the race and support his candidacy because they did n't have the experience for a large undertaking like a presidential campaign . With Perry gone , Santorum was left to respond .

`` Grandiosity has never been a problem with Newt Gingrich , '' Santorum said , arguing that he 's the steady choice and Republicans should n't pick a nominee who might surprise them .

While Gingrich and Santorum debated their records in Washington and specifically who was more responsible for the Republican Revolution of the 1990s , Romney raised his hand to argue it 's time for a Washington outsider .

`` We need to send to Washington someone who has not lived in Washington , but someone who 's lived in the real streets of America , '' Romney said .

Every candidate onstage said they opposed the anti-Internet piracy bill roiling Congress , and criticized the proposal for being too intrusive . However , both Romney and Santorum said they could support a more narrow law that would help protect intellectual property rights online .

Displaying the off-the-cuff wit he has used to great effect at a series of GOP debates , Gingrich joked he was none too sympathetic to movie and music producers who pushed for the legislation .

`` You 're asking a conservative about the economic interest of Hollywood , '' Gingrich said to laughter in the audience . `` And I 'm weighing it , I 'm weighing it . I 'm not rushing in . ''

Meanwhile Paul touted his libertarian-leaning views , adding he had been an early detractor of the bill . He said as president he would be unique in his ability to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to protect civil liberties .

The former obstetrician and gynecologist forced his way into the conversation on both health care and abortion , two issues he knows a lot about .

`` I thought maybe you were prejudiced against doctors and a doctor that practiced medicine in the military or something , '' Paul told King after a section where the other three candidates answered a question on whether a full repeal of President Obama 's health care reform was truly possible .

After a lengthy debate among the other three candidates over the legitimacy of criticizing Romney 's political conversion from pro-abortion rights to anti-abortion rights , the crowd booed and chanted Paul 's name when King moved on without letting Paul weigh in .

`` John , once again , it 's a medical subject and I 'm a doctor , '' Paul said .

Four polls over the last two days show Romney 's long-held lead in South Carolina nearly evaporating into single digits by the time the four took the stage , while Gingrich has surged into a virtual tie . Gingrich on Thursday grabbed a major endorsement when Perry announced he was backing Gingrich as he suspended his campaign .

Santorum 's campaign got a boost on Thursday when the Iowa GOP released the final certified results from its January 3 caucuses , which reversed Romney 's eight-vote victory and instead determined that Santorum had won by 34 votes .
