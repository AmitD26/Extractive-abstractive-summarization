The Turkish government banned YouTube on Thursday , less than a week after Ankara made a similar blackout of the social networking site Twitter , which is estimated to have more than 10 million Turkish users .

Neither website can be reached on Turkish Internet networks .

The crackdown comes just days before Turks are expected to go to the polls in nationwide municipal elections .

The Turkish government said its YouTube block came as a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring Syria .

Turkey 's top media regulating agency announced a similar ban on the broadcast of the conversation to television and radio channels .

`` It is seen as appropriate that a temporary broadcast ban be implemented on the voice recordings on social media and alleged to be between the foreign minister , the head of the National Intelligence Agency and military officials , '' the Radio and Television Supreme Council -- Turkey 's chief media regulating agency -- announced on its website .

Turkey 's political elite has been battered by a campaign of wiretap leaks recorded by unknown operatives and distributed daily for more than a month on the Internet .

Until Wednesday , all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , his inner circle , government officials and some top corporate executives .

Erdogan has called some recordings `` immorally edited material , '' including a conversation in which a man who sounds like the Prime Minister purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from police investigators .

But he has also confirmed the authenticity of other wiretaps , in which he is heard instructing the head of a major television news network to cut short the live broadcast of a rival politician 's speech in Parliament .

Turkey 's government has accused social media platforms , including Twitter and Facebook , of being used to spread false information and lies since the leaked , high-level conversations from inside the current government have spread online .

`` We 're seeing reports that some users are not able to access YouTube in Turkey . There is no technical issue on our side and we 're looking into the situation , '' a Google spokesperson said in a statement . YouTube is owned by Google .

Unlike previously leaked recordings -- which all sounded like telephone conversations -- the recording released on Wednesday sounds like audio coming from a microphone planted in a room where a meeting is being held .

Male Turkish voices can be heard discussing whether to send troops into neighboring Syria , where Turkey has supported rebels against the government in Damascus during a conflict that has lasted more than three years .

`` Monitoring such a meeting of a highly confidential nature which was held at a location such as the office of the Foreign Minister , where the most sensitive security issues of the State are discussed and releasing these conversations to the public are a despicable attack , an act of espionage and a very serious crime against the national security of Turkey , '' announced Turkey 's Foreign Ministry in a statement on Thursday .

The recording suggests a major security breach within the halls of the country 's Foreign Ministry .

The bans on Twitter and YouTube may be followed by a broader crackdown on the Internet .

An official at Turkey 's prime ministry , speaking on the condition of anonymity , told CNN , `` If there are recordings similarly threatening to national security , there can be similar precautions taken on other social media . ''

This week a Turkish court overruled the government 's ban of Twitter , but the website is still blocked . According to legal procedures , Turkish authorities have 30 days to implement the court injunction .
