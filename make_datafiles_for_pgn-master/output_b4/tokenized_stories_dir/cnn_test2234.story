-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In December , Facebook routinely lets users revisit the year by highlighting some their most popular posts and photos in an online scrapbook assembled in part from `` likes '' and comments .

In the case of Eric Meyer , Facebook 's algorithm brought back painful memories -- and prompted the company to apologize .

Meyer , a Web consultant , lost his 6-year-old daughter , Rebecca , in June . When Facebook showed him his suggested year in review , his late daughter 's photo was at the center .

`` Yes , my year looked like that . True enough . My year looked like the now-absent face of my little girl , '' Meyer wrote in a Christmas Eve post on his blog . `` It was still unkind to remind me so forcefully . ''

Meyer did n't blame the algorithms ; they 're `` essentially thoughtless , '' he observed . But , he suggested , Facebook 's human side could have tempered their flaws .

`` Where the human aspect fell short , at least with Facebook , was in not providing a way to opt out . The Year in Review ad keeps coming up in my feed , rotating through different fun-and-fabulous backgrounds , as if celebrating a death , and there is no obvious way to stop it , '' he wrote . `` The design is for the ideal user , the happy , upbeat , good-life user . It does n't take other use cases into account . ''

Meyer was n't the only one who was upset by the Year in Review 's briskly automatic construction . Other users chimed in on Twitter with their displeasure .

`` Wo n't be sharing my Facebook Year in Review , which ` highlights ' a post on a friend 's death in May despite words like ` killed ' and ` sad day , ' '' wrote Time magazine 's Andrew Katz .

'' -LRB- M -RRB- y preview came up with my little boy & ` it 's been a great year , thanks for being a part of it ' He died at 15mos in Nov , '' wrote peitaballerina in response .

Facebook , which has created an `` Empathy Team '' to help its employees think of users as , well , people , apologized to Meyer .

'' -LRB- The app -RRB- was awesome for a lot of people , but clearly in this case we brought him grief rather than joy , '' Year in Review product manager Jonathan Gheller told the Washington Post . `` We can do better -- I 'm very grateful he took the time in his grief to write the blog post . ''

After his first post gained attention -- and invited a lot of unpleasant commentary -- Meyer , in turn , apologized to the company in a compassionate follow-up .

`` I owe the Year in Review team in specific , and Facebook in general , an apology . No , not the other way around , '' he wrote . `` I am very sorry that I dropped the Internet on -LRB- Gheller 's -RRB- head for Christmas . He and his team did n't deserve it . ''

The solution , he adds , is n't to harp on the coders or designers , who often do n't fit the stereotypes commenters ascribed to them . It 's to `` anticipate how a design decision that really worked in one way completely failed in another , and work to handle both cases , '' he wrote .

`` This is such a common failure that it 's almost not a failure any more . It just ... is , '' he added . `` We need to challenge that ` is . ' I 've fallen victim to it myself . We all have . We all will . It will take time , practice , and a whole lot of stumbling to figure out how to do better , but it is , I submit , vitally important that we do . ''
