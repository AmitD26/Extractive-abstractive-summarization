-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As a long-time aviation journalist and regular traveler , I 've been following the debate on whether the use of cell phones and other wireless devices should be allowed on airplanes .

And now that the Federal Communications Commission has said it will weigh in on the matter , let me add my voice to the growing chorus of those who are firmly opposed to the idea .

Letting passengers talk nonstop during flights would be like being stuck in hell .

Let me explain . I 'm a working mother who is a student pilot and active in several professional and church activities . The airplane is one of the few places on -LRB- or over the -RRB- earth where I can sit quietly and not worry about answering or making phone calls .

Yes , I have used airline WiFi to sneak in some work or surf the Internet , but mostly I put on my noise-canceling headphones and relax as much as one can on a commercial coach flight .

But all that peace would be ruined if cell phones were allowed to be used on planes . Could you imagine the cacophony of chatter you would hear on a Baltimore-to-Chicago flight ? I can , because I 've heard it already .

I used to take the Amtrak Acela train between Baltimore and New York City pretty regularly . On those rare occasions when I could n't get a seat in the Quiet Car , it was sheer hell , even with headphones . I heard privileged conversations that would get lawyers fired . I listened to talk that was n't fit for children under 17 . I was forced to eavesdrop on people discussing personal , private matters -- all done in normal tones . And people did n't hesitate in trying to have their loud conversations even in the Quiet Car .

So sit back , close your eyes , and imagine hearing all those conversations trapped in a high-speed metal tube flying between Washington and San Francisco , or New York to Paris . How many hours is that ? Do you really want to hear the chatter of people sitting right next to you or 15 feet away ? Even if the talks are muffled through your noise-canceling headphones , that does n't make it any better . What if you just want to sleep through the flight ? Or take a respite from the always-on connected life you have on the ground ?

Travelers already get a sense of what this sounds like when a plane lands . You hear the chirps and beeps of phones turning on and snippets of conversation starting before the aircraft wheels have even touched the ground .

`` YES , MOM , WE JUST LANDED . '' `` I 'LL MEET YOU AT BAGGAGE CLAIM 12 . NO CLAIM 12 ! I 'M HERE ! WHERE 'S THE PARTY ? ''

If I still have n't convinced you , then consider the flight crews who will be forced to referee any cell phone disputes . Despite what travelers may think , flight attendants are not there to help you with your bags or serve you drinks . They are actually there to ensure your safety on your flight . Safety could be compromised if flight attendants are too busy refereeing -- or not -- people who are fighting about loud conversations all around them .

Passengers are already on edge these days as civility in travel seems to have diminished greatly . Allowing the use of cell phones on flights will push us all closer to the cliff of our sanity .

So here 's hoping the airlines and related aviation groups fire up their public relations machines to squash this idea and instead , urge the FCC to continue the inflight cell phone ban .

And travelers -- enjoy the down time . Listen to a podcast . Enjoy some music . Watch an in-flight movie . Play a game . The calls will be waiting for you when you land .
