-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A major snowstorm slammed the East Coast and snarled the busy holiday travel season Saturday as airports shut down runways , rail service slowed and bus routes were suspended on the last weekend before Christmas .

Record snowfall totals were reported Saturday afternoon at Washington Dulles and Reagan National airports -- and snow was still falling . Accumulation at Dulles reached 16 inches , breaking the old record of 10.6 inches set December , 12 , 1964 ; 13.3 inches was reported at Reagan . The old record there was 11.5 inches set December 17 , 1932 .

Three deaths in Virginia were blamed on the storm , state officials said . One person was killed late Friday in a single-car crash . Two other deaths were reported Saturday as more heavy snow was expected .

Virginia Gov. Timothy Kaine authorized up to 1,000 National Guardsmen to assist in responding to the storm , which dumped more than 20 inches of snow in parts of the state by Saturday evening . Virginia State Police had responded to nearly 3,000 accidents or disabled vehicles since Friday night , the governor 's office said .

The storm stretched from Tennessee and North Carolina to the southern New England states , blanketing the mid-Atlantic region and the heavily populated I-95 corridor . The forecast called for 12 to 22 inches of snow in some areas . See current flight delay information on the FAA Web site

CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the storm -- known as a nor'easter -- could rival the Knickerbocker blizzard of 1922 , which dropped between 28 and 33 inches of snow in the D.C. area .

`` I do n't know that it will be a record-breaker , but this is significant , '' she said . `` This is a really bad storm right now . ''

The foul weather prompted an emergency declaration in the nation 's capital , stranded hundreds of motorists , shut down airports , caused power outages , and threatened to keep hordes of Christmas shoppers indoors .

The weather delayed start times for two National Football League games Sunday . The Chicago Bears-Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers-Philadelphia Eagles games will be played at 4:15 p.m. instead of 1 p.m.

Chicago Bears players and staff were scheduled to arrive in Baltimore via a charter late Saturday night , after a single runway was opened at BWI-Thurgood Marshall Airport . That runway is expected to remain open for all flights , a spokesman for the Maryland Aviation Airport Authority said .

A winter storm warning was in effect for the Washington area until 6 a.m. Sunday . Blizzard warnings were issued for New York 's Long Island and parts of southern New England with forecasters predicting whiteout conditions due to high winds .

`` I strongly urge everyone to stay at home and off the roads , '' said Michael Cline , state coordinator for the Virginia Department of Emergency Management . `` There are hundreds of vehicles abandoned or stuck on roads . There is already one to two feet of snow on the roads , and snow is still falling . ''

Similar warnings were issued by state officials up and down the East Coast .

Parts of U.S. 29 , I-77 and I-81 were closed and hundreds of bus passengers were stranded at a terminal in Washington as nearly 300 routes were canceled from New England to Jacksonville , Florida , Greyhound Bus Lines spokeswoman Maureen Richmond said . Travelers stuck at Greyhound terminals are being made comfortable with assistance from the Red Cross and Salvation Army , Richmond said .

The storm also affected rail service . Passengers aboard an Amtrak train that originated in New Orleans on Friday morning sat outside Alexandria , Virginia , for more than five hours Saturday afternoon .

The train had full power , and passengers were being given food and drinks throughout the ordeal , Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said .

She expected the train to pull into Washington Saturday night . Trains were running 30 to 60 minutes behind schedule early Saturday , and 60 to 90 minutes later in the day .

Meanwhile , more than 400 people hunkered down in 20 shelters across Virginia . A Virginia National Guard spokesman said it is working with other agencies to transport stranded motorists to shelters , and is getting food and water to people stuck in their vehicles .

As snow continued to fall in the mid-Atlantic states , folks in western North Carolina were digging out Saturday from the powerful storm . More than 50,000 were without power in Asheville 's Buncombe County after more than a foot of snow fell in the mountains . Crews were traveling from Kentucky and South Carolina to help restore power , a spokeswoman for Progress Energy told CNN affiliate WLOS .

In Washington , Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is `` perhaps the biggest we 've seen in several years . ''

`` We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the district open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend , '' Fenty said when he announced the snow emergency .

But , he also urged residents to stay in their homes .

`` This snow should end early tomorrow morning with a 24-hour cleanup . We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday . And , hopefully , all of it done between Monday and Wednesday . ''

Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and a city snow plow collided , a D.C. fire official said . The injuries are not considered serious .

The storm also halted above-ground Metrorail operations in the district because of heavy snowfall covering the electrified third rail , the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority said .

Trains were shifted to underground travel , and the underground Metrorail stations will remain open until 3 a.m. , the normal closing time for a Saturday night .

In West Virginia , Gov. Joe Manchin on Saturday declared a state of emergency and `` authorized the use of the National Guard to assist with snow removal and emergency assistance and operations . ''

West Virginia is working to help stranded motorists , clear roadways , and restore power outages , Manchin said in a statement .

In Massachusetts , Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a snow emergency beginning at 10 p.m. Forecasters are predicting up to 15 inches of snow with 30 mph winds between Saturday night and late Sunday morning .

Crews were standing by with snow removal equipment and salt , and the city 's emergency homeless shelters will be open `` throughout the day and evening . ''

While the storm caused chaos for weekend travelers and shoppers , UPS spokesman Norman Black on Friday said shipped packages should n't be delayed .

`` The good thing for us and our competitors is that this is happening on a weekend , '' Black said .

He said that packages set for Monday delivery were on planes that landed and offloaded Friday night .

UPS never has packages in motion on a Sunday , even the Sunday before Christmas . And because Saturday volume is usually light -- because delivering on Saturday is a premium service -- Black expected few problems .

That is , unless the roads are still a mess and airports are n't cleaned by Monday .
