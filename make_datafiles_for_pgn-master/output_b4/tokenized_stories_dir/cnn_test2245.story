Iranian riot police swarmed a major bazaar Wednesday in Tehran as demonstrators launched protests against firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , blaming him for plummeting currency that 's leaving families across the country struggling .

A day after Ahmadinejad acknowledged that his country is taking a hit , and placed the blame largely on `` the enemy 's '' sanctions , crowds of protesters also took to the streets in another commercial area in the capital , shopkeepers said .

They chanted slogans slamming Ahmadinejad 's regime and complained about the high prices of goods and food . Riot police dispersed the crowd , a shopkeeper said .

The semi-official Mehr news agency reported two European tourists and some `` agitators '' were arrested by security forces . The Europeans violated Iranian law by gathering information about the protests , it said .

The country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , echoed Ahmadinejad 's position Wednesday , saying that growing pressures are mainly aimed at making his country surrender , `` but the Iranian nation has and will never surrender to pressures and this has made the enemy furious , '' the semi-official FARS news agency reported .

The United States and European Union have imposed numerous sanctions aimed at pressuring Tehran into sitting down for international negotiations on its nuclear program .

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the growing protests show that `` clearly the Iranian people are demanding better from their government and speaking out against the gross mismanagement of the economy and the situation in the country . ''

The United States is `` watching the situation very closely , '' she said .

The `` sanctions that the international community has put on the government as a result of its lack of forthcomingness on its nuclear program are being felt on the ground , '' she said .

Ahmadinejad , in a speech Tuesday , insisted the sanctions hurt the people , not the government . He said the country 's economy `` has become a tool for psychological warfare . ''

The rial 's value was cut in half from September of last year through last month , the Congressional Research Service said in a report . It has fallen even further since , including a sharp nosedive this week , reaching historic lows against the value of the dollar .

At the main bazaar in central Tehran , some protesters used boxes and tires to start fires , according to a merchant who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons .

But Mehr quoted the head of the bazaar 's merchant 's association as saying that officials had observed `` suspicious '' activity and identified people around the market who were from `` outside the bazaar community . ''

The bazaar was closed for safety reasons , Mehr reported .

Dozens of police on motorcycles responded to the scene , and dozens more were on foot .

As the police were surrounding the bazaar , the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency carried a quote from police official Col. Khalil Helali saying that based on his information , `` a limited number of people headed towards the bazaar and had chanted slogans . ''

Helali later told Mehr that he had no indication the bazaar was closed . Helali is chief of Tehran 's Business Locations Police , which oversees workplaces .

Police also gathered in two major squares -- Ferdosi and Vali Asr -- although no demonstrations were immediately reported in those spots .

In a speech Wednesday , Ahmadinejad also said part of the problem plaguing the country 's currency is `` internal . ''

He blamed `` 22 ringleaders '' who the country 's intelligence services have determined are causing tensions and manipulating currency .

The president gave no details . But people who trade currency illegally have been increasingly concerned about a crackdown by Iranian forces .

Months ago , an Iranian man told CNN that with the country 's economic downfall , the only way for his sons to live a decent life was to fall in with influential people or make shady business deals -- such as trading foreign currency on the black market .

But Ahmadinejad focused the majority of his remarks on the United States and the West .

`` There is a hidden war , a very pervasive and heavy warfare that is happening across the world directed towards Iran , '' he said .

The `` enemy '' has `` succeeded in reducing the sale of our oil to an extent , but God willing , we will fill it up , '' he insisted .

The price of a popular bread called barbari has gone from about 1,000 rials each to about 5,000 rials amid the increasing sanctions . A local baker told CNN the cost will likely skyrocket further . The wheat used to make the bread is imported .

Feta cheese cost 50,000 rials per kilogram in March . The price has since tripled . Meat that cost up to 190,000 rials per kilogram then has doubled in price .

Several Iranians told CNN Wednesday about the financial struggles they 're facing . They spoke anonymously for security reasons .

`` The prices are amazing , '' said an Iranian entrepreneur , adding , `` It 's crazy , it 's so high . ''

`` People ca n't make sense out of this , '' she added . `` And they do n't know what 's going to happen next . ''

A taxi driver told CNN , `` I 've been under so much stress lately that I 'm getting migraine headaches . I 'm worried about my future , my daughter 's future . ''

An auto parts maker insisted that `` nobody is buying less or eating less so far , '' and that shops do n't seem to have shortages .

But a businessman said , `` If you go into a shop , you can probably not buy anything . They 're not going to sell you anything . If -LRB- the shop owner -RRB- is prepared to sell it to you he will charge you a lot more than it was two days ago . And when you ask him why , he 'll tell you , ` I have no idea what I 'll have to pay to bring this back . ' ''

`` Nobody knows whether this is for real , whether this is going to stay here , '' he added . `` And this uncertainty is causing a lot of panic . ''

Mark Dubowitz , an analyst with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , says the sanctions `` are designed to put sufficient pressure on the average Iranian , '' which could help trigger an uprising against the government -- or at least cause leaders to fear one .

`` Sanctions are a form of economic warfare , '' he said .

Though some sanctions against Iran have existed for decades , `` We 've seen only 10 months of what I would call significant and severe economic pressure , '' Dubowitz said .

But there 's no evidence the sanctions have compelled the Iranian government to change its nuclear stance , analysts say .

Ahmadinejad , in his speech Wednesday , denied suggestions that the measures could work .

`` They lie when they say sanctions are pressure on the government , '' he insisted , adding that sanctions `` are always a pressure on nations '' -- meaning average citizens .

`` It 's a rock that the enemy has thrown . So what we should do ? We should pick up the rock and throw it at them . ''

Anthony H. Cordesman , national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said sanctions must be `` large scale and consistent '' over time to be effective .

It 's not possible to predict whether sanctions will change the regime , Cordesman said . `` This is a duel and you find out just how effective you are over time . ''

Trita Parsi , founder and president of the National Iranian American Council , said so far there is no sign of a shift in the government 's nuclear program .

`` If Iran were a democracy , you would have had a situation in which there would have been far greater protests , '' he said . `` Any democratic government would have fallen by now . ''

Parsi said he was skeptical that large-scale protests are in the cards .

Iranians `` are not going to go out there and risk their lives for a change if they do n't know what the next thing is , '' he said .

Iran saw a widespread popular uprising in 2009 after Ahmadinejad 's contested re-election , triggering a brutal , deadly crackdown by government forces -- and Ahmadinejad held onto power .
