-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An Iranian court has sentenced the so-called `` blogfather '' of Iran to 19 1/2 years in prison , the semi-official Mashregh news website said Tuesday .

Hossein Derakhshan was `` convicted of cooperating with enemy states , making propaganda against the Islamic system of government , promoting small anti-revolutionary groups , managing obscene web sites and insulting Islamic sanctities , '' Mashregh reported .

The 35-year-old Canadian-Iranian blogger and activist was also banned from journalistic endeavors and from joining any political parties for five years .

Derakhshan was arrested on November 1 , 2008 , and is being held at the Evin Prison in Tehran , reported the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .

Hamed Derakhshan , Hossein Derakhshan 's brother , was shocked when he discovered the news of Hossein Derakhshan 's sentence from an online news report .

`` It targets exactly freedom of speech and expression . Maybe they are trying to make an example of him by giving him a heavy sentence , '' Hamed Derakhshan told CNN .

The Derakhshan family will appeal Hossein Derakhshan 's sentence .

Hadi Ghaemi , executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran , condemned the sentence .

`` This is the longest sentence issued against a blogger in Iran , and it is solely because of his opinions and blogging . The sentence is meant to send a chilling message to the Iranian youth to stay away from the internet in practicing their freedom of expression , '' Ghaemi said .

Derakhshan 's blog , titled Editor Myself on i.hoder.com , gained worldwide notoriety . He got particular attention for helping other Iranians start their own blogs with step-by-step start-up guides published in Persian .

Derakhshan also blogged on many political issues including freedom of expression , the Islamic Republic of Iran and Israeli relations in the Middle East .

In 2006 Derakhshan shocked his followers when he visited Israel on his Canadian passport .

`` He was reporting his trip minute by minute on his blog ... in both English and Persian . It was the first time that an Iranian was reporting the real life in Israel , '' Hamed Derakhshan said .

Shortly before his imprisonment Hossein Derakhshan began writing in support of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .

`` He felt Ahmadinejad was doing good for Iran . At that point many Iranian bloggers did n't like his ideas . He believed in the system . He did not believe it was perfect , but he thought he could work with the system and make it better , '' Hamed Derakhshan said .

CNN attempts to contact Iranian authorities for comment were unsuccessful .
