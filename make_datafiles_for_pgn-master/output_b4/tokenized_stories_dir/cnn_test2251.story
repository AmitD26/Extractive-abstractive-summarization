-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` I wo n't even sleep in the same room with them . ''

A fellow named Daniel Sieberg was telling me his hard-and-fast rule for getting through the night .

He takes all of his digital devices -- laptops , tablets , cellphones , anything portable that has a screen -- to another room before he turns off the light . He has come to terms with the fact that the technological gadgets that have so thoroughly insinuated themselves into our lives can become addictive .

So , when it 's time for slumber , he locks them out . He wo n't even let his cellphone charge overnight in the bedroom :

`` If it 's there , I would have the temptation to turn it on and check it . ''

We have learned to celebrate , even revere , the wireless gadgets we carry around and the inventors who bring them to us ; the response to the death of Steve Jobs this month was emblematic of how important our do-it-all phones , our computers , our tablets and related digital devices have become . We say that the technology has changed life as we used to know it .

But how much is too much ?

And , more to the point : How many of us have the nagging feeling that we are somehow unable to disconnect -- that the electronic devices we own have begun to own us ?

There is an instinct to treat the subject whimsically : `` Land o'Goshen , Ma , those kids are walking down the street staring at their cellphone screens . '' It 's as if any criticism of what the digital age has done to society brands the person raising the questions as backward , afraid of change , irrationally wedded to outmoded ways .

So the addiction question is often one that people silently ask themselves . Should n't we be spending less time checking and rechecking our many screens , large and small , and more time taking part in what used to be regarded as real life ? Is there something inherently wrong when people being separated from their phones , computers and tablets makes them feel nervous , irritable , tense -- in other words , when they begin to exhibit classic withdrawal symptoms ?

For guidance on this , I got in touch with Sieberg , who has given as much thought to the subject as anyone of whom I 'm aware . A former CNN correspondent , he is a lecturer , writer and broadcaster on technology issues who , in his own life , became increasingly conscious of the unhealthy hold that digital devices can have . He wrote a book called `` The Digital Diet '' that argues persuasively that there can come a time in a person 's life when he or she is a good candidate for technology detox .

I asked him if `` addiction '' is too strong a word to use in relation to devices that seem to hook their users emotionally , but not chemically .

`` Unfortunately , the word ` addiction ' has become overused , '' he said , and should not be trivialized . Addictions to illegal drugs , alcohol and prescription medication are grimly somber matters . But , he said , the idea of an addiction to digital devices is genuine and is not something that should be greeted with a sardonic wink .

`` One definition of ` addiction ' is when other people and other activities in your life begin to suffer because of something you know you should cut back on , but do n't , '' he said .

Some of his examples are things that many people will instantly recognize :

-- The urge to pull out a cellphone even when someone you 're with is in the midst of a conversation with you .

-- Texting even while your child is telling you about his or her day at school , and realizing later that you ca n't remember the details of what your son or daughter has said to you .

-- Having the vague feeling that something has n't really happened until you post it to Facebook or Twitter .

-- Feeling isolated and anxious if you are offline for an extended period of time .

-- Noticing that even when your family is all together in one room at home , each person is gazing at his or her own screen and tapping at a miniature keyboard .

`` There are people who , even when they are n't using their digital devices , find themselves creating status updates or Twitter feeds in their heads while they are experiencing things , '' he said . `` It 's as if they have lost the ability to live in the moment , and have become conditioned to feeling that they have to instantly share it electronically while it is still going on . ''

Sieberg is hardly a guy stuck in some dust-covered , pre-technology past : He has always been among the first to own each new portable device , and he likes the many good things the digital experience can provide . But he realized -- when his wife would wake up in the middle of the night to see him , in bed , illuminated by the glow of one screen or another that he had decided to check one more time before he fell back asleep -- that something might need remedying .

There is , he said , a feeling common among people who are digitally hooked that , when it 's just them and the real world and no screen , they are somehow cast adrift , cut off : `` It 's a sense of , ` What am I missing ? ' '' But in truth , a strong case can be made that when a person lives too many hours a day in the digital universe , that is when he or she is really missing something -- missing the things that are taking place in the flesh-and-blood world .

Sieberg has a phrase for it : You know you 're in trouble when `` your footing in technology feels increasingly like quicksand . ''

And he has a piece of advice for all of us , regardless of how deep we feel we 're sinking into that digital quicksand :

Like him , we should consider locking all of those devices in another room at night . He promises that it makes a difference :

`` You sleep better . ''
