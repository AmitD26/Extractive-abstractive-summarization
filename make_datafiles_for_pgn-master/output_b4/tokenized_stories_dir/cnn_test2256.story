More American women have had medical help to have their babies than ever , according to the latest annual report from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology .

The group represents the greater majority of in vitro fertilization clinics in the United States .

Their report showed that doctors at these clinics performed 165,172 procedures , including IVF , with 61,740 babies born as a result of those efforts in 2012 .

That 's about 2,000 more babies born using treatments from IVF clinics than in 2011 . That also makes 2012 the year with the highest percentage of babies born through IVF than ever reported previously , according to the society .

That upward trend is the opposite of American birth rates overall . Since 2007 , the American birth rate has been declining steadily . In 2012 , more than 3.95 million babies were born , the Centers for Disease Control reports -LRB- PDF -RRB- . That 's below what demographers call the `` replacement level , '' the level at which the generation can replace itself . Of those births , IVF treatments account for about 1.5 % of all babies born in the United States that year .

This growing trend does n't necessarily mean Americans are having more trouble having children . It may point to the fact that couples are having babies later . American women are having babies a lot later in life than they used to : In 1980 , the average age of a new mom was about 22 . Now , the average age of a new mom is closer to 26 , according to the CDC -LRB- PDF -RRB- .

Although women today are generally healthier , fertility does decline as people age . A woman 's body produces fewer viable eggs when she gets older , and men 's sperm does n't swim as well as they age .

Women ca n't wait too long to seek out treatment , though . That is also clear from the annual report .

The IVF success rate was significantly higher for women under the age of 35 compared with those who were older .

Looking only at the IVF treatments that used fresh embryos from non-donor eggs , the number of women under the age of 35 who gave birth using IVF was about 40 % , compared with only 31 % for women between the ages of 35 and 37 . Only 3.9 % of 42-year-olds got pregnant as a result of IVF treatment .

IVF treatment has become more medically successful over the years and is gaining acceptance .

It is still , however , cost-prohibitive for a lot of couples . Most assisted reproductive technologies are not covered by insurance , or the reimbursements are capped , according the National Infertility Association .

The average cost of one IVF treatment in the United States is $ 12,400 , and that 's without the extra medicines the couple may need , according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine . Often , couples will need more than one treatment to conceive .

The number of multiple embryos being transferred in IVF treatments has also declined , according to the report .

Doctors prefer that women give birth to a single baby or `` singleton , '' as they are called in medical lingo . That 's because even with medical advances , multiple births are still considered risky for mothers and babies .
