It 's been called a `` cure for rejection-letter fatigue . ''

Amazon on Thursday released new details about the success of its program for authors who want to self-publish on its Kindle e-reader devices . The company , which unveiled a suite of new e-readers and tablets at a press conference in Southern California on Thursday , says 27 of the top 100 Kindle books were created using a system called Kindle Direct Publishing .

That system allows authors to bypass traditional publishers and instead deal directly with Amazon , which claims to be able to publish their books digitally `` in hours . ''

The authors receive 70 % of the royalties from the sale of these books . And some of them are doing quite well .

`` Most of my months are six-figure months , '' said Hugh Howey , a 37-year-old Florida author whose `` Wool '' series of digital books was highlighted by Amazon . `` It 's more than I ever hoped to make in a year . ''

The company says some authors , including Theresa Ragen , who appeared in a promotional video during the Amazon event , have sold hundreds of thousands of books .

During the event Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos displayed a quote from Kathryn Stockett , author of best-selling novel `` The Help , '' in which she lamented being rejected dozens of times before a publisher accepted her .

`` What if I had given up at 15 ? Or 40 ? Or even 60 ? '' she was quoted as saying .

`` The thing that occurs to me , '' Bezons said , according to a live blog , `` is how many authors did stop after 40 rejections ? How many great manuscripts are sitting in a drawer somewhere ? ''

The fact that so many self-published books have been successful in Amazon 's ecosystem highlights what other writers say is a trend toward success in digital self-publishing , which is offered also by companies like Apple and Barnes & Noble , in addition to Amazon .

This comes despite evidence that many self-published e-book authors make very little money . A 1,007-person survey earlier this year found `` DIY authors '' make $ 10,000 a year on average , and half of them make less than $ 500 a year , according to a report in The Guardian .

Still , the system does work for some .

`` Fact is that authors no longer need a publisher , '' Bernard Starr wrote at The Huffington Post . `` And more and more writers are awakening to the realization that if you are not a high-profile author who can command large sales , a traditional publisher will do little for you beyond editing and printing your book . ''

For Howey , author of the `` Wool '' series , the direct-publishing platform has opened up a life he never imagined was possible -- one where he is paid to write full-time .

Without the Amazon platform , the books might not have been published at all . Howey never promoted the first edition of `` Wool , '' a dystopian series about a group of underground people who get all of their information about the outside world through a single , digital screen . He did n't think it would sell .

Then in October 2011 , he said , his sales jumped from from dozens to thousands .

`` I was taking screenshots and posting them on Facebook , '' he said of the moment when the books started appearing on Amazon 's top-100 lists . -LRB- The compilation `` Wool Omnibus Edition '' is currently ranked No. 193 in the Kindle store , although it was listed in Amazon 's press conference as being in the top 100 , where it has appeared before -RRB- . `` I was kind of bewildered by the whole thing . ''

Howey used to work as a bookseller and yacht captain . Now his story has been optioned by the director Ridley Scott , according to news reports . New York publishers have approached him about book deals , he said , but he wants to continue to self-publish so he maintains rights to his work .

`` The stigma is gone , '' he said of self-publishing in digital formats . `` Publishers will pick up a self-published work if it does well . Readers are really just interested in good stories . ''
