Daniel Bradshaw , a young barber at Platinum Kutz in central Des Moines , hovers over a customer 's half-trimmed head , clippers in hand , talking about the good old days of 2008 .

`` Yeah , I was all for Obama . He was the man ! '' proclaimed Bradshaw , 32 , whose friends call him `` Mr. Puerto Rico '' and whose colleagues sometimes refer to him as `` Mr. Steal-Your-Client . '' As he brushed the hair clippings off his apron , he goes on : `` I even got to meet him , once . He was all that . ''

Or so he thought .

Bradshaw , like many of his fellow Democrats , feels let down . The promise , the hope , the dream of the first black president has stalled in the reality of a stubborn economy , two wars and a Congress engaged in full-contact politics .

So this time around , come Election Day 2012 , a frustrated Bradshaw says he might not vote at all . He 's done with all of it .

`` After all this , I just do n't trust the government anymore . They 're just playin ' with people . What have they really done ? Nothing , as far as I can see . I 'm not going to vote at all this year . My wife , either , I 've convinced her not to vote , '' lamented Bradshaw as he edged the hairline of his customer .

`` I 'm just disappointed . It 's not even Obama . It 's all of them . I 've come to realize they 're all the same . It does n't matter if you 're a Republican , it does n't matter if you 're Democrat , tea party , independent , whatever , it does n't mater . They are all the same . ''

The feeling , though certainly not universal , is more and more echoed by frustrated and disengaged Democrats at gas stations and gyms , diners and coffee houses throughout Iowa .

Disappointment and loyalty

While President Barack Obama 's approval rating has rebounded recently , jumping back up 5 percentage points to 49 % in the latest CNN/ORC International poll , the approval ratings for Congress are at all-time lows . In the same poll , only 16 % say they approve of the job Congress is doing , with 83 % giving lawmakers from both parties the thumbs down .

Across Iowa , the state where then-U.S. Sen. Obama surprised the nation and swept the 2008 Democratic caucuses , igniting early momentum and propelling him to win his party 's nomination over U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton , other Democrats are standing tall with the president , ready to fight to give him another term .

`` He does n't care about all that mess . They just have n't let him do his job . I have never seen so many politicians fighting so hard to take one man down . But he 's fighting for all of us , '' said Robert `` Big Rob '' Presswood , co-owner of the barber shop that caters to judges , local politicians , police officers and downtown professionals . `` I think if they give him another shot , then he 'll have enough time to change some things around . ''

`` He 's our first black president . He did the unthinkable . And he 's been amazing . Have you really looked at all that he has gotten done , despite those fools ? And , on top of that , he 's got swag ! ''

Meanwhile , the Obama campaign is upbeat , quietly marshaling hundreds of volunteers from Dubuque to Cedar Rapids , Davenport to Waterloo , to stoke the fires for the incumbent president at a time when all the attention is on the Republican contest .

According to two senior Obama campaign aides , the president 's 2012 re-election efforts began in Iowa as early as April . Since then , they say they 've : • Hired 20 paid staffers . • Opened eight field offices . • Held more than 1,280 training and planning sessions , house parties and phone banks . • Made more than 350,000 calls to supporters . • Held more than 4,400 one-on-one meetings .

Covering all 99 counties of Iowa

They are tasking volunteers to avoid relying solely on blanket phone calls right now , and instead create sit-down face-to-face meetings with people to build relationships and gather information : what is happening in their community , what people are hearing , who they are , what they care about , how they can be leaders for the campaign in their community . They argue that no presidential field campaign has ever done this on a big scale .

`` We 're in 1,774 precincts , in all 99 Iowa counties , '' said Sue Dvorsky , chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party .

She added that even though Obama will be unopposed this year , her party still plans on caucusing Tuesday night . And the president , she said , will even make an appearance , `` by the magic of the Interwebs . ''

When they 're not beating up on each other , Republican presidential candidates have spent much of the past few months beating up on Obama .

`` We 've seen the median income for Americans drop by 10 % , '' said presumed Republican front-runner and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , blaming the economy 's woes on Obama . `` By the end of his first term -- his only term -- he 's on track to amass almost as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined . This has been a failed presidency . ''

They have hit him on the economy , they 've hit him on foreign policy , health care and the size of government . Some even continue to suggest , albeit jokingly , that he is not a legitimate American citizen , as hinted in an offhand comment by Romney 's son Matt last week . The younger Romney quickly walked back his comments in a tweet after being confronted by the media .

`` I remember , after he got inaugurated ... and he said , ` Look , if I ca n't get this economy turned around in three years , I 'll be looking at a one-term proposition , ' '' reminded Mitt Romney during a stump speech Monday in Marion , Iowa . `` Well , I 'm here to collect . ''

But through the attacks , the president has largely remained quiet . Only occasionally has he wandered into the fray , suggesting that he may engage the other side when the dust settles .

`` I 'm going to wait until everybody is voted off the island , '' he told Jay Leno on `` The Tonight Show . ''

Iowa has historically been the proving grounds for underdog candidates . In 2008 it was Obama . This year , it could be former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum , who has been surging since the recent CNN/Time/ORC International poll put him in a strong third place behind Romney and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul , but moving up .

For Obama , his Iowa test comes in November

Nevertheless , Obama 's task in Iowa , considered a pivotal swing state when the general election comes in November , is still grand . He must retain the Democratic support he had in 2008 -- when he camped out in the state for months before the caucuses and visited Iowa more than three dozen times -- while convincing the third of the voters who call themselves independent not to drift back over to the Republican side , and the other third who are Democrats not to stay home .

And all this goes on while Republicans continue to grab the spotlight and hammer him throughout 2012 . Meanwhile , the base is restless .

`` It seems very hopeless ... hope , change ... but nothing changes , '' said Bradshaw , the young barber who is fed up with Obama and the process .

When asked what she 'd say to Bradshaw , the Iowa Democratic chair 's words got pointed .

`` Yes , there is frustration , there is angst . But I would say to that person -- and I 'd say it directly to his face -- that there has been a remarkable record of achievement in the past four years , '' Dvorsky said , her passion growing .

`` I 'd point to the record of achievement , in the face of two things happening simultaneously : The near-collapse of the entire economy , an economy that was bleeding 750,000 jobs . And now he has presided over 23 consecutive months of private sector job growth . I 'd point to everything he did to pass the Affordable Health Care Act . I 'd point to what he did to partner with the Big Three automakers to save the American automotive industry , or bringing combat troops from Iraq home with their families at Christmas , instead of on their fifth or sixth deployment . ''

`` And he did this in the face of massive opposition from a party who saw as its role to take down a sitting president , not to compromise , not to work with him , but to take him down , '' Dvorsky said . `` This is a group of people , not all of them , who say ` No , heck no , never ! ' ''

`` The real story for the Republicans is going to be not on the night of January 3 , but on the morning of January 4 , '' she said confidently . `` He 'll be on the way back to The White House , and they 'll be left sweeping up the floor of the empty rooms , and not much else . ''
