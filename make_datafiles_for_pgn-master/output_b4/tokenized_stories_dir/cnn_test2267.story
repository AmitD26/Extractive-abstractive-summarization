-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Germany 's ruling coalition has agreed to shut down all of the nation 's nuclear power plants by 2022 .

Minister of Ecology Norbert Roettgen of the Christian Democratic Union party made the announcement early Monday after negotiations with coalition partner , the Liberal Party , which had been opposed to setting a date for decommissioning the nuclear facilities .

Opposition parties have long supported shuttering nuclear energy in Germany

`` The decision looks like this , '' Roettgen said . `` Seven older nuclear power plants ... and the nuclear plant Kruemmel will not go back online ... a second group of six nuclear reactors will go offline at the end of 2021 at the latest , and ... the three most modern , newest nuclear plants will go offline in 2022 at the latest . ''

To make up for the loss of nuclear energy , the German government will begin to switch to renewable energy and increase investments in energy research , the government website says .

`` But we will not be able to do without conventional power plants , above all cutting-edge gas power plants for a long time , '' said a statement published last week . `` New fruits of new research should contribute to making the energy transition more efficient and easier on the ecology . ''

In March , German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she would rethink a plan to extend the lifespan of her country 's nuclear power plants .

`` The events in Japan have shown us that even things that seem all but impossible scientifically can in fact happen , '' Merkel said at a Berlin news conference .

Japan 's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was damaged in a March 11 earthquake and tsunami , which has spewed large amounts of radiation into the environment .

At the time , Merkel ordered a review of the nuclear plant safety standards , saying there would be `` no taboos in those reviews . ''
