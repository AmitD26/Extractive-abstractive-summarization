-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- She tackled one of the toughest jobs any nurse could take on -- treating a highly contagious Ebola patient . And somehow along the way , she contracted the deadly virus herself .

Now , Nina Pham tries to recover in the same Dallas hospital where she works .

Here 's what we know about the 26-year-old Texan :

` I 'm doing well '

On Tuesday , Pham said she was `` doing well '' in a statement released by her employer , Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas .

`` I 'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers , '' she said , according to the hospital . `` I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world . ''

Pham was in good condition , said Wendell Watson , spokesman for Texas Health Resources .

She 's Vietnamese-American

Pham grew up in a Vietnamese family in Fort Worth , Texas .

She did n't go far away for college , attending Texas Christian University in the same city . Pham graduated with a nursing degree in 2010 .

And just two months ago , she received certification in critical care nursing , which deals specifically with life-threatening problems .

She 's very religious

`` She is a very devoted Catholic , and always puts the other people 's interests ahead of her own , '' said family friend Tom Ha , who has known Pham since she was in eighth grade .

Ha taught Pham in Bible class at his church .

`` She comes from a family that is -LRB- of -RRB- a very strong faith , '' he said . So he was n't surprised `` that she -LRB- did -RRB- more than her duty called for in order to make sure the patient had a chance to survive . ''

When Pham called the church to let members know she had contracted Ebola , `` everybody at the church '' began crying , he said .

How did she contract Ebola ?

She loves her job

Ha , the family friend , said nursing is n't just a job for Pham -- it 's a calling .

`` I think that she takes it -LRB- as -RRB- more than a career . I think it 's a vocation , because her family , from the time that we met , they always serve other people , '' he said .

When she was accepted into nursing school , she was really excited , a family friend told The Dallas Morning News .

`` Her mom would tell her how it 's really hard and a bunch of her friends quit doing it because it was so stressful , '' the friend told the paper . `` But she was like , ` This is what I want to do . ' ''

What 's a hospital supposed to do if an Ebola patient shows up ?

She 's a good teacher

Not only is Pham skilled in proper nursing techniques , she was a scrupulous teacher , too .

Jennifer Joseph trained under Pham at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital . Though she now works at another hospital , she remembers the guidance she received from Pham .

`` Knowing Nina , she 's one of the most meticulous , thorough , effective nurses , '' Joseph told CNN affiliate KTVT . `` She taught me infection control and hand hygiene and protocol . I learned so much of that from her . ''

Joseph said she also has faith that those taking care of her now will help their colleague recover .

`` I have full confidence they 'll be able to get her through this . ''

She has a sense of humor

Among the boards she set up on her Pinterest account are two filled with funny e-cards : `` Laughter is the best medicine '' and `` Nurse things . ''

`` I hate the questions that start with , ` So you 're a nurse , let me ask you ... ' '' read one of the pins she posted .

She adores her dog

Many of Pham 's photos on social media feature her Cavalier King Charles spaniel , Bentley .

After Spanish authorities euthanized an Ebola patient 's dog last week , many in Dallas feared Pham 's dog might face the same fate .

Can pets get or spread Ebola ?

But Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed said Bentley is safe and being cared for in quarantine .

`` That dog was very important to her , '' said Mayor Mike Rawlings . `` We want to make sure that dog is as healthy as can be at this point and being taken care of . ''

Officials emailed a video of Bentley to Pham on Monday night , he said , hoping that it might boost her spirits .
