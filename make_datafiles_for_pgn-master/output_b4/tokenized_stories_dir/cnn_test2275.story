Partisan hyperbole has ratcheted up as the Obama administration grapples with thousands of young undocumented immigrants surging the U.S.-Mexico border and facing angry protesters on the way to overcrowded detention centers .

Republicans blame President Barack Obama for exacerbating the problem . They say the policy of temporarily deferring deportations of children sent a signal to thousands of kids fleeing poverty and violence in Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador that they could stay in America .

Immigrant children tread treacherous political landscape

And even one Democrat , Rep. Henry Cuellar , whose Texas district borders where immigrant children cross the Rio Grande Valley , feels Obama has been `` one step behind . ''

Obama and many Democrats say House Republicans are to blame for rejecting Senate-passed immigration reform last year without coming up with their own plan .

And in the latest development on Monday , the White House said most children involved probably wo n't be allowed to stay in the country .

Beyond the bickering , both sides have valid points , immigration policy and law experts say . Here 's a reality check .

1 . Why is this happening ? Unaccompanied minors have been trekking to the United States in steadily increasing numbers since 2012 , according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute .

Over roughly the past year or so , however , both the numbers and home countries shifted dramatically . Where previously Mexican children made up the bulk of them , a surge more recently from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador has been seen .

`` In reality , there is no single cause . Instead , a confluence of different pull and push factors has contributed to the upsurge , '' the institute 's analysis found . `` Recent U.S. policies toward unaccompanied children , faltering economies and rising crime and gang activity in Central American countries , the desire for family reunification , and changing operations of smuggling networks have all converged . ''

An administration program that defers the deportation of children brought in illegally by their parents or guardians has also had unintended consequences , immigration policy and law experts say .

Although most children pouring over the border now would not qualify for `` amnesty , '' drug smugglers have used misperceptions about the program to entice kids with the promise of `` permisos , '' or a pass to stay in America , Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told a congressional committee recently .

Inaction by the House on immigration reform has also exacerbated the problem , experts say .

Such reforms would help stabilize employment prospects for immigrants who left their kids behind . As a result , those children might not feel as compelled to flee , experts say .

2 . Should government have seen it coming ? : Yes .

Last year , federal agencies noticed an uptick in minors crossing the border -- particularly in the Rio Grande Valley , according to a report from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol .

The same agencies have also realized those `` children present unique operational challenges '' for Border Patrol and Health and Human Services . The administration was also aware that it could n't simply deport them .

The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act , which was signed into law and reauthorized several times during President George W. Bush 's administration set guidelines on how to best handle unaccompanied immigrant children .

In 2008 , the Department of Health and Human Services was authorized to take over the care of kids , which includes helping meet their health and legal needs , no later than 72 hours after being picked up by the Border Patrol .

At a House Homeland Security Committee hearing last month , federal officials said they were having difficulties meeting the 72-hour hand off .

The administration has asked Congress to give the Border Patrol more leeway in deportation decisions but doing so is murky , immigration advocates say , since it involves a young and vulnerable population .

3 . What 's being done now ? Obama is vowing to act on his own and use his executive authority to sidestep the House , changes some proponents say could help address the problem .

Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ?

Obama has discussed Mexico 's role with Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and Vice President Joe Biden brainstormed strategies with Central American leaders in Guatemala .

Johnson also will travel to Guatemala this summer and he made a public service announcement in Spanish and English last month aimed at Central American parents .

He stressed sending children to smugglers who sneak them across the border is dangerous and illegal .

Immigration officials also released graphic ads over the weekend with the same message . There is also an effort against drug cartel smuggling rings , and consideration of deploying more Border Patrol agents .

White House to spend millions to curb undocumented children crossing border

Obama will request more than $ 2 billion from Congress to help deal with the problem .

Though now , the administration plans to spend roughly $ 100 million in aid to Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador to help the immigrant children get back home and stay there .

It also setting aside $ 161.5 million this year for programs designed to help Central American countries respond to `` pressing security and governance challenges . ''

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday the `` law will be enforced . ''

This means children who have been apprehended `` will go through the immigration court process '' and it 's unlikely that most who do so `` will qualify '' to stay in the country .

4 . Would an immigration bill have prevented this ? Perhaps , immigration law and policy experts say .

Obama likes to blame the House for not passing a Senate immigration bill that also included a path to citizenship for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented workers in the country .

Those reforms would have helped immigrant families become more economically stable . Those parents , in turn , would have more money to send back home which , as a result , would help eliminate the type of poverty affected kids experience .

5 . Will Obama go to the border ? He is in Texas for fundraisers and for an economy event this week . However , White House officials say he has no plans to visit the border now .

The White House feels that things are in hand . `` The President is very aware of the situation that exists on the southwest border , '' Earnest said , noting that other officials have traveled there and what they 've seen `` is troubling . ''

Texas Gov. Rick Perry has loudly called for Obama to visit the border .
