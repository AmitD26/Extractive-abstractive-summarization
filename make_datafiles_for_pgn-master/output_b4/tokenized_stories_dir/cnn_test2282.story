The glitz of Cannes on the French Riviera is a world removed from the hellish conditions endured by the hundreds of illegal immigrants smuggled from Africa to Europe every year .

But Senegalese director Moussa Toure is confronting attendees of the world 's leading film festival with their story of desperation in `` La Pirogue , '' his first feature film in 14 years .

`` La Pirogue '' -- a pirogue being a type of flat-bottomed boat commonly used for fishing in West Africa -- tells the story of Baye Laye , a boat captain who hails from a fishing village outside Dakar . It follows his ordeal after he agrees to take a pirogue containing 30 men to Spain 's Canary Islands in search of a better life in Europe .

Toure said the film was inspired by the fact that , in his experience , virtually every Senegalese family had a member who had left by boat for Europe .

`` It 's an everyday reality in my country , '' he told CNN , in French . `` In Dakar , young people attempt these journeys practically every day because they have no hope for their future in Senegal . They are often educated young people with qualifications , and they pay a lot of money to be smuggled out of the country , because they have no choice . ''

According to UNHCR figures , there were 5443 `` irregular arrivals '' from North and West Africa by sea in Spain in 2011 -- down from 32,000 in 2006 . With the vessels poorly equipped for the arduous journeys of hundreds of kilometers , fatalities are commonplace .

When Toure discovered his young mechanic was among those who had made the voyage , lasting two months in Europe before being discovered by authorities and sent home , the director pressed him for his experiences , which subsequently informed the film .

The film was shot over two months in Senegal . Many of the actors , just like their characters , could not swim , making for some tense moments , said Toure . `` We had dangerous moments because we were filming at the mouth of the Saloum River and this is where it meets the sea . I was secretly terrified that we would capsize like often happens in real life . I was especially scared for those -LRB- the actors -RRB- who could not swim . ''

Moussa , a former electrician who shot his first short film in 1987 , has been focusing on documentaries for the past decade . Working on `` La Pirogue , '' his third feature , was deeply affecting , he said , and the result had made his wife cry `` like I 've never seen her cry before '' .

The film , a French-Senegalese co-production , is one of 20 films selected for the `` Un Certain Regard '' -LRB- A Particular Outlook -RRB- section of the festival , designated for original and innovative movies seeking international recognition .

Toure 's film is the only sub-Saharan African movie in competition this year , but African films -- particularly those from Senegal and Burkina Faso -- have fared well at the festival , especially over the past decade .

In 2008 , the French-Liberian co-production `` Johnny Mad Dog '' won the Prize of Hope at the festival , for its depiction of child soldiers at the end of the Second Liberian Civil War . It was based on the novel `` Johnny Chien Mechant '' by Congolese author Emmanuel Dongala .

In 2005 , `` Delwende , '' directed by Burkina Faso 's S. Pierre Yameogo , won the same prize when it was screened . It told the story of a woman accused of being a `` soul eater '' and subjected to trial by a council of elders after a child died in her village .

The year previous , `` Moolaade , '' by the late Senegalese writer and director Ousmane Sembene won the `` Prix Un Certain Regard , '' while in 1990 , Burkina Faso 's Idrissa Ouedraogo won the Jury Grand Prize for his film `` Tilai . ''

African cinema also has a strong presence at Cannes with South African and Nigerian delegations at the festival 's film market . Their attendance is intended to showcase both countries ' film industries and the investment opportunities they represent .

Nigeria boasts one of the world 's biggest film industries -- affectionately known as `` Nollywood '' -- alongside Hollywood and Bombay 's `` Bollywood . ''

Most of its output consists of pacey and vibrant video-format B-movies , which have immense popularity across the continent despite their shoe-string budgets . But recently a new generation of filmmakers has been seeking to elevate the industry through a movement they call `` New Nigeria Cinema , '' involving stronger story lines , higher production values and a more authentic depiction of African experience .

Toure is no stranger to film festivals ; last year he was president of the documentary film jury at Africa 's largest film festival , FESPACO -LRB- the Pan-African Film Festival of Ouagadougou , in Burkina Faso -RRB- .

He said he was optimistic about the future of African cinema . `` I think there are great stories coming out of Africa and there are many people who are talented . Those who govern us do not get involved and leave cinema at the mercy of filmmakers , '' he said .
