-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On New Year 's Day , after months of suffering from debilitating headaches , I learned that I had brain cancer .

I was 29 years old . I 'd been married for just over a year . My husband and I were trying for a family .

Our lives devolved into hospital stays , doctor consultations and medical research . Nine days after my initial diagnoses , I had a partial craniotomy and a partial resection of my temporal lobe . Both surgeries were an effort to stop the growth of my tumor .

In April , I learned that not only had my tumor come back , but it was more aggressive . Doctors gave me a prognosis of six months to live .

Because my tumor is so large , doctors prescribed full brain radiation . I read about the side effects : The hair on my scalp would have been singed off . My scalp would be left covered with first-degree burns . My quality of life , as I knew it , would be gone .

After months of research , my family and I reached a heartbreaking conclusion : There is no treatment that would save my life , and the recommended treatments would have destroyed the time I had left .

I considered passing away in hospice care at my San Francisco Bay-area home . But even with palliative medication , I could develop potentially morphine-resistant pain and suffer personality changes and verbal , cognitive and motor loss of virtually any kind .

Because the rest of my body is young and healthy , I am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind . I probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months . And my family would have had to watch that .

I did not want this nightmare scenario for my family , so I started researching death with dignity . It is an end-of-life option for mentally competent , terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six months or less to live . It would enable me to use the medical practice of aid in dying : I could request and receive a prescription from a physician for medication that I could self-ingest to end my dying process if it becomes unbearable .

I quickly decided that death with dignity was the best option for me and my family .

We had to uproot from California to Oregon , because Oregon is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized .

I met the criteria for death with dignity in Oregon , but establishing residency in the state to make use of the law required a monumental number of changes . I had to find new physicians , establish residency in Portland , search for a new home , obtain a new driver 's license , change my voter registration and enlist people to take care of our animals , and my husband , Dan , had to take a leave of absence from his job . The vast majority of families do not have the flexibility , resources and time to make all these changes .

I 've had the medication for weeks . I am not suicidal . If I were , I would have consumed that medication long ago . I do not want to die . But I am dying . And I want to die on my own terms .

Brittany Maynard , advocate for ` death with dignity , ' dies

I would not tell anyone else that he or she should choose death with dignity . My question is : Who has the right to tell me that I do n't deserve this choice ? That I deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain ? Why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me ?

Opinion : When assisted suicide is not the answer

Now that I 've had the prescription filled and it 's in my possession , I have experienced a tremendous sense of relief . And if I decide to change my mind about taking the medication , I will not take it .

Having this choice at the end of my life has become incredibly important . It has given me a sense of peace during a tumultuous time that otherwise would be dominated by fear , uncertainty and pain .

Now , I 'm able to move forward in my remaining days or weeks I have on this beautiful Earth , to seek joy and love and to spend time traveling to outdoor wonders of nature with those I love . And I know that I have a safety net .

Dying young and on her own terms

I plan to celebrate my husband 's birthday on October 26 with him and our family . Unless my condition improves dramatically , I will look to pass soon thereafter .

I hope for the sake of my fellow American citizens that I 'll never meet that this option is available to you . If you ever find yourself walking a mile in my shoes , I hope that you would at least be given the same choice and that no one tries to take it from you .

When my suffering becomes too great , I can say to all those I love , `` I love you ; come be by my side , and come say goodbye as I pass into whatever 's next . '' I will die upstairs in my bedroom with my husband , mother , stepfather and best friend by my side and pass peacefully . I ca n't imagine trying to rob anyone else of that choice .
