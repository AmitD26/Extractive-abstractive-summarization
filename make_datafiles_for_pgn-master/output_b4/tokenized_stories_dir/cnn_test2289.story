Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- Hillary Clinton has been meeting with advisers at her Chappaqua , New York home for strategy sessions about launching a 2016 presidential run , a Democratic source tells CNN .

The meetings have taken place for part of the last month , according to the source , and have focused on the strategy , tactics and policy that would make a possible Clinton run in 2016 campaign successful .

`` She has got a lot of depth in policy , but she is looking for new ideas , '' the source said . `` She is also being very thorough about the path to the nomination and the path to the presidency . There are a lot of strategy meetings with tactics focused on that . ''

Democrats attending some of these meetings -- which were first reported by the Washington Post on Tuesday -- include Joel Benenson , Jim Margolis and Robby Mook , according to the source , who noted that all three operatives had been selected to play major roles in the Clinton campaign .

In the run up to what is now an all-but-certain 2016 announcement , Benenson has been tapped chief strategist for the Clinton campaign , according to reports from the Washington Post and Politico . The source said that specific title has not been solidified yet , but the Democratic pollster is playing a big role in this pre-campaign process .

`` She -LSB- Clinton -RSB- likes him for more than just reading poll results , '' the source said , noting that he would play a larger role than campaign pollster .

The Clinton pre-campaign has also selected Mook -- a veteran of Clinton 's 2008 campaign -- as their campaign manger , according to the source , and Margolis -- a senior adviser to Obama 's successful 2012 reelection bid -- as media adviser . Both selections have been expected by Democrats close to Clinton and been previously reported .

John Podesta , a top White House adviser who is slated to leave the White House in early February , has also been named campaign chairman , the source said . Politico was first to report his top campaign slot .

`` He will be the chairman and the issue right now is if everyone will report to him as the chairman , '' the source said . `` I do n't think he will be a titular head . I think the issue is is he going to be in charge of the campaign with authority and the intention is that he will be very active . ''

Podesta , a former top aide in Bill Clinton 's White House , joined the Obama White House in 2013 to help on major projects and negotiations . Recently he has since been blunt about the fact he planned to leave the administration in early 2015 to help a possible Clinton campaign .

`` If she runs , as I hope she will , I will do whatever she asks me to do , '' Podesta said on the Charlie Rose Show in November . `` Right now she has n't made a decision to run , so I am expecting to return to what I was doing before . ''

Clinton 's meetings at her home in New York seemingly explain her month long absence from the speaking circuit and Twitter . The former secretary of state has gone over a month without a high-profile speaking gig , a dearth in events that is noticeable considering how many event Clinton headlined last year . Clinton will headline her first event in over a month on Wednesday in Winnipeg , Canada .

Although some structural decisions have been made , the source said the Clinton camp has not solidified the overall architecture of the operation as well as heads of the communications , field and digital operations .

`` There are these structural things to do and then , really I think once that is done , the thing she is going to end up spending a lot of time on is her plan and her message , '' the source said .

Clinton 's 2016 team , though early , is already shaping up to be a departure from the team that surrounded her in her during her failed 2008 presidential run . Instead , Clinton is pulling heavily from Democrats who successfully won Obama the White House twice .

Republicans seeking to tie Clinton and Obama have welcomed that fact , arguing that by hiring former Obama advisers , Clinton is making their job easy .

In a memo from America Rising , an anti-Clinton super PAC , Tim Miller , the group 's executive director , said `` Clinton is signaling that she 's not just from the same party as the President , but that she 's an Obama Democrat , who will back his policies , pursue his agenda , and represent a Third Term of the Obama Administration . ''

Emails to the a Clinton spokesman about the meetings and hiring went unanswered .
