NEW YORK -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bonuses for Wall Street fat cats are easy political fodder in uncertain economic times , but former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Friday cutting corporate bonuses means slashing jobs in the Big Apple .

Rudy Giuliani says that when he was mayor , he gauged the New York City budget by Wall Street bonuses .

`` If you somehow take that bonus out of the economy , it really will create unemployment , '' he said on CNN 's `` American Morning . '' `` It means less spending in restaurants , less spending in department stores , so everything has an impact . ''

President Obama admonished corporate America on Thursday after the New York comptroller reported that Wall Street bankers received $ 18.4 billion in bonuses in 2008 .

`` This is the height of irresponsibility . It is shameful , '' the president said . Watch Obama blast Wall Street ''

These are the same institutions `` teetering on collapse '' and asking taxpayers to bail them out while taxpayers are dealing with their own tumultuous finances , he said .

Last year , Congress passed a $ 700 billion bailout for financial institutions , and an $ 819 billion economic stimulus package is presently making its way through the Senate after garnering House approval Wednesday .

`` There will be time for -LSB- bankers -RSB- to make profits , and there will be time for them to get bonuses -- now is not that time , '' Obama said of the bonuses , which were about equal to those of 2004 .

When Giuliani ran for the GOP presidential nomination , pundits said his stances on issues like abortion rights separated him from self-proclaimed Reagan Republicans in the field . Not up for debate is Giuliani 's alignment with the 40th president on `` trickle-down economics , '' the theory that keeping the rich wealthy creates jobs and solvency for the lower classes .

`` Those bonuses , if they are reversed , are going to cause unemployment in New York , '' the self-described fiscal conservative said . `` I remember when I was mayor , one of the ways in which you determine New York City 's budget , tax revenue is Wall Street bonuses .

`` Wall Street has $ 1 billion , $ 2 billion in bonuses , the city had a deficit . Wall Street has $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion , New York City had a $ 2 billion , $ 3 billion surplus , and it 's because that money gets spent . That money goes directly into the economy . First of all , it gets taxed as income . Secondly , it gets taxes again when somebody buys something with it . ''

In announcing the Wall Street bonuses Wednesday , State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said the $ 18.4 billion represented a stark dip from 2007 's bonuses , which totaled $ 32.9 billion

`` A 44 percent decline in the bonus pool will ripple through the regional economy and the state and the city will lose major tax revenues , '' DiNapoli said in a statement . `` The securities industry has already lost tens of thousands of jobs and the industry is still continuing to write off toxic assets . It 's painfully obvious that 2009 will probably be another difficult year for the industry . ''

While city incomes taxes are common in Iowa , Indiana , Maryland , Michigan , Ohio and Pennsylvania , they are an anomaly in most parts of the country , according to a 2008 report by Tax Foundation , a Washington-based think tank . New York City and Yonkers are the only cities levying income taxes in New York state , the foundation said .

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday the city needs to close a projected $ 4 billion budget gap in fiscal year 2010 . Skyrocketing unemployment is partially to blame , he said , projecting that 300,000 jobs will be lost in the city by the second quarter of 2010 .

Of those , 46,000 job losses are expected to have come from Wall Street , a particularly devastating blow to the economy because those in the financial community tend to pay double or triple the taxes paid by employees in other industries , he said .

`` When Wall Street catches a cold , it 's a very serious illness to us , '' Bloomberg said .

In 2008 , New York had $ 41.2 billion in expenses and $ 42.8 billion in revenue , he said . Projections suggest that in 2010 the city will have $ 43.4 billion in expenses but only $ 37.1 billion in revenue .

Bloomberg proposed several measures , including an increase in the sales tax from 8.375 percent to 8.75 percent , in an effort to balance the budget . Bloomberg has already slashed $ 3.7 billion in spending since last year , an administration official said .

In recent months , the mayor has tried to shore up city finances by raising hotel taxes and pulling back a property tax cut set to expire this summer , the official said .
