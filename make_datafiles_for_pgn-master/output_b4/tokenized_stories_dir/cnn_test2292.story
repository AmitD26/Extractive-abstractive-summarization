-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Huddled in the hallway of his Alabama home with three of his friends , Tillman Merritt had a gut feeling to jump into a closet as the massive twister barreled into the Tuscaloosa neighborhood .

Moments later , he was the only one to survive .

`` I just heard a voice in my head saying ` go to the closet , go to the closet , '' Merritt said .

The closet walls pushed down on him as a roar surrounded him , followed by the sounds of pieces of the house snapping off . Then the crack of glass was heard , and insulation was flying everywhere .

When it was over , there was just a small hole for Merritt to crawl out of . Except for the closet he was in , the entire house -- and his three friends -- had been flung across the street .

He found the other three in the wreckage of the house , in a pile . His roommate and life-long friend was dead , the two others would succumb to their wounds .

As emergency responders continued to tally the dead on Saturday , stories began to emerge that illustrated the scope of what has become the second-deadliest , single-day tornado outbreak in U.S. history .

Among the victims for whom memorial services are planned starting Sunday are four students of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa . The area has been the focal point for the Wednesday disaster that swept through six southern states and has killed 337 people .

Among those deaths is Morgan Sigler , a senior graphic design major from Bryant , Alabama , who was killed when the storm struck Merritt 's house .

She suffered internal injuries and died during surgery , her mother said . The Siglers ' story is one of dozens of similar tales of tragedy in the South .

`` She just lit up our world , she was our baby , '' Vega Sigler said .

Morgan Sigler was the kind of person who reached to those in need , and enjoyed the mission trips she undertook with her church .

`` We know where she 's at , but it does n't make it any easier , '' her mother said .

The student was a creative type , and would build projects that she would give out as gifts to family members , Vega Sigler said . A professor even called to tell her parents how much potential Morgan Sigler had as a graphic designer .

Not far from where Morgan Sigler lived , Cody Kirk watched from his apartment complex as debris flew in the air nearby . It sounded like an engine from a 747 airliner for about three minutes , he said .

`` I go around the corner , and there 's nothing . There 's absolutely nothing , '' he said .

Kirk was close friends with Morgan Sigler and knew the two other victims , Scott Atterton and Blake Peak .

Atterton was known for having a kind heart , and was not the kind of person satisfied with a handshake .

He would tell Kirk , `` bring it in for the real thing , '' and give him a hug .

Peak was Morgan Sigler 's boyfriend . He made her really happy , Kirk said .

According to the Alabama Emergency Management Agency , at least 45 people people died during the storms in Tuscaloosa County , more than in any of the other five southern states that recorded deaths from Wednesday 's violent weather .

By early Saturday morning , emergency management officials tallied 249 deaths in Alabama , 34 in Tennessee , 33 in Mississippi , 15 in Georgia , five in Virginia and one in Arkansas .

Hundreds are unaccounted for in Tuscaloosa alone , though not all have been officially reported missing .

`` We 're hopeful and prayerful that a large majority of that is just duplicates within our dispatch system , '' Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said . `` However , we are putting cadaver dog teams through the city in a frantic search to find everyone that is accounted for . ''

The University of Alabama student newspaper , The Crimson White , began tallying e-mails from students who were searching for missing friends . Within hours , the newspaper had received 68 e-mails from worried students .

Graduate student Arefeen Shamsuzzoha toured much of the city Friday , taking photographs of the damage .

`` The trees are completely stripped of all of their branches , '' Shamsuzzoha told CNN Saturday morning . `` The ones that are standing just look like sticks rising from the ground . ''

When President Barack Obama visited the city Friday , his motorcade passed street after street of homes reduced to splinters , crushed and flipped cars , and debris strewn all around .

`` I 've got to say I 've never seen devastation like this , '' Obama told reporters .

The storms also wreaked between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion in insured losses across the region , according to the catastrophe modeling firm , Eqecat .

Records go back to 1680 , and since then there has been only one other date in U.S. history on which more people died during a severe weather outbreak . On March 18 , 1925 , a severe storm system swept across seven states killing 747 people , according to the National Weather Service .

Weather officials say the reason why so many perished was due to the size and path of the tornadoes . Meteorologists rely on what is called an `` Enhanced Fujita Scale '' to rate the severity of tornadoes .

The lowest ranking , EF-0 , applies to twisters with recorded 3-second wind gusts of between 65 mph and 85 mph , according to the National Weather Service . The highest , an EF-5 , is assigned to tornadoes with speeds of over 200 mph

The weather service has so far recorded 11 tornadoes with EF-3 ratings or higher that struck central and north Alabama on Wednesday . Some of the twisters were three-quarters of a mile wide and traveled dozens of miles , experts said .

`` That 's an astounding amount for a single day tornado event . '' said Krissy Scotten , a weather service meteorologist in Birmingham . `` It 's one of those instances where you had very large tornadoes on very long tracks hitting heavily populated areas . ''

`` When you put that together , you 're going to see large loss of life and massive devastation , '' Scotten said .

An EF-4 touched down in Hackleburg , killing 29 people in the town of nearly 1,600 residents .

The storms destroyed almost every business in the city . A doctor 's office . The pharmacy . A ball field .

`` It 's pretty much wiped out , '' said Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams . `` It looks like a war zone . ''

From there , the tornado traveled more than 39 miles across three counties , said Chelly Amin , a National Weather Service meteorologist in Huntsville .

The same tornado , Amin said , virtually destroyed the tiny town of Phil Campbell , which has a population of little more than 1,000 .

Those who survived the disaster thanked God or simple luck .
