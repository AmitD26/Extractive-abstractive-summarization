-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Country singer Trace Adkins lost his home to fire Saturday , but his three young daughters were saved by following fire safety tips they learned at school , Adkins ' wife said .

The flames apparently ignited in the garage , but quickly spread to the attic of the large home Saturday afternoon , said Brentwood , Tennessee , Fire Chief Brian Goss . The house is considered a total loss .

`` Stuff is stuff , '' Rhonda Adkins told a reporter for CNN affiliate WSMV in Nashville as she stood on a neighbor 's lawn watching her home burn .

Her three young daughters and their dog were inside the home with their nanny when the fire started . Rhonda Adkins was driving a few blocks away when a neighbor called her .

`` She said that the house was on fire and we looked up in the air and we saw the black smoke , '' Adkins said . `` And I said , ` Oh , my God , this is n't happening , this is n't real . ' ''

When she pulled up to her yard , she found her children there unhurt , she said .

`` They ran to their safe place like we practiced , in the front yard at a big tree , '' she said . `` And it worked . You know , fire safety is so important , and today we used it . ''

Brentwood firefighters , the same ones who were inside her home battling the flames , visited her children 's elementary school to teach fire safety earlier this year , she said . One lesson was to place a yellow ribbon where the family should gather if the house caught fire .

`` I tied the yellow ribbon around the tree to go to , '' she said . `` It stayed there for about a month . Trace kept going , ` When you gon na take that ribbon down ? ' and I 'm like , ` You know , I might need it one day . ' ''

Adkins said she never really expected it to be needed . `` But we did what those firefighters told us and we practiced it today , '' she said . `` It saved my kids ' lives . ''

With her daughters , their nanny and the family dog safe , Adkins said it was easy for her to be calm and thankful despite the loss of her home . She did have one regret , though .

`` I have not backed up all my photographs , and I 'm just sitting here sick because those are the things that matter the most , '' she said . `` It 's your memories , our wedding pictures , I do n't have , because the negatives are in the house .

`` Please , everybody , practice fire safety , and back up all your pictures , '' she said .

Her husband was on a plane to Alaska for two shows and some fishing when the fire happened . His publicist said he immediately boarded a return flight to Tennessee when he landed .

`` Trace wishes to express his gratitude for the immediate response of the Brentwood Fire Department and is humbled by the outpouring of concern from friends and fans , '' his spokesman said in a written statement to CNN Sunday .

Coincidentally , Adkins ' newest single , `` Just Fishin , ' '' is being released this week . The video , which features the singer and his youngest child , Trinity , on a father-daughter fishing trip , was released Friday .

Adkins , 49 , was a finalist on NBC 's `` Celebrity Apprentice '' in 2008 , but host Donald Trump chose Piers Morgan , now a CNN talk show host , as the winner .
