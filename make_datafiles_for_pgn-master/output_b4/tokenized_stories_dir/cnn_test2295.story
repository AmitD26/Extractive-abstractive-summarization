Sumptuous velvet , delicate sequins , intricate beading : They are dresses fit for a princess -- Princess Diana , that is -- and if you 've got a big pocketbook -LRB- with a designer label , naturally -RRB- , they could have been yours .

Ten dresses worn by the late Princess of Wales went under the hammer at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London on Tuesday .

The top seller was the midnight blue number Diana famously wore to dance with John Travolta at a gala dinner at the White House in November 1985 . That dress sold for $ 362,424 -LRB- 240,000 British pounds -RRB- and was bought by `` a British gentleman as a surprise to cheer up his wife , '' the auction house said .

The entire collection fetched $ 1.2 million -LRB- 800,000 British pounds -RRB- , the auctioneer said .

TV footage and photographs of the princess and the Hollywood star gliding around the room to the music of `` Saturday Night Fever '' were seen around the world , and Travolta later described the experience as having been `` like a fairy tale . ''

Diana also wore the `` Travolta '' dress , designed by Victor Edelstein , for her final portrait by Lord Snowdon in 1997 .

Auctioneer Kerry Taylor told CNN before the auction that putting a price on such items was `` difficult , '' but that their high profile added value .

`` You can look at what they sold for , you can look at how simple the thing is , '' she explained . `` If it was worn on a state occasion , or if it was for a private dinner , are there photographs of the princess wearing it , are there film reels of the princess wearing it , and is there a human story that adds to it ? ''

For example , as Taylor pointed out , a bottle green velvet evening dress , also by Victor Edelstein , bears what could be the traces of a young prince : `` what looks like a little boy 's -LRB- or little child 's -RRB- handprint -- sticky fingerprints on the fabric . '' The dress sold for $ 36,281 , including the buyer 's premium .

Also included in the sale were dresses by some of Diana 's other favorite designers . Six werer by Catherine Walker , including the beaded black dress Diana wore for Vanity Fair 's 1997 photoshoot by Mario Testino -- that sold for $ 163,264 -- and the black Bruce Oldfield gown she wore to the gala opening of `` Les Miserables '' in October 1985 and for another official portrait by Snowdon . That dress sold for $ 76,190 .

The outfits were originally sold in a charity auction at Christie 's in New York in June 1997 , just months before Diana 's death in a Paris car crash in August of that year . Kerry says that despite the passing of the years , the princess remains hugely popular .

`` Diana was different , '' she said . `` She was very much a ` people 's princess ' and the ups and downs of her life , her loves , people followed them avidly . I think there will always be a special place in people 's hearts for Diana . ''

Taylor also auctioned off the skimpy mesh dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge -- then known as Kate Middleton -- during a fashion show at the University of St. Andrews , at which she is reputed to have attracted the attentions of her future husband , Prince William .
