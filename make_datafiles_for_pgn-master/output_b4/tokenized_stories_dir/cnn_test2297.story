-LRB- CNN -RRB- When you think of the `` Fantastic Four , '' you likely do n't think of grim , dark imagery .

But if a trailer unleashed Tuesday is any indication , Marvel 's first family of superheroes are being rebooted into exactly that .

20th Century Fox 's new take on the foursome -- last seen in 2007 's `` Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer '' -- looks quite different from what we 're used to .

For starters , some of the lead cast members look to be younger than their predecessors , and Michael B. Jordan , an African American actor , is playing the Human Torch .

And the trailer is decidedly darker than the two previous breezy , joke-filled movies -- and many of the Marvel Comics as well .

Fans who have been concerned about the new direction of the `` Four , '' had a lot to say on social media , not all of it good .

`` This Fantastic 4 situation looks like Man of Steel all over again , '' tweeted Bobby Keough .

`` Taking a light/fun comic and making it dark/serious/grim . ''

`` Feels like a re-cut ` what if fantastic 4 was shot like interstellar ' blog post , '' remarked io9.com 's Meredith Woerner .

However , Jake New admitted , `` Honestly , it 's hard for me * not * to get at least a little excited about a Phill Glass-scored , Cronenberg-inspired sci-fi take on Fantastic 4 . ''
