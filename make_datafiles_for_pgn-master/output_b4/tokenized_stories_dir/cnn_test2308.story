It 's a powerful thing : the airline window seat .

Kids clamor for them . Shutterbugs are drawn to them . And some of us ca n't not look out the window .

See iReporters ' window seat photos

Statistics suggest that window seat passengers may enjoy their flights more . But changes are afoot for this travel touchstone .

Some of the most desirable window seats come at a premium now . And that may shift how we feel about them . And let 's face it , if all the photos snapped from airplane windows are any indication , we LOVE them .

Why all the love ? Sure , the stunning 30,000-foot views are cool . But for some travelers , it 's deeper than that .

Really ? Can you analyze a traveler 's personality by their favorite airplane seat ? Of course not ; do n't be ridiculous . But let 's do it anyway .

First , let 's take a look at the aisle seaters , who are passionate in their own right about airline seating . Screw the view ; these folks are all business .

`` The aisle person is looking to get some work done , '' said Courtney Scott , Travelocity 's travel blogger .

They want quick access to the cabin door -- or the restroom . And to get that access , they 're willing to put up with collisions with passing airline attendants and rattling snack carts .

Aisle seaters sacrifice frequently standing up and sitting down -- and returning their `` folding trays to their full upright position '' -- to make way for the middle and window seaters .

For window seaters , it 's not just about the view -LRB- or something to lean on -RRB- . It 's about the experience ! These fliers often are the true romantics .

Need proof ? Search #windowseat on Twitter and you 'll find plenty of tweeters waxing about windows . Like Bouss ` n.Like.A.Bouss :

Tweeting travelers have a lot of love for Erykah Badu 's 2010 hit song `` Window Seat . '' You 'll find Tweeters singing it -- virtually -- online .

`` Can I get a win-dow seat ? Do n't want nobody ... next to me , '' the lyrics read . `` I just wan na ticket outta town ... a look around ... and a safe touch down . I just wan na chance to fly ... a chance to cry ... and a long bye-bye . ''

When it comes to heart-wrenching separations , the aisle seat just does n't pack the same cinematic punch .

It 's been a century since the first U.S. commercial airline took to the sky . In that time , the window seat has become for many the best part of flying in an industry where complaints are all too frequent and the novelty of flight has faded . It attracts certain kinds of travelers , but it also can transform them .

`` It 's a calmer seat , '' Scott says .

Stats on airline seats are hard to come by , but anecdotally , front aisle seats are `` generally considered most desirable '' among Travelocity customers , Scott says .

At Expedia , 21 % of customers over the past year picked window seats , 20 % chose the aisle , and the rest had no preference . A United Airlines satisfaction survey for Airbus A320 passengers showed slightly higher preference for windows over aisles .

The consumer data collection site Hunch.com reports nearly seven out of 10 respondents prefer windows .

`` Window choosers are more likely to be younger , female , shorter and more casual than their aisle compatriots , '' Hunch wrote . `` They 're also more likely to be into nature . ''

Here 's what 's changing : Airlines are charging premium prices for some window and aisle seats . And that 's forcing passengers to choose the dreaded middle seat . It also makes it more difficult for families to sit in the same row if they 're not willing to pay extra .

Airlines with preferred seating fees include American , Spirit , Frontier , US Airways , Allegiant , Ryan Air and Delta . Charging more for preferred seating offers passengers more seating choices and flexibility , Delta said in June .

This is shifting `` the way that people view the window seat , '' Scott said . `` It has become even more of a premium . ''

Fliers stung by window , aisle fees

It 's not all blue skies with the window seats . The American College of Chest Physicians issued new health guidelines this year warning that sitting in window seats on long-distance flights can increase some people 's risk of developing life-threatening blood clots called deep vein thrombosis .

Combine that with a higher risk of wetting yourself and stepping on strangers ' toes , and you can see how far passengers are willing to go for those killer views .

Guidelines dispute `` economy class syndrome ''

And of course , who better to ask about the best air views than airline pilots ?

They tell us that -- generally -- window seaters love flying in and out of New York LaGuardia ; Vancouver , British Columbia ; Sydney ; Hong Kong and San Francisco .

Washington 's Reagan National Airport has an eye-popping approach known to pilots as `` river visual , '' says pilot Justin Schlechter . The plane flies low over the Potomac , giving passengers on the left side amazing views of the Kennedy Center , the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall .

The descent into Anchorage , Alaska , Schlechter says , `` is spectacular , with unbelievable mountaintops just skimming below the aircraft . '' Best seats : right side .

And then there 's the constant reminder that you 're in a metal tube at 30,000 feet .

In a famous 1963 episode of `` The Twilight Zone , '' William Shatner plays a mentally disturbed flier who watches helplessly through the window while a gremlin tears the plane apart .

`` It taps into that universal thought of ` if God intended us to fly , we would have wings , ' '' the `` Star Trek '' star told Business Jet Traveler . `` A lot of people getting on an airplane to this day still ca n't figure out why it flies . ''

Window psychology factored into Boeing 's new 787 Dreamliner , says John Barratt , CEO of the Teague design firm . Barratt told Fortune magazine that designers wanted to `` bring some romance back '' to air travel by reconnecting passengers `` to actually flying . '' Result : bigger windows .

Dreamliner windows measure 19 inches tall , 65 % larger than the industry standard , according to Boeing . The cool factor on these portals is high : a gel inside the glass allows passengers to brighten or darken the outside sunlight with the touch of a button .

Finally , a word of advice from award-winning travel blogger Geraldine DeRuiter of Everywhereist.com : Do n't be the `` inconsiderate window seat guy . ''

If sunlight is burning through your window when many passengers are trying to sleep , please shut your shade .

Otherwise , DeRuiter writes , you 'll be called out as `` heinous and rotten and selfish . ''

And you do n't want that -- no matter how amazing your view is .
