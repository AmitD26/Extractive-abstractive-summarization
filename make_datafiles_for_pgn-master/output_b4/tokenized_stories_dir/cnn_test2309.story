I 've been here 10 days now , and spent last weekend on call at ELWA Hospital , the 55-bed facility that SIM runs just outside Monrovia , Liberia 's capital city .

The news here is good -- the Ebola epidemic really seems to be coming to an end . But in the health care setting in particular , its effects will be felt for many months to come .

Many outward changes have been made at ELWA due to the Ebola crisis .

All patients , staff and visitors now enter the hospital compound through a single gate where people must wash their hands with bleach and have their temperatures checked before entry .

Bleach is everywhere throughout the hospital .

Staff members with sprayers wash down the floors multiple times per day . They are on hand after surgeries or other exposures to blood or body fluids to decontaminate staff before they take off their gowns and gloves .

Temporary buildings have been erected to house our outpatient clinic , because our old clinic became part of the Ebola Treatment Unit , ELWA-2 . But for the most part , ELWA Hospital is up and running , and most beds are full .

For me personally , the first week was about confronting the reality of death .

Many patients die in the hospital -- this should not be a surprise , right ?

But emotionally it is a challenge to face mortality so frequently .

We counseled several patients about their metastatic cancer this week , presenting them with the hard information that the cancer had progressed beyond a stage where anything could be done from the medical point of view .

We talk with these patients privately , off the busy ward ; then , along with the hospital 's chaplain , we pray for them if they wish .

The comfort and compassion we offer , along with an honest explanation in plain language , are important hallmarks of the work we do .

Friday , we had a 5-month-old infant arrive from Buchanan , about a three-hour drive down the coast , in very critical condition with pneumonia , sepsis and a distended abdomen . Very few hospitals have opened , so ELWA was the closest one the family could get to .

Sadly , she died about 30 minutes after arriving .

Although we doubted this child had Ebola , we wore protective gear as we tried to revive her and then performed an Ebola test to be sure , which turned out to be negative .

Thinking about the possibility of Ebola is going to be with us for a long time , maybe forever .

Later , we received a woman in her 40s who had been sick for about six months .

She had lost weight and was so weak she was unable to walk . Examination revealed a mass that seemed most consistent with ovarian cancer . She died during the night . We might not have been able to help her if she had come to a hospital sooner , because of the type of cancer she had , but if she had known her condition , her end of life journey might have been different .

We mourn with these families and others who are losing their loved ones not to Ebola virus , but certainly to the greater impact the epidemic has had on the health care system .

The bright spot for the weekend was doing two cesarean sections on Sunday with Rebecca , a Canadian doctor in her first year out of residency .

The first was a patient with a transverse lie -LRB- the baby lying sideways in the womb -RRB- ; the second a woman who had a big baby and not enough space to deliver . Both of these babies came out alive and responded to some basic resuscitation , with crying and healthy color . That was a relief , and was unlike August , when delays in getting to the hospital caused most of our deliveries and C-sections to be stillbirths .

Finally , in the middle of the night I was called to go to the hospital to evaluate a woman who had delivered an hour and a half before . She had suddenly become dizzy and weak and then gone into shock .

By the time I got there , despite IV fluids and oxygen , we had lost her .

This was an unusual case -- one minute she was sitting up playing with her new baby and talking with the staff , and just a few minutes later she was gasping .

She most likely had an amniotic fluid embolism , in which amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream and got into her lungs , a rare and catastrophic event which , even in the developed world , has an 85 % mortality rate as patients quickly go into shock .

All through Monday , my heart was heavy from the losses of the weekend .

I think my co-workers felt the same way . But as we sang hymns and prayed during morning devotions on Tuesday , we experienced a sense of unity and a release of our sadness .

During the song `` I Surrender All , '' the person leading devotions encouraged us to take the challenges we faced and the feelings that overwhelmed us and surrender them to Jesus , who loves us and shares our grief as we do this work in His name .

It was just a relief to lay it all down at the feet of Jesus , restoring my spirit to be ready to care for the next patient who needs our compassion and concern .
