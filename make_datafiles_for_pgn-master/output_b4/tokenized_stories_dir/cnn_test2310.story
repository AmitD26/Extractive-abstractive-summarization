Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Skeletal remains found in a remote area of Malibu Canyon on Monday are those of Mitrice Richardson , a California woman who disappeared last year , Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said Thursday .

Richardson , 24 , was last seen leaving a sheriff 's station in Malibu after being detained by sheriff 's deputies on a citizen 's arrest complaint made by a restaurant manager in September .

`` We have no indication of a homicide at this point , '' Baca said . `` I do n't believe that the remains are capable of telling us a story . ''

The remains , which included a human skull , were found Monday by park rangers searching the area for marijuana groves , said Los Angeles County Sheriff 's spokesman Steve Whitmore .

`` It 's incredibly treacherous terrain , '' Whitmore said of the remote site . `` There is no road , no trail even if you know exactly where you are going . ''

The woman 's father reacted angrily after watching the sheriff 's news conference from the rear of the room .

`` Now you guys are going to see the real Michael Richardson come out , '' Michael Richardson said .

Richardson said he was holding sheriff 's deputies responsible for his daughter 's death , either because of negligence or criminal intent .

`` Why ca n't I speculate ? Maybe the sheriff had something to do with it , '' Richardson told reporters .

Mitrice Richardson was taken to the sheriff 's station after she was unable to pay her $ 89.51 food and drink tab at a Malibu restaurant on the evening of September 16 , 2009 . A restaurant employee told the 911 dispatcher that she was `` sounding crazy . ''

After deputies determined she had no money to pay , the manager lodged a citizen 's arrest complaint against Richardson . Her car was towed , and she was taken to the sheriff 's station .

Richardson was given a court date and released just after midnight , but her car was still impounded with her cell phone inside it , according to an investigation conducted by an independent commission .

`` Based on my daughter 's mental condition that night , she was n't able to fend for herself , '' Richardson said . `` Mel Gibson gets driven to his car , and Charlie Sheen gets taken to his house . ''

Her family has said the college honors graduate and former beauty queen suffered from mental health issues .

`` The deputies acted properly , but properly does n't necessarily mean that we could n't do something more , '' Baca said Thursday .

One change may be in how deputies handle citizen 's arrest complaints from businesses , he said .

`` Is an $ 89 bill enough to take someone into the jail ? There is more than one way to handle a problem , '' Baca said .

Her father wants more than a policy review by the county . Richardson called for a state law named after his daughter to prevent it happening again to someone else .

`` I guarantee you the Mitrice Richardson law will say no one -- man , woman or child -- will be released in Malibu for some predator that wears a five-star badge to attack or do whatever they want . '' he said . Richardson said he was suggesting it might have been the work of `` someone in law enforcement . ''

`` It 's clearly a set up by someone , '' he said .

The independent review released Thursday said Richardson 's mother , Latice Sutton , `` was vacillating on whether to let Ms. Richardson spend the night in jail so that she could learn a lesson ; however , she made it clear if Malibu/Lost Hills personnel were going to release Ms. Richardson that night , Ms. Sutton would travel there to pick her up . ''

Mitrice 's mom angered by leaks

Her mother did not learn she was released until 5:30 a.m. the next day , it said . She then filed a missing persons report , which began the search for Richardson that did not end until this week .
