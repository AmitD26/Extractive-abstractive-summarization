April 13 , 1975 -- one of the darkest dates in Lebanese history . An attack on a busload of Palestinians in Beirut that day sparked a civil war that would rage for 15 years , leaving some 150,000 dead , the capital divided along sectarian lines and sections of the country in ruins .

But ask students in the city today of the significance of the date , and you get mixed responses .

`` I think it was a very important occasion for Lebanon , '' says Noor El-Hoss , a student in West Beirut 's Al Iman School . `` But I do n't know what happened . ''

Explains fellow student Zeina Naous : `` We are studying about ... World War Two . We are not studying about the civil war , or what happened to Lebanon . ''

More than two decades after the end of the country 's civil war , generations of young Lebanese are growing up with little formal education about the conflict .

Home to contesting political groups representing 18 religious communities , Lebanese society contains many deep divisions , and the country 's recent past is widely considered too contentious to examine in depth . To avoid inflaming old hostilities , Lebanese history textbooks stop in 1943 , the year the country gained independence .

`` We have a vacant hole in our history books , '' said independent scholar Dr. Maha Yahya , adding that this absence from the textbooks reflected society 's broader silence regarding the conflict .

`` There 's been no discussion , no writing , '' she added . `` It 's almost as if we wanted to apply to history the amnesty laws that we applied immediately after the civil war , and said ` Nobody is to blame , everybody is equally not responsible for what happened . ' ''

The country 's Minister of Education , Hassan Diab , acknowledges it 's all about politics .

`` After more than 20 years ... the teaching of history in Lebanon remains , as it has always been , subject to the interests of various political groups , '' said Diab .

Others caution that failing to teach younger generations a balanced view of their history could reinforce sectarian divisions .

Yahya said that the absence of a comprehensive , authoritative history of the war left events of the period `` open for interpretation . ''

`` The children turn to their families and to their communities to learn very particular perspectives of this contemporary history , '' she said .

Yahya said that a survey of 3,000 Lebanese 14-year-olds conducted in 2007-8 found that the historical Lebanese figures children most strongly identified with were leaders from their own sectarian background .

`` What we discovered throughout ... the questionnaire is that children tend to learn and directly absorb the values of their parents and their communities . Schools were not places where children went to learn about these things , '' she said .

`` I think this is in part playing a big role in the kind of sectarian division we 're seeing today . ''

Dr. Reina Sarkis , a psychoanalyst and history researcher , agreed . `` They only have the oral history that their parents told them , '' she said . `` You grow up with deep divisions that become even deeper with time . There 's no sense of closure , there 's no coming to terms with your past . ''

The result , she said , was a heightened risk of communities becoming `` stuck in the cycle of violence . '' In this regard , she said , Lebanon remained a society `` without closure . ''

`` This is the repetition ... that you get stuck in when you do n't do your homework , '' she said.Follow the Inside the Middle East team on Twitter : Presenter Rima Maktabi : @rimamaktabi , producer Jon Jensen : @jonjensen , and producer Schams Elwazer @SchamsCNN .
