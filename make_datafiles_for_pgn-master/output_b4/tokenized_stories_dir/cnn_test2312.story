-LRB- CNN -RRB- A deal has been reached for 200 Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces to pass through Turkey to help Syrian Kurdish fighters in the besieged town of Kobani , just over the border in Syria , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday .

The Syrian Kurdish fighters had originally declined the deployment of Peshmerga troops , but Erdogan told reporters in Riga , Latvia , that he 'd learned Wednesday that an agreement for the reinforcement force had been reached .

However , an aide to the minister for Peshmerga in Iraq 's Kurdish Regional Government told CNN that talks are ongoing .

The technical discussions involve four parties -- the United States , Turkey , the Syrian Kurds and the KRG in Iraq -- and decisions on numbers and timing are still a ways off , he said .

The reports on the Peshmerga forces came on the same day that Erdogan accused the United States of arming a group linked with terrorists , according to Anadolu , Turkey 's semiofficial news agency .

Kurdish fighters have been battling alongside Free Syrian Army forces to repel ISIS forces from the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani .

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a London-based monitoring group , said Thursday that ISIS militants have taken control of the western outskirts of the border town .

This means they now surround Kobani from three sides : the east , west and south , it said .

Meanwhile , heavy clashes continue between Kurdish militia groups and ISIS militants in the northern part of Kobani , the group said .

Strong accusation

As the clashes raged in Kobani , Erdogan said the border city , which is under the control of the armed wing of the Democratic Union Party , or PYD , is more important to Turkey than the U.S. because Turkey houses the roughly 200,000 refugees who have fled the fighting there , Anadolu reported .

He asked the U.S. to recognize the `` dilemmas '' there while accusing the country of arming terrorist elements among the Kurdish forces .

`` Kobani is not strategic for the U.S. , '' he said . `` It could be strategic for us only . And also , Turkey is currently accommodating all the civilians fleeing from the town . There are no civilians there . ''

Erdogan went on to say the U.S. was pushing arms to the PYD , which he accused of affiliation with the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , which is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. , Turkey , NATO and others .

`` We had said that there are commanders from the PKK in the ranks of PYD fighting in Syria , '' Erdogan said . `` We had said that any U.S. aid to this group is going to a terrorist organization . ''

Airdropped supplies

There had been hopes that foreign airstrikes and airdropped supplies could help Kurdish fighters turn the tide against the ISIS militants . But the onslaught has continued .

ISIS has said that at least some of the airdropped supplies made it into its fighters ' hands .

One of the 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani on Monday drifted away from its target zone , a U.S. official said . The U.S. military said it went back and blasted it .

But a video posted on social media shows what appears to be an ISIS fighter next to a parachute bundle . He goes on to show what appears to be the contents of the bundle , including crates of hand grenades and mortar rounds .

CNN can not independently confirm whether the items in the video are from a U.S. airdrop , but according to Anadolu , Erdogan said ISIS had seized some of the weapons .

`` The rest , they also were seized by another terrorist organization , the PYD . Turkey did never lean toward such military aid and the U.S. did that despite Turkey , '' the news agency quoted him as saying .

Erdogan further said the Syrian groups that deserve help are the Free Syrian Army and the Peshmerga fighters , the news agency reported .

Fight for strategic hill

A Kurdish fighter and a media activist in Kobani also told CNN that ISIS militants are pushing toward the western outskirts of Kobani after attacking checkpoints manned by the Kurdish People 's Protection Units , or YPG , and the Free Syrian Army .

The attacks forced them to withdraw from the strategic Tall Shair Hill area , they said .

But , they said , neither ISIS nor the YPG is able to control the western outskirts of Kobani as fighting for control of the hill rages .

Clashes also continue between ISIS and YPG fighters on the eastern outskirts of Kobani , leaving at least five Kurdish fighters dead .

ISIS militants were also killed in the clashes , but it was not immediately clear how many .

Earlier this week , U.S. airplanes dropped medical supplies and weapons into Kobani to help the city 's defenders .

Rights group : Syria airstrikes killed 553

Meanwhile , a month of airstrikes in Syria by the U.S.-led coalition -- many targeting ISIS positions around Kobani -- has killed 553 people , according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .

A large majority of those killed were ISIS militants , including foreigners , the group said .

However , at least 32 civilians were also among those killed between the start of the airstrikes on September 23 and October 22 .

They included six children and five women , the group said in a statement Wednesday .

In total , 464 ISIS militants were killed , the Observatory said . The airstrikes also claimed the lives of 57 fighters from al Nusra Front , a rival Islamist group fighting in Syria .

The figures do not include any casualties in neighboring Iraq , where the coalition has also been targeting ISIS forces .
