Kaci Hickox , a nurse placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey , went on CNN on Sunday and criticized the `` knee-jerk reaction by politicians '' to Ebola , saying `` to quarantine someone without a better plan in place , without more forethought , is just preposterous . ''

Hickox , an epidemiologist who was working to help treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone , has tested negative twice for Ebola and does not have symptoms , she said . She is quarantined for 21 days at University Hospital in Newark .

`` This is an extreme that is really unacceptable , and I feel like my basic human rights have been violated , '' Hickox told CNN 's Candy Crowley on `` State of the Union . ''

She described herself as `` physically strong '' but `` emotionally exhausted . ''

`` To put me through this emotional and physical stress is completely unacceptable , '' she said .

She slammed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for describing her as `` obviously ill . ''

`` First of all , I do n't think he 's a doctor ; secondly , he 's never laid eyes on me ; and thirdly , I 've been asymptomatic since I 've been here , '' Hickox told Crowley Sunday .

In a separate interview with CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen , Hickox elaborated on what she thought of Christie 's assessment of her medical condition .

`` I 'm sorry , but that 's just a completely unacceptable statement in my opinion . For -LRB- Christie -RRB- -- a politician who 's trusted and respected -- to make a statement that 's categorically not true is just unacceptable and appalling . ''

What would mandatory quarantines do ?

`` She 's fine . She 's not sick . ''

Hickox told Crowley that mandatory quarantine is `` not a sound public health decision '' and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to Ebola and public safety .

`` For the first 12 hours , I was in shock . Now I 'm angry , '' she added .

On Sunday , Hickox 's lawyers met with Hickox at the hospital , saying they had a 75-minute conversation through a piece of clear plastic while she sat inside the tent .

`` She 's fine . She 's not sick , '' lawyer Steven Hyman said in a sidewalk news conference aired on CNN affiliate WABC . `` She went and did a magnanimous thing and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity , not put in isolation because some political leaders decided it looks good to do that . ''

Lawyer Norman Siegal , former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , said he 'll be filing papers in court for Hickox to have a hearing no later than five days from the start of her confinement .

He said the doctors at the hospital say there 's no medical reason to hold her . The policy Christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad , he said .

`` We need to know what the medical facts are and not rely on politicians who have their own vested interests , '' he said .

In a Sunday evening news conference , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio commented briefly on Hickox 's case , saying that `` what happened to her was inappropriate . ''

`` This hero was treated with disrespect and was not given a clear direction . ''

`` We owe her better than that , and all the people who do this work , better than that , '' he added .

Ebola gets political

` To put me in prison is just inhumane '

Hickox arrived in Newark Liberty Airport on Friday afternoon and after a seven-hour wait at the hospital . She was put in an isolation tent inside University Hospital in Newark . She 's twice tested negative for Ebola , including a test at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta .

Hickox says she has asked repeatedly but has n't been told how long she 'll be held at the hospital .

`` To put me in prison , '' she said , `` is just inhumane . ''

On Sunday night , New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced he was changing the state 's mandatory 21-day quarantine policy for health workers who return from the Ebola zone . People who worked with Ebola patients but do n't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21-day quarantine at home , the governor 's office said .

Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts said late Sunday night : `` The protocol is clear that a New Jersey resident with no symptoms , but who has come into contact with someone with Ebola , such as a health care provider , would be subject to a mandatory quarantine order and quarantined at home . Nonresidents would be transported to their homes if feasible and , if not , quarantined in New Jersey . ''

On Fox News Sunday morning , Christie said he had `` no second thoughts '' about New Jersey 's mandatory quarantine for health care workers .

`` I believe that folks who want to take that step and are willing to volunteer also understand that it 's in their interest and the public health interest to have a 21-day period thereafter if they 've been directly exposed to people with the virus , '' he said .

Christie also told `` Fox News Sunday '' that a voluntary system of quarantine is n't reliable .

`` I do n't believe that when you 're dealing with a serious situation like this that we can count on a voluntary system ; this is the government 's job . ''

At a news conference Saturday , the governor said , `` I 'm sorry if in any way she was inconvenienced , but inconvenience that could occur from having folks that are symptomatic and ill out amongst the public is a much , much greater concern of mine . I hope she recovers quickly . ''

Hickox said she has nothing to recover from . Her temperature is normal , and she feels fine .

`` Everyone keeps asking how I 'm feeling physically and of course I 'm fine physically , but I do n't think most people understand what it 's like to be alone in a tent and decisions are being made that do n't make sense and show no compassion , '' Hickox said , starting to cry .

`` I just feel like fear is winning right now , and when fear wins , everyone loses . ''

Her life in quarantine

She 's not allowed to have her luggage and was given paper scrubs to wear . Hickox said she has no shower , no flushable toilet and the hospital gave her no television or any reading material . Mostly , she says , she stares at the walls .

On Sunday afternoon , the hospital issued an update saying `` the patient has computer access , use of her cell phone , reading material -LRB- magazines , newspaper -RRB- and requested and has received take-out food and drink . ''

Hickox said she 's not allowed to see her lawyer or anyone else .

`` The tent has a window , and doctors talk to me in normal clothes from outside the window , '' she says . `` So if there 's no risk to them talking to me from outside the window , it does n't make any sense that my lawyer would n't be able to do the same . ''

A spokeswoman for the hospital said staff is trying to make Hickox comfortable .

`` While we understand that the required quarantine is an inconvenience , it is our primary goal to make sure the patient is as comfortable as possible . We have given our prompt attention to provide the patient with basic needs and to accommodate additional requests made by the patient , '' said Stacie Newton , spokesperson for University Hospital in Newark .

Would policy discourage health workers ?

Hickox said she worries that her experience will discourage other aid workers from going to West Africa to help quell the Ebola outbreak .

That thought was echoed by Dr. Rick Sacra , an Ebola survivor .

He said he 's afraid some returning healthcare workers will skirt the system and end up not being monitored

`` You might have some renegade workers flying into Toronto and then driving home and so they 're not on anyone 's radar , '' he said . `` If quarantines push people away from transparent , friendly , respectful , dialogue with public health workers , that may increase the risk back home . ''

Hickox said she would welcome Christie to visit her in the hospital .

`` Maybe he could tell me what ` obviously ill ' means . That would be great , '' she said .

She added that she does n't regret her trip to help Ebola patients in Africa .

`` Someone asked me earlier would I do this again if I knew what would happen , and my answer is categorically yes , '' she said . `` I feel incredibly privileged to be able to do this work . ''

After hearing Hickox 's phone interview with Candy Crowley on Sunday , New Jersey Health officials emailed CNN 's `` State of the Union '' to refute some of the claims made by Hickox .

In the email , Donna Leusner , communications director for the New Jersey Department of Health , wrote that Hickox did receive reading materials and got computer access .

Leusner also wrote that `` the patient was given a copy of the quarantine order on Friday and is receiving regular updated information . ''
