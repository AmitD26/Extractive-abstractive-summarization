-LRB- CNN -RRB- Colombian beauty queen Paulina Vega may soon have a new role : peace negotiator .

The newly-crowned Miss Universe got an invitation Saturday from Colombia 's leftist FARC rebels to attend their peace talks with the government .

Rebels took her up on an offer she 's made in the past that she 's willing to attend the negotiations in Cuba .

`` We have read with interest about your desire to contribute your services to achieve peace and reconciliation between Colombians , '' FARC said in a statement on its website .

`` We salute your willingness to travel to Havana at the same time that we invite you to make the trip to exhibit the development of the process of talks . ''

Vega , 22 , a business administration major at a Bogota university , was crowned Miss Universe in Miami last month . Though the native of Barranquilla has not responded to the offer , the rebels emphasized that her input is important .

`` Rest assured that there is complete willingness to respond to your concerns and to value your opinions as a valuable contribution to peace , '' the statement said .

The talks are crucial to helping end 50 years of fighting between FARC and the government . Negotiations between the two sides have stalled several times over the years , and the group has been accused of bombings , murder , extortion and kidnappings .

FARC started as an insurgency in 1964 and continues to champion leftist causes . But with Colombia being one of the world 's top cocaine producers , the rebels have added drug trafficking to their list of atrocities .

The group is estimated to make $ 500 million from the illicit trade per year , according to the Council on Foreign Relations .

The United States and the European Union consider FARC a terrorist organization .
