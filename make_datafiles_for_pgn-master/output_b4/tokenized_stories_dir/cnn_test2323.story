It lasted 23 matches and 102 days but Chelsea 's unbeaten run is over .

The English Premier League leaders were handed their first defeat of the season by Newcastle United .

`` Super Sub '' Papiss Cisse came off the bench to score twice in the second half , first tapping in Sammy Aemobi 's cross and then finishing off Moussa Sissoko 's effort .

Newcastle held on to a satisfying 2-1 home win despite seeing Stephen Taylor sent off for a second bookable offense and a late header from Chelsea striker Didier Droga .

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho might also be seeing red after his side 's first Premier League defeat in 265 days .

The Portuguese maestro has never won a league match at St James ' Park during his two spells in charge of the west London club .

Manchester City ticked off a 1-0 victory over Everton to close to within three points of league leaders Chelsea with 15 matches played .

Yaya Toure rammed home a penalty early in the first half after James Milner had been toppled by Phil Jagielka .

There was a bitter note to City 's win after the league 's top striker Sergio Aguero left the field in a distressed state with a suspected left knee injury .

Elsewhere in the Premier League there were big wins for QPR , who beat Burnley 2-0 , and Stoke , who shocked Arsenal 3-2 .

Who 's invincible in Europe ?

Until Saturday 's knockout blow at Newcastle , Chelsea had been included in a select band of European sides to make a flawless start to their league campaigns .

German champions Bayern Munich remain unbowed in the Bundesliga , Paris St Germain are unbeaten in Ligue 1 while , in Portugal , FC Porto are yet to be defeated in Primeria Liga .

Bayern hold a seven-point league lead after a 1-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen .

The manager of second-placed Wolfsburg ruefully commented Saturday : `` Bayern are the superior team and they 'd need to play with seven men each week for us to have a chance to catch them . ''

But PSG are the only team who can lay claim to being a true `` European Invincible . ''

The French champions remain unbeaten in all competitions -- including the Champions League - after a 2-1 victory over Nantes , Saturday .

Swedish star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice on his return to the side , helping the Parisians eclipse Marseilles at the top of the table .
