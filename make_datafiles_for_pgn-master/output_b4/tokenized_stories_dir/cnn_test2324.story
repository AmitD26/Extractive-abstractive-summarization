It used to be as simple as folding a piece of paper up your sleeve or writing on the inside of your wrist . But now , as students across the world ready themselves for exam season , cheating is going high tech .

With smartwatches , smartpens and Google glasses now on the market , the modern pupil has an array of gadgets to trick the sharpest pair of eyes .

Educators now need to spot -- not just keep up with -- the latest tech inventions .

`` I do think wearable technology is going to be an issue , '' Larry Rosen , psychology professor at California State University , told CNN . The Educational Testing Service , or ETS , is likely to be `` grappling with this for the SAT , GRE and other standardized exams that they administer , '' he said .

There are `` unanticipated consequences '' of rules that lag behind technology , Rosen added .

Governments are starting to respond to the high-tech threat , according to the UK Department For Education . Schools are expected to take `` appropriate action '' on cheating , it said in a statement , and report the incident to the exam boards .

The invisible threat

But some devices are near impossible to see -- such as the so-called `` invisible '' Bluetooth earpieces .

They work with a tiny microphone , which is synced to a Bluetooth cell phone . They can enable questions , whispered from exam rooms , to be answered from someone outside the room .

Taylor Ellis , associate dean at the University of Central Florida , heads its testing center and is familiar with the tactic .

Examiners are trained to look for suspicious behavior and `` if we observe a student waving their pen in front of the computer , or if I see them waving their wrist close to it , these are all signs that they 're probably taking a photo of the screen , '' Ellis said . `` That 's when we intervene . ''

The center is equipped with cameras so , once the exam is over , Ellis can review the footage to pick up any suspect activity he may have missed . `` I tell my staff we ca n't stop cheating , but I will find out about it . ''

China shows way to future

China has been at the forefront of the tech cheating crackdown .

Its schools and universities have been using technology to combat high-tech cheating for over a year . Among other anti-cheating tactics , staff members monitor radio signals and check students with scanners .

Such advanced technology could , some argue , make teachers redundant . `` It 's hard to find a teacher who 's up on what 's happening in the tech world , '' digital media consultant Shelly Palmer said . `` They do n't know about the latest wearable technology , you only see that in medical schools or in a research lab . ''

Palmer told CNN a complete overhaul of the education system was needed . Factoids and long division is a wasted skill in today 's society because in the future , a child will never be without a computer , he said .

`` There was a time when you had to build a house and you needed the tools to do that , but most of us no longer translate mechanical energy into wealth , we do n't plough the fields , '' Palmer added .

Palmer said children would be better served by learning with such high-tech tools , rather than being separated from them . These days , it 's `` intellectual property '' that is translated into wealth , he said .
