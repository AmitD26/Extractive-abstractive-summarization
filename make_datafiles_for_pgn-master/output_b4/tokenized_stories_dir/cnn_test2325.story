-LRB- CNN -RRB- Grand jury proceedings are secret , and when no indictment is handed down -- as was the case for Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson -- the files remain locked up .

But in an unusual step after a grand jury deliberation , transcripts of testimony that jurors heard considering Michael Brown 's death have been released to the public .

Late Monday night , officials made available 24 volumes of material , covering 23 meetings that the grand jury held between August 20 and November 21 .

A CNN team is going through all of the court documents . Here 's what has emerged so far from that review :

Wilson had never fired his gun on duty before shooting Michael Brown , he told the grand jury .

Asked if he had ever used excessive force before , he replied : `` I 've never used my weapon before . ''

Wilson called the area where Brown was shot a `` hostile environment . ''

`` There 's a lot of gangs that reside or associate with that area . There 's a lot of violence in that area , there 's a lot of gun activity , drug activity , it is just not a very well-liked community . That community does n't like the police . ''

What 's next for Officer Wilson ?

Wilson told the grand jury his original goal was to arrest Brown , after identifying him as a possible suspect in a shop theft .

`` My main goal was to keep eyes on him and just to keep him contained until I had people coming there , '' he testified .

`` I knew I had already called for backup and I knew they were already in the area for the stealing that was originally reported . So I thought if I can buy 30 seconds of time , that was my original goal when I tried to get him to come to the car . If I could buy 30 seconds of time , someone else will be here , we can make the arrest , nothing happens , we are all good . And it did n't happen that way . ''

Wilson told the grand jury he did n't normally carry a stun gun .

`` We only have a select amount . Usually there is one available , but I usually elect not to carry one . It is not the most comfortable thing . They are very large . I do n't have a lot of room in the front for it to be positioned , '' he told the grand jury .

The officer testified he was carrying mace when he encountered Brown .

Officer Wilson told the grand jury that Brown punched him in the face when the officer drove back to him .

Wilson said he tried to get out of his cruiser but Brown slammed the door shut twice and hit him with his fist .

`` I felt that another of those punches in my face could knock me out or worse ... I 've already taken two to the face and I did n't think I would , the third one could be fatal if he hit me right , '' Wilson said .

Twelve shots were fired by Wilson . Wilson said two shots were fired during a struggle at his police vehicle and that he then fired three bursts of gunfire as he chased and then backed away from Brown . He testified that his Sig Sauer .40 caliber gun held a maximum of 13 bullets .

Twelve casings were recovered and one bullet remained in the weapon , according to the grand jury documents .

How prosecutor defended grand jury 's decision

Wilson testified he shot at Brown on the street when Brown turned on him .

`` As he is coming towards me , I tell , keep telling him to get on the ground , he does n't . I shoot a series of shots . I do n't know how many I shot , I just know I shot it , '' he said .

`` I know I missed a couple , I do n't know how many , but I know I hit him at least once because I saw his body kind of jerk , '' he said .

Wilson testified that Brown did not slow down .

`` At this point I start backpedaling and again , I tell him get on the ground , get on the ground , he does n't . I shoot another round of shots , '' he said .

`` Again , I do n't recall how many him every time . I know at least once because he flinched again . At this point it looked like he was almost bulking up to run through the shots , like it was making him mad that I 'm shooting at him .

`` And the face that he had was looking straight through me , like I was n't even there , I was n't even anything in his way . ''

He told the jurors he thought Brown was going to tackle him .

`` Just coming straight at me like he was going to run right through me . And when he gets about that 8 to 10 feet away , I look down , I remember looking at my sites and firing , all I see is his head and that 's what I shot .

`` I do n't know how many , I know at least once because I saw the last one go into him . And then when it went into him , the demeanor on his face went blank , the aggression was gone , it was gone , I mean , I knew he stopped , the threat was stopped .

`` When he fell , he fell on his face . ''

Brown put his hand under his shirt into his waistband when he ran at Wilson , Wilson told the grand jury .

`` He turns , and when he looked at me , he made like a grunting , like aggravated sound and he starts , he turns and he 's coming back towards me , '' Wilson said .

`` His first step is coming towards me , he kind of does like a stutter step to start running . When he does that , his left hand goes in a fist and goes to his side , his right one goes under his shirt in his waistband and he starts running at me . ''

Wilson was diagnosed with a bruised face after his confrontation with Brown , according to a medical report dated the day of the killing , August 9 , 2014 .

No other injuries were mentioned in the report . He was prescribed Naprosyn , an anti-inflammatory medicine commonly used to treat pain .

The medical investigator did not take photographs at the scene of Brown 's killing because the camera battery had died , the grand jury heard .

The investigator , who goes to the crime scene to collect evidence for the pathologist , also did not take measurements of anything at the scene because they `` did n't need to . ''

The investigator , whose name was redacted , said : `` It was self-explanatory what happened . Somebody shot somebody . There was no question as to any distances or anything of that nature at the time I was there . ''

Typically , a medical investigator will take crime scene photos in addition to the ones taken by police investigators .

The investigator testified that they did not see evidence of `` stippling '' -LRB- gunpowder -RRB- around the wounds on Brown 's body .
