-LRB- CNN -RRB- Iran blasted its mock-up of a U.S. aircraft carrier during naval drills on Wednesday , swarming the target with 100 speedboats armed with rockets , shoulder-launched missiles and mortars as well as striking it with cruise missiles , according to reports from Iran 's semi-official Fars News Agency .

Iran said the aircraft carrier target was a full-size replica of the USS Nimitz .

`` Iranian naval forces displayed their skills in targeting enemy vessels and destroyed a mock U.S. aircraft carrier during the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps Navy 's massive Payambar-e Azam 9 -LRB- The Great Prophet 9 -RRB- wargames in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz , '' read a video caption on Fars ' website .

When U.S. officials first learned of the existence of the mock carrier last year , one described it as more akin to a Hollywood set than an actual warship .

But the symbolism is clear . Nimitz-class carriers are the centerpiece of U.S. naval forces , and the largest warships in the world .

Mine-laying exercises were also part of the war games , according to the Fars report .

Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi , commander of the Iranian naval forces , described that portion of the games as `` the most important concern of the Americans . ''

`` We have the most advanced sea mines which can not be imagined by the Americans , '' he is quoted as saying in the Fars report .

Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami , lieutenant commander of the Revolutionary Guard , said Iran was n't showing off all its capabilities during the games , according to a Fars report .

`` We have capabilities which will remain covert and hidden before being used in action and we will merely use them in the battlefield , '' Salami said in the report .

A U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain told the Associated Press that the United States `` was not concerned about this exercise . ''

`` We 're quite confident of our naval forces ' ability to defend themselves , '' Cmdr. Kevin Stephens said .
