Pretoria , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- South African track star Oscar Pistorius , charged with murder in the shooting death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp , is once more allowed to travel overseas after a judge lifted a bail condition Thursday restricting his movements .

Judge Bert Bam said that Pistorius ' passport could be held by his attorney , Barry Roux , instead of the court and that he was entitled to use it to travel outside South Africa .

Bam said he saw no reason why Pistorius `` should be forbidden to leave South Africa if invited to compete overseas . ''

Pistorius should report his itinerary a week before leaving and hand his travel documents back over to his lawyer within 24 hours of returning to South Africa , Bam said at Pretoria 's North Gauteng High Court .

Pistorius not suicidal , family says

The athlete may also now drink alcohol and return home to the scene of the crime , he ruled .

Bam said the magistrate who imposed the original bail restrictions last month had not included the prohibition on Pistorius returning to his home or a requirement that he report to a police station twice a week in the written court order he signed .

This means those provisions , which the magistrate only mentioned verbally in court , should be ignored , Bam said .

The new order represents a victory for the athlete 's legal team , which went to court to request more lenient terms for his bail .

Not everyone surprised about Pistorius ' fall from grace

The lifting of the travel ban could mean that the Olympic and Paralympic sprinter would return to international competition ahead of his trial .

If Pistorius qualifies for the Moscow World Championships in August , `` then on the basis of the ` innocent until proven guilty ' principle , he would be free to run , '' Yannis Nikolaou , communications manager for the International Association of Athletics Federations , told CNN via e-mail .

Invitations are at the discretion of meeting organizers , not the IAAF , he said . The IAAF will not comment on the case against Pistorius , he added .

Premeditated murder charge

The athlete 's lawyers argued in their appeal filing that since Pistorius was not considered a flight risk , the restrictions on his travel were unnecessary .

They also argued that since alcohol and substance abuse were not factors in the case , the ban on their use was not warranted . Pistorius had no desire to use alcohol or illegal drugs , they added .

Authorities charged Pistorius with premeditated murder after he shot Steenkamp in the bathroom of his Pretoria home on February 14 .

Pistorius , who spent eight days in jail before being freed on bail on February 22 , did not attend Thursday 's hearing .

State prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the court Thursday that he plans to serve Pistorius with an indictment on June 4 .

No trial date has yet been set .

Pistorius , known as the `` Blade Runner '' for competing on carbon fiber blades fitted to the stumps of his amputated legs , says he thought Steenkamp was an intruder .

Prosecutors argue that he intentionally killed her after a loud argument .
