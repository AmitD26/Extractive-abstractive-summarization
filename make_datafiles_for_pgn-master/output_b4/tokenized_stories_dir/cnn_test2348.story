Islamabad -LRB- CNN -RRB- Pakistan has ordered a stay of execution of a man who was convicted of manslaughter while he was 14 years old .

Shafqat Hussain , 24 , was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday , but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours .

`` We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours , '' said Shahab Siddiqui , Hussain 's lawyer . `` We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need . ''

Hussain 's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners , who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police .

His family says Hussain , at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004 . Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer , whom , according to human rights groups , failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile .

This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court .

A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case .

Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed , Manzoor Hussain , his brother told CNN . `` He had said that if I do n't get justice in this world , I will get it in my afterlife . ''

`` I ca n't tell you what kind of night my family has had . I close my eyes and I want to forget . I ca n't express the agony we have gone through , waiting and not knowing . ''

Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19 , but under international pressure , Pakistan 's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order .

Addressing parliament , the minister called for an investigation into the young man 's age .

Two months later , another death warrant was issued for Hussain , with an execution date set for March 19 .

Since then Hussain 's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president 's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest .

Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts .

Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar , which left at least 145 teachers and students dead . It was the deadliest act of terror in the country 's history .

The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row , the largest number in the world .

The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad .

`` It 's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves , '' Zohra Yusuf , the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN . `` Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society . ''

Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to `` reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations , in particular the principle of fair trial . ''

The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant `` that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age . ''
