-LRB- CNN -RRB- A Colorado woman whose fetus was cut from her womb in a stabbing attack last week has been released from the hospital , relatives say .

Michelle Wilkins thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes on March 18 in Longmont .

Instead , when she arrived at the purported seller 's home , authorities say , she was attacked , beaten and her fetus was surgically removed . The baby did not survive .

Dynel Lane , 34 , has been held on $ 2 million bond as authorities weigh charges against the former nurse aide .

While the attack on Wilkins has shocked her community for its brutality , many have also remarked on the 26-year-old 's strength .

Bleeding and stunned in a stranger 's basement , Wilkins managed to lock herself in a room to prevent any further violence , called 911 and did what she could to stem the bleeding .

Police officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski , who responded to the call , told CNN affiliate KDVR they were n't prepared for the grisly scene .

`` She was covered from head to toe in blood , '' Sawyer said .

Piotrowski told the station that Wilkins `` saved her own life , '' describing her as '' probably one of the strongest people I 've ever had the pleasure to meet . ''

Wilkins is now out of the hospital , according to a family statement posted on their GoFundMe page , and she 's `` in a safe location '' and `` surrounded by family and friends . ''

More than $ 65,000 has been raised so far .
