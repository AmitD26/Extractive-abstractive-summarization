-LRB- CNN -RRB- Dynel Lane , a former nurse 's aide accused of stabbing a pregnant Colorado woman , was charged Friday with criminal attempt to commit first-degree murder , unlawful termination of pregnancy , and other crimes for allegedly cutting a fetus from the womb .

Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law , and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus did n't show any signs of life outside the womb , Garnett said .

The victim , Michelle Wilkins , 26 , who was seven months ' pregnant , survived this month 's attack , which occurred when she went to a Longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on Craigslist .

`` Now , I understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows I 've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges , '' Garnett told reporters .

`` However , that is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth . A prosecutor can not file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother . For similar reasons , I can not bring charges of child abuse resulting in death , '' the district attorney said .

The fetus ' lungs never inflated , Garnett said . The fetus ' exact cause of death , however , is n't immediately known and is expected to be revealed when the final autopsy report is released in six to eight weeks , he said .

Wilkins and her partner , identified only as Dan , named the female fetus Aurora , the prosecutor said .

Lane , 34 , appeared briefly in a holding room during an initial court appearance Friday , but she did n't enter the courtroom . Her attorneys waived a formal reading of charges at the hearing , which occurred before the prosecutor 's press conference .

`` She could get a long sentence and very well could die in prison , '' the district attorney said about Lane , adding he could n't immediately calculate the maximum number of years she faces if convicted of all counts .

Lane was also charged with two counts of crime of violence , two counts of first-degree assault , and two counts of second-degree assault , Garnett said .

Lane 's next court date , a preliminary hearing , is May 5 . She is being held on a $ 2 million bond .

Earlier Friday , the Boulder County Coroner 's Office said the fetus was n't alive on its own after it was cut from Wilkins ' womb .

The female fetus did n't exhibit `` any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth , '' Coroner Emma R. Hall said in a statement .

Friday 's finding came a day after prosecutors indicated that Lane would n't face a murder charge in the March 18 assault .

Wilkins was released from the hospital on Thursday , relatives said .

The coroner 's office performed an autopsy on the fetus and said Wilkins was 34 weeks pregnant .

`` An autopsy has been completed , '' Hall said . `` At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb , therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth . No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body .

`` Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete , '' Hall said .

The coroner 's finding apparently contradicts earlier claims made in police reports that the fetus `` gasped '' and that emergency room personnel described the fetus as viable .

David Ridley , the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane , told police he found his wife `` covered in blood '' in the family home and later found `` a small baby lying in the bathtub , '' a Longmont police report said .

`` He rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath , '' the report said .

Ridley took the baby and his wife to the emergency room of Longmont United Hospital , and the hospital told police the baby `` would have been viable , '' the police report said .

But on Friday , District Attorney Garnett said that Ridley altered his earlier statement to police .

Without referring to Ridley by name , Garnett cited how media accounts took note of the police report and how a `` witness observed Aurora taking a gasping breath . ''

`` However , upon a more thorough examination of this witness by the Longmont Police Department , the witness clarified that Aurora was still and her mouth was open , but she was not breathing , which is consistent with medical evidence from the autopsy , '' Garnett told reporters .
