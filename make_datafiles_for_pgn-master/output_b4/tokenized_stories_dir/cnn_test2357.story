-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Atlanta Hawks majority owner Bruce Levenson just figured out how to get rid of a product that no one wants to purchase by throwing himself on the confessional table of bigotry -- which will probably make him more wealthy than he could have ever imagined .

Sure , the publicity is n't flattering , and Levenson 's hand may have been forced by the Hawks ' internal investigation .

But this is not about racism , this is about business .

What we know

I 've lived in Atlanta for close to 20 years -- the Hawks games are boring ! I ca n't name the players . I do n't know who they are married to or what they do in the community . They are not a fabric of my interest . I wish they had a star player whose jersey I wanted to buy so I could finally hang my Dominique Wilkins jersey up as memorabilia .

This is not about racism , this is about business .

So , like all other non-Atlanta natives living in Atlanta long term , when the Hawks play the New York Knicks , this native New Yorker whips out her Carmelo Anthony jersey and heads to Phillips Arena . The reason Bruce Levenson could not make the Hawks profitable is not because black people do n't buy season tickets , or arrive at games late , or spend all their time at the bar , or black fathers do n't bring black sons to the games . It 's because the Hawks suck . They have no marquee players and they do n't win games ! -LRB- Yes , they 've made the playoffs in the past seven years , but have n't gotten as far as the conference finals . -RRB-

This is not about racism , this is about business .

The few years that the Hawks have made it to the playoffs , you can hardly make it down Centennial Olympic Drive in time for tip-off because the traffic is so thick . Fans , white and black , show up when their hometown team is winning . Period .

This is not about racism , this is about business .

Opinion : Atlanta Hawks owner is a hypocrite

Are there unique factors to every city that accounts for distinctions between fan bases ? Sure . New Orleans , Memphis , New York and Boston fans show up -- even when their teams are not having a winning season . Those cities are not as transient as Atlanta . That 's something Bruce Levenson fails to realize is unique to Atlanta .

This is not about racism , this is about business .

Bruce Levenson 's 2012 email , in which he shared his ideas about why his franchise was not as profitable as he hoped , as unscientific as it was , can hardly be called shocking or rise to the level of racially polarizing . It was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers , who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in America .

This is not about racism , this is about business .

I was slightly annoyed with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver commending Mr. Levenson for coming forward and self-reporting . Levenson revealed his email of August 2012 to Silver in July 2014 , after the Hawks found it in an internal investigation and precisely the time that investigators for Donald Sterling were looking to expose other NBA owners for any possible racial missteps .

It 's no coincidence that an NBA investigation on this Levenson matter was kept secret and remained pending until the Sterling deal became final . Why are we just now hearing about it ? Silver knew , yet he did n't reveal it to the public .

Racism has never been as profitable in the NBA as it is right now in the wake of the historic $ 2 billion sale of the Clippers , the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league , and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals . Bruce Levenson is a businessman following the business model : Strike while the iron is hot . Buy low . Sell high .

This is not about racism , this is about business .
