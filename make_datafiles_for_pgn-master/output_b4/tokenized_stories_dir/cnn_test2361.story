-LRB- Mental Floss -RRB- -- Starting a legitimate business is hard , boring work . There 's paperwork to fill out , employees to hire , and all sorts of other drudgery , not to mention the biggest hurdle of all : providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay .

President Ulysses S. Grant foiled a gold scam .

In all likelihood , it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets . Or so it would seem .

As many aspiring scam artists quickly learn , when a business scam fails , it tends to fail in rather grand fashion . Just ask any of these four teams of not-so-smooth operators .

A corny sea story

Xenothemis and Hegestratos may not have been the world 's first white-collar criminals , but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence . In 360 B.C. , the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash . Shipping was extremely risky at the time , and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency .

To exploit this uncertainty , Xenothemis and Hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from Syracuse to Athens . Due to the dangers associated with shipping , the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment did n't make it to Athens , so if the boat sank Xenothemis and Hegestratos could keep their cash .

Instead of loading the ship with expensive corn , the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days , then sink it and escape in lifeboats . Since the boat itself was insured , this plot seemed airtight , and the potential profit was great .

Unfortunately , though , the boat 's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship . These passengers were understandably a bit peeved at Hegestratos ' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain . Hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard , at which point he drowned .

Unable to sink the ship by himself , Xenothemis had to sail on to the port , at which point the buyer , Protos , wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty . A legal battle followed , and although the verdict has been lost by history , it 's safe to say that the late Hegestratos regretted the scam .

When Friday went black

Despite his prowess as a general , Ulysses S. Grant 's presidency did n't go so smoothly . Ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869 , when a group of speculators upended the U.S gold market .

The plan started when financier James Fisk and robber baron Jay Gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market , which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price .

Of course , one can only corner the market if there 's a fixed quantity of gold available . Otherwise , the government could just sell large quantities of gold , and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure . In an effort to avoid this fate , Gould and Fisk brought President Grant 's brother-in-law Abel Corbin into their fold .

Using Corbin 's influence to get an audience with the President , the pair would argue to Grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs . The wily pair also used their influence at the White House to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the United States for Daniel Butterfield , who would warn them if the government started to sell gold .

With their connections in place , Fisk and Gould started buying up gold in September 1869 , quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent .

Once Grant and his advisors got wise to the situation , though , the government quickly sold off $ 4 million in gold to break the corner , effectively killing the inflated prices on September 24 .

As investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold , the price plummeted sharply , and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money . Fisk and Gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury , but what would be known as Black Friday did n't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the American economy .

Bad moves

If you 've ever hired movers , you know it can be pretty pricey . Erik Deri , the founder of Woodinville , Washington-based Nationwide Moving Systems , understood that most movers were expensive , so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients . The customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply .

That is , until the price went up . Deri 's movers would load the company 's vans with all of a customer 's worldly belongings , then a foreman would inform the client that they 'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs .

The price hikes were n't small , either ; one man 's estimate stated he could move for $ 3,000 but was later revised to $ 16,000 after loading . According to authorities , if customers balked at these demands , the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street ... and then charge them an unloading fee .

If things got really sticky , Nationwide 's trucks could just take off with all of the clients ' possessions . Deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong-armed customers into forking over the premiums .

In the end , though , Deri learned that you ca n't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it . In 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion . Three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket . Deri was sentenced to seven years in prison , after which he 'll face deportation to his native Israel .

Fools for gold

Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was a small Canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995 . Geologists had discovered gold on a site Bre-X owned near Busang , Indonesia . Not just a little gold , either -- at least 30 million ounces , possibly as much as 200 million ounces . Given the high prices of gold , such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars . Bre-X 's stock price shot through the roof ; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $ 280 Canadian .

In fact , the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like Bre-X could not possibly handle it all without some help . In 1997 , the Indonesian government convinced Bre-X to take on an American firm as a partner to help extract the gold .

When this firm , Freeport-McMoRan , started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence , it reached a confusing conclusion : there was n't any gold in the soil . Subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion . The `` natural '' gold that in the original samples Bre-X had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry .

Although the company 's market cap had climbed to $ 4.4 billion , this report quickly destroyed Bre-X 's value . Share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement , the company was soon removed from the Toronto Stock Exchange and Nasdaq , and Bre-X quickly went bankrupt . Amazingly , no one ended up in jail from this scam , but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on Borneo .
