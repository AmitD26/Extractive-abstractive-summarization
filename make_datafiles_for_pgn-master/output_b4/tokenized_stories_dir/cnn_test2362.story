ATLANTA , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The two men who claimed to have found the carcass of Bigfoot have surfaced to say : Hey , it was just a joke .

Matt Whitton has been fired from his job as a police officer because of his role in the hoax .

Not everyone is laughing .

In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WSB , the two hoaxers -- car salesman Rick Dyer and now-fired police officer Matt Whitton -- said the whole situation began as a joke and then got out of hand .

`` It 's just a big hoax , a big joke , '' Dyer said .

`` It 's Bigfoot , '' Dyer explained . `` Bigfoot does n't exist . ''

Whitton chimed in : `` All this was a big joke . It got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be . '' Watch the two men explain their `` joke '' ''

At a news conference in California last week , the two men had stood by their claims that they had discovered Bigfoot 's corpse and had it on ice . Scientific analysis would prove it , they said .

Not quite .

Now the two Georgia men admit that the hairy , icy blob was an Internet-purchased Sasquatch costume stuffed with possum roadkill and slaughterhouse leftovers .

Whitton and Dyer say that when they came up with the hoax , they had no idea it would become a media circus .

`` It got legs and ran . It 's crazy now , '' Dyer told WSB .

Co-hoaxer Whitton agrees : `` It started off as some YouTube videos and a Web site . We 're all about having fun . ''

`` Fun '' is n't exactly how Clayton County Police Chief Jeff Turner sees it . He has kicked Whitton off the police force .

`` He lied on national TV , '' Turner says of Whitton , `` so a defense attorney now could say , ` How do we know you 're not lying now ? ' ''

Whitton and Dyer had announced that they had found the body of a 7-foot-7-inch , 500-pound half-ape , half-human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June . They also said they had spotted about three similar living creatures .

Still unclear is how much money Whitton and Dyer got out of the hoax .

Steve Kulls , who maintains the SquatchDetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program , first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program . On August 12 , Kulls said , Dyer and Whitton `` requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance , expected from the marketing and promotion . ''

Two days later , after signing a receipt and counting the money , Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the carcass : `` Something appearing large , hairy and frozen in ice , '' Kulls wrote on the Web site .

It was , as many had suspected , an ape-like costume stuffed with entrails .

After the news conference last week , Dyer and Whitton disappeared from view . The truth came out over the weekend .

In a Web posting this week , Kulls wrote that `` action is being instigated against the perpetrators . ''

The two hoaxers have hired attorney Steve Lister to represent them .

`` There have been some threats made to them for both civil and criminal prosecution , '' Lister said .

The attorney says the Bigfoot incident `` got out of hand . ''

Dyer , asked whether he ever thought that the hoopla had become more than just a joke , implied that everyone should have known it was a hoax .

`` Well , we told 10 different stories , '' he said . `` Everyone knew we were lying . ''
