-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Top Democratic lawmakers called Tuesday for high taxes on the controversial AIG bonuses , as new details emerged on who got those bonuses .

Congress is looking at ways to deal with the outrage surrounding AIG 's controversial bonuses .

`` My colleagues and I are sending a letter to -LSB- AIG CEO Edward -RSB- Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell the employees that are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily return them , '' Sen. Charles Schumer said on the Senate floor . `` Because if they do n't , we plan to tax virtually all of -LSB- the money -RSB- ... so it is returned to its rightful owners , the taxpayers . ''

Schumer 's comments came the same day New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo confirmed in a letter to Congress that AIG paid 73 employees bonuses of more than $ 1 million each .

Cuomo also wrote that 11 of the employees no longer work for the company . The largest bonus paid was $ 6.4 million ; seven other people also received more than $ 4 million each .

`` Until we obtain the names of these individuals , it is impossible to determine when and why they left the firm and how it is that they received these payments , '' Cuomo wrote to a congressional committee .

AIG has been under fire for awarding seven-figure bonuses to employees while being kept afloat by more than $ 170 billion from the U.S. government 's financial bailout .

The company insists the payouts are needed to keep talented executives on the payroll , but public anger over the moves has prompted Congress and the Obama administration to seek some ways to reclaim the money . Watch Sen. Schumer vow to recoup the bonuses ''

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on the Senate floor Tuesday that the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee will pursue a legislative fix in such a way that the `` recipients of those bonuses will not be able to keep all their money -- and that 's an understatement . ''

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D-Montana , will propose a special tax within the next 24 hours , Reid said .

`` I do n't think those bonuses should be paid , '' Baucus said Tuesday .

The special-tax idea was first floated Monday by Sen. Chris Dodd , chairman of the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs .

`` We have a right to tax , '' the Connecticut Democrat told CNN . `` You could write a tax provision that 's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses . '' Watch why Americans have a right to be angry ''

At an unrelated hearing Tuesday at which IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman was testifying , Baucus asked the nation 's top tax official , `` What 's the highest excise tax we can impose that 's sustainable in court ? ''

Shulman did not respond directly , but Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Florida , chimed in to suggest the tax could be as high as `` 90 percent . ''

President Obama on Monday expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG .

`` This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed , '' Obama told politicians and reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House , where he and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner were unveiling a package to aid the nation 's small businesses .

Obama said he will attempt to block bonuses for AIG , payments he described as an `` outrage . '' See a snapshot of facts , attitudes and analysis on the recession ''

`` Under these circumstances , it 's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses , much less $ 165 million in extra pay . I mean , how do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat ? ''

Obama was referring to the bonuses paid to traders in AIG 's financial products division , the tiny group of people who crafted complicated deals that contributed to the shaking of the world 's economic foundations . Watch Obama say he 's outraged by bonuses ''

The president said he has asked Geithner to `` pursue every single legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole . '' Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation can not happen again .

The president spared Liddy from criticism , saying he got the job `` after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year . ''

But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics . `` It 's about our fundamental values , '' he said . iReport.com : Sound off on AIG

Under pressure from the Treasury , AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or `` retention payments '' -- by at least 30 percent . That has done little to temper outrage over the initial plan , however .

In the House , Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses . They 're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses , a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday .

The committee is trying to determine whether Congress can force AIG to renegotiate the bonuses , which the company says it is legally required to give employees under contracts negotiated before the company received its first infusion of bailout dollars in September , according to the committee aide . Who 's insured by AIG ? ''

Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses .

Liddy will face intense questioning about the bonuses when he testifies Wednesday before the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets .
