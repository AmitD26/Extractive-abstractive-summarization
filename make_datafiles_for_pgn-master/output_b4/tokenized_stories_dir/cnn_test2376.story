LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Leading British Cabinet minister Jacqui Smith 's political future is in doubt after her husband admitted to paying for adult movies with taxpayers ' money .

Jacqui Smith surrounded by media outside her sister 's home , whom she lives with in London .

The home secretary 's husband , Richard Timney , has apologized for the `` embarrassment '' he caused his wife , while she has promised to repay the money spent , including the £ 10 -LRB- $ 14 -RRB- charge for the two films , the British Press Association reported .

According to British media reports , Smith had not seen the videos and was `` mortified '' that they had `` mistakenly '' been paid for using her MP 's expense account .

Timney , who Smith pays £ 40,000 -LRB- $ 56,000 -RRB- a year to be her office manager , submitted an expense claim last June for a £ 67 -LRB- $ 95 -RRB- Virgin Media bill for television services in the couple 's family home in Redditch , Smith 's constituency , The Guardian newspaper reported .

It reported the bill included two adult films , at a cost of £ 5 -LRB- $ 7 -RRB- each , as well as two viewings of the heist movie `` Ocean 's 13 '' and one of `` Surf 's Up , '' a children 's film about a penguin .

The revelations could not come at a worse time for Smith , who is already being investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over her decision to claim at least £ 116,000 -LRB- $ 164,000 -RRB- in second-home allowances for her family home since becoming an MP .

She has claimed the second-home allowance for her family home while living with her sister in London . Smith designated her sister 's house as her `` main '' residence , allowing her to claim the money for her family home .

Conservative and opposition leader David Cameron described the latest news as `` deeply embarrassing '' for Smith .

He said Smith had `` questions to answer , '' PA reported .

`` I do not think this individual thing is the issue . I think she has got some questions to answer about the second home issue . It does seem to me pretty incredible to claim that the home where her family is , that is not her main home .

`` I think this goes to a deeper problem , which is the second home allowance for MPs . The prime minister has ordered a review but he has sort of kicked it into the long grass .

`` The review does n't start until September , it is not going to report until after the next election . That is hopeless . We have got to get on with it . ''

Prime Minister Gordon Brown defended Smith .

`` The home secretary is doing a great job and I do not think this issue should be allowed to detract from everything she is doing to ensure we protect the public and keep our neighborhoods safe , '' he said .

`` She has done the right thing by taking steps to rectify the mistake that was made as soon as she became aware of it .

`` This is very much a personal matter for Jacqui . She has made her apology , her husband has made clear that he has apologized . ''

Last week Brown ordered a review of the complex and opaque system of MPs ' pay and allowances .

Do you think Smith should resign ?
