NASHVILLE , Tennessee -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album . He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star .

Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music . His new record is `` Untold Truths . ''

Only in this case , he was a movie star .

Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of `` Untold Truths '' -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway . He was backed by his band , Modern West , which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class . The three have been making music on and off since then , with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar . Back in the day , they called themselves Roving Boy .

Truth be told , the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star 's vanity project . It 's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop . Costner sings about freight trains , dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that 's pleasant , if not terribly distinct . In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater , he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen .

At 53 , Costner is the soft-spoken , heroic everyman we 've seen time and again in such movies as `` Dances With Wolves , '' `` The Bodyguard '' and `` Field of Dreams '' -- except today he 's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat . The mission statement from `` Field of Dreams '' seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist : `` If you build it , they will come . ''

Plenty of fans did come to his show that night , but earlier in the day , we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored `` SoundCheck '' session . Listen to Costner kick it with his band ''

CNN : Even though your album , `` Untold Truths , '' is being marketed as a country album , your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country .

Kevin Costner : Yeah . It 's just music .

CNN : What made you decide to put out an album ?

Costner : My wife said , `` Look , you are the happiest by far when you are making music . Why do n't you keep on making music ? ''

CNN : People may not know this , but you 've been making music for a long time .

Costner : Yeah , for a long time . I have been doing a lot of things for a long time . -LRB- chuckles -RRB- It 's not like we called up and said , `` Hey , we have a garage band . Can we show up ? '' We have been working really hard at this for three years . All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it . It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation , people discovering the band .

CNN : When you were talking to the students , you spoke a lot about being fearless .

Costner : Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues , but by their parents . You only get one shot at this life . They can go to college and learn a lot of things , but they should also be encouraged to try things , even if they do n't succeed . I am trying -- even if I do n't succeed . You know , failure is completely underrated in America . -LRB- smiles -RRB-

CNN : With this new project , there 's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter .

Costner : Well , that will happen no matter what I do -- so I 'm not worried about that . I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable .

CNN : And what is that ?

Costner : I do n't know . It 's just a moment when you feel you 've given an honest effort .

CNN : You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie , let alone condensing things into a three-minute song . How do you --

Costner : I do n't have that hard a time !

CNN : Oh , come on !

Costner : I make jokes about it a lot . You know , I make one-hour , 59-minute movies ! But yeah -- telling the story , I do n't believe in some conditional running length . I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically .

CNN : You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago .

Costner : Yeah , a long time ago . Blair -LRB- his bass player -RRB- , the same . Like anybody with good sense , you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you .

CNN : Which is more cutthroat , the movie business or the music business ?

Costner : There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under , and people ducking for exits , pointing fingers . You know , it is a cycle of life . Then someone else will take that spot , some heavy hitter . Maybe it is good to take a lesson . You have to be a little humble because maybe one day , you are not that big , swinging dog you think you are .

CNN : Do you ever feel like that in your own career ?

Costner : Well , I am aware that a career that takes chances is n't always going to ring a bell . It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person , or the number one person , because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with .

CNN : Do you read reviews ?

Costner : No . Sometimes they are read to me . `` Look what he said ! '' I am like , `` Please do n't show me . ''

CNN : Are you planning to make more albums ?

Costner : I will be making more music . We 'll see where it lands . We made a record . We made it as good as we could make it , and now we let it go . And we go and write a better song .

CNN : In the meantime , you have a show to put on .

Costner : There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning , and that is a great feeling . Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them . When you perform , for me , it 's like filling up the gas tank .
