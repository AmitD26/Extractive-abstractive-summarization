MIDDLETOWN , Connecticut -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The suspect in the shooting of a Wesleyan University student is in police custody , police in Meriden , Connecticut , said Thursday .

Police have arrested Stephen Morgan in the shooting death of Johanna Justin-Jinich .

A spokesman in Meriden said Stephen Morgan had been in custody there , but was transferred to police in Middletown , seven miles away . No other details were available .

An arrest warrant was issued earlier for Morgan , charging him with murder in the death of Johanna Justin-Jinich at a Middletown bookstore on Wednesday .

Justin-Jinich was shot Wednesday afternoon at the Red & Black Cafe in Broad Street Books , the campus bookstore , the university said .

She worked at the cafe , the cafe said on its Web site . It said that her killing has left employees `` devastated . ''

Earlier Thursday , a law enforcement source told CNN that police spoke briefly to the suspect after her shooting death .

Morgan was one of several people who gathered Wednesday afternoon outside Broad Street Books after the Wesleyan junior was shot , the source said . He gave his name to investigators who spoke with him , the source said .

At that early stage of the investigation , the source said , police had no reason to suspect Morgan .

Earlier Thursday , Morgan 's sister had urged him to turn himself in to `` avoid any further bloodshed . ''

Diana Morgan told reporters in Marblehead , Massachusetts , that her family was `` shocked and sickened by the tragedy in Middletown . ''

She said her family did not know her brother 's whereabouts , but issued a brief statement to him through the media : `` Steve , turn yourself in right now to any law enforcement agency , wherever you are , to avoid any further bloodshed . We love you , we will support you in every way and we do n't want anyone else to get hurt . ''

She did not take questions .

Before his arrest , police had been worried that Morgan may be targeting Wesleyan University and the town 's Jewish residents .

A statement from the university alleges that Morgan had written threats against `` Wesleyan and/or its Jewish students '' in his personal journals .

Congregation Adath Israel , Middletown 's lone synagogue , canceled all activities for the next day , said its president , Eliot Meadow .

He said police told him that they do not think Morgan is part of a larger anti-Semitic organization .

About 200 families attend the synagogue , Meadow said , and he added that Wesleyan , a private university with about 3,000 students , has a substantial Jewish population .

While Justin-Jinich was a student at Wesleyan and was Jewish , according to the Middletown mayor , there was another connection between her and her alleged killer , authorities said . Watch how suspect and victim knew each other ''

In July 2007 , the young woman filed a harassment complaint against Morgan while the two were taking the same six-week summer course at New York University , school spokesman John Beckman told CNN .

The complaint , in which Justin-Jinich said she was receiving harassing e-mails and phone calls from Morgan , was filed with the university 's public safety department toward the end of the course , Beckman said .

The public safety department brought in the New York Police Department and after conversations with Morgan and Justin-Jinich , the young woman declined to follow up or press charges , Beckman said .

Beckman said the two were not living in the same student residence house during the course . Additional details were not immediately available .

Another law enforcement source also told CNN that in an excerpt from one of the e-mails sent to Justin-Jinich , Morgan wrote , `` You 're going to have a lot more problems down the road if you ca n't take any -LRB- expletive -RRB- criticism , Johanna . '' Watch the crime described as ` every parent 's nightmare ' ''

Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano said the connection between Morgan and Justin-Jinich may `` go back to Colorado . '' No further details were available .
