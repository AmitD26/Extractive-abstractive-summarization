JOHANNESBURG , South Africa -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Police armed with rubber bullets were patrolling neighborhoods in Johannesburg on Tuesday in an effort to quell a recent spree of violence aimed at foreigners that police say has killed 22 people and displaced an estimated 13,000 .

A crowd armed with clubs , machetes and axes rioted on the outskirts of Johannesburg on Tuesday .

Many of the victims are Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances in their homeland .

Evidence of the violence was seen in smoke rising from burned homes in one Johannesburg neighborhood . Locals angry about the rising number of foreigners arriving in South Africa had set homes ablaze .

Firefighters said they had fought more than 100 such blazes since Thursday .

Standing outside a row of charred homes , Diamond Minnaar said there is a solution for foreigners .

`` Most of them just have to go back to their country and leave us in peace , '' Minnaar said . `` That is the only solution . Or they are just going to get killed . Look at how many shacks have burnt down . ''

The attacks and looting have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders . iReport.com : Are you there ? Send photos , video

The violence began a week ago in Johannesburg 's Alexandra Township , police say , and has been concentrated in the city 's poorest areas .

`` People are angry because they are unemployed , poverty-affected people struggling for basic needs every day , '' said Dean Christopher Barends , a local Lutheran minister . `` This will explode into something . ''

One person victimized was Pascoal Sendela Gulane , a Mozambican man , who said gangs broke into his home and stole his belongings .

He fled to a church with his family and is now living with his children in his car on the church 's property . For him and many others , churches and police stations have become safe havens . Watch footage of the attacks ''

On Monday , South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an end to the violence .

`` We dehumanize ourselves the moment we start thinking of another person as less human than we are simply because they come from another country '' he said in a statement .

`` As South Africans , we must recognize and fully appreciate that we are bound together with other Africans by history , culture , economics and , above all , by destiny . I call upon those behind these shameful and criminal acts to stop ! Nothing can justify it . ''

He has called for an investigation into the violence .

Also Monday , the Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the `` senseless violence . ''

South African police have arrested more than 200 people in connection with the violence for offenses including rape , murder , robbery and theft .

Police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said that at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend , while others saw their houses torched , their shops looted and their possessions stolen .

Tuesday there was a large police presence in the neighborhoods were the violence had occurred , according to a CNN producer on the scene .

Despite the police presence , sporadic looting still took place in several townships east of Johannesburg .

Mbuso Mthembu , provincial manager at the Red Cross office in Johannesburg , said that the number of people fleeing is continuing to grow and that violent attacks seem to be spreading into other areas .

His organization has made an emergency appeal for people to donate 1 million rand -LRB- about $ 135,000 -RRB- to help support the estimated 13,000 who have fled their homes . Many had to flee quickly , leaving all their belongings behind , Mthembu said .

`` We have delivered blankets , kids clothing , baby formula , '' he said . `` But we need more . ''
