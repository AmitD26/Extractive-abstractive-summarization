MEXICO CITY , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon met with the country 's 32 governors Thursday to create a plan to combat the nation 's staggering rise in crime and kidnappings .

Mexican President Felipe Calderon has noted that kidnappings have reached an alarming level .

In a heavily guarded meeting at Mexico 's National Palace , the leaders devised a plan that detailed 65 specific actions to could be taken in the next several months .

Those actions are aimed at helping families like that of prominent businessman Alejandro Marti . He told the group that the new focus on kidnapping has come too late for his 14-year-old son , Fernando .

Fernando was grabbed from a car on a busy street at a fake police checkpoint this year . The next day , his chauffeur and bodyguard were found bound and strangled in the trunk of a car .

Next to their bodies , police found a yellow chrysanthemum , a calling card from a gang that calls itself the Band of Flowers .

Some investigators believed the flower was a coded message to police telling them not to investigate too closely , that the kidnappers were police , also .

In July , Fernando 's decomposed and bullet-ridden body was found stuffed in the trunk of a car .

At least one police officer and one civilian have been taken into custody , accused of involvement in the kidnapping and killing , police and Alejandro Marti said .

Marti told the group of leaders to do a better job to protect other children like his son .

`` There are university students who could do their jobs better than you can , '' Marti scolded the group .

To address the crime increase , Mexican leaders called Thursday for building special prisons exclusively for kidnappers , bolstering the justice system , cleaning up corrupt police forces , clamping down on kidnapping tools such as prepaid cell phones and money laundering .

Calderon noted at the meeting that kidnappings had reached an alarming level .

`` The truth is we are all responsible , '' Calderon told the group . `` We must recognize the traditional way of combating crime has not been sufficient . We must act in a more coordinated and vigorous manner . ''

According to official figures , there have been 314 kidnapping in Mexico this year . The numbers topped 700 in 2007 . Authorities say the real figures may be even greater because victims often do n't report crimes to a police force they do n't trust . Experts say the rise is also a result of a perception sense that crimes go unpunished .

Non-governmental groups estimate that there have been more than 1,500 killings in Mexico this year linked to organized crime .

The group of leaders pledged to implement changes within the next three months .

Activists said they hoped the one-day crime summit does not end up becoming just a photo-op .
