Editor 's note : The author has ridden motorcycles more than 125,000 miles since 1999 , including solo trips from Georgia to California and Canada . She takes us inside the world of motorcycle travel .

Bikers approach Mount Mitchell , North Carolina , during a road trip through the Blue Ridge Mountains .

SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK , Virginia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- We were parked at a peaceful , shady overlook beside Virginia 's Skyline Drive , admiring the green mountains and the river far below , when Keith realized he needed a new rear tire , and he needed it now . A bald tire is a serious problem when you 're traveling by motorcycle : We do n't carry spare tires , for obvious reasons , and a blowout on two wheels could be life-threatening .

Keith decided he could make it 100 miles to the Harley-Davidson dealership in Richmond , Virginia , as long as we kept it slow , so our seven bikes headed that way .

It 's been said that a great trip in a car is like watching a first-rate movie -- but a great trip on a motorcycle is like living the movie .

For our road trip , we had chosen an eight-day itinerary from our homes outside Atlanta , Georgia , through the mountains of North Carolina and Virginia , then east to the Atlantic shoreline and south along the coastal islands of the Outer Banks .

The trip offered a spectacular ride up the Blue Ridge Parkway , a winding two-lane that clings to the ridgeline through North Carolina and Virginia . The elevation often reaches 5,000 feet or more , so temperatures were cool despite a heat wave down below . See map ''

Our motorcycle motorcade passed panoramas of blue-tinged mountains and rolling meadows set off by split-rail fences . We motored through dense forests whose overhanging branches turned the road into a cool green tunnel . Rhododendrons and mountain laurels in bloom lined the road .

It all looks better from a motorcycle , because you 're so immersed in it -- not just looking out from inside a cage of steel and glass . In fact , we call cars cages and the people who drive them -- you guessed it -- cagers . See how motorcycle travel differs from car travel ''

The smells were intense : fresh-cut hay , pine trees baking in the sun , honeysuckle -- and sometimes , the not-so-pleasant aroma of ripening roadkill . Songs of determined birds rang out over the rumble of the motors .

Riding a motorcycle on a road like this is a physical pleasure , too , as you lean right , then left , then right , to guide the bike smoothly through the parkway 's sweeping curves . You swoop , you glide -- it 's like dancing , or like those dreams where you 're flying .

In Virginia , Skyline Drive offered an abundance of wildlife . We saw five deer in 40 miles , including a small fawn with its mother -- none of them close enough to threaten a collision , and all of them smart enough to run the other way when they saw us coming .

Finally we arrived at the dealership in Richmond to replace Keith 's balding tire . We knew we 'd be there for a while -- so we made ourselves at home . We ordered pizza to be delivered and Neil brought in his laptop so everyone could upload their snapshots .

It might seem strange for customers to take over a retail establishment , but a Harley dealership always feels like home . There 's a strong sense of community among motorcycle riders -LRB- and by extension , the stores -RRB- .

Almost all riders wave to other riders on the road , whether they 're on Harleys like ours or small , speedy sport bikes or huge , silent Honda Gold Wings .

Bikers fall into conversations with other bikers as if we already know each other because -- in a way -- we do . We 've all experienced the same joys and aggravations -- but it 's mostly joys .

One of those pleasures is how people go out of their way to be helpful or to strike up a conversation with a group of bikers . All kinds of folks wave to us on the road -- from Boy Scouts selling doughnuts on a street corner , to a man walking his dog , to shy-but-fascinated kids in a car stopped next to us at a traffic light .

A couple of hours -LRB- and several hundred dollars -RRB- later , Keith 's tire was replaced and we headed for Elizabeth City , North Carolina . We hit a huge blanket of smoke from a massive wildfire about 40 miles away . The thick , yellowish smoke made the rural landscape look like another planet , with the late-afternoon sun glowing red through the haze .

The next morning , the smoke was gone , and we headed for the Outer Banks and a day of lazy meandering toward Ocracoke , the southernmost town on the string of narrow islands .

We stopped at the Currituck Beach Lighthouse , built in 1875 . The sight of a long line of other tourists persuaded us not to climb its 214 steps .

At the Wright Brothers National Memorial near Kitty Hawk , we checked out the windy dune where aviation began and rode our bikes around a monument to Orville and Wilbur .

We spent the next day in Ocracoke investigating artsy-craftsy shops in the village and stores that sell hokey pirate souvenirs , in honor of the fact that Ocracoke was supposedly a hangout of the legendary pirate known as Blackbeard . We watched descendants of the island 's wild ponies that now live in a fenced-in pasture to safeguard them from traffic .

The final leg of our trip began with a two-hour ferry ride from the island to the mainland .

But we came to a standstill the next day in traffic in Marion , South Carolina -- which was cause for some concern . Most Harley engines are air-cooled , so we ca n't just leave them idling for long periods because they can overheat .

We managed to turn off the highway onto a series of small side roads , where we pulled over to figure out our next move . A mini-van pulled up beside us .

`` Where are y' all trying to go ? '' the passenger asked . `` I-95 , '' we said . `` Come on ! '' she yelled , signaling us to follow . After a few turns , we were on I-95 , waving our thanks to the mini-van .

By the time we reached Georgia , it was obvious there was a thunderstorm between us and home . Despite the 10-minute cloudburst , we were too hot to stop and put on rain suits . We did slow down , since it 's hard to see with rain running down your face shield or glasses .

Soon we went our separate ways toward home . But I would have been ready to leave on another long motorcycle trip the next day , if it were n't for the suitcase full of dirty laundry and the need to deal with real life for a while . The unfiltered sights and smells , the enjoyment of riding , the companionship of other riders , the friendly encounters with strangers -- there 's nothing like it .
