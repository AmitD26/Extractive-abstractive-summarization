`` He is a funny man , a kind man , a bit of a goofball and not very well-spoken , '' Cordsen said . `` But , he would not have been treated the way he is being treated now if not for 9/11 . His presidency was thwarted by the ` evildoers . ' I love that term of his . ''

Chuck Burkhard of Windber , Pennsylvania , hopes history will remember Bush as a strong man who loved his country .

Burkard said the president juggled unprecedented challenges during his term , including dealing with terrorism and facing up to financial forces that may not have been under his control . Critics of Bush should look within themselves for answers , he said . iReport.com : Working overtime

`` Most of us are spoiled by a have-it-our-way-now and reckless generation that must stop borrowing so much and start working more . We shift blame instead of looking to ourselves for resolve and drive . ''

Burkhard said he feels Bush is one of the most overworked presidents in history and has shouldered too much blame for the current state of the economy .

`` I personally have never seen this much responsibility thrown onto our country , in such a small amount of time , '' Burkhard said . `` We are responsible for the world economy , the global war on terror , global warming . You name it , we have our hands in it . ''

Chris Molisani of Rochester , New York , says September 11 was a defining moment , not just for Bush 's presidency , but also in his own life . He was in high school and college during Bush 's eight years in the White House . iReport.com : Look back on how Bush changed the country

He can scarcely remember the Bush presidency before 9/11 and expects phrases such as `` weapons of mass destruction , '' `` Axis of Evil '' and `` You 're either with us or against us '' to be associated permanently with him . He hopes for a brighter future with President-elect Barack Obama .

`` History will likely be kinder to Bush than his contemporaries are , but a Washington , Lincoln or Roosevelt he will not become , '' Molisani said . `` What is interesting to note is that some of the worst presidents in history have been followed by the best presidents . Perhaps we will have a bright future to look forward to . ''

Maria Davis of Prescott Valley , Arizona , voted twice for Bush but now regrets her decision . Her dislike for the Democratic candidates ' running mates in 2000 and 2004 was a major factor , she said . iReport.com : Watch Davis discuss the pros and cons of the president 's time

Although she wants Bush to get out of the national spotlight , she feels he needs to speak to the people and mend wounds . She hopes he will follow Sen. John McCain 's example and make a gracious speech after the inauguration .

`` Speak to the American people passionately and gracefully about Obama taking the presidency , '' Davis said . `` That would probably help people . ''

His presidency was n't all bad , she said .

`` Well , he was good for 9/11 , and he caught Saddam -LSB- Hussein -RSB- , but he ran the country into the ground with unneeded funding for an unneeded war in Iraq , '' she wrote .

Overall , Davis has mixed feelings now and has felt uneasy for a long time . She was laid off from her job and is trying to run a home eBay business that barely pays rent . She is having trouble finding jobs that pay more than $ 7 per hour . Her brother , who has a house payment and a child to support , was recently laid off , as well . She hopes the country can rebuild .

`` It 's hell , it 's absolutely hell , '' she said . `` I really hope Obama can fix the economy so we can have our lives again and live the American dream . ''

The desire to dream again was a common theme , and many iReporters said they yearn for more hopeful times .

Robin Savage of San Juan Capistrano , California , said Bush 's greatest legacy is the passionate voter turnout he unintentionally inspired in the 2008 election . She said she is glad to see Obama 's rise as a result . iReport.com : One last thing before he goes

`` I think the one thing President Bush will be remembered for is not being able to really connect with people . If you compared him to Obama , I tell you , what a difference there is . ''

Patrick Finney of Portland , Oregon , said he felt there was a large disconnect between Bush and the American people . He says the president ignored what ordinary folks wanted .

`` I am afraid that George Bush will be judged harshly by history , '' Finney said . `` I am also afraid that judgment will be deserved . ''

But critics should be careful about taking aim at Bush , warns David P. Kronmiller of Burbank , California .

`` I do not think we should be blaming him for the misery of the last eight years . He is not to blame . We are . You are , the American people . We voted him into office . '' iReport.com : The Bush paradox

Kronmiller says he voted for Bush in 2000 , but not in 2004 , adding that he feels Bush is responsible for day-to-day decisions that placed the country in a state he finds unfortunate .

Jimmy Deol of Toronto , Ontario , Canada , said he believes Bush had good intentions .

`` I think he meant well , '' Deol said . `` I wholeheartedly believe it . In his convictions , he always thought he was doing the right thing . The people elected him . There must have been something people liked . '' iReport.com : Quotes and commentary
