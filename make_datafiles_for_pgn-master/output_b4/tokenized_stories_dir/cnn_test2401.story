-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A man accused of killing eight people in a shooting spree at a North Carolina nursing home is the husband of a woman who worked there , police said Monday .

Robert Stewart faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the nursing home shootings .

The two may have been separated , said Carthage , North Carolina , Police Chief Chris McKenzie . He did not say if the wife was in the building at the time .

The alleged gunman , Robert Stewart , was carrying several weapons , authorities said . Seven patients and a nurse were killed , and three people were wounded , including a visitor and a police officer .

All the wounded are expected to survive , McKenzie said .

Officer Justin Garner was shot in the leg , McKenzie said . `` As I understand , there were three pellets in his shin , leg and foot , '' he said .

Garner entered the Pinelake Health and Rehab Center alone with no backup and brought the shooting spree to an end with a single shot , hitting Stewart in the `` chest , upper torso area , '' McKenzie said .

`` If that 's not heroism , I do n't know what is , '' he said .

Garner is `` in very good spirits , resting at home , '' he added . McKenzie said he did not know the latest on Stewart 's condition .

The alleged gunman 's motive remained a mystery .

Stewart has not made a public statement nor has an attorney on his behalf .

His wife has not issued a statement either .

Meanwhile , his ex-wife , Sue Griffin , told CNN affiliate WTVD-TV in Raleigh-Durham , North Carolina , `` He did have some violent tendencies from time to time . '' She added that when she heard the news of Sunday 's shooting , `` I could n't believe it -- then I stopped , thought about it and thought , ` It is possible . It 's possible . ' ''

At a news conference Monday , McKenzie described the shooting spree as `` unimaginable '' and `` horrific . ''

`` Everything that you can possibly imagine that is bad in the world , '' he said . `` This does n't happen , but it did . '' He described the small town as `` strong , faith-based -- and that faith will get this community through this . ''

The tragedy draws attention to what McKenzie called the toughest part of training police officers .

Officers are told not to wait for backup when there are many lives on the line , he said . `` That 's the hardest thing -- to try to convince them you ca n't wait , you have to go . ''

If Garner had waited for backup , `` there would have been a lot more people -LSB- killed -RSB- , '' McKenzie said .

The slain patients ranged in age from 78 to 98 , Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger said .

A witness told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV in Raleigh-Durham that Stewart was armed with a rifle , a shotgun and other weapons .

Jerry Avant Sr. told WRAL that his son , Jerry Avant , a 39-year-old registered nurse , was the employee who was killed in the shooting . He said a doctor told him that his son had been shot more than two dozen times .

The elder Avant said the doctor told him his son `` undoubtedly saved a lot of lives . '' Watch dad praise his son 's bravery ''

Stewart faces eight counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony assault on a police officer , and other charges are pending , Krueger said .
