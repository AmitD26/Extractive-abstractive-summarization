-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tensions mounted in Paris , Texas , on Tuesday when about 100 mostly black protesters clashed with white supremacist groups in a verbal confrontation over a black man 's death .

White supremacists taunt black protesters who marched Tuesday in Paris , Texas .

The confrontation stems from the 2008 death of 24-year-old African-American Brandon McClelland . After his body was found mangled on the side of a rural road , investigators concluded he was run over , dragged , and killed .

Two white men were initially charged with murder , but the charges were dismissed last month because of a lack of evidence .

Black protesters marched through the town Tuesday , hoisting a flag of red , green and black , the colors associated with African liberation movements . They chanted , `` No justice , no peace . ''

White demonstrators waved a flag emblazoned with a Nazi swastika and taunted the black marchers , shouting through a megaphone : `` White power , white power . '' Watch the confrontation ''

Paris , in northeast Texas , has 25,000 people , 70 percent white and 20 percent black .

No violence or injuries were reported but two white men were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for trying to incite the protesters , Lt. Danny Huff of the Paris Police Department said .

McClelland 's mother , Jacqueline McClelland , told CNN the demonstration was not about race but was aimed at achieving justice for her only child .

`` We come seeking justice , not only for myself , but -LSB- for -RSB- other people who have been done wrong , '' she said . `` I want for everyone to get equal justice .

`` I do n't know the whole story , '' she said . `` I ca n't be at peace until I know what happened to my child . ''
