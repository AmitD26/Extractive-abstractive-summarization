-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Iggy Pop invented punk rock . That 's how cool he is . His songs have been covered by the likes of Guns N ' Roses , REM , The Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Sex Pistols .

Iggy Pop : The wildest man in rock music .

He is the wildest wild man of rock and his four-decade career has been marked by drug addiction , self mutilation and onstage nudity -- and at 61 years old he is showing no signs of growing old gracefully .

Born on April 21 , 1947 , in Muskegon , Michigan , James Newell Osterberg grew up in a trailer park .

When he began learning the drums as a teenager his parents gave up their bedroom to house his drum kit . It was n't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom , playing with high-school band The Iguanas , from which he later took his stage name .

After graduating from high school in 1965 , Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers . Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago , playing drums with local bluesmen , before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band .

In 1967 , he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton , his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges .

It was after seeing the Doors in concert , and inspired by Jim Morrison 's confrontational stage persona , that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop , a drug-fueled , crazed whirling dervish of a front man , who would strut semi-naked around the stage , roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience .

The band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969 . Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop . At the height of flower power , when The Stooges ' contemporaries were singing about peace and love , Iggy was singing `` No Fun '' and `` I Wan na Be Your Dog . '' See photos of Iggy in action . ''

The album was a brilliant mess of raw , blues-influenced garage rock , but it sold poorly , as did the 1970 follow up `` Fun House , '' later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as `` the definitive rock album of America . '' Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami

By this time , Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971 , The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label . That same year , Iggy met David Bowie , who took him to England , re-united The Stooges and produced 1973 's `` Raw Power . ''

With `` Raw Power , '' Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music , an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time . Nonetheless , it was another commercial failure and in 1974 , The Stooges split again .

By this time , Heroin had taken over Iggy 's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit . Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour , before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs .

It was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy 's 1977 solo albums , `` The Idiot '' and `` Lust for Life . '' The latter included the songs `` The Passenger '' and `` Lust for Life , '' which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks , spawning countless cover versions .

More commercial than The Stooges ' records , Iggy 's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales , but never breakthrough into the mainstream . Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums , with `` China Girl '' becoming a hit single for Bowie .

Iggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s , without much commercial success , although the single `` Real Wild Child '' was a hit in the U.S. and UK . But by the end of the decade , Iggy was beginning to be recognized as `` the Godfather of Punk , '' with a new generation of bands citing him as an influence .

Members of Guns N ' Roses and the B52s appeared on his 1990 album `` Brick by Brick , '' which sold more than 500,000 copies , and his 2003 album `` Skull Ring '' featured the likes of Green Day , Sum 41 and Peaches . But what really made `` Skull Ring '' special was that it re-united Iggy with Ron and Scott Asheton of The Stooges .

After years on the periphery , Iggy was suddenly fashionable , with the reformed Stooges appearing at festivals all over the world . The band recorded the album `` The Weirdness '' in 2007 , but it was their astonishingly powerful live performances that showed why they were still such a big deal 40 years after they started out .

Any hopes Iggy may have had for a peaceful retirement in Miami have been dashed . At 61 years old he is still performing with the same energy and abandon as when The Stooges first formed , with only marginally less stage diving and nudity . It seems that the world has finally caught up with Iggy Pop , the most exciting , unpredictable and entertaining man in rock .
