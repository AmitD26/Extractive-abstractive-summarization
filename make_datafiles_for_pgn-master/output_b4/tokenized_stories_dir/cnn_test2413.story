LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The two men running Michael Jackson 's estate gained new powers and an extension of their authority until the end of the year in a court hearing Friday .

An investigator 's report said Michael Jackson 's children are doing well with Katherine Jackson as their guardian .

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff also accepted an investigator 's report that said Jackson 's three children are adjusting well under the guardianship of Katherine Jackson .

`` It looks like the children are really doing wonderfully with their grandmother guardian , '' Beckloff said .

Joe Jackson sat in the courtroom for the hearing on estate and custody matters . It was the first time Michael Jackson 's father has attended the hearings since his son 's June 25 death .

John Branca and John McClain , named as executors of Jackson 's 2002 will , have been handling the estate 's business as temporary special administrators since July while the will probate process is completed .

Branca was a longtime attorney for Michael Jackson , who was rehired by the pop star just a week before his death , according to estate lawyer Howard Weitzman .

McClain is a former music industry executive who worked with Jackson for years .

Katherine Jackson 's challenge of Branca and McClain appears headed for a trial in December , unless an agreement is reached between them . Her lawyers have not publicly given their objections to the two men , but have suggested the trial would explore possible conflicts of interest that would prevent them from running the estate .

Jackson 's lawyers have also said a Jackson family member should be included as an executor .

While Joe Jackson did not speak to reporters after the hearing , a Jackson family friend , Majestik Magnificent , talked about the special administrators .

`` Why are they even here ? Why are they even involved in this ? This is a family affair , '' he said .

Until now , the administrators had to ask for court approval for every agreement they made for the estate , including a deal for a movie that will hit theaters at the end of October .

`` Things went well for the estate , because the estate can now continue to do it 's business , '' Weitzman said after the hearing .

Beckloff said that while the case is fascinating , his calendar is too full for him to be involved in all of the estate 's business . With their new powers , the special administrators only have to notify the court and the Jacksons about deals .

Michael Jackson 's mother and three children , along with unnamed charities , are the beneficiaries of the estate , which is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars .

An odd moment came in the hearing when a woman who has previously filed a papers claiming to be the mother of Michael Jackson 's youngest child , Prince Michael II , spoke up to remind the judge she was there . She says her name is Billie Jean Jackson .

At the end of the hearing , Joe Jackson approached her , but she frowned at him and walked away .

Majestik Magnificent later wondered aloud why reporters even give any attention to `` crazy '' people surrounding the case .
