-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Republican Party that struggled in the wake of recent Democratic landslides sprang back to life Tuesday with wins in hotly contested races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey , according to CNN projections .

In Virginia , 55-year-old former state attorney general Bob McDonnell will be the first Republican to win the state 's highest office in twelve years , CNN projects . Republicans will win races for Virginia 's lieutenant governor and attorney general as well . In New Jersey , former federal prosecutor Chris Christie will oust first-term Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine , CNN projects . Christie will be the first Republican to win the top office in heavily Democratic New Jersey in 12 years .

Corzine will be the first New Jersey governor to lose a re-election bid since 1993 , when then-Gov . Jim Florio , a Democrat , lost to GOP challenger Christie Todd Whitman .

The two gubernatorial contests have been deemed by some analysts as the first major referendum on President Obama 's administration . Republicans leaders , demoralized after landslide defeats in 2006 and 2008 , have been hoping to capitalize on wins in Virginia and New Jersey to help fuel a nationwide Republican resurgence .

They were buoyed by a huge swing of independent voters to the Republican column .

Democrats sought to minimize the defeats . Since 1989 , it was noted , the party winning the White House has always gone on to lose the gubernatorial races in both states the following year .

CNN also projects that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be re-elected to a third term . The billionaire mayor is believed to have spent well over $ 100 million of his own money in his quest for a third term -- shattering the record for personal spending in any American campaign .

Democrat Bill Owens has won a vacant U.S. House seat in upstate New York , CNN projects . The contest to fill the seat sparked a vicious internal fight between GOP conservatives and moderates . The struggle has been viewed as a proxy for a national struggle between activists arguing the GOP slipped by betraying conservative values and officials warning a rightward move would further alienate an increasingly independent-minded electorate .

The split could result in the election of a new Democratic congressman from a region that has backed Republican congressional candidates since 1872 .

Voters in nearby Maine -- not generally noted for their hard-edged , ideological politics -- tackled an emotional hot-button issue as voters decided whether to overturn a recently enacted law legalizing same-sex marriage . Results on the measure were not immediately expected , however .

Washington state voters are choosing whether to uphold a law granting same-sex domestic partners the same rights as heterosexual married couples .

Results on either measure were not immediately available , however .

The fight for control of New York 's City Hall is one of 380 mayoral races across the country , including contests in Atlanta , Georgia ; Boston , Massachusetts ; Detroit , Michigan ; Houston , Texas ; and Seattle , Washington .

It was the two races for governor , however , that appeared to attract the most interest at the White House . Obama personally campaigned for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in both states .

A plurality of voters in both states cited the economy as their top concern , according to exit polls . Majorities in both states said Obama 's job performance was not a factor in their vote .

In Virginia , McDonnell beat Democratic nominee Creigh Deeds , a state senator from the rural western part of the state , by 21 points among critical independent voters . Last year , in contrast , Obama edged out GOP presidential nominee John McCain by one point among Virginia independents .

African-Americans , as expected , voted overwhelmingly for the 51-year-old Deeds . Their total share of the vote , however , dropped from 20 percent from last year -- when Obama topped the ballot -- to 16 percent .

McDonnell benefited from a Virginia electorate that , according to the exit poll , was slightly more conservative Tuesday than it was in 2008 . Conservatives were also more unified in their support for McDonnell than they were for former GOP presidential nominee John McCain .

McDonnell himself is a staunch conservative , but stressed bipartisan solutions to problems relating to job growth and transportation . Deeds sought to peel social moderates and political independents away from McDonnell in part by highlighting McDonnell 's graduate school thesis , in which the Republican was critical of homosexuals and women in the workplace .

The attacks appeared to backfire on Deeds . Almost two of every three voters said Deeds attacked McDonnell unfairly ; those voters broke for McDonnell by a 21-point margin .

McDonnell 's expected victory is in keeping with Virginia 's tradition of backing candidates from the party that most recently lost the White House . Republican George Allen was elected in 1993 , one year after Bill Clinton won the presidency . Democrat Mark Warner won in 2001 , a year after George W. Bush 's first presidential victory .

In 2008 , Obama became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry an increasingly diverse Virginia in more than four decades . Fewer than one in five voters on Tuesday , however , said their vote was meant to express support for the president . Almost one in four said their vote was meant to express opposition to Obama .

Further north in New Jersey , Corzine had pulled even in the final surveys before Election Day with the help of a virtual 2-to-1 spending advantage . Many analysts believed independent candidate Chris Daggett , a socially moderate former Republican , was also be digging into Christie 's support .

Obama , who carried New Jersey by almost 16 points in 2008 , campaigned for Corzine three times , most recently this past Sunday . The president 's help , however , was not enough to save Corzine , who was saddled with burden of seeking reelection in the midst of a steep economic downturn . Almost one-third of New Jersey voters cited the economy as their top concern in early exit polls , with another 25 percent citing the state 's high property taxes . One in five voters said their top concern was the state 's ongoing struggle with corruption .

Independent voters broke even more heavily for Christie in New Jersey than for McDonnell in Virginia . Corzine was able to keep the race close , however , due to New Jersey 's political landscape . New Jersey voters were both more Democratic and more liberal than Virginia voters .

Last year , the president also managed to carry New York 's sprawling 23rd congressional district , a traditional GOP stronghold running along the Canadian border from Lake Champlain to Lake Ontario . The area has sent Republican representatives to Congress since Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant occupied the White House . But this year it was the scene of a GOP civil war .

The district 's U.S. House seat opened up a few months ago after nine-term Republican Rep. John McHugh stepped down to become secretary of the Army . Local Republican leaders picked state assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava as their nominee to replace McHugh because they felt her moderate views would appeal to centrist Republicans , independents and even some Democrats .

The decision , however , sparked a revolt among conservatives angry with what they saw as Scozzafava 's liberal views on same-sex marriage , abortion and fiscal matters such as the president 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan . They backed Doug Hoffman , an accountant , ran on the state 's Conservative Party line .

Scozzafava suspended her campaign Saturday after her poll numbers plummeted following a flood of support and contributions to Hoffman from leading conservative politicians and organizations .

Republican leaders were fractured by the choice . Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich backed Scozzafava . Gingrich 's one-time deputy , former House Majority Leader Dick Armey , backed Hoffman .

After dropping out , Scozzafava endorsed Democratic nominee Bill Owens . She campaigned for him on Monday .
