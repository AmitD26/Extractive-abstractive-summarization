CHICAGO , Illinois -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A 17-year-old said Tuesday he is `` blessed '' that prosecutors dropped a murder charge against him in the beating death last month of a Chicago honors student .

Derrion Albert , 16 , was beaten to death September 24 . His death was captured on video .

`` I 'm just happy to be out , '' Eugene Bailey said , a day after authorities announced they were dismissing the charge against him in the September 24 death of Derrion Albert .

Police said Albert , a 16-year-old honors student , was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School . His beating death was captured on video , which shows him being hit by a person wielding a piece of a railroad tie .

Bailey said he considered Albert a `` good friend '' and approached police offering to help in their investigation . When police told him he appeared on the video , he said , he told them , `` No , that ca n't be me . ''

Authorities searched his mother 's home and found he did not own clothing and shoes like that seen on the participant thought to be him , he said .

`` I 'm just blessed to have my freedom , '' he said , adding that what happened to Albert `` should n't happen to anyone . ''

Cook County prosecutors issued a statement Monday saying , `` While the charge against Bailey was brought in good faith based on witness accounts and identifications , additional information has developed during the ongoing investigation that warranted dismissal of the murder charge against Bailey at this time . ''

`` I was kind of overwhelmed , '' said Bailey 's mother , Ava Greyer . `` They would n't listen to me . ''

She said she received an eviction notice after her son 's arrest , but has since received a letter of apology . She said she did n't think that was right , however : `` You are innocent until proven guilty . ''

`` I did n't raise no murderer , '' she said . `` He did n't murder nobody . ''

`` We all talk about what is what out here and point fingers at one another . ... These kids need something to do , '' Greyer said . `` It 's not gang-related . They get out of school -- once they 're in school it 's cool . Once they get out of school , the school says ` Forget 'em . ' That 's wrong . Get them some after-schooling programs , some recreation centers 20 hours a week . ''

She said , `` That was sad , that was wrong what happened to Derrion . I wish that upon no one . But at the same time , we need to sweep around our doorsteps and see what we can do as a community to keep this from happening to somebody else 's child . ''

Prosecutors said that when school let out on September 24 , Albert was on his way to a bus stop when two groups of students converged on the street and began fighting . Albert was approached by two members of one faction and struck in the head with a long piece of a wooden railroad tie , and then punched in the face , Tandra Simonton , spokeswoman for the Cook County prosecutors , has said .

After being knocked out for a brief period , Albert regained consciousness and tried to move from the fight , but was then attacked by members of the opposing faction , Simonton said . He was pronounced dead at a hospital .

Albert 's death remains under investigation , prosecutors said Monday .

Three other individuals still face murder charges : Silvanus Shannon , 19 , Eric Carson , 16 , and Eugene Riley , 18 . All three appeared in court for a preliminary hearing Monday , but their cases were continued to Friday .

Albert 's death prompted President Obama , a former Chicago resident and Illinois senator , to send Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder to Chicago earlier this month . The two met with the city 's mayor and community leaders to discuss possible remedies for violent youth crime . Albert 's death was not an isolated incident : More than 30 youths suffered violent deaths in Chicago last year .

`` We should n't have to worry about walking down the streets , '' Bailey said . `` We all live amongst each other . ''
