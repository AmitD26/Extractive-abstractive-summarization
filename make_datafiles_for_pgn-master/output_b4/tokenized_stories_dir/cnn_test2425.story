LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- George Lucas did n't get to be a billionaire by delegating .

George Lucas says he was `` completely surprised '' by `` Star Wars in Concert . ''

Holding fast to his vision -- and his marketing rights -- for the `` Star Wars '' empire has made it the biggest franchise in history , and made Lucas one of the most powerful people in entertainment .

But while he 's enthusiastic about the new touring show `` Star Wars In Concert , '' it was n't his idea , and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week , he kept giving the credit to others .

`` Star Wars In Concert '' is built around John Williams ' well-known scores from the films , performed by a symphony orchestra and choir , and accompanied by specially edited clips from all six movies , displayed on a mammoth LED screen . Watch Lucas rave about the show ''

Anthony Daniels , who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid `` C3PO '' in every film and most of the spinoffs , provides live narration -- and another reason for the `` Star Wars '' fans in the audience , especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to Imperial stormtroopers , to cheer mightily , as they did the night I interviewed Lucas . iReporter praises the ` Force ' of the show

George Lucas : I 've seen some presentations of , you know , live orchestras with `` Star Wars '' clips , and that sort of thing . But this is so much more than that -- it 's so much more emotional , because what they 've done is taken the emotional content of the score ... one is obviously the Imperial March , one is obviously romantic ... and then they 've cut all the pictures around that from all the movies , so that you get this really wide range of visuals going with the music , and it really is quite powerful when you see the depictions of all of the various Imperial shenanigans that were going on over the Imperial March .

CNN : Obviously , when John Williams did the music for the original film , neither of you could have guessed your association would last so long , or that you 'd be so identified with each other . How did he get involved originally ?

Lucas : What I did was , I was doing this space opera , and I was talking to Steve Spielberg and I said , `` Look , I 've got to get somebody who really knows the old-fashioned music score , I really am doing some giant romantic action adventure , you know , throwback to the '30s , and who do you know that can do that ? '' And he said , `` Oh , there 's only one person who can do that and that 's John Williams -- he did ` Jaws ' and he 's perfect . ''

And I said OK , and I met him , and we hit it off , you know , perfectly , and doing the first film was such a great experience -- he 's so wonderful to work with -- that , you know , I 'll never let him go . And Steve wo n't let him go either !

CNN : How did this show come together ?

Lucas : Howard ! -LSB- Lucas calls over Howard Roffman , the president of Lucas Licensing . -RSB- You 're the man who did the whole thing -- I 've got nothing to do with it . ... We would kid him about how his concert was going and he had to get Johnny -LSB- Williams -RSB- to buy in and me to buy in .

Howard Roffman : Well , he always got it from the beginning , so he was an easy sell .

CNN : But what was it he `` got '' ? How did you sell him on a new concept for his franchise ?

Roffman : I think he understood that the music was so powerful and the images are so powerful that when you put that together with a live orchestra on a big venue , I mean , who would not be thrilled to see that ?

CNN : It 's a very different experience , being live .

Lucas : It 's very powerful . I was completely surprised by it . And I 've seen other live orchestra performances with `` Star Wars '' images , but nothing like this -- I mean this really works , because it was edited specifically to bring out the emotion .
