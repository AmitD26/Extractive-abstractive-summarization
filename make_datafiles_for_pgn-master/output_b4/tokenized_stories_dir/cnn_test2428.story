-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A tip from a television viewer led to the arrest of a Florida man accused of killing four of his family members on Thanksgiving Day , authorities said early Sunday .

Paul M. Merhige is accused of fatally shooting his twin sisters , a 6-year-old cousin and a 79-year-old aunt at a family home in Jupiter , Florida , on November 26 . One of his sisters was pregnant .

Authorities say Merhige also wounded two other family members .

A viewer of `` America 's Most Wanted '' recognized descriptions of Merhige and his car , authorities said at a news conference early Sunday . Officers immediately responded to the tip late Saturday , surrounding a small motel in the Middle Keys , part of the Florida Keys .

Merhige , who had apparently been at the Monroe County motel since December 2 , did not resist apprehension by U.S. marshals , authorities said . It was not immediately clear whether he was armed when marshals burst into his motel room , more than 200 miles from Jupiter .

Merhige made a first appearance in a West Palm Beach , Florida , court later Sunday morning in a hearing that lasted only minutes , according to CNN affiliate WPTV . He is charged with four counts of premeditated murder and attempted first-degree murder .

Asked by the judge if he had anything to say , Merhige declined comment , WPTV said . His next court appearance is scheduled for February 1 . He will be held without bond at the Palm Beach County jail .

Jim Sitton , father of 6-year-old Makayla , who was killed , told CNN affiliate WPTV late Saturday that he would `` sleep a little better tonight . ''

`` I wo n't be patrolling my house with a shotgun , looking for the monster . ... I 've been in protective mode , '' he said . `` This does n't bring Makayla back . I 'm not jumping for joy . Her room is still empty . But the monster is in a cage now . ''

The `` America 's Most Wanted '' tipster told authorities that Merhige had checked into the Edgewater Lodge motel under the name John Baca and provided an address in Homestead , Florida , according to a news release from police in Jupiter , Florida .

No one at the motel was immediately available for comment , but its Web site included photos of waterfront rooms , efficiencies and townhouses starting at $ 89 a night .

Merhige had paid cash at least two weeks in advance , the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release . He was on a computer when marshals burst into his second-story room .

Merhige had tried to disguise his 2007 Blue Toyota Camry with a car cover and had switched its vehicle tag with one from another car he 'd owned , the statement said . He also had shaved his head in an attempt to disguise his identity , the Monroe County Sheriff 's Office said .

Last month , the marshals added Merhige to their list of the Top 15 most-wanted fugitives . A total of $ 100,000 was offered as a reward for information leading to Merhige 's arrest , the sheriff 's office said , and the tipster may be entitled to it .

The agency also released some distinguishing characteristics about Merhige , saying he was known to either fake or display symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder , such as frequent bathing and shaving , and difficulty making decisions . He also had faked or displayed symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome , and taken several prescription drugs for the ailments , the agency said .
