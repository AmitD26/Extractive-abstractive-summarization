-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- If austerity had been a clinical trial , it would have been stopped . As public health experts , we have watched aghast as a slow motion disaster arose from austerity policies in Europe , while politicians continue to ignore the evidence of their disastrous effects .

Austerity was designed to shrink debts . Now , three years after Europe 's budget-cutting began , the evidence is in : severe , indiscriminate austerity is not part of the solution , but part of the problem -- and its human costs are devastating .

In the U.S. , Greece , Italy , Spain , the UK and elsewhere in Europe there were more than 10,000 additional suicides from 2007-2010 , a figure that is over and above historical trends , with the largest rises concentrated in the worst performing economies .

But suicides and depression are not unavoidable consequences of economic downturns : countries that slashed health and social protection budgets have seen starkly worse health outcomes than nations which opted for stimulus over austerity .

Greece , for example , is in the middle of a public health disaster . To meet budget-deficit reduction targets set by the European Central Bank , European Commission , and International Monetary Fund -LRB- the so-called troika -RRB- , Greece 's public health budget has been cut by more than 40 % .

As Greece 's health minister observed , `` these are n't cuts with a scalpel , they 're cuts with a butcher 's knife . '' The spending was reduced to 6 % of GDP , a figure lower than the UK , at 8 % , and Germany , at 9 % .

As a result , HIV infections have jumped by more than 200 % since 2010 , concentrated in injection drug users , as needle-exchange program budgets were cut in half . There was a malaria epidemic in Greece -- the largest in 40 years -- after mosquito-spraying budgets were slashed .

More than 200 essential medicines have been de-stocked from some pharmacies as the state 's drug budget was reduced and pharmaceuticals companies exited the country in arrears .

Since 2008 there has been a rise of more than 40 % of people who report being unable to access healthcare that they believe to be medically necessary , the majority concentrated in pensioners .

As patients can not afford private care and forego preventive care , public sector hospitals have experienced a 24 % rise in hospital admissions . Doctors and clinics are therefore overstrained . Infant mortality rates have risen 40 % between 2008 and 2010 .

Over 35,000 public health workers , nurses , and doctors have lost jobs . Unemployment rates have hit 27 % and youth unemployment has jumped to near 75 % in some areas .

With little hope for the future , desperate people are turning to cheap , synthetic drugs . Use of anti-depressants has skyrocketed , adding costs to the healthcare system . Suicide rates , previously among the lowest in Europe , have soared .

Were these all inevitable consequences of recession , rather than consequences of austerity ? Of course the Greek financial and political elites have made mistakes . And of course Greece 's fiscal and monetary options were severely restricted as part of the bailout deals . But the suffering of the Greeks was not inevitable .

The timing of many of these health effects coincided not with the onset of recession in 2008 and 2009 , but with the implementation of deep budget cuts starting in 2010 .

Several prevailing myths are commonly offered as alternative explanations for Greece 's devastating health outcomes , including these three :

The first myth : `` Greece 's healthcare system is excessive and inefficient . '' But there are just five hospital beds in Greece per 1,000 people , versus more than eight beds per 1,000 people in Germany .

The second myth : `` Greeks are lazy . '' But in 2011 the average Greek citizen worked 2,038 hours per year -- 600 hours more than the average German , according to the OECD .

The third myth : `` Europe 's bailout money is being squandered . '' But bailout money is not flowing in to support Greece 's healthcare system -- it is instead circulating back to large international banks in Germany , France and the UK .

What we learned from analyzing past crises is that people do not inevitably get sick or die because the economy has faltered . Fiscal policy can be a matter of life and death .

During the Great Depression in the U.S. in the 1930s , mortality rates actually fell by about 10 % . Even though suicide rates increased among the unemployed between 1929 and 1933 , this increase was outweighed by short-term drops in road traffic deaths , as people drove less to save on fuel costs .

Then , at a time when total debt was over 200 % of GDP , President Franklin Roosevelt implemented the New Deal , which created the U.S. social safety net . New Deal programs to re-house people who lost their homes , help people return to work , and build a public health infrastructure were highly effective -- and each additional $ 100 per capita in New Deal spending reduced suicides by 4 per 100,000 and infant deaths by about 18 per 100,000 .

Tuberculosis rates also fell , but disease rates were substantially reduced in those states that aggressively implemented the New Deal rather than those avoiding its implementation -- a `` natural experiment . '' 1934 , the year after the New Deal started becoming effective , marked the beginning of the U.S. economic recovery .

Another `` natural experiment '' occurred in the aftermath of the East Asian financial crisis from 1997 to 1998 . Indonesia , Thailand , and Malaysia all had large market crashes : their currencies plummeted , GDP collapsed , and unemployment soared .

But their politicians responded differently to the crisis , creating a rare laboratory in which we can identify the health effects of economic policy . Indonesia and Thailand turned to the IMF for help , implementing deep cuts to its HIV prevention , whereas Malaysia charted a different path , investing in preventive measures during the crisis .

Indonesia and Thailand suffered large pneumonia and tuberculosis outbreaks , but Malaysia avoided these effects .

Turning to the current recession in Europe , Iceland is another case study revealing that there is an alternative to austerity . Five years ago its three largest banks failed , and their total debt rocketed to over 800 % of GDP . It was the largest banking crisis in history relative to the size of an economy and it forced Iceland to turn to the IMF for help .

The troika 's bailout plan called for reductions in spending equivalent to 50 % of the budget in order to finance bank bailouts . The health minister resigned in protest at plans to cut the healthcare budget by 30 % , as detailed in our book .

Then the president of Iceland took a radical step : asking the people what they wanted to do .

In March 2010 , 93 % of the Icelandic people voted against financing a bailout for foreign savers of Icesave Bank through draconian budget cuts . Instead , Iceland stabilized healthcare spending .

Thanks to this boost to the nation 's universal healthcare system , no one lost access to healthcare even as the cost of imported medicines rose as an effect of the devaluation of the Icelandic Krona .

There was no significant rise in suicides or depression . Nor were there any significant infectious disease outbreaks . Indeed , last year GDP growth was 2.7 % , and unemployment rates have fallen below 5 % .

Having seen the results , the IMF turned tail , praising Iceland 's successful approach .

Each of these crises -- America 's Great Depression , the Asian financial crisis , and Iceland 's bank meltdown -- had different origins , but they led to potentially similar health threats . But their contrasting outcomes support our conclusion that an economic crisis does not inevitably increase in death and disability . The real danger is austerity .

But if austerity is not working , and indeed is part of the problem -LRB- as the IMF has recently admitted -RRB- , why are European leaders continuing its pursuit ?

British economist John Maynard Keynes indirectly outlined the dangers of austerity in 1919 . Germany 's unpayable debt from World War I , he argued , exacted by European nations in the Treaty of Versailles , would cause economic collapse and , ultimately , social instability in Germany .

Tragically , his premonition was borne out : Germany 's deep austerity under `` hunger chancellor '' Heinrich Bruning as it struggled to repay debts to France , Belgium , and the U.S. fueled the rise of the Nazi party and , as some historians argue , ultimately World War II in Europe .

In the aftermath of that war , West Germany benefited from the U.S.-sponsored Marshall Plan , whereby America injected $ 1.45 billion in funds to invest in German industry and rebuild vital infrastructure . The Marshall Plan 's stimulus package helped spur recovery , paving the way for decades of prosperity and peace in Western Europe .

Collectively we seem to be losing sight of the lessons from our past . In Greece , austerity packages in Europe are sparking the rising popularity of neo-Nazi parties , such as Golden Dawn .

But there is an alternative . In 2009 , the German parliament approved a 50 billion euros stimulus package to spur growth . Across Europe we have found that economies that introduced greater stimulus investment have charted faster economic recoveries .

Thanks to smart investments in `` active labor market programs `` â € '' programs that help people access job retraining and return to work quickly -- Germany , Sweden and Iceland have mitigated rises in depression and suicides from unemployment .

Our research has found that each euro invested in public health can yield up to a three euros return if invested wisely in data-supported government programs .

New York City officials learned this lesson in the early 1990s -- after restricting its TB prevention budget , the city suffered a drug-resistant TB outbreak that ultimately cost $ 1.2 billion to control , about 10 times greater than the estimated price of prevention .

Greece 's HIV , TB , and malaria epidemics will now cost more to control than they would have been to prevent , our research indicates .

What we have learned is that severe , indiscriminate cuts to vital social protection programs are not only economically self-defeating , but fatal .
