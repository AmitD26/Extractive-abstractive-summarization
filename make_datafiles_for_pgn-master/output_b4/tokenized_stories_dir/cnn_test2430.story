Instrument ? Powering up iPhone ...

These days , British singer Gary Go might reach for his iPhone before his keyboard when hammering out a tune . He says applications such as Chordica and Beatmaker allow him to compose material and provide instant accompaniment for those spontaneous moments when he feels the need for a good sing -LRB- during the interview , Go broke into song every five minutes -RRB- .

Go 's gadget of choice even doubled as a `` fifth member of the band '' during his July performance in front of 70,000 at London 's Wembley Stadium . He hooked it up to an amplifier and tapped out drum beats on the little screen . Watch Go in action with his iPhone ''

Luckily , he said , his `` mum ' `` did n't call him mid-show to tell him his dinner was ready . -LRB- `` That would be a bit embarrassing . Thank goodness for airplane mode . '' -RRB-

While the iPhone might be a handy tool for musicians -LRB- a couple of months ago , I watched as rock 'n' roller Rhett Miller tuned his guitar using an app called Power Tuner -RRB- , Go says he 's still a fan of old-school methods . The Londoner used real instruments when making his self-titled debut album , out this week in the U.S. -LRB- Decca -RRB- .

Lead single is `` wonderful ''

That 's actually the song title : `` Wonderful . '' It dips and soars in all the right spots like any good Coldplay-esque pop song should . It had a good run on iTunes as the service 's single of the week and is worth checking out if you like a good chorus that sticks in your noggin for a few days .

Twitter-lyrical ...

Go was intrigued by a heart-shaped balloon he saw entangled in a tree outside his home , so he posted a picture of it on the social networking site Twitter . He then enlisted his followers to suggest lyrics based on the pic , and wrote and recorded a song incorporating their comments : `` Love , I 'm caught by the wind , I 've lost all control , 'cause you caught my heart string ... ''

So the followers are entitled to royalties ? Not so fast ! Because the piece was offered up as a charity song to aid the British Heart Foundation last month , there wo n't be royalties .

Gaga and Go-Go

A fan of singer Lady Gaga , Go likes to perform a cover of the flamboyant star 's hit `` Let 's Dance . '' He was also Gaga 's supporting act during the European leg of her tour earlier this year .

It 's time to get things started ...

Creativity runs in Go 's family . His father worked as a producer for Jim Henson 's `` The Muppet Show . ''
