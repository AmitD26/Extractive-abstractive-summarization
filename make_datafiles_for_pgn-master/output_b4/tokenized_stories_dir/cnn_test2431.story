OAKLEY , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The black box sat inside a cabinet . Philip Garrido had given it to a friend for safekeeping , and that 's where the friend kept it .

The black box has jacks for plugging in headphones . Philip Garrido claimed it could speak his thoughts .

`` He feels he can speak to you and me and everyone else using this box , '' said Garrido 's friend and former business client , who spoke on condition of anonymity .

`` He was a whack job , but he was a whack job who sounded like he had a really good heart , '' the friend added .

Garrido and his wife , Nancy , were arrested last month and charged on more than two dozen counts , including kidnapping and rape .

Authorities say the Garridos held Jaycee Dugard , 29 , captive for nearly two decades in their backyard . Both have pleaded not guilty . Authorities have said Garrido , a registered sex offender , fathered Dugard 's two children .

A few days before his arrest , Garrido delivered some documents touting the device to the FBI .

The black box is simple , with a handle , a metal switch and jacks for plugging in headphones . But it provides some insight into the mind of 58-year-old Garrido .

Garrido told his friend and customers of his printing business that the box allowed him to communicate without speaking .

`` He would move his lips and not speak ... and you would be able to hear his voice through the headphones , '' the friend said .

Three years ago , Garrido demonstrated the box for clients of his printing business . The clients , some of them at least , went along with his claims for the device .

`` I did n't want to tell him you 're a kook and you do n't know what you 're talking about , '' said Tim Allen , who owns a glass shop in Antioch .

Even so , Allen and several other former Garrido clients signed declarations saying the device worked .

`` People believe in things . I did n't think it was my place to shoot him down , '' Allen said .

Garrido so believed in the power of his invention that he wanted to have the device patented , so he solicited the help of a private investigator last year .

`` He was speaking normal , dressed normal , acting normal , '' said Ralph Hernandez , who spent 30 years in law enforcement before becoming an independent private investigator .

Hernandez said he agreed to help Garrido verify the testimonials that the product actually worked , but he never saw the box . Garrido told him it would be best if he did n't , the investigator said .

Hernandez said he provided all the requested information to Garrido .

`` This was like the last part before he would take whatever he had had to a lawyer to prepare for patenting , '' Hernandez said .

Documents obtained by CNN include a news release that Garrido produced :

`` A Bay area man has made a major discovery concerning the phenomenon of voice , '' the release says , accompanied by a photograph of Garrido . Read the news release

Though it 's not known whether Garrido hired a patent attorney , there 's no record at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of a patent application or a patent granted to him . But 48 hours before he was arrested , Garrido gave the device to his friend for safekeeping .

`` I can only guess that he knew something bad was going to happen , '' he said .

Meanwhile , investigators will begin excavating part of the Garridos ' California property Monday afternoon after two sheriff 's dogs trained to find human remains alerted authorities of possible buried bones , officials said .

The search is in the same area as a canine alert last week , said Lt. Chris Orrey of the Hayward , California , police department . Ground-penetrating radar also found an `` anomaly '' in that area , Orrey said Monday .

Investigators have already found bone fragments at the property in unincorporated Contra Costa County but have not said whether they are human .
