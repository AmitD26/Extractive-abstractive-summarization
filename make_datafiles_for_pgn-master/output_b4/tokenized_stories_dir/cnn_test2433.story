WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Bernie McDaid was an 11-year-old altar boy when his priest began molesting him , one of 50 boys who have said they were molested by the same man .

Olan Horne , from left , Faith Johnston and Bernie McDaid met with the pope Thursday .

Like with so many victims of abuse , McDaid 's young life spiraled . He turned to drugs and alcohol in his teen years , struggling to cope with what `` Father B '' had done to him .

On Thursday , he finally got a chance to do something he 'd hoped for decades : He met with the Holy Father and told him about the abuse he had suffered .

`` I basically told him that I was an altar boy ... a young boy praying to God at the time that I was abused , '' McDaid said . `` It was n't just sexual abuse , it was spiritual abuse , and I want you to know that . '' `` And then I told him that he has a cancer growing in his ministry and needs to do something about it . And I hope he hears me right , and I touched his heart . And he nodded . '' Watch victims describe abuse and pope 's apology ''

McDaid was part of a small group of victims of the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Roman Catholic Church who met with Pope Benedict XVI on Thursday . They shared their stories with the pope in a Washington chapel in what the victims called an emotional , frank and ultimately hope-filled meeting .

Faith Johnston clutched her mother 's rosary beads as she tried to speak to the pope . But her emotions took over .

`` I did n't end up saying anything . I got up to him , and I burst into tears , '' said Johnston , who at 14 was molested by her priest . `` I think just my tears alone spoke -- just spoke so much . ''

She added , `` I hope that other survivors can hear about this , see this and get the same hope that we 've gotten from it . ''

Olan Horne said the pope first apologized to them in what he called an `` unscripted '' and `` free-flowing '' meeting .

`` We were all able to answer all of the questions that needed to be asked and for him to respond to . And he did -- and he did forthright , '' Horne said .

`` He seemed to intrinsically understand what we were talking about . And he spoke to those issues to each one of us in a spiritual way , in a pastoral way . And he also was very respectful of where and what we wanted to talk about . ''

Horne added , `` My hope was restored today from what I heard . And I believe we received a promise . ''

Horne and McDaid both accused the same priest , the Rev. Joseph Birmingham , of molesting them . Birmingham died in 1989 .

The Rev. Federico Lombardi , a papal spokesman , said the pope listened to everyone 's `` personal accounts and offered them words of encouragement and hope . ''

The surprise meeting came during the pope 's visit , the first trip to the United States by the Holy Father since the abuse scandal rocked the church in the early 2000s .

The meeting is believed to be the first between a pope and the victims of clergy sexual abuse .

The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests , the nation 's oldest and largest support group for clergy abuse victims , said it was pleased that the pope met with the victims but hopes the church will do more .

`` This is a small , long overdue step forward on a very long road . We 're confident the meeting was meaningful for the participants , and we 're grateful that these victims have had the courage to come forward and speak up , '' the group said .

`` But fundamentally , it wo n't change things . Kids need action . Catholics deserve action . Action produces reform , and reform , real reform , is sorely needed in the church hierarchy . ''

Earlier Thursday , celebrating Mass in center field at Washington 's new ballpark , the pope gave a 20-minute homily that focused on hope , repentance , unity and reconciliation among the 70 million Catholics in the United States . `` It is in the context of this hope , born of God 's love and fidelity , that I acknowledge the pain which the church in America has experienced as the result of sexual abuse of minors , '' Benedict said .

`` No words of mine could describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse . It is important that those who have suffered be given loving pastoral attention . ''

McDaid was sitting in the audience with his mother when he heard those words . Watch pope 's apology ` blew me away ' ''

`` I had tears in my eyes that I was n't ready to have . It was an incredible moment for me , '' he said .

Now , he hopes the church will follow through .

`` We 're at the beginning of a new start , and there 's real hope this time . It 's not just words . I think there 's going to be action following this moment now . '' E-mail to a friend
