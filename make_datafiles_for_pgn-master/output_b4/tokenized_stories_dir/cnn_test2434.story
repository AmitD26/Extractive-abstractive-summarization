Port-au-Prince , Haiti -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Six Haitian orphans , seized by national authorities last week as they prepared to journey to the United States , will be able to leave the earthquake-devastated country Wednesday .

The U.S. Embassy retained custody of the children Tuesday and they were handed over to three American women who have been trying to escort them out .

The women had attempted to leave Saturday when angry Haitians demanded to see their paperwork . Police suspected that a key document the women were carrying -- a permission signed by Haiti 's prime minister -- was a fake , something the women and U.S. officials deny .

There is no chance the paperwork is fake , said Sarah Thacker , one of the three women . Thacker , from Minnesota , was in Haiti to bring home her newly adopted son .

Police did not arrest the women , but temporarily placed the children under government custody at a local orphanage .

The women said Tuesday that they had been given permission to take the children to the United States . The women were staying with the children at a friend 's house in Port-au-Prince .

The incident came nearly a month after the arrest of 10 U.S. missionaries accused of trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country without proper paperwork . Eight of them have been released on bail and have returned to the United States .

The question of Haitian children being removed from the country illegally came to the foreground after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake devastated parts of the country on January 12 . Authorities feared that children left on their own -- because their parents died or they were separated from them -- would be targeted by child traffickers .

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has backed Thacker 's efforts .

`` They have filled out all the paperwork , '' she said . `` This is a legitimate orphanage that has brought other children to America . And I feel like these little babies are just caught up in this international dispute , and it 's just not fair . ''

CNN 's Gary Tuchman and Ismael Estrada contributed to this report .
