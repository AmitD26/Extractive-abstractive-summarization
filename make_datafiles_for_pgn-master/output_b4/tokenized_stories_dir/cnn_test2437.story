-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For many graduate students seeking an advanced education degree , obstacles abound . Issues of finance , time management and family logistics often get in the way of students furthering their education and their dreams .

Palestinian Sawsan Salameh is attending an Israeli university after years of negotiations and court proceedings .

For Sawsan Salameh , the obstacles also involved politics .

Several years ago , Salameh , a 31-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Anata , was granted a scholarship to study at Hebrew University of Jerusalem . Although her town is only a few miles from the university , access to the school was out of reach because of an Israeli military ban that limited Palestinian students ' access to Israeli universities , on security grounds .

But she was far from giving up on her goal of pursuing her education .

`` When I was in high school , it was a dream that I should finish my Ph.D. , '' Salameh said .

After obtaining a master 's degree at Al Quds University , a Palestinian school in the West Bank , Salameh was granted full scholarships at several international schools , including Hebrew University .

With the military ban in place , Salameh considered studying at a university abroad .

`` I started to think I should get up and take this offer to leave , but it 's not easy to go abroad , and the only chance is for me to study in Israel , because it 's important for me to stay close to my family , '' Salameh said .

Salameh sought the support of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha , which submitted a petition to Israel 's Supreme Court on her behalf in 2006 .

The Supreme Court responded by asking the military to lift the ban and allow Salameh to study at Hebrew University , where she is pursuing a Ph.D. in pharmacology .

`` We argued Sawsan 's case for 2 1/2 years , and at the end of the day , the military agreed to let Sawsan study , '' said Sari Bashi , director of Gisha .

`` It was impossible to deny her incredible talents and the example she set for women and girls throughout the West Bank , '' Bashi says .

The Israeli military agreed to review all future requests for Palestinians in the West Bank wishing to pursue a degree at an Israeli university on a case-by-case basis , based on specific criteria .

The criteria include that the potential student clear all necessary internal security checks , that the student pursue a degree in a discipline that would encourage regional cooperation and develop area coexistence , and that the area of study not have the potential to cause damage to Israel , says Maj. Guy Inbar , spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories .

The area of study must be supported by an international organization -LRB- such as the U.N. or the Red Cross -RRB- and approved by the Ministry of Education and must also be a degree unique to an Israeli university -LRB- not offered at a Palestinian university -RRB- . The request must come with a recommendation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to Inbar .

After Salameh 's victory , Gisha , with the support of a number of Israeli academics , further appealed to the court to push the military to ease these limitations .

The Israeli military 's heightened security concerns reflect heightened tensions in the region due to the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict .

In July 2002 , a bomb exploded in the student cafeteria of Hebrew University , killing seven people . The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas claimed responsibility for the explosion , according to Palestinian sources .

Still , some academics at Hebrew University believe qualified students like Salameh pose no security risk , and their acceptance to Israeli universities could even foster better relations in the region .

Professor Alon Harel , a law professor at Hebrew University , pushed for the appeal to lift the military 's criteria on Palestinian students .

He believes that the admission of Palestinian students from the West Bank would enrich the academic environment at the university , particularly in the study of law .

`` It 's particularly important for classes to be diverse , for people to have familiarity with Arabic studies and Islamic law , '' he said .

Other academics agree that qualified students such as Salameh can only add to the diversity of the campus , where thousands of Israeli Arab students are enrolled .

`` My personal feeling is that we should do everything we can to allow Palestinian students to study at Hebrew University , '' said Yaacov Schul , vice rector at Hebrew University .

Salameh is a devout Muslim with a traditional background yet shirks pressure from family members to focus on marriage and motherhood .

`` Everyday I have to hear something about -LSB- not being married -RSB- from relatives and aunts , '' she says . `` It 's become -LSB- the -RSB- usual . ''

Salameh , who also provides valuable resources for young women at a women 's center she opened in her community , says she hopes her pursuit of higher education will open even more doors for young women also wishing to pursue a higher education and achieve their academic goals .

`` I get lots of phone calls every day from girls in the West Bank who ask me how to apply to universities in Israel , '' Salameh said .

`` Maybe they can become more than just a wife and mother and at least finish their first degree , '' she said .

Salameh says she enjoys the collegial atmosphere at Hebrew University , where she studies among Israeli Arab , international and Israeli students .

She is considering pursuing another degree after completing her Ph.D. in two years .

`` I would like to help other people , and I hope the political situation will become better and things will become easier , '' she said .
