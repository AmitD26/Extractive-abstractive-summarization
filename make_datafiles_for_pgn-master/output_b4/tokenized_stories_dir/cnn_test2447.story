-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Elizabeth Smart was not afraid to face Brian Mitchell in her first testimony detailing her 2002 abduction .

Elizabeth Smart , now 21 and in college , testified that Brian Mitchell raped her daily .

In fact , her father said , she wanted the man who allegedly kept her tethered to a tree in the Utah woods muzzled and forced to listen to her testimony .

Mitchell was in court Thursday for a competency hearing , but Smart never saw him because U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball ordered him removed from the court when he ignored requests to stop singing and disrupting the proceedings . He watched via a closed-circuit camera from another room .

`` She actually wanted to face him , '' Ed Smart said . `` I think she asked -LSB- U.S. Attorney Brett Tolman -RSB- if he could be muzzled and have to sit there and watch it . ''

Tolman , standing alongside Smart 's father after Thursday 's hearing in Salt Lake City , confirmed the 21-year-old woman 's request : `` She did ask me whether or not -LSB- Mitchell -RSB- got to see that testimony and hear that testimony , and I indicated to her , to her relief , that he was there in a room with the audio and video and had nothing else to do but listen . ''

Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart from the bedroom of her Salt Lake City , Utah , home in June 2002 . She testified that she was kept captive in Utah and California until March 2003 , when she was found walking down a street in Sandy , Utah , with Mitchell and his wife , Wanda Barzee .

Smart said that , during those nine months , no 24-hour period passed without Mitchell being able to rape her .

Public defender Robert Steele says Mitchell is mentally ill , but Tolman said he believes that Mitchell `` has attempted to fool or to deceive the system . ''

Ed Smart said he hopes his daughter 's testimony nixes the notion that Mitchell can not stand trial , `` and if this does n't clinch the issue of competency , our nation is in really , really bad shape , because it means that anyone out there can manipulate and make the court do what it wants .

Mitchell and Barzee are charged with six felony counts , including aggravated burglary , aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault .

Smart 's testimony began with details of how she was abducted at knife point while she slept next to her sister . She was 14 at the time .

She said Mitchell took her to a wooded area not far from her home , performed a marriage ceremony and began raping her . Mitchell often sang about his intentions , she testified : `` He would come up the mountainside , yelling , ` I 'm going to -LSB- expletive -RSB- your eyes out . ' ''

Mitchell also threatened to kill her if she tried to escape , Smart said .

`` He said an angel would strike me down with a sword , '' she said , `` but he also told me that he would be that angel . ''

Mitchell gave her drugs and alcohol , showed her pornography and used religion to justify most of his actions , she testified . He also said he was God 's servant , a prophet , and would one day face and kill the Antichrist , she said .

On one occasion , Smart said , she vomited after Mitchell gave her too much to drink .

`` He let me lie face-down in my vomit for the entire night until I woke up the next day , '' she told the court . `` He said that was showing my true state , that I was laying face-down in my vomit . ''

That morning illustrated a recurring theme , she said , explaining that Mitchell often rationalized his actions by saying they would ultimately yield greater spirituality .

`` He said that first I had to be humbled and to sink below all things before arising above all things , '' she recalled . `` You have to experience the lowest form of humanity to experience the highest . ''

Smart , now a Brigham Young University student and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , described Mitchell as `` evil , wicked , manipulative , sneaky , slimy , selfish , greedy , not spiritual , not religious , not close to God . ''

During her nine months in captivity , Mitchell kept her in Utah until the winter approached , at which point he transported her to San Diego , California , she said .

It 's unclear when they returned to Utah , but Elizabeth Smart testified that she convinced Mitchell that they should hitchhike back to Salt Lake City . She told the court her ulterior motive was to return to an area where she more easily could be recognized and rescued .

While in Utah , Mitchell kept her confined with a cable attached to her leg , she said . The 10-foot tether was locked on to another cable that was 15 to 20 feet long .

`` He had a big cable bolted onto my leg , which was strung between two trees , and there was a lock that would slide between the two trees , '' she said . `` He had the key around his neck the entire time . ''

Asked how often she was raped , she replied , `` On a daily basis , up to three or four times . ''

She resisted his advances several times , she said , once biting him as he tried to have sex with her .

`` He said that if I ever did that again , he would never have sex with me again , and I would be the most miserable woman in the world , '' she said . `` It did n't make a difference that he said that . I mean , it did n't stop him . ''

After the hearing , Ed Smart said he was `` amazed at her strength '' and `` I do n't know how she could have done a better job . '' Asked about his daughter 's reaction following her testimony , he said , `` Phew , it 's over . ''

He bordered on tears when asked whether he had learned anything Thursday about his daughter 's abduction .

`` There were certainly a lot of things that I had never heard before , and I had no idea what she had gone through -- so much out there , '' he said .

Prosecutor Tolman said Smart 's `` powerful '' testimony demonstrated that Mitchell was manipulative and inclined to be deceptive , but defense attorney Steele said Mitchell 's guile did not negate his mental illness .

`` Those things can exist side by side : manipulativeness and mental illness , '' he said .

Smart testified Thursday because she is scheduled to leave soon on a mission , customary of the Mormon religion .

The prosecution plans to call dozens of witnesses when the competency hearing continues at the end of November , Tolman said . Included are people who have been incarcerated with Mitchell , he said .

`` The battle is not over . This is the very beginning of it , '' he said .

Asked whether he would be willing to accept a plea bargain , Tolman said there was no indication that one was imminent .

`` We 're inclined to prosecute this case vigorously and present it to a jury , '' he said .
