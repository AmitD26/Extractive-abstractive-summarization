-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In a most public fashion , congressional lawmakers have been grilling Toyota officials this week about safety defects that have caused some of the automaker 's vehicles to accelerate without warning . Accidents and deaths are being linked to these problems .

This is prime political theater . Angry lawmakers are aggressively demanding answers , dressing down their corporate counterparts . Toyota officials are largely apologetic . Toyota President Akio Toyoda wept after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing Wednesday .

What 's largely occluded from television cameras , however , are the long , deep ties between Toyota , former federal government employees and current lawmakers , some of whom are -LRB- or have been -RRB- tasked with providing oversight , upholding public safety and , at the moment , potentially recommending regulatory changes .

Of course , ties do not mean tepid congressional questioning , nor do they mean tough regulations will not result from committee hearings . But as consumers -- and citizens -- watch the hearings transpire , it 's worth remembering that Washington is a place where the public interest is n't always politicians ' first or only interest .

In 2009 , Toyota employed 31 lobbyists , hired to exert influence and defend the company 's interests before Congress , the White House and federal agencies , such as the Department of Transportation and Department of Energy .

So who are these Toyota lobbyists working the back channels of government ?

Our research indicates that in many instances , they 're former members of the U.S. government , earning handsome salaries lobbying on behalf of their corporate client .

Among the leaders in this small army of lobbyists -LRB- and registered as such in 2009 -RRB- are a former congressman , two former chiefs of staff for prominent senator currently serving , a former Department of Energy assistant secretary , a former assistant director of the National Commission on Air Quality and a former special events director for the Republican National Committee .

This is a group that ca n't be easily dismissed by congressional leaders and their staffs .

In politics , just like any social realm , it 's simpler to say `` no '' to a stranger than someone who used to work for you or with you , or someone you may have even campaigned for . Now , in Toyota 's period of political peril , the company will probably need the help of its lobbyists to mitigate damage to its corporate interests .

By December , Toyota had spent about $ 5.4 million on federal lobbying efforts for 2009 , more than Honda , Volkswagen , Nissan or any other foreign automaker .

During the past five years , Toyota 's federal lobbying expenditures total nearly $ 25 million , about enough to buy two new Prius hybrids for every member of Congress .

Among automakers , only General Motors and Ford have each spent more money to lobby the federal government during that time .

As for lawmakers themselves , they , too , have connections to Toyota .

In 2008 , the most recent year for which data are available , seven members of Congress reported owning Toyota stock . Rep. Jane Harman , D-California , who represents that district in which Toyota 's U.S. headquarters is located , declared in her 2008 personal financial disclosure report that she and her husband owned $ 315,000 in Toyota assets .

Harman , who serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee , which is investigating Toyota , said this week that she 'd recuse herself from committee proceedings and votes , an appropriate step to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest .

No other member of Congress has publicly followed suit , including Rep. Michael Burgess , R-Texas , another Toyota stock owner in 2008 who also sits on the committee .

Sen. Jay Rockefeller , a Democrat from West Virginia , does n't own Toyota stock , but he was instrumental in wooing Toyota to build a factory in his state , once saying he `` felt like a full-fledged member '' of Toyota 's site selection team .

Rockefeller , chairman of the Senate 's Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee , is slated to serve as the Senate 's lead investigator into Toyota 's safety issues -LRB- hearings begin next week -RRB- and whether the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration properly monitored safety concerns about the company .

The agency 's new chief ? He 's David L. Strickland , a former lawyer and senior staff member for Rockefeller 's Senate committee .

-LRB- A spokeswoman for Rockefeller told the Washington Post this week that the senator fought `` for good-paying manufacturing jobs but never shirks from holding those same companies ' feet to the fire when it comes to safety and consumer protection . '' -RRB-

Lawmakers are also the beneficiaries of money Toyota has directly donated to their political campaigns . Although Toyota itself can not create a political action committee through which to make donations to politicians -- foreign firms are banned from doing so -- the U.S.-based Toyota distributor , Gulf States Toyota , faces no such restriction .

Gulf States Toyota 's political action committee has contributed at least $ 1,000 to each of 10 federal political candidates this election cycle after making donations to 29 federal candidates during the 2008 election cycle .

Included on this list -- for 2007 and 2008 -- are members of the congressional committees investigating Toyota : Reps. Joe Barton , R-Texas ; Gene Green , D-Texas ; Charles Melancon , D-Louisiana ; Steve Scalise , R-Louisiana ; and John Sullivan , R-Oklahoma .

Since 1999 , Toyota employees in the United States have also individually donated more than $ 100,000 to congressional members .

Taken separately , these associations may not amount to a smoking gun of profit and politics over people .

But together , they represent a ruck of entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that must be adequately checked by the press . And the public must be mindful of these ties , lest they deliver on their potential to render safety subservient to a financial bottom line .
