Moscow , Russia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thousands of opposition demonstrators marched in front of the parliament building in Kiev , Ukraine , Saturday , protesting a deal reached earlier this week to extend Russia 's military presence in the former Soviet Republic , national news media reported .

Parliamentary opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- told protesters Saturday that the ratification of the treaty must be prevented at all costs .

She claimed that Yanukovych is `` selling out '' Ukraine , has `` openly embarked on the path of destruction of -LSB- Ukraine 's -RSB- national interests , and has actually begun the process of eliminating the state 's sovereignty , '' according to a transcript of the speech on her website .

After the deal was signed Wednesday by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution , which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017 .

Saturday , protesters reportedly adopted a resolution calling the agreement an `` unprecedented act of national treason and disgrace , '' and calling on all opposition groups to unite against it .

According to Tymoshenko 's website , some 10,000 people gathered at the rally . But Ukrainian national news agency UNIAN estimated the number of protesters at 5,000 .

The deal extends Russia 's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol , Ukraine , for an additional 25 years , in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine .

The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices , which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine . The dispute affected not only Ukrainians , but many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine .

The two countries had been at odds ever since the `` Orange Revolution '' swept Yanukovych 's fiercely anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005 .

Throughout his time in office , Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia 's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol . The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017 .

`` The prolongation of the Black Sea Fleet 's presence in Sevastopol is essential to Russia , '' Yanukovych said Wednesday . `` We understand that the Black Sea Fleet will be one of the guarantors of security on the Black Sea . ''

The Kremlin-friendly Yanukovych , who hails from predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine , trounced Yushchenko in national elections last January .

The Russian president said the new deal added a `` concrete and pragmatic dimension '' to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians .

Opposition groups in Ukraine , however , were quick to denounce the agreement . Yuschenko 's `` Our Ukraine '' party said the treaty would lead to the `` Russification '' of Ukraine .

Opposition activists decided Saturday to stage another protest in front of parliament April 27 , when the deal will be put to a ratification vote .
