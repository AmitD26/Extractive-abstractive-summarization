Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- President Obama tapped a former Army general Monday to lead the Transportation Security Administration .

Obama nominated Robert A. Harding , a retired major general with 33 years in the Army , to become the TSA administrator . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the nomination with Harding by her side .

`` The TSA administrator is among the most important , unfilled posts in the Obama administration , '' Napolitano said . `` The president and I both believe that Gen. Harding has the experience and perspective to make a real difference in carrying out the mission of this agency . ''

`` If there were ever a nominee that warranted expedited , and detailed , consideration in the Senate , this is it , '' she said .

Obama announced the nomination in a White House news release .

`` I am confident that Bob 's talent and expertise will make him a tremendous asset in our ongoing efforts to bolster security and screening measures at our airports , '' Obama said . `` I can think of no one more qualified than Bob to take on this important job , and I look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead . ''

The TSA has been under the leadership of an acting administrator since Edmund `` Kip '' Hawley resigned at the end of the Bush administration .

In September , Obama nominated Erroll Southers , a Los Angeles airport police department official , to the head the agency . But Republican Sen. Jim DeMint , R-South Carolina , spearheaded GOP efforts to block the nomination based on concerns Southers would unionize airport screeners .

Southers withdrew his nomination in January after lawmakers questioned his changing explanation about a personnel action taken against him decades ago .

Harding would be the TSA 's first African-American administrator . Southers is also black .

Harding has served as CEO of Harding Security Associates , a defense and intelligence government contracting firm he founded in 2003 and sold in July 2009 .

From 1996 to 2000 , Harding was director for operations at the Defense Intelligence Agency , where he was the Defense Department 's senior human intelligence officer .

Before that , he was director for intelligence for the Army 's Southern Command .

The TSA was created in the months after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks and soon took over security at the nation 's airports , including screening commercial airline passengers and luggage .
