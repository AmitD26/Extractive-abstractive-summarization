-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- West Indies pace bowling legend Michael Holding has launched a passionate defence of Test cricket , claiming that the 20/20 version of the game is threatening to completely destroy the five-day format .

Speaking exclusively to CNN , Holding -- who has just released his autobiography `` No Holding Back '' -- admitted he disliked the limited-overs game so much that he turned down television work on the recent world 20/20 championship in his native West Indies .

`` I am not interested in 20/20 at all . Maybe I am an old fogey but I think it is destroying Test cricket , '' said Holding .

`` Kids should be playing Test cricket and then maybe progressing to 20/20 once established . But now , with all the money available in 20/20 , top young players are not going to be interested in playing the five-day game .

`` When you can earn $ 800,000 for playing six weeks in the Indian Premier League -LRB- IPL -RRB- , why waste six years trying to earn that sort of money in Test cricket ?

`` If this is n't controlled properly , Test cricket will die . When I was playing , people said : ` Test cricket is too slow , ' so they brought in 50-over one-day cricket . Now it 's down to 20-overs . What happens next ? 15 overs ? 10 overs ? .

Holding also believes that Test cricket is not being helped by the way the sport 's governing body , the International Cricket Council -LRB- ICC -RRB- is managing the game .

`` The ICC needs to see how football 's governing body FIFA runs things . The ICC are letting the Indian Cricket Board -LRB- BBCI -RRB- dictate how cricket is run and that is all wrong . India is where the money is in cricket at the moment but that does n't mean they should have a say in how cricket is governed .

`` FIFA would n't let Brazil dictate how to run football and cricket should n't let India have more of a say just because they have money there .

`` Basically , the ICC are governing cricket so badly that soon nobody will pay any attention to them at all . If Test cricket is boring it is because the ICC are handling the calendar all wrong .

`` Bangladesh are playing a series in England soon , but who cares ? . Imagine there was a two-division system , six teams in each , with promotion and relegation . India to face Pakistan with the losers being relegated to Division Two -- now that would be a Test series to watch ! ''

Holding also told CNN that he would suspend any player found to have been betting on matches , although would stop short of banning them for life .

`` No cricketer , in fact no sportsman , should be betting on matches -- to win or lose . If there is irrefutable evidence that a player has been caught betting on matches , they have to be banned .

`` However , not for life , I believe in people getting second chances , but if it happened twice -- then ban them for life . ''
