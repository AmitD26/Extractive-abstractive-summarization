Atlanta , Georgia -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Kuwaiti company that has been paid more than $ 8.5 billion to supply food and other items to the U.S. military in the Middle East has been indicted on multiple federal fraud charges , authorities announced Monday .

Public Warehousing Company KSC is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States , committing major fraud against the United States , making false statements , submitting false claims and wire fraud , a six-count indictment states .

The company obtained contracts in May 2003 , February 2005 and July 2005 to feed U.S. troops in Iraq , Kuwait and Jordan , said the U.S. attorney 's office for the Northern District of Georgia , where the charges were filed .

`` This indictment is the result of a multiyear probe into abuses in vendor contracts in the Middle East involving the illegal inflation of prices in contracts to feed our troops , '' said F. Gentry Shelnutt , who is serving as acting U.S. attorney on the case . `` The indictment alleges PWC submitted false information and manipulated prices to overcharge for food . ''

Public Warehousing Company , also known as Agility , did not return a telephone message Monday .

The charges came after federal officials joined a 2005 whistle-blower suit by Kamal Mustafa al-Sultan , the owner of a Kuwaiti company that had partnered with Public Warehousing to submit a proposal on the food supply contracts , the Justice Department said . The case remained under seal to let federal officials investigate the allegations and determine whether the U.S. government would join the lawsuit .

The whistle-blower 's civil complaint was filed in Atlanta .

According to the indictment , the company violated the False Claims Act by presenting false claims for payment , overcharging for locally available fresh fruits and vegetables , and failing to pass along to the U.S. government rebates and discounts it had obtained , as required by its contracts .

The indictment does not say how much the United States was allegedly defrauded , because the investigation is under way , officials said .

The investigation is being conducted by a team from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service , the FBI , the Army Criminal Investigation Command , auditors from the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Department .

`` The defendants , tempted by monetary gain , betrayed the trust invested in them by the U.S. Army and now they must face the consequences , '' said Brig. Gen. Rodney Johnson , commander of Army Criminal Investigation Command .
