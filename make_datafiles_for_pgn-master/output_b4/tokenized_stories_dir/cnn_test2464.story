WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The former judge who last year lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a dry cleaners over a missing pair of pants wants his job back .

Roy Pearson sued the owners of this dry cleaning business for $ 54 million over a missing pair of pants .

Roy Pearson was not reappointed after his term expired as an administrative law judge in the District of Columbia .

He filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court accusing city government and others of an `` unlawful demotion and subsequent termination . ''

Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007 , during his unsuccessful $ 54 million lawsuit against a dry cleaning business , which he accused of failing to meet its promise of `` satisfaction guaranteed . ''

As an administrative law judge , Pearson would hear cases involving zoning law and certain business disputes .

A city panel that decides reappointments had notified Pearson during the controversial lost trousers trial that his status was under review .

A source on that panel said at the time that any judge must meet certain standards of conduct `` on and off the bench . ''

The source , who was among the members of the panel at the time of Pearson 's review , said `` a judge is a judge 24/7 ; whether or not they use good judgment in all aspects of their lives is what we can consider . ''

The civil case , in which Pearson represented himself , sought punitive and compensatory damages against a small family-owned dry cleaners that once posted signs promising `` satisfaction guaranteed . ''

A pair of trousers that hung by the witness stand was a featured part of the trial last summer . The owners testified that the pants belonged to Pearson , who denied under oath that they were his .

The judge found in favor of the dry cleaners and disagreed with Pearson that the satisfaction promise was unconditional . Pearson petitioned the trial judge for a reconsideration , which was denied . He then filed an appeal with the D.C. Court of Appeals , which will hear his appeal later this year .

In court documents made available Friday at U.S. District Court in Washington , Pearson , again acting as his own attorney , relies on what he considers Washington 's `` Whistleblower Protection '' law to try to establish illegal retaliation .

The trial over the lost trousers generated a storm of criticism among fairness advocates , who accused Pearson of abusing the system . The latest litigation has begun to produce the same reaction .

`` He lost his job because he proved he did not have the legal requirements to fill the job , namely a judicial temperament , '' said Darren McKinney of the American Tort Reform Association .

Pearson did not return a message left at home .

In his suit seeking to regain his job , he also seeks `` compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial , in excess of $ 75,000 from all defendants jointly and severally , '' as well as an unspecified amount of punitive damages `` to be determined at trial . ''

Efforts to seek reaction from the individuals named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful . No initial hearing date has been set in the civil case assigned to U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan . E-mail to a friend
