Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The September 11 , 2001 , attacks have led to an intelligence community so large and unwieldy that it 's unmanageable and inefficient -- and no one knows how much it costs , according to a two-year investigation by the Washington Post .

Ahead of the publication , many in the intelligence community worried that the stories would disclose too much information about contractors and the classified tasks they handle .

The Post article that appeared in Monday 's edition says its investigation uncovered `` a Top Secret America hidden from public view and lacking in thorough oversight . After nine years of unprecedented spending and growth , the result is that the system put in place to keep the United States safe is so massive that its effectiveness is impossible to determine . ''

Washington Post : Top Secret America

The Post investigation found that `` 33 building complexes for top-secret intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001 , '' or the equivalent of nearly three Pentagons .

`` Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism , homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States , '' according to the Post , which added that an estimated 854,000 people hold top-secret security clearances .

`` There has been so much growth since 9/11 that getting your arms around that -- not just for the DNI -LSB- director of national intelligence -RSB- , but for any individual , for the director of the CIA , for the secretary of defense -- is a challenge , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the Post last week .

`` Look , we know the intelligence community grew significantly and quickly after 9/11 , '' a senior administration official told CNN Monday . `` Some of it was inefficient . But we are looking at those inefficiencies . And remember , we have prevented attacks . ''

Acting National Intelligence Director David Gompert issued a statement saying the Post 's report `` does not reflect the intelligence community we know . ''

`` In recent years , we have reformed the -LRB- intelligence community -RRB- in ways that have improved the quality , quantity , regularity , and speed of our support to policymakers , warfighters , and homeland defenders , and we will continue our reform efforts , '' he said .

`` We provide oversight , while also encouraging initiative . We work constantly to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies , while preserving a degree of intentional overlap among agencies to strengthen analysis , challenge conventional thinking , and eliminate single points of failure . ''

The Post said its investigation was `` based on government documents and contracts , job descriptions , property records , corporate and social networking Web sites , additional records , and hundreds of interviews with intelligence , military and corporate officials and former officials , '' most of whom requested anonymity .

Although officials were concerned about the content of the newspaper articles ahead of publication , what troubled them the most was `` interactive '' component of the series , which they said lists the locations where the CIA , the National Security Agency and the other agencies that make up the intelligence community have facilities . Many of those sites are not publicly known , some officials said .

Officials worried about the security implications of such disclosures . As one person put it , `` these are targeted places to begin with . ... Mapping it out presents counterterrorism and counterintelligence concerns . ''

The officials say there have been discussions with the Washington Post to make changes in the website . It was not immediately known what , if any , changes were made , but an interactive map available Monday morning showed more than 2,000 government work locations and nearly 7,000 for private contractors .

In two communications , officials asked the Post not to publish addresses , the senior administration official said Monday .

There has been talk in Washington for some time that the Post was working on an investigative series on the intelligence community . But it 's only been in recent days that the deep concern of the intelligence officials has become more apparent .

The newspaper said it took steps to allay public safety concerns .

`` Because of the nature of this project , we allowed government officials to see the Web site several months ago and asked them to tell us of any specific concerns . They offered none at that time , '' the Post said in a message posted on its website . `` As the project evolved , we shared the Web site 's revised capabilities . Again , we asked for specific concerns . One government body objected to certain data points on the site and explained why ; we removed those items . Another agency objected that the entire Web site could pose a national security risk but declined to offer specific comments . ''

The message from the Mission Support Center of the director of national intelligence that was obtained by CNN told contractors , `` Employees should be reminded that they must neither confirm nor deny information contained in this , or any , media publication . ''

It warned that foreign intelligence services , terrorist groups and `` criminal elements '' might want to use the information .

`` Specifically , we recommend that companies affected by this publication and website assess and take steps to mitigate risk to their workforce , facility and mission , '' including `` re-enforcement of security and counterintelligence protections and steps to enhance workforce awareness . ''

Similar messages from the military and other agencies also went out .

CNN 's Pam Benson , Barbara Starr , Tom Cohen , Alan Silverleib and Ed Payne contributed to this report .
