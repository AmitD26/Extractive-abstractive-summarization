CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : We 're wrapping up the first week of November , and we 're glad to have you along for the ride . For CNN Student News , I 'm Carl Azuz .

First Up : Fort Hood Shootings

AZUZ : `` A horrific outburst of violence . '' That is how President Obama described yesterday 's deadly shooting at a military post in Texas . A gunman opened fire on a soldier processing center at Ft. Hood , killing at least 12 people and wounding dozens of others . According to military officials , the alleged gunman is in custody . Authorities said there was no immediate information about a motive behind the attack , but the Army has asked the FBI to help look into the suspect 's background . You can get the latest details on this developing story at CNN.com .

Health Care Debate

AZUZ : Back in the nation 's capital , the debate over health care reform is ratcheting up . The House of Representatives might vote on its health care bill this weekend . And yesterday , that bill , which has been backed primarily by House Democrats , picked up the support of two big groups : AARP and the AMA .

AARP is the country 's largest organization of older Americans . The group 's head says the house bill meets AARP 's goals when it comes to health care reform . The AMA , or American Medical Association , is one of the nation 's most influential medical groups . It said the bill does n't represent its views perfectly , but it 's close enough to earn the AMA 's support .

Many people , including most House Republicans , are opposed to the $ 1.1 trillion bill . Yesterday , they held a rally at the U.S. Capitol to speak out against it . One of their main criticisms is that the public option that 's included in the bill is basically a government takeover of the country 's health care system . Republicans have offered their own proposals , but they 've been rejected by Democrats , who are in the majority in the House . Yesterday , leaders from both parties spoke out against each other 's plans .

REP. JOHN BOEHNER , -LRB- R -RRB- HOUSE MINORITY LEADER : This weekend , the House of Representatives is likely to vote on Pelosi-care . This bill is the greatest threat to freedom that I have seen in the 19 years I have been here in Washington . Taking away your freedom to choose your doctor .

REP. NANCY PELOSI , -LRB- D -RRB- HOUSE SPEAKER : Anything you need to know about the difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is that the Republicans do not end health insurance companies ' discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions . Let that stand . That 's scandalous , the fact that it exists . I do n't understand why we have not heard the American people who have said that pre-existing conditions should not be a source of discrimination .

Benefits Extended

AZUZ : The House has passed a couple of economic measures that could help out two groups of people : the unemployed and first-time home buyers . The first part of this legislation extends the amount of time that people can collect unemployment benefits , something that millions of Americans are depending on right now . In all states , people who are out of a job could continue getting unemployment for an additional 14 weeks . But in states with an unemployment rate higher than 8.5 percent , the benefits would be extended for 20 weeks . The second measure is also an extension . This one is for an $ 8,000 tax credit that 's available to people buying a home for the first time . The Senate passed this legislation on Wednesday , and President Obama is expected to sign it into law today .

Tribal Leaders Summit

AZUZ : Yesterday , he took part in a White House conference with Native American leaders . During his speech , the president said that the U.S. government was guilty of mistreating Native Americans in the past , but he wants to build a new relationship between tribal leaders and the government . In order to do that , he 's ordered federal agencies to offer ideas on how Native American tribes can take part in government decisions . There are 564 federally recognized tribes in the U.S. . About two-thirds of them were represented at yesterday 's conference .

Shoutout

TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! Who is the current secretary-general of the United Nations ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Is it : A -RRB- Kofi Annan , B -RRB- Kurt Waldheim , C -RRB- Ban Ki-moon or D -RRB- Boutros Boutros-Ghali ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! Ban Ki-moon became the 8th U.N. secretary-general on January 1 , 2007 . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout !

Safety Assessment

AZUZ : Last week , Ban Ki-moon said that the U.N. is determined to carry out its mission of helping the people of Afghanistan build a better future . The statement came after an attack in the Asian country which claimed the lives of five U.N. workers . The United Nations is making some changes to its security measures in Afghanistan . Sara Sidner explains how .

SARA SIDNER , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : After the targeted attack on U.N. staff members here in a guarded guest house in Kabul that left five U.N. members dead , the United Nations has decided to make some changes . They are , for right now , sending out about 600 foreign workers here , and they 're going to assess right now the security situation for their staff .

They 're sending those workers out for about three weeks , and then intend to bring some of them back . But first , they want to figure out how to beef up security here .

Now , we understand though that the U.N. is very , very adamant that they are not pulling out of Afghanistan . They are simply looking at the security situation , obviously , after that traumatic time where five of their colleagues died . We should also mention that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is asking for about $ 85 million to beef up security here . Sara Sidner , CNN , Kabul .

Military Vaccines

AZUZ : Some U.S. forces serving in Afghanistan and Iraq may be getting their H1N1 flu shots soon . Just like with civilians , the military has a priority list that says who should get the vaccine first . But as Barbara Starr explains , there are some hang-ups in getting the doses out , even to the people at the top of that list .

-LRB- BEGIN VIDEO -RRB-

BARBARA STARR , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT : As Americans wait in lines across the country to get the H1N1 vaccine , the Pentagon this week finally began shipping limited vaccine supplies to troops fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq . Under Pentagon guidelines , tens of thousands of troops on the front line and those headed to war are the top military priority to receive the vaccine . Even so , supplies are severely limited . Only half of what is needed is now on the way .

GEOFF MORRELL , PENTAGON SPOKESMAN : Right now , we do n't have enough to even take care of all of them .

STARR : The Pentagon is defending plans to offer the vaccine to detainees at Guantanamo Bay , as well as those in Iraq and Afghanistan . Prisoners are considered to be high risk , but a lower military priority than troops , health care workers and civilian personnel .

STARR -LRB- Question -RRB- : I have n't heard an assurance that detainees will get it after civilians in this country .

MORRELL : Barbara , Barbara , Barbara , Barbara , you are presuming that I have the knowledge or the wherewithal to tell you the protocols that are being used for the general population . All I can do is speak to what the priorities are in this department .

STARR : Troops at home also a priority because they will be called upon to help in towns across the country if the crisis grows . The military 's top homeland defense commander has teams that could move into action .

GEN. GENE RENUART , COMMANDER , U.S. NORTHERN COMMAND : It would be to provide things like potentially logistics , movement of supplies , maybe additional health care providers that could assist in immunization .

STARR : The Pentagon stopped counting the number of troops that have come down with H1N1 back in July , when world health authorities declared a global pandemic . But privately military officials say the number of cases continues to grow , and recently , Defense Secretary Robert Gates received his vaccine . Barbara Starr , CNN , the Pentagon .

Jordan Shoes

AZUZ : It 's got ta be the shoes . Marcus Jordan , son of basketball legend Michael Jordan , wanted to be like Mike . He wore Nike `` Air Jordan '' shoes during an exhibition game Wednesday night . Not surprising , but Marcus plays for the University of Central Florida , and that school had a deal with Adidas , getting free uniforms , equipment and shoes , but only if Central Florida players wore the Adidas brand . When Marcus wore his dad 's Nikes , Adidas reportedly backed out of the contract , possibly costing central Florida as much as $ 3 million . A university official says they 're still trying to work this out .

It 's like one guy said to the other , you wan na race hospital beds ?
