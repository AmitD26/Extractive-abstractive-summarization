-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Punctuating the scenes of heroic rescue and devastating death in Haiti is another drama : moments of connection .

A man in Haiti identifies a woman he sees on the street as the missing person whose photo is posted on CNN 's iReport . A husband reels off the names of missing college students and a stranger hundreds of miles away confirms they are safe .

It is a scenario being played out again and again . Somehow , desperate pleas relayed mouth-to-mouth , through the Internet , on television and in text messages become fodder for celebration with the confirmation : They 're alive .

iReporter Wolin Delerme sent in a frantic video about her sister who had left for Haiti on Monday , a day before the 7.0-magnitude quake struck . Minutes after her plea aired on CNN , a man in Haiti contacted her .

`` He saw my sister not too far from where he 's standing , '' Delerme said .

Choking back tears , she said , `` I am very overwhelmed , and full of joy in my heart . There 's just no words that can explain it . I am just so happy . '' She has since spoken with her sister .

Kristy Springer sought information on her mother and several church members who were in Haiti on a missionary trip . `` I am here waiting for you mom . You need to be OK , '' Springer told iReport .

Her mother sent a text message at 1:30 a.m. Thursday . Everyone was `` at least safe for now . ''

iReport : Are you looking for loved ones ?

Much of Haiti 's infrastructure crumbled during the quake , knocking out power and other communication networks , further hampering people 's efforts to get word of missing relatives and friends .

Mark Frohardt is heading to Haiti with two `` radio suitcases , '' mobile communication devices with a range of about 30 miles that can tap into radio waves . A veteran of disaster efforts in the 2004 tsunami and the 2008 Pakistan quake , Frohardt hopes to disseminate critical information about humanitarian efforts over the radio in Haiti . As of Friday , 13 radio stations were up and running .

`` Part of that is ` family tracing , ' '' he said , `` working with organizations and radio stations on getting the word out -- who 's alive and getting messages back to loved ones . ''

There is no confirmed death toll from the earthquake . Bodies litter the streets of the capital , Port-au-Prince , and barely functioning clinics are overwhelmed with injured . Survivors wander the streets .

For loved ones seeking information on the missing , the wait is anguishing . Sometimes the answers that come are not reliable .

Len Gengel and his wife have endured a parent 's worst nightmare . Their daughter Brittany was visiting Haiti with a group of students from Lynn University in Florida .

The parents were initially told their daughter survived . Upon reaching South Florida for what they thought was going to be a reunion , the parents learned the original information was wrong . Brittany was still missing , along with three other students and two professors .

On Monday , Gengel spoke to Kenneth Merten , the U.S. ambassador to Haiti , on CNN `` We need American soldiers up there rescuing our children now , '' Gengel said . `` Time is of the essence . I beg you . '' Merten said he would do all he could .

The International Committee of the Red Cross has set up a Web site for people trying to find information on the fate of relatives in Haiti . However , inside Haiti , the Red Cross has not been able to collect and publish identities and whereabouts of survivors .

Frohardt , a vice president for Internews Network , hopes to help change that .

`` The focus , '' he says , is `` connecting the community so they know where all their loved ones are . ''
