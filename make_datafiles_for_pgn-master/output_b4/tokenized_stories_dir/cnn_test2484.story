-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As a concept , recycling has lived and died many times throughout its 4,000-year old history . But it always re-emerges as an idea when humans need it most , such as during the Great Depression , and later during World War II , when American companies recycled or reused around 25 percent of the waste stream .

Today , the global recycling industry generates $ 160 billion a year , processing more than 500 million tons of materials .

The industry is becoming one of the world 's biggest employers . While the official amount of people employed by the industry is 1.5 million worldwide , the real figure -- when you factor in illegal recycling operations in the developing world -- is likely to be much , much higher . The United Nations believes , for example , that as many as 10 million people in China alone are now in the recycling business .

What 's not to like about recycling ?

There are some fairly persuasive arguments for recycling , and for using recycled goods . Energy savings is just one of them . By reusing existing materials you are essentially removing the process involved in sourcing the `` virgin materials '' in the first place .

Take soda cans , made from aluminum . According to Friends of the Earth , creating a ton of these from scratch takes five times the amount of energy as it would to produce a ton of recycled cans . According to the Bureau of International Recycling -LRB- BIR -RRB- , the companies that manufacture recycled aluminum are using 95 percent less energy than if they were using `` virgin materials . '' -LRB- For plastics the energy savings are almost as high -- 80 percent , BIR says , while making paper from recycled paper -LRB- as opposed to wood -RRB- can save 64 percent of energy . -RRB-

Looking at it another way , according to the National Recycling Coalition , the amount of energy saved in one year by Americans recycling their soda cans , plastic containers , newspapers and packaging represented the energy equivalent of :

Not surprisingly , recycling also impacts pollution levels . BIR says producing paper from recycled paper as opposed to wood can slash air pollution by as much as 74 percent and water pollution by 35 percent ; while manufacturing recycled steel results in 86 percent less air pollution .

There are different types of pollution savings to be made , reducing the pollution generated by manufacturing the stuff in the first place . And then there is the pollution that results in dumping the waste in landfills , instead of recycling it . A recent report from the European Environment Agency -LRB- EEA -RRB- , for example , has predicted that greenhouse gas emissions from household waste will drop by more than 80 percent by 2020 -- largely because of increases in recycling levels which are diverting waste away from landfills .

And the carbon savings can be huge , even when a relatively small amount of effort has been made . The UK has one of Europe 's lowest recycling rates when it comes to municipal waste -- 27 percent . Yet , the impact on its carbon emissions has already become worthwhile , according to Waste & Resources Action Programme , or WRAP . WRAP says that these relatively minor efforts already mean a 10 million - to 15 million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide -LRB- CO2 -RRB- emissions a year -- the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars off the road .

What about the costs ? One of the main objections to the recycling movement has been the cost factor . Throwing something away is obviously going to be a lot cheaper than going through the hassle of recycling it . And certain materials are going to be a lot tougher to recycle than others , driving up costs and energy spent . But , as a 2004 study by research group GPI Atlantic found out , there are many different ways to measure cost .

GPI looked at the Canadian province of Nova Scotia , which back in the 1990s had decided that 50 percent of its trash was going to get recycled instead of landing up in incinerators or landfills . The annual cost to the province of doing this was $ 18 million more than it would have cost to chuck trash away . But , when different factors were considered , the number looked very different These factors included :

GPI concluded that Nova Scotia was in fact saving up to $ 125 million simply because it had embraced recycling .

The developing world 's gain ?

Arguably , recycling has seen the most economic success in the poorer parts of the world . According to the Earth Institute , the aluminum can recycling business in Brazil now employs more people than its car industry . Brazilians collecting used soda cans have boosted their earning power significantly , earning $ 200 a month against the standard minimum $ 81 monthly salary .

Then there are the inhabitants of a single 174-hectare slum in India 's largest city , Mumbai , that have managed to create a $ 1.3 billion recycling industry between them , according to the Observer . Dharavi is home to one million slum dwellers , with a quarter of them fully employed -LRB- albeit often illegally -RRB- in a recycling business which processes 80 percent of Mumbai 's plastic waste alone .

`` There is a lot to be learned from the developing world , '' the Observer quoted Friends of the Earth 's Claire Wilton as saying . `` Where a scavenger mentality , grassroots recycling and sheer necessity can lead to imaginative leaps in redeploying waste . ''

That being said , the economic impact may be welcomed by those in poorer countries sifting through everyone 's trash -- but the health impact still leaves a lot to be desired .

Around 70 percent of the world 's electronic waste ends up in southern China . A recent study by Hong Kong 's Baptist University found that the basic methods employed to recycle these items was having an unsettling effect on people living nearby , specifically women . Women in their mid-20s in one recycling site in Zheijiang Province were found to be carrying the highest levels of cancer-causing toxic chemicals like dioxins and furans than they had seen anywhere else in the world .

It is still too early to say what the long-term effects of these chemicals will be on these women , but it is likely that it will become clear when they attempt to have children . Dioxins and furans have been linked to reproductive problems specifically .

The researchers found that the women had twice the amount of dioxins in their breast milk and three times as much in their placentas as normal . They were also found to be at increasing risk of experiencing spontaneous abortions the longer they chose to live there . E-mail to a friend
