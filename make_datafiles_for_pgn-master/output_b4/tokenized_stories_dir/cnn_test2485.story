Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An alarm sounded when Alejandro Rea walked out of a Hollywood Boulevard clothing store earlier this month , signaling that he may be leaving with merchandise he did n't pay for .

Rea is deaf , so he did n't hear the alarm or the shouts from a security guard ordering him to stop . The 28-year-old kept walking out of the Forever 21 until he was tackled and placed in a choke-hold by the guard .

It was a drama that played out in front of dozens of tourists gathered on Hollywood 's Walk of Fame and near Grauman 's Chinese Theatre .

Pablo Rea , also hearing-impaired as are other members of the family , said it was frustrating watching the guard wrestle his brother for several minutes .

`` I can see my brother saying he could n't communicate , '' Pablo Rea said Thursday , speaking through an interpreter . `` It was like an immediate attack and my brother went limp and then he got in a choke-hold and became purple . ''

Rea 's lawyer , John Henrichs , is threatening to sue the store for using excessive force and causing injuries to Rea , something Forever 21 acknowledged in a statement .

`` We recognize that the security guard used excessive force , which is against our store policy and have suspended him indefinitely , '' the store said in a news release .

An advocacy group for the deaf wants the clothing store chain to train workers to be more sensitive to hearing-impaired customers .

`` We 're making sure that it wo n't happen again , '' said Patricia Hughes , CEO of the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness -LRB- GLAD -RRB- .

Video of the incident , shot by Joshua Fountain using his cell phone , has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since it was uploaded to YouTube .

`` His eyes were watery , '' Fountain , from Long Beach , California , said . `` He was practically purplish , reddish , so he was suffering , and he was continuing tapping on the security guard 's arm , telling him ` I 've had enough , I am submitting . ' ''

Alejandro Rea has not seen the video , since he has been held in a Los Angeles jail since his August 7 arrest . His court date is August 24 , and he has n't been able to pay his $ 56,000 bond .

Instead of a misdemeanor shoplifting charge , he faces felony second-degree robbery . His alleged violent resistance to the security guard and his prior arrest record apparently played a role in the more serious charge , the lawyer said .

Rea was convicted twice before on misdemeanor petty theft charges , in 2002 and 2008 , according to the Los Angeles District Attorney 's office said .

Henrichs said it does n't matter in the civil case if he was shoplifting , since it did not justify the brutal treatment by the guards .

`` The security guard , the same one , when they took him back in the office , threw him against the wall twice and so he has injuries from that and he is entitled to be compensated for that , '' Henrichs said .

Forever 21 could avoid a lawsuit with a settlement , Henrichs said , that should include a donation to Patricia Hughes ' organization .

`` Maybe they can turn a negative into a positive with donation to GLAD for sensitivity training for security workers , '' he said .

Pablo Rea has simple advice for security guards .

`` They should have tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention , '' Rea said .
