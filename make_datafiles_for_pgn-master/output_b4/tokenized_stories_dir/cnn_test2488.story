-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Thirteen townships in Australia 's flooded Queensland state were evacuated Thursday as forecasters warned it may be weeks before river levels start to drop .

All 130 residents of Condamine , about 185 miles inland from Brisbane , were evacuated because the town was inundated with water , Queensland Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts told CNN .

He said it was one of 13 townships where residents had to be moved out Thursday . In all , between 1,000 and 2,000 people have been evacuated , he said .

Roberts was in Emerald , an inland city of 15,000 residents that was experiencing some of the worst flooding Thursday . The Fitzroy River there was rising and expected to peak Friday at a record level of 16.2 meters -LRB- 53.2 feet -RRB- , according to Jeff Perkins , a supervising hydrologist at Australia 's Bureau of Meteorology .

`` Emerald is downstream of Fairbairn Dam . We 're expecting the dam to peak overnight tonight and Emerald to peak tomorrow , '' Perkins told CNN .

Rockhampton , a coastal city of 50,000 that is also affected by the Fitzroy River , was expected to see its worst flooding in 50 years next week , Perkins said .

`` It 's going to be a big flood over next week , up to about 9.4 meters -LRB- 30.8 feet -RRB- , which will be similar to the 1954 flood , '' Perkins said .

Many areas around the Fitzroy River will still be at flood stage in 10-14 days ' time , he said .

Elsewhere in Queensland , Australia 's northeast state , it was a mixed picture .

The town of Bundaberg peaked Thursday at 7.92 meters -LRB- 26 feet -RRB- , Perkins said . That level was expected to stay steady throughout the day but start to fall Friday , he said .

Parts of northern Queensland , however , were starting to recover from the monsoon rains that started about a week ago , creating the flooding problems , Perkins said . The rainfall has since moved south , flooding southern parts of the state , including Emerald and Rockhampton .

Over the entire month of December , Queensland has seen 1.3 meters -LRB- 4.3 feet -RRB- of rain -- most of which fell during the past four or five days , said Tony Auden , a forecaster with the Bureau of Meteorology .

`` There 's been numerous rainfall records both for individual days and for much of the year , and for the month as well for northern and eastern Queensland , '' Auden told CNN .

The rain is now easing , but it has left behind flooded rivers that continue to cause the problems , he said .

Eight areas of the state have been declared disaster situations , Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said . She said the flooding was the worst she 's ever seen .

`` What is unprecedented about what 's happening up here at the moment is just the scale and the number of communities affected , '' she said in an interview Thursday with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . `` I 've certainly seen flooded towns before in Queensland . We have big storms and we have big river systems . But I 've never seen Queensland -- and I think it 's without precedent in our recorded history -- with so many places in so many diverse parts of the state each affected so critically all at once . ''

The government of Queensland said additional police have been sent to many flood-affected areas including Emerald , Rockhampton and Bundaberg .

It asked drivers to be careful when driving over the New Year holiday throughout the state .

More than 100,000 liters -LRB- 26,400 gallons -RRB- of water was being trucked into the town of flooded town of Dalby on Thursday because it was left with only two days ' worth of drinking water supply , Roberts ' office said .

`` This is a proactive measure , initiated before the stocks were exhausted , '' Roberts said in a statement . `` The emergency was caused by the town 's water treatment plant being out of action after flood inundation . ''

Thirty-one of Queensland 's 73 communities are now receiving government disaster assistance , Prime Minister Julia Gillard 's office announced this week .

Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster-declared areas across Australia and work with state authorities to provide more assistance .
