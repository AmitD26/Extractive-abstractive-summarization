-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- All Americans who presented themselves at the United Nations camp in Bor , South Sudan , were evacuated safely Sunday amid deadly violence in the country , the State Department said . A State Department official said about 15 Americans were flown out .

U.S. personnel are working to confirm that no other U.S. citizens remain in Bor in need of evacuation , a State Department official said .

`` This morning , the United States -- in coordination with the United Nations and in consultation with the South Sudanese government -- safely evacuated American citizens from Bor , South Sudan , '' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement . `` U.S. citizens and citizens from our partner nations were flown from Bor to Juba on U.N. and U.S. civilian helicopters . The United States and the United Nations , which has the lead for securing Bor airport in South Sudan , took steps to ensure fighting factions were aware these flights were a humanitarian mission . ''

`` The U.S. government is doing everything possible to ensure the safety and security of United States citizens in South Sudan . We are working with our allies around the world to connect with and evacuate U.S. citizens as quickly and safely as possible , '' Psaki said .

The United Nations moved noncritical staff out of South Sudan 's capital , Juba , across the border into Uganda on Sunday , as the violence spread inside the world 's newest country .

U.N. civilian staff were moved from a compound in the flashpoint town of Bor to Juba on Saturday , the same day a U.S. mission to airlift Americans out was aborted when the aircraft came under fire .

U.S. President Barack Obama said in a letter to congressional leaders Sunday that 46 U.S. service members took part in the mission , and he noted he `` may take further action to support the security of U.S. citizens , personnel and property , including our Embassy , in South Sudan . ''

Four U.S. troops were wounded in the attack in Bor and were expected to be moved to the U.S. military hospital at Landstuhl , Germany , a senior U.S. official told CNN earlier Sunday .

One of the injured `` went through some pretty serious surgery '' after being taken to Nairobi , Kenya , for wounds from the gunshots fired at the aircraft . All four have been able to speak to their families .

Thousands displaced

Hundreds of people have been killed in a week of fighting , which has spread from Juba to oil fields farther north .

South Sudanese President Salva Kiir blamed soldiers loyal to his former vice president , Riek Machar , for starting the violence .

Up to 40,000 civilians have taken refuge in United Nations bases in the country , Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday .

`` There are many more thousands of people who are very much in fear and vulnerable , and at this time , the priority of the United Nations is to -LRB- protect -RRB- the lives of civilians , '' Ban told a news conference in the Philippines .

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates some 62,000 people have been displaced in total , with five of South Sudan 's ten states affected by the violence .

The U.N. has said some 20 people were killed during an attack Thursday by about 2,000 armed youths on a U.N. peacekeeping base in Jonglei state . Two Indian peacekeepers were also killed .

After the attack , the assailants fled with arms , ammunition and other supplies , the U.N. said .

` We will not be intimidated '

In a statement Sunday , the U.N. said it had made the decision to relocate noncritical staff from Juba to Entebbe , Uganda , as `` a precautionary measure to reduce pressures on its limited resources , '' while still providing assistance and shelter to more than 20,000 civilians who have gathered at its compounds in the capital .

The U.N. Mission in South Sudan is planning to reinforce its military presence in Bor and Pariang , the organization said . Plans are also under way to relocate all noncritical staff from the U.N. compound near Bentiu in Unity state , and reinforcements will also be sent in .

`` We are not abandoning South Sudan . We are here to stay , and will carry on in our collective resolve to work with and for the people of South Sudan , '' U.N. envoy Hilde F. Johnson said in the statement . `` To anyone who wants to threaten us , attack us or put obstacles in our way , our message remains loud and clear : we will not be intimidated . ''

Ban said the U.N. would `` transfer our assets from other peacekeeping missions , '' such as the one in the Democratic Republic of Congo and other areas , to the troubled country .

`` We also seeking support from other key countries who can provide the necessary assets , '' he said . `` We are in shortage of capacity . When the United Nations compound was overrun by 2,000 armed elements , we were having difficulties . ''

Echoing calls from Western governments , Ban urged an end to the violence and called on Kiir and Machar `` to come to the table and find a political way out of this crisis . ''

`` They are responsible to the people of South Sudan to end the crisis and find the political means of addressing their differences , '' he said .

Ban said he had dispatched a special representative to Juba to work with the U.N. envoy in the city . Washington is also sending an envoy .

Tensions have been high in South Sudan since July , when Kiir dismissed Machar and the rest of the Cabinet . The move inflamed tensions between Kiir 's Dinka community and Machar 's Nuer community .

South Sudan formally split from Sudan in 2011 after a referendum , following decades of conflict . Numerous armed groups remain active in the oil-rich country .
