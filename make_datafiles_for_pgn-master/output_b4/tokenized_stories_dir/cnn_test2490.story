That 's what contestant Caitlin Burke , 26 , said after her remarkable `` Wheel of Fortune '' solve that won her a Carribbean vacation .

With just one letter revealed -- `` L '' -- Burke correctly guessed the seven-word phrase : `` I 've got a good feeling about this . ''

Even Pat Sajak , the show 's host , was shocked , according to video from Sony Pictures Studios .

`` Wait a minute . Let me get over this first , '' he said , smiling . `` Is it just me , or was that the most amazing solve we 've ever had ? ''

Burke , who lives in New York , said she is a huge `` Wheel of Fortune '' fan and often impresses her family and friends by solving puzzles when they watch at home .

`` I 'm not bragging . There 's a million and one things I 'm not good at , but for some reason , I do n't know , I 've always just been really good at ` Wheel of Fortune , ' '' she said .

The show aired last week .

When asked what advice she could offer to aspiring contestants , Burke said practice . `` Watch the show and think positive . ''

Appropriately , she added : `` If you have a good feeling about something , just go for it ! ''
