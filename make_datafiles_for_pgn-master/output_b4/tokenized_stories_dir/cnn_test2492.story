LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- As an organization they 're used to investing billions of dollars in scientific experiments that further our knowledge of earth and space . But the only bill to speak of on this occasion is orange and attached to the body of a rubber duck .

Scientists from NASA hope that rubber ducks will help them better understand glacier movements .

In the name of climate change science , researchers at NASA have dropped 90 rubber ducks into holes of Greenland 's fastest moving glacier : the Jakobshavn Glacier in Baffin Bay .

Scientists remain unsure as to why glaciers speed up their movement in the summer months and it is hoped that the rubber ducks -- labeled with the words `` science experiment '' and `` reward '' in three languages , along with an email address -- will shed some light on the phenomenon .

One theory is that the summer sun melts ice on the surface of the glacier which creates pools of water which then flow into moulins -- narrow tubular shafts in the glacier . These then transport the water from the top to the underside of the glacier .

It 's thought that this base water acts as a lubricant to speed up the movement of the glacier towards the sea .

It is hoped the ducks will help show how the water moves through the ice .

In conjunction with the ducks , Nasa has also launched a GPS probe which they hope will tell them more about the inner workings of the glacier .

So far , neither the probe nor any of the ducks have turned up .

Alberto Behar of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California told Reuters : `` We have n't heard back but it may take some time until somebody actually finds it and decides to send us an e-mail that they have found it . ''

The Jakobshavn Glacier is responsible for seven percent of all ice which is peeling off Greenland and its ice sheets could contribute to sea levels rising this century .

The glacier 's menace was also felt last century . Experts believe that it was the source of the iceberg which sank the Titanic in 1912 .

It 's not the first time rubber ducks have helped scientists track water flows . Thousands fell into the sea in 1992 when a container ship bound for Seattle from China shed its load in a storm in the Pacific Ocean . The ducks spent years at sea and washed up in all corners of the globe , telling oceanographers much about the surface currents of the oceans .
