LAGOS , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Nigerian militant group tangling with government forces in the country 's southern oil-producing region declared `` an all-out war '' Friday after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians .

Militants from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta have declared war on Nigerian troops .

The military , meanwhile , pressed ahead against the fighters , wresting control of a hijacked tanker and capturing a militant stronghold .

The developments are the latest in the escalating hostilities between the government and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta , which demands that more of the country 's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians

In e-mail messages to reporters , the militant group said it sank six army gunboats , destroyed three others and captured three in the restive Niger Delta region .

`` Many soldiers have been killed , and the military has made a hasty retreat , '' said the group , which is calling on `` men of fighting age to enlist '' in its battle against government forces .

Also , the group said , it had captured personnel from a Nigerian warship deployed from Liberia to help the military and was `` in the process '' of torching the vessel .

`` We have some casualties on our side , obviously , '' a militant spokesman said . `` Obviously , the battle is more serious as night comes . ''

Col. Rabe Abubakar , spokesman for the Nigerian military 's joint task force , confirmed exchanges of fire between government forces and militants and reported the seizure of a militant camp , saying one soldier was wounded and the militants `` suffered a lot of casualties . ''

The troops are conducting cordon-and-search operations designed to nab militants in their suspected hideouts along the southern region 's creeks .

Abubakar said that the military conducted a successful `` rescue '' mission of a recently hijacked oil condensate tanker , and that the captain and the crew , some foreign , were safe .

The militant group said Nigerian troops fired stray bullets that killed a Filipino `` hostage '' on the ship in Delta state , but the Nigerian military could n't confirm the killing of a `` foreign hostage . ''

The violence , which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking , has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria .

The militant group said Friday the country 's armed forces conducted `` indiscriminate aerial bombardment on the defenseless civilians in the Gbaramatu area of Delta state . '' It said the strikes were punishment `` for the humiliating defeat '' of the army in raids on two militant camps Wednesday .

`` Casualties are mostly women , children and the elderly who could not get away quickly into the bush or high sea , '' the militant group said .

It also repeated its `` directive '' for oil companies in the region to `` evacuate by the deadline of midnight today and cease oil production until further notice . ''

The military made reference to the directive , saying it is responding to attacks on troops , hijackings of vessels and threats to innocent people , such as the `` expatriates who were given ultimatum to leave the region by the militants . '' It characterized the various claims by the militants as `` propaganda . ''

`` We are not at war with any individuals or groups in the region , '' Abubakar said . `` Ours is to protect lives and property and also to rid the region of criminals who hide under the guise of struggle agenda to perpetrate crime . ''
