-LRB- Oprah.com -RRB- -- At the small worktable in Anna Rabinowicz 's sunny Manhattan office , smooth slices of agate -- some as small as coins , others as big as dinner plates , in swirling shades of sapphire , rust , and olive -- mingle with wrist-thick hunks of faceted crystal , three knobby yellow gourds , and a dried version of Anna 's latest muse .

`` A neat thing about sea fans , '' says Anna , 39 , who is wearing silver sea-fan-shaped earrings , `` is how they move . '' She imitates the meshlike creature 's undulations with her hand . `` They 're at the whim of the current ; they get their nutrients from whatever happens to pass through . ''

She lifts the stainless steel colander/fruit bowl she recently designed based on her sea fan research , its sides veined with silver tendrils . If a sea fan mated with a Rolex , this would be the result .

I 'm spending today dipping a toe into the ocean of Anna 's creative output -- and the colander is just one of the creatures in a vast and lively sea . The woman draws , sews , sculpts , and dreams things up as naturally as the rest of us breathe . For her company , RabLabs , she designs coasters , clocks , and picture frames from those pieces of agate , along with handblown-glass napkin rings , amethyst bottle stoppers , and lacquered wooden boxes -- and at home , her creative juices just keep on flowing . Over eight hours with Anna , I 'll discover that her default thought process works like this :

That -LSB- sea fan , kangaroo , hunk of quartz , sequined fabric -RSB- is fascinating . I must learn all about it and then make something !

Next comes studying , sketching , model-making , and finally , the finished product -- which might be anything from a letter opener to a medical device to a fetching new cape .

Oprah.com : How one woman was saved by a poem

When I arrived this morning at Anna 's apartment , she told me that a full day lay ahead : We 'd go shopping for supplies to create a prototype of a new RabLabs bowl -LRB- a mission that would require walking about 40 city blocks -RRB- , we 'd have searching discussions about creativity , and we 'd get our hands really dirty . Hey , who ever said innovating was a cakewalk ?

`` I tell my students , ` If it 's easy to create , someone has probably already created it , ' '' says Anna , who teaches product design at Parsons The New School for Design . `` Work through the setbacks , and you can make things no one else has . ''

Like the unique items in Anna 's home , for example . The light fixture that resembles an upside-down red umbrella . The key ring of plastic doodads she assembled for her 1-year-old , Talia , to teethe on . -LRB- `` Her body is telling her to bite . She must bite ! So I give her these , to keep her from biting me . '' -RRB- The little cloth squares she sewed for Talia and her 3-year-old brother , Izzy , to sleep with -- they 're soft and worn , and hand-embroidered with trees and abstract whorls and the babies ' initials . `` I cut them from my husband 's old T-shirts , '' says Anna , whose husband , Aden Fine , is a lawyer for the ACLU .

Even Anna 's home is an Anna original : Three years ago , she and Aden bought a dim studio in a former sewing factory , then gut-renovated the space into a snug two-bedroom nest , with floor-to-ceiling windows and a kitchen bedecked in vintage red tiles .

Anna 's mother , Lisa , arrives to take Talia to baby dance class just as Anna is describing her collaborations with New York 's Hospital for Special Surgery . `` My dad made surgical instruments , '' says Anna , who has helped create an artificial knee and an assistive device for people recovering from elbow surgery . `` He was a pediatric ophthalmologist and surgeon . He taught me how to sew and solder . ''

`` She has her father 's hand-eye coordination , '' Lisa chimes in . `` And such fine-motor control . ''

`` Thank you , '' Anna says , looking moved . She pulls out her sewing kit from the 1890s -- her father , who died in 2001 , bought it at an antiques market . `` Look at all these crazy needles , '' she says . There are thick needles , teeny needles , needles that look like fish hooks . `` I sew by hand , '' she tells me , `` so the project will be imbued with my love . ''

Oprah.com : How to write a poem

After Lisa and Talia depart , Anna and I go on a coffee run . I ask her about Stanford 's Joint Program in Design -- where she was the third-ever person to graduate with both an MFA in design and an MS in engineering . For her thesis , she traveled to Australia , enticed kangaroos to bounce on treadmills while she tracked their motion using high-speed video , and created chairs that mimic their movements .

`` A kangaroo uses its tail like a third leg , leaning on it to push off for the next hop , '' Anna explains . When you sit in her kangaroo chair , it reclines on its curved tail and gently bounces forward -- like a movie theater seat only much more fun .

While I 'm still processing the concept of marsupial furniture , Anna is already onto the business at hand : buying materials for the RabLabs bowl prototype . She 's envisioning a ceramic vessel encrusted with crystal-like formations -- sort of an inside-out geode . She 'll make the mock-up with real crystal , using clay to affix the stones to a steel mixing bowl , then create a mold of the whole piece , which she 'll use to cast the ceramic version . Beneath her desk , wrapped in Portuguese newspaper , is 50 pounds of Brazilian crystal waiting for its shot at glory .

To find the right steel bowl , we visit a baking shop . The place is packed ceiling-high with little objects that light up all kinds of circuits in Anna 's mind : shiny pastry tips -LRB- `` These could be molds for crystal-covered salt and pepper shakers '' -RRB- , cardboard cake bases laminated in gold paper -LRB- `` We 'll use this as a work surface -- the gold feels auspicious '' -RRB- , and an accordion squeeze bottle -LRB- `` I do n't know why , but I need this '' -RRB- . On the way out , Anna marvels at pouches of red , brown , and yellow goo -- pastry filling , it turns out -- and decides it 's lunchtime .

As she eats her chicken-chermoula sandwich , bought from a food truck on Fifth Avenue , Anna says , `` There 's this book called ` I Stink ! ' ''

`` I stink ? ''

`` It 's about a garbage truck that adores gross stuff , '' she says , `` like dog poop and fish heads . Izzy laughed and laughed when my husband read it to him , because it 's a bit mischievous . Kids have to follow so many rules , but a book like ` I Stink ! ' lets them be vicariously rascally without breaking the rules . Designing is like that . The rule is that the object has to perform its function . But within that rule , you can do anything -- the object can be witty or silly or weird . ''

We nod , considering this .

`` You stink , '' I say .

Anna smiles . `` I stink ! ''

Oprah.com : Essential pleasures

After lunch , we head downtown to buy clay from the art supply store -- though Anna beelines for the gift wrap and letterpress stationery -LRB- `` This is paper geek heaven ! '' -RRB- . In the pen aisle , she laments that her favorite model , the Pilot Razor Point II , has been unavailable for the past year . In its place she 's been using pens her Korean students brought her from their visits home .

She puts a squat , gray felt-tip to a sheet of paper , moving her arm as decisively as a symphony conductor . `` That 's what 's called an emotive line , '' she says . In the way a jagged line might suggest turmoil and a squiggle could evoke confusion , Anna 's ascending swoop reads joie de vivre . Then she draws a guy with big curly hair .

Back at the office , she puts on Hall & Oates 's `` Kiss on My List '' and lays out the gold work surface , the gray clay , and translucent columns of crystal in sizes ranging from raspberry to cucumber . We begin cocooning the bowl with clay for the crystals to smoosh into , as I explain that I 'm much too impatient to be good at making things . `` I 'm always rushing to finish , '' I tell her . `` I do n't have it in me to keep refining until it 's perfect . ''

Looking at the prototype , it seems I 've proven myself right : One side is stunning , and the other side is mine . Anna has anchored two eight-inch columns of quartz in the clay surrounding the bowl and is now accentuating them with smaller satellite crystals . She 's edging the place where the clay meets the rock into a kind of cuticle to the crystal 's nail . If you squint , you can envision the final product : an improbable , precious thing , plucked from the Earth and yet made by a human hand .

Anna turns the cardboard and considers my work . She adds more cuticles , tweaks the angles of the crystals , and carves where I 've over-clayed . But for all her refining , what I 've contributed -- my inter-crystal spacing , rim-smoothing , and reinforced clay base -- remains . It 's just been gently Anna-fied .

`` This is really interesting work ! '' she says , seeming to sense my hunger for praise . Anna likes to say that a designer must understand human need : Check .

A designer must also find creative potential in what 's around her , and Anna does -- in bouncing kangaroos and ratty T-shirts and charmless studio apartments . Think of her as a human sea fan , open to the myriad unknown things riding the current , which she uses to make the world a little more fascinating , and a little more Anna , than it would otherwise be .
