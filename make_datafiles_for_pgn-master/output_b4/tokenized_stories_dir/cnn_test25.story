-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A possible constitutional crisis loomed in Malawi following the reported death of President Bingu wa Mutharika , once hailed as a positive steward for the southern African country .

Mutharika , 78 , died of a heart attack on Thursday and his body was flown to South Africa , according to government sources .

However , there was no formal government statement announcing his death , and the chaotic politics of the impoverished nation raised questions about what happens next .

Under the constitution , Vice President Joyce Banda would succeed Mutharika .

However , Banda was expelled from the ruling Democratic People 's Party in 2010 in a dispute with Mutharika over the president 's efforts to position his brother rather than the vice president as his eventual successor .

Banda formed her own party , but remained vice president .

A government spokeswoman declined to discuss reports of the president 's death but declared that the vice president can not take over the presidency .

`` The conduct of the honorable Joyce Banda in forming her own opposition party precludes her from being eligible to succeed the presidency , '' said Patricia Kaliati , who serves as information and civic education minister .

In a news conference earlier Friday , Banda told reporters she was kept `` in the dark '' regarding the president 's condition .

However , the Malawi defence forces , which provides security for the sitting president , shifted security members to Banda 's residence amid news of the death .

While declining to comment on the president 's condition , Kaliati appealed to Malawi residents to remain calm and only listen to information coming from official government sources .

The United States and Britain have urged Malawi to observe the succession process in the constitution .

`` We are concerned about the delay in the transfer of power . We trust that the vice president who is next in line will be sworn in shortly , '' said Johnnie Carson , the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs .

During her news conference , Banda , along with former President Bakili Muluzi , called on Malawians to adhere to the constitution regarding the issue of succession .

Mutharika , a former World Bank economist who studied in the United States and other countries , was elected president in 2004 after campaigning as an `` economic engineer . '' He won re-election five years later for a term scheduled to end in 2014 .

His initial years in office were considered a success as he focused on battling corruption and working to improve the economy .

He implemented a subsidy program for agricultural products that was credited with boosting the economy of the largely agrarian nation . Malawians welcomed his focus on reducing reliance on food aid and attaining self-sufficiency .

However , his popularity plunged in recent years as the economy faltered and the nation faced chronic fuel shortages and frequent power blackouts .

Anti-government groups accused Mutharika of dragging Malawi back into a dictatorship , citing the passage of bills they say infringe on citizen rights .

Protesters took to the streets last year demanding immediate government action to address the economic plight . Security forces cracked down , leading to more than a dozen deaths and sparking international condemnation .

Critics also accused Mutharika of jeopardizing international relations and risking foreign aid that benefits the nation 's poor .

Last year , Mutharika expelled a British envoy who was quoted criticizing him in a leaked diplomatic cable , straining relations with one of Malawi 's largest foreign donors . In return , Britain asked Malawi 's top envoy to leave the country and rescinded her invitation to the royal wedding .

At the time , London said it was halting `` all general budget support '' to the nation .

Last month , the United States announced it was suspending $ 350 million allocated to Malawi because of concerns about its democratic governance .
