-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- What color underwear did you wear on New Year 's Eve ?

Your choice may say something about your culture and your hopes for 2012 -- as might whether you decide to ring in the new year by smashing dishes , respectfully bowing to your elders or feasting on everything from cabbage to sticky rice soup to black-eyed peas .

As they do every December 31 , revelers around the world spent Saturday-into-Sunday ushering in the new year in distinctive ways . One of the most common was by watching fireworks light up the nighttime sky , though this was just one of many ways people found to celebrate and do all they could to ensure that the next 12 months proceed as they wish .

And yes , underwear is one way to state your intentions -- at least in many South American countries , including Brazil and Argentina .

If you wore yellow , that supposedly enhances your chances for abundance and reaping in more money . If it was red , then you 'll more likely find love in 2012 . And if you were sporting white underpants , preferably new and clean , then peace was your top priority for the coming year .

One New Year 's theme that resonates across borders , ages and ethnic groups is feasting on foods in an effort to boost your prospects for the future . But the menu varies from place to place .

Cabbage represents money and sauerkraut is for living a long life for some of Northern European ancestry , for instance . People in Spain and many Latin American countries down 12 grapes , one each to `` guarantee '' a month of happiness . In parts of the American South , year-round favorites black-eyed peas , ham and collard greens carry special importance over the New Year 's holiday .

People in the nation of Georgia do n't count on a chef for good luck . Rather , they rely on the first person to come through their home 's door after midnight -- a person who , theoretically , will bring them fortune for the following year . Snacking on candy on New Year 's Eve is another way , in the former Soviet territory , to ensure that 2012 is likewise sweet , and not bitter .

Brazilians try to optimize their prospects for the coming year by jumping waves or , if they are not near the beach , eating lentil soup or handing out money . Besides raucously banging together pots and pans , Filipinos eat round fruits to bring good fortune .

Some New Year 's traditions have nothing to do with luck . A front stoop littered with broken plates in Denmark , for instance , suggests that the person inside has a lot of friends since , each New Year 's Eve , people throw their old dishes at the doors of their friends ' homes .

The agenda for fun in Canada depends on where you are , from partying at a `` reveillon '' in Quebec to imbibing Screech rum in Newfoundland to savoring `` beaver tail '' -- a Canadian fried dough treat -- in Ontario .

Still , for all those who partake in grand New Year 's events , there are many more who make their own traditions .

It may be a small gathering of family and friends , watching the Times Square ball drop on TV , or loudly running through the neighborhood . Some may simply go to sleep early , so they can be energized for an early New Year 's Day hike -- perhaps while wearing underwear that suits their mood , and wishes , for 2012 .
