-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Jean-Bertrand Aristide , Haiti 's first democratically elected president , who has been living in exile in South Africa for seven years , has been issued a new passport to return home , the Haitian interior minister said Wednesday .

Paul-Antoine Bien-Aime said the diplomatic passport was handed over to Aristide 's U.S. attorney Ira Kurzban , who picked it up in Port-au-Prince Tuesday evening .

That removes a major obstacle that has prevented Aristide from making the journey back . However , Kurzban said last month that Aristide would still need the cooperation of South Africa and the United States to make the journey home .

Kurzban also said last month that Aristide had no intention of re-entering politics . But Washington has already signaled its displeasure .

`` We do not doubt President Aristide 's desire to help the people of Haiti . But today Haiti needs to focus on its future , not its past , '' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said last month . `` This is an important period for Haiti . What it needs is calm , not divisive actions that distract from the task of forming a new government . ''

The former Roman Catholic priest , who became a voice for Haiti 's impoverished , remains a polarizing figure but commands a large following in his homeland .

Jacob Francois , coordinator for Aristide 's Fanmi Lavalas party in the United States , predicted crowds would greet Aristide upon his return .

`` It will be the greatest party of this decade , '' Francois said . `` Once again the world will see that President Aristide is the most revered politician in the history of Haiti . ''

Aristide left Haiti on a U.S. jet in 2004 after a bloody revolt by street gangs and soldiers . The leftist former president says he was shuttled out by Western powers .

Aristide has long expressed his desire to go home . He reiterated that wish just days after former dictator Jean-Claude `` Baby Doc '' Duvalier returned to Haiti in January .

`` Once again I express my readiness to leave today , tomorrow , at any time , '' Aristide said in a January statement . `` The people of Haiti have never stopped calling for my return to Haiti . ''

His return would come at crucial time in Haiti 's history .

The Caribbean nation 's efforts to recover from a devastating 2010 earthquake has been compounded by a cholera epidemic and political chaos sparked by allegations of fraud in the presidential elections held in late November .

A runoff is scheduled in March and a winner will not be known until April .
