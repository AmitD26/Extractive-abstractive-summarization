-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Early this month , Jim O'Neill , the former Goldman Sachs economist who coined the term `` BRICs '' -LRB- Brazil , Russia , India , and China -RRB- , appeared on a weeklong BBC series in which he introduced yet another acronym to describe a new group of emerging economies , the `` MINTs '' -LRB- Mexico , Indonesia , Nigeria and Turkey -RRB- .

The BRICs acronym kindled a lot of interest among investors eager to find the next `` big thing , '' while increasing attention to a group of nations that suffered from ongoing economic crisis during the 1990s .

But considering that the BRICs economies have not done so well in recent years , perhaps it 's not a good idea to introduce another acronym . Doing so suggests that we focus on these nations ' economies while overlooking key differences in their political , economic , and social welfare systems .

While working as Goldman Sachs ' chief economist in 2001 , O'Neill was struck by how fast Brazil , Russia , India , and China 's economies were growing . This motivated him to introduce the BRICs acronym in a Goldman Sachs working paper titled `` Building Better Global Economic Brics . ''

Even from an economic point of view , in recent years , though , the BRICs have not done so well . Brazil 's GDP growth level declined from 7.5 % in 2010 to 0.9 % in 2012 , ; Russia 's from 4.5 % in 2010 to 1.3 % in 2013 ; India 's from 10.5 % in 2010 to approximately 4.4 % in 2013 , while China 's decreased from 10.4 % in 2010 to a still substantial 7.6 % in 2013 .

Using the BRICs acronym also obscures the fact that these nations are rather different , ranging from democratic to authoritarian regimes .

The BRICs vary considerably in their health and educational outcomes . While Brazil and China have relatively successful public health care systems , Brazil 's educational system lacks adequate resources and has n't succeeded at building a skilled work force , while China 's education system is producing a large number of skilled college graduates . Russia and India 's governments are failing to adequately invest in health and education , the product of a lack of political commitment and inadequate funding .

Despite the appeal of the MINTs idea , those countries are not looking too good either . Most are seeing lowered rates of economic growth .

Because of a decline in exports and industrial production , the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- slashed Mexico 's predicted GDP growth rate from 3.9 % in 2012 to 2.9 in 2013 and 3.2 % in 2014 . In Indonesia , the World Bank projected that economic growth will slow from 5.6 % in 2013 to 5.3 % in 2014 , considerably lower than the 6.2 % average in 2012 .

According to the IMF , however , Nigeria 's GDP growth is expected to rise from 6.2 % in 2013 to 7.4 % in 2014 , the product of increased oil exports , economic stability , and increased domestic consumption . Yet the situation in Turkey is n't as peachy . GDP growth decreased from 9.2 % in 2010 to 3.6 % in 2013 , with an OECD forecast of 3.8 % in 2014 .

And just as with the BRIC nations , the MINTs exhibit different political institutions . Mexico and Indonesia are presidential democracies with relatively stable political coalitions . Nigeria is also a presidential democracy challenged by political corruption and ethnic conflict . And Turkey has struggled with corruption and a lack of toleration for dissent .

While Mexico and Turkey have succeeded in extending universal health care coverage for the poor and providing medical services , their education system , as well as Indonesia and Nigeria 's , are weak , leading to a low level of college graduates and a small skilled labor force . Indonesia and Nigeria 's health care systems have also had insufficient resources , doctors and nurses .

Adopting the MINTs acronym could lead us to expect too much , too soon . There 's a lot more to an emerging nation than its economy : if citizens lack good health care and access to quality education , the country is unlikely to realize its potential .

Indeed , even Jim O'Neill admits that it 'll take at least 30 years to see if the MINTs become economic powerhouses .

Therefore , let 's give the MINTs a bit more time to nurture their economies , strengthen their political institutions , and more importantly , invest in their people before we make them models for the rest of the world .

Eduardo J. Gómez : The notion of MINTs may have similar flaws to the BRICs

MINT nations -- Mexico , Indonesia , Nigeria , Turkey -- face big and different challenges , he says

Give them time to develop further before making them models for the world , he says
