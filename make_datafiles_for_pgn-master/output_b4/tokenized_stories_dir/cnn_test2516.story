-LRB- Rolling Stone -RRB- -- One question loomed large before Friday 's Alice in Chains concert at Madison Square Garden : How would new singer William Duvall measure up to Layne Staley , the band 's original front man , who died in 2002 ?

On `` Black Gives Way to Blue , '' the album Alice in Chains released last year with Duvall -LRB- ending a fourteen-year hiatus for the group -RRB- , the new guy sounds remarkably like Staley . In concert , the similarity became almost eerie : The band kicked off its set by nailing the first three tracks from 1992 's `` Dirt , '' -LRB- `` Them Bones , '' `` Dam That River '' and `` Rain When I Die '' -RRB- , with Duvall recreating Staley 's vocal lines with the same studiousness of guitarist Jerry Cantrell , who delivered his solos note-for-note .

In that sense , Alice in Chains have changed : The show felt more like a recital than an exorcism , as it would have with Staley .

Still , the crowd responded with cheers when Cantrell introduced `` Rooster '' by saying , `` It 's been a long , strange trip , and I 'm really glad it 's still going . '' It 's going great , in fact , `` Black Gives Way to Blue '' has sold over half a million copies and produced three number one tracks on the Mainstream Rock chart .

The band 's not on the nostalgia circuit : They 're arena rockers , and the polish they put on their music just comes with the territory . So do fans who know every word to the new songs , but shuffle off to buy a t-shirt during classic tracks like `` Down in a Hole '' and the ever-creepy `` Love , Hate , Love . ''

The set , though , cohered well , with the new acoustic song `` Your Decision '' sliding in alongside ' 94s `` No Excuses '' as if the two were written in the same era , and the `` Black Gives Way to Blue '' track `` Check My Brain '' just as clobbering as the four older tunes that came before it . Cantrell and company are playing to their strengths , and on Friday , they sounded about as strong as they ever have .

Opening act Deftones , meanwhile , held their own , especially when they played more recent material , which blends dreamy atmospherics into the band 's ultra-heavy attack . Frontman Chino Moreno , who has at times been criticized for sluggish performances , proved to be the night 's most energetic performer , bounding across the stage and unleashing his primal screams .

Before the show , Moreno told `` Rolling Stone '' that he has reevaluated his lifestyle since a 2008 car accident that left original Deftones bassist Chi Cheng in a semi-vegetative state .

`` I watched some old videos of us , and I got choked up , '' he said . `` It made me think about a lot of the things I was doing and the way I was living , and gave me an appreciation for life . My new drug is sweating . Now I go onstage and I feel lighter on my feet -- I feel more agile . ''

The Deftones and Alice in Chains sets both had an undercurrent of loss . But by night 's end , the overwhelming sense was of rebirth .
