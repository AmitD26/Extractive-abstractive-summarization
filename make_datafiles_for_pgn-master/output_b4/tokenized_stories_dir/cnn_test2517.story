San Angelo , Texas -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The state and defense rested their cases in the penalty phase of convicted polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs ' trial Monday .

The defense did not call any witnesses and it was not immediately clear when closing statements and deliberations would begin .

Jurors weighing punishment for Jeffs heard audio recordings earlier in the day that prosecutors say show he had sex with underage girls and encouraged group sex .

At times difficult to hear , one of the tapes recorded sounds of two people apparently engaging in intercourse . Other recordings captured Jeffs instructing what prosecutors say were underage girls in how to please him . Girls could be heard giggling in the background .

Prosecutors also presented evidence that Jeffs knew he was wanted by federal authorities and was aware that if people outside his community knew about his behavior , they would be extremely upset .

FBI Special Agent John Broadway testified that Jeffs ordered the destruction of various discs and transcripts three days after an arrest warrant was issued for him on June 10 , 2005 . The polygamist sect leader established `` houses of hiding , '' allegedly with young girls for him to marry , Broadway said .

The FBI agent also read from a priesthood record , in which Jeffs allegedly wrote : `` Things are happening so quickly . There is an even younger girl that the Lord wants me to take . She is 13 . For some reason the Lord is sending me these girls that can be worked with . ''

Jeffs also wrote : `` If the world knew what I was doing , they would hang me from the highest tree , '' according to evidence presented in court .

Jeffs was convicted last week on two counts of sexual assault on a child .

Jeffs ' nephew and niece had testified Saturday about the alleged abuse they suffered at his hands .

Brent Jeffs , 28 , told jurors that his uncle raped him when he was 5 years old .

`` He began to tell me that we were going to do God 's will , '' he said Jeffs told him . `` This is between me , you and God . ''

Three jurors wiped tears from their eyes as Brent Jeffs spoke , his voice breaking with emotion .

Several also cried during the niece 's testimony , in which she described an incident that allegedly occurred between her and Jeffs when she was 8 years old .

`` He made me sit on his lap , '' she testified , and did `` inappropriate things to me . ''

She was crying so hard at one point that the prosecutor stopped questioning . Neither side pressed her for details . CNN is withholding the niece 's name because she is the alleged victim of a sexual assault . Brent Jeffs has published a book about his life and has previously been public about the allegations against his uncle .

Jeffs , the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his `` spiritual wives . ''

He could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old . For the other count , he could face a sentence of two to 20 years .

The charges were filed after a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado , Texas .

During the first day of the sentencing hearing Friday , Jeffs said he objected to the introduction of items seized in the raid and documents that should get `` religious protection . ''

He requested to be excused from the sentencing phase to avoid hearing his religion degraded .

`` I am God . Cease . Do not present my holy ways as a thing of naught , '' the self-proclaimed prophet said before he left court Friday . `` Hear my warning as a full awakening . Let my holy way be of freedom . ''

Deric Walpole , one of the defense attorneys Jeffs had fired earlier in trial , is representing him during the penalty phase .

Jeffs represented himself during the guilt-innocence phase of the trial . He was silent during most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday , mumbling at one point , `` I am at peace . ''

Monday was not the first time jurors heard audio recordings . Texas prosecutors rested their case last week after playing a key piece of evidence : A 20-minute audiotape that began and ended with a man saying a prayer .

Prosecutors alleged that the recording was of Jeffs ' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other `` wives . ''

The girl had grown up at Jeffs ' Yearning for Zion ranch , authorities said .

Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of her with her arms around Jeffs , and a marriage certificate that listed the girl 's age as 12 at the time .

Jurors also heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young `` wives '' on how to sexually please him in order to win God 's favor .

Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs ' `` spiritual wife '' and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15 .

Jeffs ' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers . Their practice of polygamy , which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago , is part of the sect 's doctrine .
