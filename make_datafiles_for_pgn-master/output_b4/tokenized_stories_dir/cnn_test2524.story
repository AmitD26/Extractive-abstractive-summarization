-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tournament favorite Maria Sharapova powered into the Wimbledon women 's singles semifinals on Tuesday , crushing Dominika Cibulkova for the loss of just two games .

Fifth seed Sharapova , the 2004 champion and only grand slam winner left in the women 's draw , proved in a different league to Slovakian Cibulkova , taking just under an hour to reach the last four 6-1 6-1 .

Cibulkova , seeded 24th , had stunned world number one Caroline Wozniakci in the last 16 , but could not match that performance on Centre Court , as Russian Sharapova reached the semifinals at the All England Club for the first time since losing to Amelie Mauresmo in 2006 .

The 24-year-old Sharapova told reporters : `` It 's an honor to be in the semifinal at Wimbledon .

`` It 's a few years since I 've got past the fourth round so it 's a great chance to take it a step further , '' she added .

`` Every opponent is different . I have a tough opponent coming up and I 'm looking forward to the match .

`` She 's confident and playing great grass court tennis , '' continued Sharapova , who has yet to drop a set in the tournament so far .

Sharapova 's semifinal opponent is unseeded German Sabine Lisicki , who continued her remarkable run of form by defeating Marion Bartoli of France in three sets .

Ninth seed Bartoli came into the tournament on a high after winning the warm-up event at Eastbourne , and she maintained that momentum by putting out defending champion Serena Williams in the last 16 .

However , wild card entrant Lisicki , who had beaten French Open champion Li Na in an earlier round , proved far too strong in the decisive third set , going through 6-4 6-7 6-1 to become the first German woman to reach a grand slam semifinal since compatriot Steffi Graf in 1999 .

Czech Petra Kvitova is also through to the semifinals after a battling three-set victory over Bulgaria 's Tsvetana Pironkova .

Both players had reached the last four of last year 's tournament , losing to Serena Williams and Vera Zvonareva respectively , and it was eighth seed Kvitova who got there again -- going through 6-3 6-7 6-2 .

Kvitova is aiming to become the first left-hander to win the women 's title since Martina Navratilova in 1990 .

The final semifinal was held up because of heavy rain at Wimbledon , and was eventually switched to Centre Court under the roof , where fourth seed Victoria Azarenka claimed a comfortable 6-3 6-1 victory over unseeded Austrian Tamira Paszek .

The 21-year-old Belarussian had lost her four previous grand slam quarterfinals , but was never in danger against her unseeded opponent , who was reaching her first grand slam quarterfinal .

Azarenka will now face Kvitova for a place in the final , in a repeat of their match here 12 months ago , which went the Czech 's way .
