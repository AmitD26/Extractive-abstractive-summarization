-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Kids having sex on prime time broadcast TV ? Must be sweeps month .

It 's so predictable , it 's almost laughable . Almost . That is , it would be if it were n't for the fact that there are real-world consequences for these brazen , ratings-boosting publicity ploys .

Fox 's soapy , teen-targeted `` Glee '' tried to boost sagging ratings this week by showing not one , but two teen couples having sex for the first time -- one gay , the other straight . Show co-creator Ryan Murphy and the folks over at `` Glee '' are spinning this as a `` teachable moment '' for teens and their parents , an opportunity for dialogue about safe sex and responsible choices . The problem is Ryan Murphy wants to have his cake and eat it , too .

Hollywood loves to defend teen sex story lines by insisting , `` Kids are having sex ! We 're reflecting the real world ! '' But the truth is much more sobering and complicated .

Yes , there are and always have been sexually active teens , but never before have depictions of premarital teen sex been so widespread in the media . Today , you are more likely to see sexualized teens than adults in sexual situations . By presenting teen sex as common , the media marginalizes teens who choose to remain abstinent while increasing the pressure teens are already feeling to become sexually active .

Television is a `` sexual super peer , '' according to Jane Brown , a professor of journalism and mass communication at the University of North Carolina . The phrase `` peer pressure '' is used to describe the influence a peer group can exert on a teen 's decisions . Television amplifies that peer pressure by making the entire realm of television , and all the characters in it , part of the teen 's peer group .

When television portrays attractive , popular teenage characters as sexually active , it sends a powerful message to young viewers that there is an expectation that they , too , should be sexually active and , in fact , there might be something wrong with them , if they are n't .

Teens are also aware that television influences their behavior . According to one survey , a third of youths age 12 and older say the media encourages them to have sex by making it seem like `` everybody does it . '' And why should n't they get that impression ?

Beyond making teen sex the norm , researchers have found heavy television viewing to be predictive of positive attitudes toward `` recreational '' or casual sex and negative attitudes toward remaining a virgin . Studies have also found the more a teenager identifies with the characters they see on prime time TV shows , the more likely they are to be sexually experienced and to expect higher levels of sexual activity among their peers .

At least half a dozen studies in the past few years have documented a strong correlation between exposure to adult media content as children and the early onset of sexual activity among teens . One study even found that viewing of sexual media content was predictive of teen pregnancy .

If that is n't enough , why exactly do parents and teens need to sit down and watch a TV show that glamorizes teen sex in order to have a conversation about it ? Let 's hope most parents pass on Hollywood 's attempt to help them out with the visuals and simply have an honest conversation with their teenagers .

If history is a predictor of future behavior , we can expect this trend to continue . A season or two into Murphy 's show `` Nip/Tuck '' on the FX network , he was interviewed for a Bravo network documentary about breaking sexual taboos on television . Murphy stated , `` It 's tough to get that sexual point of view across on television . Hopefully I have made it possible for somebody on broadcast television to do a rear-entry scene in three years . Maybe that will be my legacy . ''

This , ladies and gentlemen , is the self-styled sex-ed teacher to America 's teens . The worst thing parents can do is step aside and let Hollywood do the teaching .
