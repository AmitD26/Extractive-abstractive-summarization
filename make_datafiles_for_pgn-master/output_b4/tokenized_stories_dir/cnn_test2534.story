-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pennsylvania needs to change its law in the wake of a scandal over alleged child sexual abuse by a then-member of Penn State 's football coaching team , the governor said Sunday .

A new law is needed to make sure reports of alleged child sexual abuse are made to government authorities , Tom Corbett said .

`` Should the law be changed ? Absolutely , '' Corbett said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . ''

Corbett was the attorney general who began an investigation of former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky .

A 23-page grand jury report released last weekend described crimes that Sandusky allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus , both during and after his tenure at at Penn State .

Sandusky 's attorney , Joseph Amendola , has said that his client disputes the report .

In 2002 , a graduate assistant allegedly saw Sandusky raping a boy in the showers of a campus athletics facility . The graduate student , Mike McQueary , informed Joe Paterno , the team 's coach at the time , according to the grand jury report . Paterno then alerted his boss , the school 's athletic director .

It was years before law enforcement first learned about the allegation .

Penn State Athletic Director Timothy Curley and Senior Vice President for Finance and Business Gary Schultz have been charged for failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading investigators . Prosecutors determined that a legal duty to report the alleged abuse applied to them , but not to McQueary and Paterno .

Members of both political parties `` have already introduced measures '' to change the law , Corbett said when asked about Paterno . `` And we have to make sure that the change in the law is one that is effective . It 's easy enough to take a look to see what other states have done . But I 'm sure that within the next few weeks , you will probably see bills become public .

`` I would n't be surprised to see if a bill was passed between now and the end of this year , '' he said .

McQueary , who was later promoted to a full-time assistant coach , eventually described the alleged incident in graphic detail to the grand jury . He was placed on administrative leave Friday .

The grand jury report says that Schultz and Curley were `` senior staff '' of the university . `` Pennsylvania 's mandatory reporting statute for suspected child abuse ... provides that when a staff member reports abuse ... the person in charge of the school or institution has the responsibility and legal obligation to report or cause such a report to be made by telephone and in writing within 48 hours '' to the Department of Public Welfare , according to the report . `` An oral report should have been made to the Centre County Children and Youth Services , '' it said .

Pennsylvania 's Child Protective Services Law states that anyone who , in the course of employment , `` comes into contact with children shall report or cause a report to be made ... when the person has reasonable cause to suspect '' that the child is a victim of abuse .

The law states that when the person is required to report `` as a member of the staff of a medical or other public or private institution , school , facility or agency , that person shall immediately notify the person in charge . '' The person in charge ultimately has the responsibility to report the alleged incident to government authorities .

Jerry McHugh , a prominent Philadelphia attorney who represents victims of abuse but is not currently representing anyone involved in the Penn State scandal , told CNN Sunday a new law is needed to state that `` if you eyewitness the abuse , you have a direct obligation to go to law enforcement . ''

Legal analyst Holly Hughes told CNN that when Paterno told his boss and no report was given to the authorities , `` that is where they failed . That 's where they fall down on the job . ''

There is also speculation that Pennsylvania 's whistle-blower laws may apply to , and protect , McQueary .

Legal analyst and civil rights attorney Avery Friedman said the case highlights the need for `` a re-examination of what is called the mandatory reporter law . ''

`` The argument being advanced in Pennsylvania is that as long as you tell the boss , you 're covered . And that 's where -- I think if we zero in on the issue -- where the problem is . If victims are going to be protected , you have to go to law enforcement , and that did n't happen here , '' Friedman said .

Outside of the legal concerns , many question why McQueary did not stop what he allegedly saw happening in the showers in 2002 .

`` How does McQueary , a 28-year-old grad student , look in the showers of a facility and see a grown man raping a 10-year-old child and not instinctively grab a baseball bat and not protect this child ? How does he live with himself ? '' asked Richard Hermann , legal analyst and criminal defense attorney .

Before announcing his administrative leave , the university said McQueary would not coach Penn State 's Saturday football game against Nebraska due to `` multiple threats . ''

The newspaper Patriot-News reported Friday that McQueary told players on a brief conference call that he was in `` protective custody '' at a secluded location .

Paterno , meanwhile , was fired last week . The school 's Board of Trustees also ousted Graham Spanier , the school president , who had initially voiced support for Curley and Schultz following the release of the grand jury report .

Corbett , who now serves as a trustee on the Penn State board , made the rounds on three Sunday political talk shows , though he cautioned that his comments were limited by legal obligations due to the ongoing investigation .

Asked by `` Fox News Sunday '' how the school could have allowed Sandusky 's alleged activities to continue for years , Corbett said , `` What I saw was a failure to act , and I always have said your actions speak louder than your words . ''

GOP presidential hopeful Rep. Michelle Bachmann , who happened to appear on `` Meet the Press '' after Corbett , was asked about the scandal .

`` If that was my child , '' she said of the allegations , her `` automatic reaction would be , even though I 'm a small woman , I 'd want to go find that guy and beat him to a pulp . ''

But Bachmann said the case belongs within the state 's jurisdiction , and that she does not see a role for Congress in the response .

On Saturday , tens of thousands packed Penn State 's football stadium , cheering the Nittany Lions for the first time since the graphic allegations rocked the university and led to the ouster of longtime coach Paterno , who until days ago was a beloved school icon and the winningest coach in top-level college football history . Penn State lost to Nebraska 17-14 .
