-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A cadaver dog searching the home where a missing 11-month-old Missouri girl was reportedly last seen indicated a positive `` hit '' for the scent of a body , according to documents released Friday .

The information was included in an affidavit , dated Tuesday , police filed to request a search warrant of Lisa Irwin 's Kansas City home .

Baby Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4 , after Lisa 's father , Jeremy Irwin , came home from work to find the door unlocked , the lights on and a window that had been tampered with .

Lisa 's mother , Deborah Bradley , said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before .

`` The cadaver dog indicated a positive ` hit ' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of Bradley 's bedroom near the bed , '' the affidavit read .

It also said that interviews with people involved in the case `` revealed conflicting information '' and that Bradley told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she `` was afraid of what she might find . ''

A judge approved the search warrant , which allowed investigators to comb the house and barred the family from returning home . The warrant was executed on Wednesday .

Police took clothing , blankets , a toy , rolls of tape and a tape dispenser from the home , documents showed .

The attorney for Lisa 's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was `` unfortunate , '' as it could derail the search for the missing girl .

Joe Tacopina described his clients as `` very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive . '' He said Lisa 's parents are `` terrified , not for themselves , but for the welfare of their daughter . ''

The attorney also stressed cadaver dogs are just meant to be an investigative tool , and can not be considered a basis for legal action against his clients .

The family 's private investigator , Bill Stanton , called the information contained in the affidavit `` interesting . ''

`` I 'm eager to get the facts -LRB- and -RRB- I hope it leads to finding baby Lisa , '' he said .

Earlier in the week , Bradley said in an NBC interview that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported .

Bradley told NBC she is afraid she will be arrested . Police have accused her of killing Lisa , she said , and told her that she failed a lie detector test .

`` I was the last one with her , '' a tearful Bradley said . `` And from judging on how the questioning went , that 's kind of a fear that I have . And the main fear with that is , if they arrest me , people are going to stop looking for her . And then I 'll never see her again , and I 'll never know what happened . ''

Asked how much she had been drinking that night , Bradley said , `` enough to be drunk . ''

But she rejected the notion that she could have harmed her daughter while under the influence of alcohol .

`` No , no , no , '' she told NBC . `` And if I thought there was a chance , I 'd say it . No . No . I do n't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that . ''

Asked whether he had questions about Bradley , Jeremy Irwin told NBC , `` No . There 's no question to be had there . I know who she is . I know the kind of mother she is . ''

Irwin said it 's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing , as the couple 's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa 's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed .

Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blonde hair , according to police . She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it .

The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a `` beauty mark '' on her right outer thigh , police said . At the time of her disappearance , she had a cold with a cough .
