New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The first two weeks of the NBA 's regular season have been canceled , as basketball players and management have yet to reach a deal on a new labor agreement , Commissioner David Stern announced , according to NBA.com .

The two sides remain far apart , Stern said from the NBA meetings . He added that no further talks are scheduled .

Derek Fisher , the president of the NBA Player 's Association , said the entire season may be in jeopardy . And the association 's executive director , Billy Hunter , said the owners are more dug in than in the past .

The commissioner had warned last week that such a cancellation may well be coming , at which time Los Angeles Lakers ' guard and NBA Players Association President Derek Fisher acknowledged the stakes .

`` We know our backs are against the wall in terms of regular season games and what those consequences will be , '' he said then .

The league 's owners began a lockout of its players in early July .

Stern has said that last season was not profitable for most of the league 's 30 owners , who want cost-cutting help from players .

The league lost as much as $ 300 million in the 2010-11 season , according to the commissioner .

Less than a week ago , the NBA canceled its preseason , which meant the loss of about $ 200 million in revenue , Stern said .

One of the battles has focused on the owners ' rejection of the players union 's call for an average $ 7 million player salary in the sixth year of a new labor deal .

The current average salary is about $ 5 million .

Other big issues include a fight over a move by owners to get a bigger share of revenues and whether the NBA will strengthen its salary cap .

The last work stoppage occurred in 1998 .
