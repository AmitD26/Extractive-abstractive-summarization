Lagos , Nigeria -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A day after an election official announced that Nigeria 's parliamentary election was postponed for two days , the nation 's election commission announced that all elections would be pushed back a week .

The Independent National Election Commission said the parliamentary , presidential and gubernatorial elections would be put off because of the late arrival of voting materials .

`` We can not proceed with these elections if we want them to be free , fair and credible if there are no result sheets , '' said Attahiru Jega , chairman of the election commission , on Saturday , when the parliamentary race was supposed to happen . `` We can not bury our heads and say there are no problems . It is regrettable . It is unfortunate . It should not have happened . ''

Jega also had said he took full responsibility for the fiasco but he said a vendor that was supplying results sheets and ballots was unable to deliver them on time . The vendor , said Jega , cited the diversion of planes to carry relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Japan as the reason for the delay .

Citizens of Africa 's most populous nation were supposed to vote Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats . That vote will now be held April 9 .

And they were scheduled to vote next Saturday in a presidential election and for state governors the following week , all of which has been bumped to April 16 and 26 , respectively .

Before the logistical problems , the election , the most expensive in Nigeria 's history , had already been marred by riots , bombings and assassinations .

`` The unprecedented levels of violence that have seen several people either killed , maimed , kidnapped or intimidated for political reasons pose the single most significant threat to the conduct of general elections , '' warned the Nigeria Elections Situation Room -- a forum of groups focusing on the upcoming elections .

Human Rights Watch estimates at least 70 people have been killed in political violence in the run-up to the voting .

The European Union described Nigeria 's 2007 elections as the worst they had ever seen anywhere in the world , with rampant vote rigging , violence , theft of ballot boxes and intimidation . Nigeria had hoped to gain a cleaner image this year .
