Los Angeles -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Brooke Mueller , the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen , will undergo drug rehab at home while caring for her young twins , her spokesman said Monday .

Mueller was arrested in Aspen , Colorado , on December 3 and charged with assault and cocaine possession , police said .

`` Recognizing past attempts at treatment have not been successful , Brooke has decided to take a different approach to deal with her addiction , '' spokesman Steve Honig said .

Mueller will take part in a rehab program during the day , but she will be `` under expert supervision 24 hours a day , seven days a week , '' Honig said . `` In addition , Brooke has requested to be tested on a daily basis for cocaine and other illegal substances so there is no doubt as to her commitment . ''

The 2-year-old sons she shares with Sheen will stay in Mueller 's custody and will `` be cared for by Brooke and their longtime nanny , '' Honig said . `` Charlie and Brooke 's family are all fully supportive of this decision and recognize the importance of maintaining the children 's normal routine . ''

The incidents in Aspen began when a woman at the Belly Up -- a bar and performance venue there -- complained that Mueller had been `` the aggressor '' in an assault , Aspen police said .

Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar , Escobar , police said . She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute , which is a felony , and third-degree assault , which is a misdemeanor .

She was released after posting an $ 11,000 bond , Aspen police said . A court date is scheduled for December 19 .

Mueller has appeared as an actress in several movies , including 2004 's `` A Love Song for Bobby Long , '' according to IMDb . But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen , with whom she has twin sons .

The boys and Mueller were part of Sheen 's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network 's `` Two and Half Men . ''

She claimed in March that he 'd threatened to kill her , saying , `` I will cut your head off , put it in a box and send it to your mom , '' according to a declaration made in a restraining order against Sheen . The revelations led to a court order removing the 2-year-old boys from Sheen 's home .

The actor called the allegation `` colorful '' and described the quote attributed to him as fabricated in an interview with NBC 's `` Today Show . ''

Mueller has sought help for substance abuse and stress-related issues in the past .

Last December , her attorney , Yale Galanter , said that she entered a sober living facility . Earlier , in April 2010 , Mueller had checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a `` return to old problems , '' her representative said .

She was in substance abuse rehab earlier in 2010 `` to get her health in order , '' Galanter said at the time .

The couple was involved in an alleged domestic dispute in Aspen on Christmas Day 2009 that resulted in felony charges against Sheen .
