-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A recent dust-up at MSNBC is driving the latest round of `` gotcha '' between the right and the left .

A host has apologized , actually tearing up as she tried to make amends for a segmet that did n't provide information , only insult . And yet , even as the target of the attack says it 's time to move on , the right is still incensed . And the left still seems uncomfortable talking about what happened .

And it prompts me to kick off the new year with a confession : I 'm bored with both the right and the left . In politics , everyone lies . No one tells the truth . They all push their own agendas . Everything is divided into these camps of blue and red , liberals and conservatives .

The order of the day is situational ethics . Your guy says something wrong , and you defend him because he 's your guy . Next week , your opponent says the same exact thing , and you excoriate him because , well , he 's your opponent . Where is the consistency ?

You wo n't find much of it in the game of gotcha .

The first rule is that you can constantly reinvent yourself . The second rule is that no other player can remind you of the person you were 10 minutes ago . The third is that , once you catch someone on the opposing team saying something intolerant or insensitive , you get to jump all over them and act high and mighty -- that is , until the next time that someone on your team says something intolerant or insensitive . When that happens , you get to act surprised that anyone took offense and accuse the offended of having thin skin .

To be sure , there was plenty of offensive material in Phil Robertson 's recent comments to GQ magazine appearing to liken homosexuality to bestiality and other deviant behavior . As if that were n't bad enough , the star of the A&E Network 's `` Duck Dynasty '' also appeared to minimize the mistreatment that African-Americans suffered in the South before the civil rights movement . The left could n't wait to pounce .

Now consider what happened when MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry and her equally self-righteous guests took a break from portraying themselves as morally superior to conservatives and decided it would be hilarious to turn a baby -- specifically , an adopted African-American baby -- into a punchline .

The three used a year-end segment dubbed `` Look Back on 2013 and Laugh '' to poke fun at the adoption of Kieran Romney , who this year found himself in a family Christmas photo , atop the lap of his new grandfather , Mitt . To some on the left , the fact that Kieran is black , and his grandpa is n't , is a real side splitter .

Opinion : Why Romney adoption jokes hurt

Upon seeing the photo , guest Pia Glenn was so tickled that the actress burst into song : `` One of these things is not like the others ! One of these things just is n't the same . And that little baby , front and center , would be the one . ''

Harris-Perry laughed at that crack and joked that she 'd like to see Kieran grow up to marry North West , the daughter of reality star Kim Kardashian and rapper Kanye West . `` Can you imagine Mitt Romney and Kanye West as in-laws ? '' she said .

The other guest was not to be outdone . Comedian Dean Obeidallah chimed in with this : `` I think this picture is great . It really sums up the diversity of the Republican Party , the RNC . At the convention , they find the one black person . ''

Liberals like to think of themselves as more enlightened than anyone else . But if this is what passes for `` enlightened '' these days , I 'd hate to hear what ignorant sounds like .

It 's pretty clear that while the focus was on the baby -LRB- `` one of these things ... '' and `` one black person '' -RRB- , the real target was Mitt Romney . That is , this was about politics . It was about left and right , and that 's boring .

What interests me now is how people treat one another , how we interact with each other during the relatively short time we have here on Earth . That is what is going to endure when we 're gone , not who we voted for in a given election or our party affiliation .

If you 're still looking for a New Year 's resolution , how 's this one ? Let 's treat each other better .

Using a baby -- let alone an adopted baby -- to score cheap political points is not how we should treat one another . That 's what happened here . Once politics took over , common decency and good manners went out the window .

Harris-Perry , Glenn , and Obeidallah all apologized . But , would n't you know it ? Even that was a mixed bag .

First the good news . Harris-Perry did a great job . A day after the incident , she apologized on Twitter `` without reservation or qualification . '' Then , she opened her show Saturday with more of the same and veered off into the larger issue of keeping the families of political figures off limits .

`` Adults who enter into public life implicitly consent to having less privacy , '' she said . `` But their families , and especially their children , should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly . My intention was not malicious , but I broke the ground rule that families are off-limits , and for that I am sorry . ''

Now the bad news . Her guests were not nearly so gracious . In fact , their apologies were less about contrition and forgiveness , and more about politics .

Glenn tweeted : `` In a spontaneous reaction to a photo , my disdain for Mitt Romney 's political platform led me to inadvertently insult adoptive families . ''

In a piece for the Daily Beast , Obeidallah -LRB- who has appeared on CNN shows and written op-eds for CNN.com -RRB- explained that he was in hot water because `` I told a joke that many on the right -- and even a few in the middle -- did n't like '' and because `` those on the right who monitor MSNBC were outraged '' and because `` right-wing media outlets '' had piled on . He said that `` being attacked by right-wing publications '' is not new for him and vowed `` to the self-appointed right-wing pundits '' that he will `` never stop calling out the wrongs and hypocrisy of the right . ''

All RIGHT , then .

Still , Obeidallah wrote , `` I want to sincerely apologize to the Romney family if anyone was offended by my joke . ''

For his part , Romney told Fox News that he 's ready to move on from the controversy . So should we all .

Interestingly , the three jokesters only apologized after word of the segment got out and conservative media outlets kicked up a fuss . You see , apparently when you have a show on MSNBC , no one watches or hears what you have to say until someone else repeats it .

Now , that 's funny .
