-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- When my wife woke me up before dawn about three months ago to tell me she was having contractions , one of the first things I did was grab my iPhone from the nightstand .

No , I was n't ignoring my wife to check my e-mail or send a tweet . I picked up my smartphone so I could use a 99-cent app to track the duration and frequency of those contractions .

You might think that using apps and gadgets right before and after your child is born will take away from this life-changing experience . But for my wife and me , having the right tech tools enhanced the experience and made us feel more connected to our out-of-town friends and family .

Here are five tech tools that have come in handy for this new dad .

LaborMate iPhone app -LRB- 99 cents -RRB-

Each time my wife signaled that a contraction was starting , I tapped the app 's start button and when it was over , I hit stop -- generating a report that made it easy to track her progress . I could e-mail that data to our OBGYN , or if I was really bold , share it on Twitter or Facebook .

Using the app provided some order and calmness to what is often a chaotic experience .

Total Baby iPhone app -LRB- $ 4.99 -RRB-

After our son Jack was born and we settled into the hospital room , nurses started coming in and peppering us with questions : How many times did the baby pee today ? When was the last time he ate ? Were you able to breastfeed ? For how long ? Are you sure this is your baby ? -LRB- kidding -RRB- .

Once we left the hospital , there were more questions . And they got harder .

At the first pediatrician visit , the doctor wanted daily totals for the number of dirty and wet diapers as well as more details on the frequency and length of breast - or bottle-feeding sessions . What were his height , weight and length at birth ? When he left the hospital ?

Total Baby makes it easy to keep track of every dirty diaper , bottle , nap and even bath . As a new parent , it 's easy to obsess over these early details , and while this app can feed that obsession , it put me at ease to know that all the vital information about my son was only a few taps away .

We also used the app to keep track of upcoming and past doctor 's appointments , to write down questions for the doctor and track Jack 's growth .

Since I always carry my iPhone with me , I use the app to document milestones like Jack 's first bath or the first time he smiled . Each entry automatically records the date and time , and you can add a photo to go with it .

One of the best things about the app is if you download it on multiple iPhones or iPads , you can use your home Wi-Fi network to sync the data . We downloaded it on two iPhones and an iPad , so regardless of which gadget we use to update the app , it only takes a few seconds to sync so we have the latest data on all of our devices .

Apple iPad -LRB- starts at $ 499 -RRB-

After more than two months as the father of a newborn , I 'm now convinced that Steve Jobs had new parents in mind when he designed the iPad 2 .

There are many nights where my son wo n't fall asleep unless he 's cradled in the crook of my arm . That leaves me with one free hand -- not enough to flip through a book or use a laptop . The iPad is the perfect size and shape to balance on my lap or chair armrest and manipulate with my free hand .

My iPad has become my mobile command center to entertain and inform myself and to share news and photos of my son with friends and family .

I 'll catch up on news and social-networking feeds through apps like CNN , New York Times , Twitter and Flipboard . When I want to watch TV without disturbing the baby , I 'll plug in my headphones and use apps such as HBO GO , SlingPlayer , CNN and ABC .

And of course like any new parent , I 'll use Google to get answers to burning questions like `` Why does my baby have hiccups ? '' or `` When does the umbilical cord fall off ? ''

The iPad is also great for storing and displaying pictures . When relatives visited , I set the iPad to slideshow mode and propped it upon the living room table to use as a digital picture frame .

To make loading photos onto the iPad easier , I bought the $ 29 iPad Camera Connection Kit to transfer photos and videos from an SD card and my iPhone . It 's easier than dumping photos onto a computer , but you will need two hands .

Web Albums iPhone/iPad app -LRB- $ 1.99 -RRB-

Like any new parent , I was eager to share photos of our son on Facebook , but I did n't always have my computer handy . There 's no official Facebook iPad app -LRB- yet -RRB- , and the iPhone app only lets you upload one photo at a time .

The Web Albums app for iPhone and iPad lets me upload batches of photos to Facebook at the same time and create and easily manage my Facebook photo albums .

The app also let me upload multiple photos and manage albums on Google 's Picasa service . It even saves photos for offline viewing and the app features a nice slideshow function .

Amazon Mom & Subscribe & Save

We heard lots of opinions on the best place to buy diapers and other baby stuff . We joined Amazon 's free but unfortunately named Amazon Mom club -LRB- the account is in my name -RRB- to get discounts on lots of stuff .

For diapers and wipes , we signed up for Amazon 's subscription service called `` Subscribe & Save . '' The service delivers items to your door at set intervals of your choosing . You can cancel at anytime or change the type of diapers or wipes .

For instance , with the Amazon Mom discount , a shipment of 234 Pampers diapers costs about $ 31 , or 13 cents a diaper . That 's about $ 12 less than Target.com .
