-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Each spring brings major medical meetings from the likes of the American Association for Cancer Research , the American Urological Association and the American Society for Clinical Oncology , to name a few .

These meetings began as forums for scientists to meet and discuss findings and generate ideas . They offer opportunities for physicians to learn about new studies and possible new treatments , and for those interested in medicine , the meetings are fascinating and enjoyable .

But over the past several decades , these gatherings have more and more become venues for drug companies and medical device manufacturers to tell physicians about their drugs and medical hardware . Today , much of the presented research is sponsored by industry , and these medical meetings are increasingly an opportunity for companies to make a name for themselves by promoting their products .

Doctors find themselves asking when promotion of a product or a company stops being education and becomes a naked attempt at advertising . Companies have found that the investors watch these meetings like a hawk , looking for the earliest bit of data that may show promising results for a new drug .

Successful promotion of positive findings through meeting abstracts and press releases can double or triple a small company 's share price . But observers note a troubling trend . It is a shame that the desire to pump up a stock price often leads to over-promotion and exaggeration of paltry scientific findings .

Recently , the economic crisis in the media has led to the disappearance , through layoffs or by choice , of some wonderful , skilled and seasoned science writers . And with that comes genuine concern . The veterans have been replaced by mostly young , inexperienced writers who suddenly find themselves under pressure to turn out compelling stories about difficult scientific medical studies that are all too easy to oversimplify and misinterpret .

Meanwhile , to bolster readership or numbers of viewers , the media reward reporters whose stories can lead to the most eye-grabbing headline . These reporters are well-meaning , but if they do not understand medicine and the scientific process , these articles can truly harm public health . And , in my experience , that is happening more and more often .

And even more important : Reporters must understand that the motivation of every scientific report must be questioned as part of routine due diligence . The caveats from each report must also be clearly detailed in each story . From where I sit , all too often , that is not happening .

This combination of scientists and businessmen enthusiastically promoting products or themselves with sales pitches , and inexperienced reporters struggling to make sense of their claims , has led to some unfortunate articles .

I was motivated to write this after reading articles in reputable newspapers in the United States and Europe that a cure for breast cancer was on the horizon and a blood test was coming to market that could detect lung cancer early and save lives .

Truth be told , a lab cured breast cancer in six mice . But translating these findings to humans is difficult , and experience has taught us that it likely will never happen . Some of these articles also failed to say that this is a very early piece of scientific progress at best -- and may not even be progress .

As for the blood tests , I have read reports of some that are somewhat effective in finding lung cancer . But the articles failed to point out that any test will require years of more development to determine whether it 's useful . They also failed to report that the study showed that the test was no more accurate than X-rays , which are not recommended by any major medical organization .

Unfortunately , by the time measured voices put these stories into perspective , the media have moved on to a new story . The end result of all this is very harmful . The nonscientific public gets misled , and some of those folks who have an interest in a specific disease get their hopes up , only to be disappointed . I was taught by a wise physician that the worst thing we in medicine can do is deceive our patients .

Another event that motivated me to write this opinion piece : One of the good , smart medical writers who toil in this field every day , unheralded and woefully underpaid , asked me a really good question . I realized that these good hard questions are less frequent as the good medical and scientific writers , most of whom I 've had the privilege of enjoyed working with over the years , are becoming an endangered species .

This decline of the professional medical and science writer is a threat to the public health as important as the latest scare story in the headlines -- perhaps even more so . Unfortunately , this is one health threat that has received little attention . Maybe it 's time to change that .
