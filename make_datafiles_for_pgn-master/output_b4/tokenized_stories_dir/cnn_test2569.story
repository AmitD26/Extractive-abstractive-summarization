BAGHDAD , Iraq -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Abu Ahmed says he was there : An Iraqi held prisoner at Abu Ghraib by the American military when inmates were abused .

Abu Ahmed says he and other inmates were held naked and forced to stand in their cells .

He says he was kept naked and saw other naked inmates stacked onto a pile while photos were taken , photos that would become public and bring shame to the United States .

The pain of the past few years is clearly etched on the man 's face and equally obvious as he talks . It began October 1 , 2003 , he says , when U.S. troops came to his home and detained him during a sweep of his neighborhood .

The next day , he was processed and put into Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad .

`` They made us take off all our clothes , even our underwear , '' recalled the man who is afraid to reveal his identity , instead offering up the alias of Abu Ahmed . Watch Abu Ahmed tell his story ''

`` They walked us in front of all the cells , about 50 or 60 cells , in front of all the detainees , in front of the soldiers , of the female soldiers . They got us in the cells , still naked , and they locked us inside , '' he said , tears welling in his eyes .

`` They made us stand in the corner of the cell . We were not allowed to sit down . We were not even allowed to talk . '' See the photos of the abuse ''

That treatment went on and on , Abu Ahmed said . `` For 32 days I was without clothes , even if we wanted to pray , we had to pray naked . ''

Abu Ahmed says he saw more abuse from his cell , including one of the incidents captured in one of the infamous photos .

`` One day , they brought three or four detainees , maybe more . They were about 40 years old or older . They took off their clothes , forced them to climb on top of each other and start taking pictures ... I saw it with my own eyes , '' he said .

`` Those detainees , I found out , were former Iraqi officers -- they brought them after a fight inside the camps , they brought them because they were very well respected inside the camp , so they humiliated them and returned them to the camp as a message to the others . ''

The U.S. military fully admits that the treatment of Iraqis inside Abu Ghraib at that time was unacceptable by its own standards , and that detention centers in Iraq today are run on very different lines .

President George W. Bush declared that the `` abhorrent '' acts were `` a stain on our country 's honor and our country 's reputation . '' They made Americans `` sick to our stomachs , '' he said in May 2004 , soon after the photos became public .

But Abu Ahmed says it is still hard for him to look at an American .

`` Thanks to God , I have the ability to handle worse sights . I ca n't blame you for everything that these people did , '' he said .

`` But , at the end , the American people are responsible for everything that happened , '' Abu Ahmed said , referring to the war that he believes turned his life upside down .

Abu Ahmed spent a total of 20 months in U.S. custody , between Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca , outside Basra in southern Iraq .

He then returned home , where he spent less than five months with his family before being arrested again , this time by the Iraqi army in yet another sweep through his neighborhood .

He says his treatment inside Iraqi facilities was even worse than what he faced at the hands of the U.S. military . His Iraqi captors , Abu Ahmed says , beat him with cables and pipes ; he even had a cement block hung from his genitals .

Documents issued to him by the U.S. military corroborate many aspects of his story , showing that he was in Abu Ghraib and Camp Bucca during the time he says he was . He asked us not to contact the Iraqi army to confirm details of his detention , fearing that they might arrest him again .

He does not want any restitution and now works with the Iraqi government , trying to rebuild his life .

Abu Ahmed has never been charged with a single crime .
