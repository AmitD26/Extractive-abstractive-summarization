-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The picture of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer tilted on a lounge chair , hair flowing above her and shot from above has sparked a mini-firestorm among women . A significant number of women , feeling not too distanced from the days when women CEOs were just a fond hope , much less an aspiration , were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot .

The fact that it was kind of sexy added just a little gasoline to the fire . But to be fair , the reaction was far from uniform ; other women slammed back and said , '' Why not ? '' `` She 's earned the right to do anything she wants , and why not be sexy and a CEO ? We do n't have to wear the same uniform men do , we can do it our way '' .

Well , I am teetering towards the middle but coming down on the side of the disappointed . On the one hand , Marissa Mayer ca n't avoid the fact that she 's a role model , even if she did n't start out to be one . Her picture seems to say to us , `` Here 's a real me that 's just as important as being a CEO . Look at how pretty and sexy I am ! '' Now any woman can understand that .

Sexed up and smart : Women debate Marissa Mayer 's Vogue photo

Posing for the camera is always a narcissistic act , and I dare say , most women 's first reaction to seeing themselves in a photo that surfaces in a newspaper , or in a private family shot , is `` how do I look ? '' I plead guilty . But still , here 's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains , does she still need to self-validate by having a beautiful fashion gig ?

What does that say to all the women who would never be beautiful enough to do that , but might be brainy enough to have her job ? Should they feel '' less than Marissa '' because they ca n't qualify for the Vogue slot ? Could n't Marissa just take pictures that show her as a stylish and good-looking CEO rather than as a babe who is showing her great legs in $ 1,000 shoes ?

But then there is the other side . We all do love to look great and be admired . We understand the impulse . And why should she be denied her one month of being a famous fashonista ? She 's worked hard to gain the prominence she earned , and some girls , even very smart girls , do , just like the song says , `` just want to have fun '' ... at least occasionally .

Mayer turns heads with photo shoot

I get it , and I get why she did it . But she has to take note of how pained a lot of women are about this fashion photo . Not just a few women felt hurt looking at the Mayer layout , wondering silently or out loud if acquiescing to this kind of shot means that for Mayer , and perhaps for other women , that `` making it '' and `` having it all '' needs to include being publicly admired for one 's allure . That 's a depressing thought for many talented women who are not beautiful or not sexy . They do not have that card to play and this layout could certainly make them wonder if selection for the top job requires being lovely .

We women would like to feel that for at least some of us , sheer competence would make looks a non-issue in our lives . We would like to think that a brainiac like Marissa Mayer would n't need , perhaps would not want , to have a very public glamor shot as a career capstone . Unfortunately , it is not an exaggeration to say that Marissa Mayer is kind of saying , even though I am sure she did not mean to , that to have it all , sure , you have to be smart , but , let 's face it , you also need to be beautiful .
