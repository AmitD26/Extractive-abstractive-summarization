But in the seventh inning , Giants outfielder Gregor Blanco saved the perfect game by chasing down a screaming drive hit by the Astros Jordan Schafer and making a diving catch on the warning track .

The dazzling catch also put Blanco in the spotlight as his name was trending on Twitter nationwide along with Matt Cain 's some 20 minutes after the game .

Cain 's feat comes the same night that New York Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey narrowly missed a no hitter . Dickey held the Tampa Bay Rays to only one infield hit Wednesday night , and did not walk a batter .

There have now been five no hitters this year . Along with Cain and Humber , Jered Weaver , Johan Santana and a crew of Seattle Mariners also pitched games without allowing a hit .
