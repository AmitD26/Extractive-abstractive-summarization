-LRB- Wired -RRB- -- We 're all familiar with Apple 's love affair for thin devices . Although the third-generation iPad surprised many by gaining about half a millimeter of thickness , it looks like Apple could be back to trimming product dimensions by using a new kind of display technology in the next iPhone .

Instead of using a display comprising a number of separate layers , Apple could use in-cell touch display technology , according to a Friday report from Digitimes . The report says Apple would be sourcing its in-cell displays from Toshiba and Sharp .

`` The advantage of in-cell is that you 're streamlining the manufacturing process , so in time you should be able to drive efficiencies and reduce cost , '' IHS analyst Rhoda Alexander told Wired . `` Additionally , by reducing the number of layers , you reduce the size and thickness of the device , making it thinner and lighter . ''

If the iPhone has a larger 4 - to 4.3-inch display , as some reports expect it to , that extra glass could add a bit of heft to the iPhone 's weight . Thus , Apple would need to find new ways to keep the phone from gaining too much weight .

Currently , the iPhone 's `` on cell '' display is layered a bit like a sandwich -LRB- or if you 're feeling like dessert , think of a trifle -RRB- . At the very bottom , you 've got the back light . Directly above that , the LCD section , which houses the red - , green - , and blue-colored pixels of the display . Then there 's a layer of glass .

On top of that is the capacitive touch layer , which is then topped off by a tough layer of Gorilla Glass . The middle layer of glass separates the liquid crystal portion of the display from the touch portion .

In-cell display tech eliminates that middle layer of glass , combining the LCD and touch sections of the display into a single layer .

One way this can be successfully accomplished is by `` multiplexing '' the electrodes normally used to relay touch input -- that is , using the same electrodes to handle the signals for both touch control and the pixels of the LCD , according to a 2010 IHS report on touch-screen displays .

In-cell technology is n't currently deployed in any shipping cellphones . And it should n't be confused with the similar-sounding `` Super '' technologies from Samsung . Super AMOLED and Super LCD screens use on-cell technology rather than in-cell .

Right now , in-cell touch displays are still an emerging technology . So while the core technology promises long-term benefits , yield rates could be a problem in the shorter terms , Alexander says .

But that 's the deal with any new technological process , is n't it ? In the months before the new iPad was announced , yield rates for Apple 's Retina display were a huge question mark .

So is in-cell really something Apple would pull the trigger on ? `` We do believe that the next iPhone display will implement in-cell touch , '' DisplaySearch 's Paul Semenza told Wired via e-mail . But of course , we 'll have to wait and see how it pans out when the next iPhone actually debuts
