-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's been called `` something Smurfs would play on , '' labeled a danger to players and derided over a lack of consultation .

Madrid 's new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons . But is the furore justified ?

After all , is n't this the same surface -- just a different color ?

It 's the nature of sports stars to be hyper-sensitive about their office environment . As one British journalist argued , a malfunctioning computer can waste your morning 's work , but a ridge in a tennis court might spell the end of a career .

The sport has undergone some of its most dramatic modernizations in the last two decades . Let 's not forget the uproar when Hawk-Eye , the electronic ball tracking system , was introduced in the 1990s .

But if the controversy over the last few weeks has revealed anything about tennis , it 's that this is a game where tradition still looms large .

Ion Tiriac 's baby

The man behind the blue revolution is Romanian billionaire Ion Tiriac . The former French Open doubles winner and manager to Boris Becker has had a blue bee in his bonnet for a while .

He pioneered the first blue hard courts at his indoor event in Stuttgart -- a lead followed by the Australian and U.S. Opens .

Tiriac argues the color increases the visibility of the yellow ball and points to scientific tests proving the contrast is at least 15 % better on blue than red .

The fact it 's also the color of Madrid 's major sponsor , Spanish insurance giant Mutua Madrilena , has not been lost on his critics .

A court by any other name

But really , it 's just a color right ? According to Tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red , with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers .

However , in Madrid these bricks are stripped of their iron oxide -LRB- the chemical that provides the original color -RRB- and then treated with dye .

Tiriac acknowledges the cost is almost double that of the red clay , but says the extra expense is worth it .

He admits that improving the experience for television viewers watching his $ 10.6 million tournament was a major factor in the switch .

Players see red

So what 's all the fuss about ? World No. 2 Rafael Nadal 's shock exit in the third round on Thursday has only added fire to players ' complaints that the new surface is too slippery .

The `` King of Clay '' -- Nadal has won six of his last seven appearances at the French Open -- was beaten in a three-hour epic by fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco .

It ended a 22-match winning streak on clay for Nadal that stretched back to 2011 , and was his first defeat in 14 meetings with Verdasco .

`` I never was in control of the match , I did n't know how to win a point , '' Nadal told reporters , before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed .

But even before his huge upset , the 25-year-old was critical of the new surface , tweeting : `` The history of clay court was on red . It was n't on blue . Only one person wins -- the owner of the tournament . ''

A slippery slope ?

World No. 1 Novak Djokovic also threatened not to step on Madrid 's blue clay again after he lost to Janko Tipsarevic .

The Serbian beat Nadal in last year 's final , held on red clay , and he expressed his unhappiness with the new surface even after beating Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2 in his opening match on Tuesday .

`` Today I played my first official match on blue clay and I have to admit I was not very happy . Next time I have to bring skates instead of shoes , it was sooo slippery , '' the 24-year-old said on Facebook .

Likewise , Ukrainian player Sergiy Stakhovsky tweeted : `` After playing a match on blueclay court 6 I can say with full responsibility on my shoulders that it is the worst court of @ATPWorldTour . ''

In the women 's draw , world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka also complained about the slide , telling reporters : `` The surface is a bit slippery , but it 's the same for all of us . ''

It 's not just the texture of the surface raising eyebrows -- on the most basic level it just looks different .

`` Ha ! Blue clay . . It looks like something Smurfs would play on , '' tweeted player Ivo Karlovic , in what has become a catchphrase of the tournament .

But it 's not all blue . American star Serena Williams did n't see what all the fuss was about .

`` I have n't noticed a difference between the blue and the red clay . I think it 's the same , it 's just you do n't get as dirty , '' she tweeted .

Technically speaking

According to experts the lack of traction has nothing to do with the color but the implementation of the clay -- which has been playing much faster than usually expected on such a surface .

Alistair McCaw , a performance specialist to tennis stars including Jelena Dokic , has been watching the action close-up in Madrid .

`` The problem is not the fact that the color is blue , even though the change from the traditional brown is quite a shock . Let 's not forget the Australian Open changing court color from the green to that bright blue ! The players had a lot to say about that too , '' he said on his Facebook page .

`` It 's that the amount of clay covering the surface is lesser than normal . If you dig your foot into the surface and remove some of the clay , you will notice that the underlying surface is a hard rubber-like mat . When water is sprayed on the surface , it become slippery . This , in my opinion , is what 's causing the main problems . ''

Former world No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic tested the blue clay at Madrid last year and admitted it did `` look a bit slippery . ''

But the Croatian , who retired last month , did n't believe it was a safety issue . Part of being a pro tennis player is adapting to different surfaces , he said .

And besides , the biggest challenge at Madrid is n't the clay -- it 's the altitude . Balls fly faster through thinner air and Madrid is 650 meters above sea level .

`` I would say that grass courts and even the hard courts are a lot more dangerous than clay -- any clay , '' Ljubicic told CNN .

`` Regarding adaptation , tennis players face different surfaces on a weekly basis , every clay court is a bit different . I would say that the altitude in Madrid creates bigger problems to players than the color of the court . ''

Eyes on the prize ... no , the other prize

The issue is n't just about Madrid , of course . The tournament is seen as an important buildup to the real clay-court crown -- the French Open .

Players have argued it 's difficult enough adjusting to the conditions in Madrid , without then having to change their game at Roland Garros at the end of the month .

Perhaps most galling for the top players is that they were never consulted over the controversial changes .

`` Players should be agreeing to the change -- there should be some value in what they say , '' Djokovic told reporters .

`` I 'm not blaming the tournament , it is fighting for its own interests . But the ATP should have done a better job on player rights in protecting what the players want . ''

Ljubicic added that even when players did raise objections , they were ignored .

`` Players were asked at the council meeting if they would support the idea of having blue clay courts . They clearly refused the idea -- only to see that the decision was made anyhow that the surface will be blue , '' he said .

The ATP has granted permission for a one-year trial of the tournament , and says it 'll be taking into account players ' feedback .

Judging by the response so far , Tiriac will have a battle on his hands to keep blue in 2013 .
