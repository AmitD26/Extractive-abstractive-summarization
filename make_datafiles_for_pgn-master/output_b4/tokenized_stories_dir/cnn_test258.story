Hong Kong -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- After much anticipation , and against the wishes of the international community , North Korea finally pushed the button on its third underground nuclear test , this time using more sophisticated technology than its previous attempts .

While it marks another milestone in the short , but increasingly eventful , reign of young leader Kim Jong Un , it also threatens to undermine an already fragile security situation in the region .

How worried should we be about North Korea 's nuclear test ?

It 's worrying but does this mean they can drop a nuclear weapon on Los Angeles ? Absolutely not . The notion that they are going to target the U.S. is way off the mark .

Any time the North Koreans stage a test , it significantly improves their nuclear capabilities . This comes after they staged a rocket launch that was successful , a long range rocket which appears to have put a satellite into orbit . What they need to achieve to have the weapon they want is the capability to miniaturize a warhead and put it on a rocket . This test is n't going to do that in and of itself , but it is a significant step forward .

What will happen next ?

The U.N. Security Council will meet . South Korea is the chair this month so they get to call the agenda . There will be discussion about a much tougher sanctions resolution . The $ 64,000 question is whether the Chinese will in the end agree to anything significant enough for it to really affect North Korea .

I think it 's certain , whatever the U.N. does , the U.S. will move on its own to ratchet up sanctions . I also think the Americans will beef up their military presence in the region . It will mean stronger anti-missile defenses going to South Korea and possibly Japan

Why is China 's reaction so important ?

The Chinese do n't like the idea of international sanctions and coercing other countries . They still have a strategic interest in maintaining a viable separate North Korea as a buffer against a pro-U.S. South Korea and that has only become more important as tensions between the U.S. and China have increased .

On the other hand , a nuclear North Korea that is behaving in an adventuristic way risks very bad outcomes from the Chinese point of view . What China least wants is a more active , antagonistic , robust U.S. military presence in North East Asia in conjunction with the strengthening of military capabilities of allies who are not China 's friends .

Chinese companies are more involved in North Korea than they were half a dozen years ago , so the Chinese stand to lose on that front if the U.S. tightens sanctions .

Who really calls the shots in North Korea ?

-LRB- North Korean leader -RRB- Kim Jong Un has people around him but he 's driving the show . There 's no evidence to suggest that he 's not in charge . All the personnel changes he made he was able to make without enough pushback for it to matter . He 's got military people around him , and his uncle . I do n't see any evidence to see that he 's not ultimately in charge .

How significant is the timing of the test ?

It 's the birthday of Kim Jong Il -LRB- Kim Jong Un 's late father -RRB- on -LRB- Saturday -RRB- . Assuming this -LRB- test -RRB- is not a total dud , this will be ... great propaganda and they will play it to the hilt . North Koreans are extremely nationalistic . They may be hungry , they may be miserable but by God they 've got a bomb and they can stand up to the rest of the world and that really , really matters in North Korea .

You also have a power transitions in Seoul , Tokyo -LRB- and the U.S. -RRB- . How can Barack Obama not devote more attention to North Korea in his State of the Union address ? Everyone is reacting to them and that 's how they -LRB- North Koreans -RRB- like it .

What do n't we know ?

We do n't know yet whether this was a test of a plutonium device or a uranium device . The previous two tests were plutonium . We know they have a uranium enrichment capability . We know that a uranium bomb , once they master it , is easier to make and they have deposits of uranium in North Korea so they can keep digging it up .

If they have successfully detonated a uranium bomb and they have moved forward in the process of developing the technical capabilities to miniaturize it and put it on a war head , then in purely military terms it 's worrying

The test also raises interesting questions on the proliferation front . The more successful they are with this program , the scarier the consequences should they choose , for example , to provide Iran with test data or fissile material or other information .
