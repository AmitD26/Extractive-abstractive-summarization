-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` No poo '' sounds like a swimming pool rule , but to some it also means washing hair with baking soda and vinegar instead of shampoo .

Tiffany Burke , 31 , says she might try it soon , with a goal of becoming as natural and organic as possible .

`` I 'm , like , 60 % there , '' she says about her use of organic products . `` I would say I 'm in the middle , because there are still lots of moms who just do n't care . ''

Burke is pregnant and due in November . But the twins she is carrying are n't her biological or legal children .

As a surrogate mother , she 's carrying fetuses formed by her brother 's sperm and her sister-in-law 's egg .

CNN 's `` Sanjay Gupta , MD '' is profiling the legal and emotional issues surrounding Burke 's surogate pregnancy .

Burke 's interest in natural and organic products began when she was expecting her first child and read the best-selling pregnancy book `` What To Expect When You 're Expecting . ''

Some passages suggest that chemicals and pesticides in our food and cosmetics , although legal , may nonetheless be causing harm .

Burke wanted to know more .

`` I would just Google and hope for the best . I 'd just keep going and going until I saw enough evidence that to me said , just avoid it . Just do n't put that in your body , '' she says .

Eight years later , how she chooses what to buy is a far cry from how she was raised , Burke says .

When sister-in-law Natalie Lucich had to have her uterus removed because a complication with her last pregnancy led to uncontrolled bleeding , Burke offered to carry her next child .

Lucich was overjoyed .

Surrogate sisters : The ultimate gift

Now , Lucich relies on Burke to make all the right choices for her baby .

`` She is organic , and she does know everything that 's going into her body . She reads labels , '' says Lucich . `` You never know when you 're hiring some surrogate to do it , what they 're doing to their bodies . ''

The FDA says common chemicals like BPA , phthalates and pesticides are safe , but research shows they pass from mother to child , and may be neurotoxins in the womb .

So Burke is like her own regulatory agency , learning as much as possible about the safety of every product on the shelf . She says she does n't want to take any risks .

Artificial food colorings linked to ADHD in children have been banned from Burke 's home . She stores food in glass containers , not plastic .

Even though she might experiment with making her own shampoo , she 's passionate about the natural products already on store shelves .

Burke brushes with Tom 's of Maine toothpaste , she does laundry with Seventh Generation detergent and she loves `` Organic wear '' makeup by Physicians Formula .

FDA says it will deny request to ban BPA

Ken Cook , president of the Environmental Working Group , says Burke is smart to be proactive .

`` We 've come to understand that if you take some reasonable steps you can dramatically reduce your exposure to a lot of different chemicals , '' says Cook .

`` If you 're going to wait for the government to take action , you could be in store for a lot of exposure . ''

With the joy of surrogacy comes the burden of responsibility for Burke .

If anything goes wrong with her pregnancy , she says she could n't help asking herself , `` What did I do ? ''

Still , even careful shoppers like Burke get caught off guard .

She felt good about buying BPA-free sippy cups for her toddler until she came across an article explaining that manufacturers can replace the BPA in plastic with similar chemicals like Bisphenol-S , and still label their product `` BPA-free '' .

`` I never knew that . I had no clue . So last week I spent two hours online looking for sippy cups that were not plastic , '' says Burke .

When asked whether she avoids canned goods because research shows many cans ' interior linings leach BPA into the food inside , Burke says , `` I did n't know that . I 'm super cranky about that . ''

She immediately sought information online and found the website for Annie 's Homegrown , which makes her favorite soups .

She found a statement saying , `` We continue to work diligently with our vendors and supply partners to find a can lining without BPA . We are also exploring other package solutions . ''

`` Boooo , '' Burke says . `` It never crossed my mind . Why would there be BPA in cans ? ''

To Cook , it 's a familiar story .

`` Eating less canned food , which comes as a surprise to a lot of people , is an important first step , '' he says .

`` People are beginning to understand that the environment is not something that 's just external to us ; it 's not polar bears and wilderness and ice floes in the Arctic or forests . It 's something we metabolize day in and day out . ''
