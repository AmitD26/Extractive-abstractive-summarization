-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For the 23rd and 24th time in less than two weeks , shots were fired at seemingly random targets in southeastern Michigan and , for the first time , someone was struck , police said .

A driver suffered non-life-threatening injuries , details of which were not disclosed , when he was hit by a bullet around 12:20 p.m. ET west of Fowlerville , said Clarence Goodlein , director of public safety in Wixom and spokesman for the eight-agency task force investigating the shootings .

After that incident -- which occurred about 35 minutes after another shooting , both affecting vehicles heading eastbound on Interstate 96 -- authorities shut down the highway , looking for evidence .

It reopened shortly after 5 p.m. , without anyone in custody or a named suspect .

Authorities investigate spate of roadways shootings in Michigan

Michigan authorities have released a composite sketch of a man with short-cropped hair who they believe was involved in an October 18 shooting in Ingham County .

And police have said they are looking for a black Ford Mustang with blue-tinted front lights and a racing stripe down the center , while other witnesses have pointed to an older-model Chevrolet Cavalier .

Saturday 's highway shootings are the latest in a series that began October 16 in Wixom and a neighboring community . They have all occurred over a roughly 35-mile stretch west of Detroit .

Goodlein said authorities have indications the suspect or suspects were themselves in vehicles when they fired at other vehicles that were driving in the opposite direction . What would motivate them to do so , however , is a mystery .

`` We have no idea why these events are occurring , '' Goodlein said .

In one of the shootings , a man taking out his trash heard a bullet `` whizzing by his head , Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said earlier this month . In another , a bullet went through the driver 's side of a car , lodging inside the passenger-side door . And on one day , five vehicles were shot along the same road in a span of `` two to three minutes , '' according to Goodlein .

`` The scariest thing about it is the suspect , or suspects , are not targeting certain individuals , '' said Brian Cheesvro , a detective with the Wixom police .

The incidents have stirred memories of the D.C. sniper shootings , when 10 were killed and three wounded over a terrifying three-week span in October 2002 . John Allen Muhammad , the mastermind behind those shootings , was found guilty and executed in 2009 . Lee Boyd Malvo , who was 17 at the time , is serving a life sentence .

Over the past two weeks , dozens of law enforcement officers have come together to form a task force to probe the Michigan shootings .

Goodlein said about 500 leads have come in through a tip line , and he encouraged people to keep calling -- even if they are not sure whether their thoughts or observations will impact the investigation .

`` Our experience has been ... that one piece of meaningless information , or what seems to be meaningless to someone , when it is combined with some other information ... becomes extremely valuable , '' the chief said .
