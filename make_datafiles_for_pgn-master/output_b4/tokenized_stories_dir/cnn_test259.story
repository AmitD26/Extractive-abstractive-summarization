-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Lawmen subdued and disarmed a Seattle-area man suspected of writing an expletive-laden e-mail threatening President Barack Obama , a Secret Service agent says .

Anton Caluori , 31 , was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way , a Seattle , Washington , suburb , Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit .

Caluori is charged with making threats against the president and assaulting a federal officer , according to the affidavit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Seattle .

Molnar wrote that the e-mail , received by the FBI earlier Tuesday , said , `` I will kill the president !!!!! '' and `` You ca n't afford to call my bluff . ''

The message said that dying `` is n't frightening ... it 's peaceful ... you will see ... '' and spoke of a `` cop killing spree ... just over the hill , '' Molnar said . The e-mail included an address and challenged authorities to `` come and get me . ''

A database check confirmed that Caluori lived at the address in the e-mail , '' Molnar said in his affidavit , and the username of the e-mail account appeared consistent with his name .

Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address , where an employee told them Caluori was a `` hothead '' with a `` temper '' who lived with his mother .

The officers knocked on the apartment door twice with no answer . The third time , a man later identified as Caluori opened the door , Molnar said .

`` Caluori was wearing a black bandoleer filled with 12-gauge shotgun shells around his torso . Attached to the bandoleer at chest level was a large black fixed-blade knife . On his ankle , Caluori was weaving a revolver in an ankle holster . Caluori 's right hand was placed out-of-view behind his back , '' the affidavit said .

The officers commanded the man several times to `` show us your hands . ''

At first he did n't comply . But then he `` moved his right hand from behind his back revealing a stockless black pump-action shotgun with a pistol grip , '' the affidavit said .

After he raised the firearm , the officers scuffled with Caluori .

`` Officer Hensing and I were able to take Caluori to the ground . Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands , '' Molnar said in the affidavit . `` Ultimately , Officer Hensing and I together were able to restrain Caluori and disarm him . ''

More Federal Way police arrived . Molnar said one of them asked Caluori if there was anything in the apartment that `` would hurt '' law officers and he replied , `` There are things inside that go boom . ''

The bomb squad was called to the scene and the residence and other apartments were evacuated . But police found no explosives .

The shotgun Caluori pointed was `` loaded to capacity , including a round in the chamber . The safety was not engaged , '' the affidavit said .

The pistol on his ankle was loaded with `` five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds , '' it said , and about 50 12-gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer .

A search of the apartment produced an AK-47-type rifle , a .45 caliber pistol , a Bushmaster AR15 rifle , more ammunition and a laptop computer , Molnar said .

Caluori 's mother , identified as R.B. in the affidavit , said Caluori `` spends a lot of time on the computer '' but she `` does not know what he does on it . ''

According to the affidavit , R.B. said Caluori has `` negative views of President Obama and in the last few days , most recently that day , has made negative statements about the president . ''

After reading Caluori his Miranda rights , Molnar asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene .

`` I think I do , but I do n't want to say it , '' he said .

He was shown a copy of the e-mail to the FBI and , asked if he wrote it , said , `` possibly , '' Molnar wrote .

Asked if he had any `` issues with the president , '' Caluori replied , `` You do n't have a high enough security clearance . Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command , '' Molnar said .

Threatening the president is punishable by up to five years in prison and assault of a federal agent is punishable by up to 20 years in prison , the U.S. attorney 's office said .

`` Recent national events are a stark reminder that we must take these threats of death or violence seriously , '' U. S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan said in a news release . `` This case had all the troubling ingredients : threats of violence and explosive devices , multiple weapons with hundreds of rounds and even brandishing of a weapon at law enforcement . ''

`` The United States Secret Service takes all threats against its protectees seriously . This situation is indicative of how a routine investigation can very easily turn violent , '' said James Helminski , special agent in charge of U.S. Secret Service in Seattle . `` We appreciate the professionalism of the Federal Way Police Department in defusing this potentially volatile situation and in the ongoing investigation . ''

Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac , Washington . A detention hearing has been set for Monday , the U.S. attorney 's office said .

His attorney , Kyana Stephens , would not comment on the case or the charges .
