The referee has refuted all allegations made against him , but that has not stopped Chelsea from taking its case further .

A statement on the official club website read : `` Chelsea Football Club today lodged a formal complaint with The Football Association regarding inappropriate language directed at John Mikel Obi by referee Mark Clattenburg . This is a result of a thorough investigation carried out by the club , and led by outside legal counsel , of all information available to us including interviews with a number of players and staff .

`` Following Sunday 's Premier League game against Manchester United , club board members were quickly made aware , upon entering the home dressing room after the final whistle , that there were allegations of inappropriate language directed at Chelsea FC players by Mr Clattenburg during the game .

`` Board members began establishing the details of the allegations , speaking to all relevant players and staff . After those initial interviews it was clear that the matter had to be reported . The correct protocol for doing so was to report the incidents to the match delegate , and the club took immediate steps to inform him as soon as he was available . It was not a decision the club took lightly .

`` Since reporting the matter to the delegate , the club and outside legal counsel have conducted further investigations . Having completed that process we have now followed the correct protocol and lodged a formal complaint with The FA regarding John Mikel Obi . There was not sufficient evidence to support a second claim to The FA with regard to the alleged verbal abuse of another first team player .

`` We will cooperate fully with The FA and the Police as they each investigate the matter . As events on Sunday are now subject to those investigations we are unable to comment further until those processes are complete . ''

Meanwhile , Mikel played 45 minutes as Chelsea defeated Manchester United 5-4 in a thrilling Capital One Cup encounter .

Javier Hernandez put the visitors back in front , his sixth goal in nine games against Chelsea , before Gary Cahill headed home a second equalizer .

United grabbed the advantage for the third time just before the hour mark when Nani rounded off a flowing move only for Eden Hazard 's 90th minute penalty to send the game into extra-time .

Daniel Sturridge then gave Chelsea the lead for the first time in the contest on 97 minutes and Ramires made sure of the victory added a fifth late on .

Giggs netted a penalty to make it a nervy last couple of minutes but Chelsea held out to book a quarterfinal place against Leeds United .

Elsewhere , Tottenham suffered a 2-1 loss at Norwich after Clint Dempsey failed to score a last minute penalty .
