Miami , Florida -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- The so-called `` barefoot bandit '' suspect will be sent to Washington state to face charges there , a federal judge in Miami , Florida , ruled Friday after Colton Harris-Moore waived his right to an extradition hearing .

He will be transferred in the next two weeks aboard a secure federal transportation service called `` con air , '' said Barry Golden of the U.S. Marshals Service .

Harris-Moore , 19 , is believed to be the person who earned the `` barefoot bandit '' nickname because he was unshod when he broke into houses in Washington . He was captured in the Bahamas after he apparently flew a stolen private plane there .

He appeared in Miami Federal Court Friday morning dressed in government-issued socks , sandals and shackles . Before the hearing , the young defendant appeared relaxed and even shared a few laughs with another detainee .

Harris-Moore did not speak during the session , which was a continuation of his first appearance earlier this week .

A public defender represented Harris in lieu of his attorney in the state of Washington , who will be present when a court there reads the charges against Harris and then conducts a detention hearing .

The Washington attorney , John Henry Browne , on Friday filed the request to waive the extradition hearing so his client could be immediately transferred to Washington . Magistrate Judge Robert L. Dube granted the request once he confirmed through the public defender that Harris-Moore has legal representation .

U.S. Marshal Albert Diego said the defendant will continue to be held at the Federal Correctional Center in downtown Miami until a secure flight to Seattle , Washington , is available for him .

Harris-Moore was taken into custody on Harbour Island in the Bahamas early Sunday .

He was sought in a string of home and airport break-ins in various U.S. locations , along with thefts of vehicles .

In the Bahamas , Harris-Moore pleaded guilty to a charge of illegally landing a plane , paid a $ 300 fine and was ordered deported , his lawyer said . Police said the plane was a Cessna that was stolen in Indiana and flown to the Bahamas , where it was found in the shallows off Abaco Island .

Harris-Moore was flown to Miami on Tuesday , the FBI said .

Typically in extradition cases , the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested , said Emily Langlie , spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Western District of Washington . The Southern District of Florida , in Miami , is the closest jurisdiction to the Bahamas , she said .

He is named in a federal complaint that was sealed until last week after being filed last December . The charge in the complaint -- interstate transportation of stolen goods -- stems from the theft of a plane in Bonners Ferry , Idaho , that crashed outside Granite Falls , Washington , Langlie said .

A conviction on the charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison .

Under the federal system , the case will go to a grand jury . If an indictment is returned , more charges could be filed .

Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case , but the courts Washington will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant , Langlie said .

`` He seems to be very remorseful , '' Monique Gomez , a Bahamian lawyer who represented Harris-Moore in Nassau , told CNN in a telephone interview .

Asked whether he acknowledged guilt in the other cases , Gomez said , `` Let me put it this way -- he wishes he had done things a little differently in his life . '' Still , she added , he appeared `` in good spirits . ''

Authorities in Madison County , Nebraska , issued an arrest warrant for Harris-Moore last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception . The affidavit supporting the warrant alleges the youth waged a crime rampage .

The teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in Renton , Washington , in 2008 . The FBI had offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest .

Harris-Moore has amassed more than 80,000 Facebook fans . In December , Time magazine dubbed him `` America 's most wanted teenage bandit . '' And 20th Century Fox has purchased the rights for a film based on his exploits .
