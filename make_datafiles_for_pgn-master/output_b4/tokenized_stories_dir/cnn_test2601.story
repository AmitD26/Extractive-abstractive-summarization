Los Angeles , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Prosecutors are expected to rest their case Friday in the seven-week-long trial of model Anna Nicole Smith 's boyfriend and two doctors .

They are expected to call their last witness Friday afternoon . And defense lawyers said they will likely not call any witnesses .

Smith 's boyfriend Howard K. Stern and two doctors are on trial for allegedly conspiring to feed her drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs .

One expert witness for the defense , a pain medications expert , has already testified for the defense . Dr. Perry Fine testified early because of scheduling issues .

Jurors watched a video on Wednesday of the Playboy model singing , kissing and bathing with her infant daughter just two months before her February 2007 death .

`` Momma did n't mean it , I 'm sorry , '' Smith said when Dannielynn began crying as she washed her face .

Prosecutors showed the 13-minute video to support their argument that Smith 's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs .

The defense does not deny Smith took a lot of drugs , but they contend Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed .

`` If she 's being treated for pain , it 's not illegal , '' Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said last week .

Judge Perry has suggested several times in recent weeks that the prosecution had fallen short in proving the core of its case , including that Smith was a drug addict .

The judge told the lawyers on Monday that he was considering dropping some of the charges before the case goes to the jury .

`` I expect some charges will likely survive in some form , '' Perry said .

The three are charged with a conspiracy to provide drugs to a known addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith .

They are not charged in her death , which a Florida medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid , a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu .

While much of the past seven weeks have been tedious testimony about medical practices and drugs , the video shown in court Wednesday captured the jury 's full attention .

Smith and her 2-month-old baby sat naked in a large tub in the Bahamas home where she spent most of her last months . The mother softly sang to her baby and kissed her repeatedly .

`` Love the water , '' Smith said to her child .

Stern smiled several times as he watched the video from his seat at the defense table .

`` Come on , Danny , do something good , '' jurors heard Stern say from behind the camera . `` Show us you 're a star . ''

In one moment , Smith and Stern seemed to joke about their rivalry for the baby 's attention .

`` Say ` Mommy , ' '' she told the baby . `` Say ` Daddy , ' '' he said .

They repeated that exchange several times before Stern said `` She made a funny face , she pointed to the camera . ''
