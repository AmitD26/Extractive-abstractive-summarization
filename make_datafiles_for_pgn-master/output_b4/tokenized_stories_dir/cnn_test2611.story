-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- On the eve of his second inaugural , President Obama appears smarter , tougher and bolder than ever before . But whether he is also wiser remains a key question for his new term .

It is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years . Weeks before the November elections , his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term .

`` Just watch , '' they said to me , in effect , `` he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the Republicans , insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy . Right on the edge of the fiscal cliff , he thinks Republicans will cave . ''

What 's your Plan B , I asked . `` We do n't need a Plan B , '' they answered . `` After the president hangs tough -- no more Mr. Nice Guy -- the other side will buckle . '' Sure enough , Republicans caved on taxes . Encouraged , Obama has since made clear he wo n't compromise with Republicans on the debt ceiling , either .

Foreman : My last letter to the president

Obama 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue : gun control . No president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation 's gun culture . Once again , he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front .

In his coming State of the Union address , and perhaps in his inaugural , the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system . Leading GOP leaders on the issue -- Sen. Marco Rubio , R-Florida , for example -- would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan . Obama wants to go for broke in a single package , and on a central issue -- providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents -- he is uncompromising .

After losing out on getting Susan Rice as his next secretary of state , Obama has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments . Rice went down after Democratic as well as Republican senators indicated a preference for Sen. John Kerry . But when Republicans also tried to kill the nomination of Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense , Obama was unyielding -- an `` in-your-face appointment , '' Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , called it , echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues .

Will Obama 's second inauguration let America turn the page ?

Republicans would have preferred someone other than Jack Lew at Treasury , but Obama brushed them off . Hagel and Lew -- both substantial men -- will be confirmed , absent an unexpected bombshell , and Obama will rack up two more victories over Republicans .

Strikingly , Obama has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon Vice President Joe Biden . During much of the campaign , Biden appeared to be kept under wraps . But in the transition , he has been invaluable to Obama in negotiating a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package . Biden was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures .

All of this has added up for Obama to one of the most effective transitions in modern times . And it is paying rich dividends : A CNN poll this past week pegged his approval rating at 55 % , far above the doldrums he was in for much of the past two years . Many of his long-time supporters are rallying behind him . As the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to score back-to-back election victories with more than 50 % of the vote , Obama is in the strongest position since early in his first year .

Smarter , tougher , bolder -- his new style is paying off politically . But in the long run , will it also pay off in better governance ? Perhaps -- and for the country 's sake , let 's hope so . Yet , there are ample reasons to wonder , and worry .

Avlon : GOP 's surprising edge on diversity

Ultimately , to resolve major issues like deficits , immigration , guns and energy , the president and Congress need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term . Over the past two years , Republicans were clearly more recalcitrant than Democrats , practically declaring war on Obama , and the White House has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections .

But a growing number of Republicans concluded after they had their heads handed to them in November that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center-right position , more open to working out compromises with Obama . It 's not that they suddenly wanted Obama to succeed ; they did n't want their party to fail .

House Speaker John Boehner led the way , offering the day after the election to raise taxes on the wealthy and giving up two decades of GOP orthodoxy . In a similar spirit , Rubio has been developing a mainstream plan on immigration , moving away from a ruinous GOP stance .

One senses that the hope , small as it was , to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away .

Zelizer : Second-term Obama will play defense

While a majority of Americans now approve of Obama 's job performance , conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness , he is going overboard , trying to run over them . They do n't see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate ; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up . News that Obama is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that sense . And it frustrates them that he is winning : At their retreat , House Republicans learned that their disapproval has risen to 64 % .

Conceivably , Obama 's tactics could pressure Republicans into capitulation on several fronts . More likely , they will be spoiling for more fights . Chances for a `` grand bargain '' appear to be hanging by a thread .

Two suspicions are starting to float among those with distaste for the president . The first is that he is n't really all that committed to bringing deficits under control . If he were , he would be pushing a master plan by now . Instead , it is argued , he will tinker with the deficits but cares much more about leaving a progressive legacy -- health care reform , a stronger safety net , green energy , and the like .

Politics : Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company

Second , the suspicion is taking hold that he is approaching the second term with a clear eye on elections ahead . What if he can drive Republicans out of control of the House in 2014 ? Then he could get his real agenda done . What if he could set the stage for another Democrat to win the presidency in 2016 ? Then he could leave behind a majority coalition that could run the country for years , just as FDR did . Democrats , of course , think the real point is that Obama is finally showing the toughness that is needed .

We are surely seeing a new Obama emerge on the eve of his second term . Where he will now lead the country is the central question that his inaugural address and the weeks ahead will begin to answer .
