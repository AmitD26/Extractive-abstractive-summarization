-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- American teenager Sloane Stephens stunned her compatriot Serena Williams on Wednesday , beating the 15-time grand slam winner 3-6 7-5 6-4 to reach the Australian Open semifinals .

The 29th seed , playing in her first grand slam quarterfinal , came from once set down to overcome third seed Williams who suffered a back injury having already rolled an ankle earlier in the tournament .

Despite Williams ' fitness problems , few had given Stephens a chance of beating the five-time Melbourne champion .

`` Someone asked me , ` Do you think you can win ? ' I was like , ` Yeah , I think so , but I was n't like too clear about it , '' '' the 19-year-old told reporters after advancing to a tie with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka on Thursday .

`` Then this morning when I got up , I was like , ` Look , dude , like , you can do this , go out and play and do your best . ' ''

Stephens did not make the best possible start as Williams went one set and a break of serve ahead , before the 19-year-old American dug deep to pull out an unlikely triumph .

`` You just fight and just get every ball back , run every ball down , and just get a lot of balls in play , '' said Stephens , explaining her strategy after the loss of that first set .

`` From then on I got aggressive , started coming to the net more , and just got a lot more comfortable . ''

Stephens becomes the first U.S. teenager to reach a grand slam semfinal since Serena at the 2001 U.S. Open , and the first to achieve the feat outside of the Williams sisters since Alexandra Stevenson at Wimbledon in 1999 .

For Williams , it marked the end of a campaign which had pushed her body to the limit .

`` I 'm almost relieved that it 's over because there 's only so much I felt I could do , '' said the 31-year-old . `` It 's been a little difficult . I 've been thrown a lot of balls these two weeks . ''

When one journalist asked Williams if she had considered retiring hurt during the match , it caused some confusion in the press room .

`` Are you kidding me ? I 'm not retiring , '' responded Williams , believing the reporter was asking if she was considering ending her career .

`` Oh , you mean , retiring in the match ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I thought you meant my career . You 're crazy .

`` I thought about it like for a nanosecond . It 's a quarterfinal of a grand slam . Even if I have to take off in a wheeler before I retire . ''

Defending champion Azarenka had to battle through a tough 77-minute first set against Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova , before winning 7-5 6-1 .

When asked about Stephens prior to her victory against Williams , Belarus ' Azarenka said : `` I think Sloane is a very , very talented girl . I think over the last couple years you see her development , you know , as a tennis player .

`` Her game has come together . She 's an all round player , very competitive . I think she has a good potential . It 's just a matter of her getting all those details in place and really wanting to achieve great things . ''

The second semifinal , also due to take place on Thursday , sees sixth seed Li Na take on No. 2 seed Maria Sharapova -- who is yet to drop at set at the tournament .
