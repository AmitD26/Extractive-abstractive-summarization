-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A friend of mine told me -LRB- when -RRB- I was 17 years old -LRB- that -RRB- I should sing opera because I had an interesting voice . I said : `` Oh my gosh , No ! These fat ladies singing on stage ! ''

She gave me two Maria Callas CDs , I listened to them and I started to sing the high notes . I started to hear the orchestra and the emotion -- and the power to express so many different feelings through voice , through instruments , through feelings . That was the beginning .

This talent I have got , I had to develop it , because it was a burning flame in my heart .

When it started , I knew . I do n't know how to explain it . Maybe different people feel that with love -- you just know it ! I felt that with music and opera .

Virginia Zeani , Ileana Cotrubas , there are so many great Romanian singers , but from my little town in the north , I think I was the first one . I come from Transylvania in the north of Romania . The city I am from is called Bistrita . My parents are very proud of me and so are other people in our little town .

So I worked through the summers so I could get professional singing lessons and then I got into the music academy in Cluj where I studied for six years . When I finished at the music academy , Ioan Holender from the Vienna State Opera heard about me from a critic .

He sent me an email -LRB- saying -RRB- that he wanted to hear my voice and from that moment on everything changed . I do n't know the details about what the critic wrote -- it must have been something that made him curious .

The difference between one singer and another is of , course , the talent he or she got from nature . The color of the voice , yes you could say that , but the most unique thing , the thing that makes a difference , is sincerity . It 's not that easy to open yourself to the audience -- to be sincere , to open your soul , to say , `` This is me with my talent , my insecurities , with everything I am . This is me . ''

Of course , technique is important too , but there are lots of singers with good technique who do n't take enough time , maybe , to develop the other part -- the sensitivity .

My technique is not perfect all the time -- if I am not sleeping enough or having problems and too many thoughts . You ca n't force your voice to sound the same all the time because lots of exterior things influence your resonance and your energy , and all that feeds into your voice .

The voice is a very sensitive instrument . It 's not that easy , it 's not just going out there and singing and your voice comes out . It would be so easy if it was like that . Can you imagine how hard it is without a microphone to have the force and the power to sound through an orchestra of 80 people playing loud music ? That 's not normal , right ? You have to be patient and focused and to love what you do and to understand there are lots of moments where you feel very down .

As an opera singer you have to understand that going through those rough moments is part of the lesson , of development , of enrichment . Going through those moments , you can learn to inspire yourself . I inspire myself when I have to interpret a role where the character is very sad or very depressed .

I think what I am doing to project that sound is connecting with something beyond this world . I just take a breath , and try to focus on one point . I ca n't push the sound out ; it feels more like I 'm just connecting myself with the universe .

There are lots of times where I feel depressed or lonely or misunderstood and different . I do n't have a normal life with family or a partner who can help me from time to time .

The most interesting thing -LRB- is -RRB- that we always work with new people -- new conductors , new musicians , new partners -- on a new repertoire or a new role . This is the most beautiful thing that keeps me awake and makes me discover more of myself , to want more .

You can compare being an opera singer with being an athlete : Both have to practice a lot to focus on the distance . I also have to somehow know when I can hold myself back to maintain energy .

Some days I practice three , four , five hours , it depends . Some days I 'm just reading , going through the score .

We are in the most beautiful and the most known theater in the world , La Scala in Milan . Great musicians , great tradition -- opera was born here .

I 'm so happy to be here , I could cry with gratefulness and joy for the emotions I feel . It 's more than a dream -- it 's that the most pure desire I had in my heart that came true .
