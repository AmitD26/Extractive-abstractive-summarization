-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Mexico 's foreign minister says he 's summoning the U.S. Ambassador following fresh reports of spying .

`` Shared security and responsibility between respectful neighbors can not be constructed by violating the law and violating trust , '' Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said Tuesday .

`` Mexico is convinced that the practice of espionage committed constitute a violation of norms , an abuse of the trust built between partnering countries and does not honor the historic friendship between our nations , '' he added .

Speaking in Geneva , Meade said he would summon U.S. Ambassador Anthony Wayne upon his return to Mexico .

His comments come days after Germany 's Der Spiegel news magazine published allegations that the U.S. National Security Agency `` systematically '' eavesdropped on the Mexican government and hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon .

Der Spiegel named former NSA contractor Edward Snowden as the source of its information .

On Sunday , Mexico 's government said such spying would be unacceptable , illegitimate and against the law .

Meade demanded a swift investigation , noting that U.S. President Barack Obama had vowed to investigate when earlier allegations of spying surfaced in September .

`` Mexico finally reiterates its confidence in the conviction of President Obama that international law is not an empty promise , '' Meade said . `` We are sure that the promise of an investigation made with Mexico is not either . ''

Mexico will also conduct its own investigation , Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong told reporters .

The new allegations drew a sharp response from Calderon in a series of Twitter posts on Monday .

`` More than personal , it is an assault on the institutions of the country , given that it was done when I was the president , '' Calderon said . `` I will be following the steps the Foreign Ministry takes to demand explanations from the United States and the corresponding account of responsibility . ''

A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN the Mexican government reached out about the report and that the two governments will be discussing it via diplomatic channels .

The NSA said it would not `` comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity , and as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations .

`` As the President said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly , we 've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence , so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share , '' the agency added .

The statements were the latest sign of international fallout over apparent Snowden leaks .

Mexico summoned Wayne in September after a report alleging the U.S. government had spied on Mexican President Enrique PeÃ ± a Nieto during last year 's presidential campaign .

Separately , the United States and Brazil agreed in September to postpone Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff 's state visit to Washington over reports the United States spied on her communications . That case of alleged NSA surveillance was also linked to apparent Snowden leaks .

And on Monday , the U.S. ambassador to France met with French diplomats over allegations the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in the European nation over a 30-day period . Those allegations were reported by France 's Le Monde newspaper , citing documents leaked by Snowden .

Snowden has admitted to leaking documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces charges of espionage and theft of government property in the United States . He is living in Russia after receiving asylum .

CNN has not independently verified the reports citing leaked documents by Snowden .
