WASHINGTON -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A Duke University official is accused of offering his 5-year-old adopted son for sex on the Internet , according to the FBI and court documents in the case .

Frank M. Lombard is the associate director of Duke University 's Center for Health Policy .

Frank M. Lombard , 42 , was arrested last week at his home in Durham , North Carolina . During an Internet chat , Lombard allegedly offered the child to the person he was chatting with , who was a task force officer from Washington 's Metropolitan Police , the FBI said in a statement .

The chat was initiated after a confidential source facing child pornography charges told authorities they had witnessed a man , allegedly Lombard , performing sex acts on a child over the Internet .

During the chat , according to the complaint filed against Lombard , he told the officer that he had performed multiple sex acts on the boy and that the officer could do the same if he came to Durham .

According to a transcript of the chat , reprinted in the complaint , Lombard allegedly told the officer that he had to hide the abuse from his partner and that he drugged the child with allergy medication .

Lombard was arrested June 24 , and two children at the home , including the 5-year-old , were removed from the home by the North Carolina Department of Social Services , the FBI said .

Lombard is the associate director of Duke University 's Center for Health Policy , but was placed on unpaid administrative leave , effective immediately , last week , university spokesman Keith Lawrence said .

The center is described on its Web site as a joint venture among the university 's law , business and arts-and-sciences schools and `` an instigator and facilitator of a broad range of research related to public health and the policies that address it . ''

Lombard faces federal child sex abuse charges , which carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years upon conviction , authorities said . He made an initial appearance in federal court in North Carolina but was transferred to Washington to face the charges there , court documents show .

Attempts to contact the Durham attorney who appeared in court with Lombard were unsuccessful Tuesday .

Federal agents seized Lombard 's computer , thumb drives , Web cams and other items when executing a search warrant upon Lombard 's arrest , according to court documents .
