-LRB- EW.com -RRB- -- Bruce Willis ' return as John McClane , A Good Day to Die Hard , topped the box office over the Friday-to-Sunday period , but with a weaker-than-expected $ 25 million . Fox 's $ 92 million thriller , which also stars Jai Courtney , earned $ 8.2 million on Thursday , its first day of release , and after four days , it 's earned $ 33.2 million . That 's a substantially weaker start than 2007 ′ s Live Free or Die Hard , which started with $ 33.4 million in its opening three-day weekend .

Die Hard 's middling performance is n't a total surprise . This has been a remarkably tough winter for male-driven action vehicles , many of which star members of The Expendables . Arnold Schwarznegger 's $ 45 million entry The Last Stand has earned just $ 12 million after five weekends . Sylvester Stallone 's Bullet to the Head , which reportedly cost $ 55 million , has only earned about $ 10 million after three . The Jason Statham thriller Parker cost about $ 35 million but has only grossed $ 17 million after nearly a month in theaters . The Mark Wahlberg/Russell Crowe shoot-em-up Broken City has languished with $ 19.5 million against a $ 35 million budget . -LRB- Meanwhile , 2013 ′ s top four highest-grossing movies -- Identity Thief , Mama , Warm Bodies , and Hansel & Gretel : Witch Hunters -- all feature women in leading roles . -RRB-

Obviously , A Good Day to Die Hard has already earned more than each of those aforementioned flops , though , and it should n't be written off as a misfire . The film 's $ 7,036 per theater average from 3,553 theaters was strong , and with a `` B + '' CinemaScore grade , it may benefit from word-of-mouth in the weeks to come . Prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend , and it remains to be seen whether it can match Live Free or Die Hard 's $ 134.5 million finish , but Fox can rest easy thanks to Die Hard 's strong international performance so far . The film earned a tremendous $ 61.5 million overseas this weekend , bringing its international haul to $ 80.1 million and its worldwide cume to $ 113.4 million . Those overseas results may keep John McClane Yippee-Ki-Yaying for years to come .

Last weekend 's champ , Identity Thief , dipped only 32 percent to $ 23.4 million in its second weekend . The Melissa McCarthy/Jason Bateman laugher has now earned $ 70.7 million against a slim $ 35 million budget , and , for Universal , it 's the latest in a hot-streak of sensibly budgeted hits that almost -LRB- almost -RRB- make up for the fact that the studio spent $ 209 million on Battleship , which earned only $ 65.4 million , last year . With the exception of The Man with the Iron Fists , every Universal film since the fall has been a profitable venture : Pitch Perfect -LRB- $ 65 million vs. $ 17 million budget -RRB- , This is 40 -LRB- $ 67.4 million vs. $ 35 million budget -RRB- , Les Miserables -LRB- $ 145.5 million vs. $ 61 million budget -RRB- , Mama -LRB- $ 68.3 million vs. $ 15 million budget -RRB- , and now Identity Thief . Next up on the studio 's plate ? The surefire smash Fast & Furious 6 .

Close behind in third place , Relativity 's $ 28 million Nicholas Sparks adaptation Safe Haven opened with $ 21.4 million . Including Valentine 's Day grosses , the goopy romance , which stars Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel , has earned a solid $ 30.5 million . Relativity did a great job of marketing Safe Haven as the top choice for Valentine 's Day couples , and the built-in cachet of Nicholas Sparks continues to prove irresistible for many moviegoers . Among all eight Sparks films , Safe Haven 's $ 21.4 million frame trails the opening weekends of just Dear John -LRB- $ 30.5 million -RRB- and The Lucky One -LRB- $ 22.5 million -RRB- , which finished with $ 80 million and $ 60.5 million , respectively .

For star Hough , who 's made the transition from Dancing with the Stars pro to fledgling country singer -LRB- remember ? -RRB- to Hollywood leading lady , Safe Haven represents her best-ever opening weekend following underwhelming debuts from Burlesque -LRB- $ 11.9 million -RRB- , Footloose -LRB- $ 15.6 million -RRB- , and Rock of Ages -LRB- $ 14.6 million -RRB- . She may carve out an acting career , yet . Like Die Hard , Safe Haven missed with critics , but earned a `` B + '' CinemaScore grade from audiences , which were 71 percent female and 68 percent below the age of 25 .

Weinstein 's animated effort Escape from Planet Earth benefited from the fact that no family films have hit theaters in almost two months and finished in fourth place with $ 16.1 million . Facing no family competition , Escape , which cost $ 40 million , fared better than Weinstein 's last attempt to get into the animation game , Hoodwinked Too ! Hood vs. Evil , which bombed with just $ 10.1 million in April 2011 . Despite poor reviews , Escape from Planet Earth wound up with a `` B + '' CinemaScore grade .

Rounding out the Top 5 was Summit 's Warm Bodies , which fell only 20 percent to $ 9 million , giving it a $ 50.2 million total . While the YA adaptation has n't become the next Twilight , positive word-of-mouth has helped Warm Bodies , which cost about $ 35 million , avoid the steep drops that usually plague films aimed at teens . It could finish with about $ 65 million .

Fellow YA tale Beautiful Creatures did n't earn such a Warm reception on its opening weekend . The witch-y tale bombed with only $ 7.5 million -- $ 10 million including Valentine 's Day grosses . Warner Bros. is distributing the film , which was financed for $ 60 million by Alcon Entertainment . Fortunately for the distributor , its other recent release , The Hobbit , is on pace to pass $ 300 million at the domestic box office on Monday . Audiences issued Beautiful Creatures a lukewarm `` B '' CinemaScore grade .
