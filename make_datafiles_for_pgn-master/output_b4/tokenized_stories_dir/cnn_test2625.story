The best of Nora Ephron

She wore many hats : essayist , playwright , journalist , novelist , an Oscar-nominated screenwriter and a movie director .

An accomplished screenwriter , her romantic comedies featured strong but appealing characters who tackled relationship issues with a comic insight into their situations .

They included box office hits `` When Harry Met Sally '' and `` Sleepless in Seattle , '' both of which earned her screenwriting Oscar nominations .

Ephron mourned as ` brilliant ' writer , humorist

She also received an Oscar nomination for `` Silkwood , '' the story of anti-nuclear activist Karen Silkwood .

`` An amazingly talented girl who was able to accomplish everything she set her mind to with great style and will be missed enormously , '' actor Martin Landau said in a statement .

Ephron also wrote and directed `` Julie & Julia , '' which earned Meryl Streep a best actress Oscar nomination in 2010 .

`` What a loss . A magnificent spirit and voice . She changed romantic comedy forever , '' actress Debra Messing said .

Ephron was born on May 19 , 1941 , into a family of writers .

While her parents ' works live on through movie rentals and classic film channels , perhaps the elder Ephrons ' true legacy is their daughters .

Nora Ephron made her directorial debut with the 1992 comedy , `` This Is My Life , '' which she co-wrote with her sister , Delia .

Both sisters also put together a production fashioned around Ilene Beckerman 's best-selling book `` Love , Loss and What I Wore . ''

Ephron believes her parents ' humor was a big part of her productions .

`` They were funny and they believed that everything was copy , '' Ephron said in 2009 . `` They believed that anything in life could be turned into a story , which is really the first rule of humor . I do n't think you can get through almost anything without humor . ''

She married screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi in 1987 , eight years after she divorced investigative reporter Carl Bernstein . Her failed marriage to Bernstein was the basis of her book and movie , `` Heartburn . ''

`` I feel bad for the people who do n't at some point understand that there 's something funny in even the worst things that can happen to you , '' Ephron said .

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Ephron 's stories set in his city are classics .

`` You 've Got Mail '' and `` Sleepless in Seattle , '' her romantic comedies starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan , were among her movies that featured a lot of the city 's iconic buildings as a backdrop .

`` The loss of Nora Ephron is a devastating one for New York City 's arts and cultural community , '' Bloomberg said in a statement . `` From her earliest days at New York City 's newspapers to her biggest Hollywood successes , Nora always loved a good New York story , and she could tell them like no one else . ''

In addition to making movies , Ephron also tackled writing in many other forms . Her essays include `` I Remember Nothing '' and `` Crazy Salad . '' She also wrote the 2002 play , `` Imaginary Friends . ''

Three years ago , Ephron provided a list of some of the best advice she 's ever got .

It included `` life is too short '' and `` location , location , location , '' an appropriate sentiment for a director whose romantic comedies focused on seizing the moment in major metropolitan cities .
