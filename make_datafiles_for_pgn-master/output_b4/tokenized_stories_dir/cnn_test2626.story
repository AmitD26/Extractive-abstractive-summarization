Vatican City -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Pope Benedict XVI prayed for peace in Syria , reconciliation in Myanmar , and comfort in flood-stricken Thailand and the Philippines in his annual Christmas message `` To the City and the World '' on Sunday .

Addressing a packed St. Peter 's Square on a glorious sunny day , the pope pleaded with God to `` bring an end to the violence in Syria , where so much blood has already been shed . ''

More than 5,000 people have died in Syria since President Bashar al-Assad began a brutal crackdown in mid-March on anti-government protesters calling for his ouster , the United Nations said earlier this month .

In his Christmas morning speech , Benedict also urged the international community to help those suffering hunger and insecurity in the Horn of Africa , a reference to famine and violence in Somalia and Kenya .

The pope 's reference to the Philippines came as the death toll from flooding there last week topped 1,000 , with more than 1,000 more missing .

He also prayed for peace and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians , and in Iraq , Afghanistan and South Sudan , and wished `` renewed vigor '' to those striving for the common good across the Arab world after this year 's revolutions .

The speech , called `` Urbi et Orbi '' in Latin , came a day after the pope delivered a homily that focused on the `` essence '' of the holiday rather than the `` commercial celebration '' it has become .

`` Today Christmas has become a commercial celebration , whose bright lights hide the mystery of God 's humility , which in turn calls us to humility and simplicity , '' the pope said during Mass on Christmas Eve . `` Let us ask the Lord to help us see through the superficial glitter of this season , and to discover behind it the child in the stable in Bethlehem , so as to find true joy and true light . ''

The 84-year-old pope , presiding over his seventh Mass as pontiff , also conjured up an image of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem , explaining that visitors must bend down to enter its low opening , drawing a tie to what followers of Christ must do to find their faith .

`` If we want to find the God who appeared as a child , then we must dismount from the high horse of our ` enlightened ' reason , '' he said . '' ... In this spirit let us celebrate the liturgy of the holy night , let us strip away our fixation on what is material , on what can be measured and grasped . ''

The pope started off Saturday 's celebrations by lighting a peace candle in the window of his study during the unveiling of a larger-than-life Nativity scene in St. Peter 's Square . The scene , at 23 feet high and 82 feet wide , is dedicated to the Virgin Mary , according to the Vatican 's news agency .

Thousands poured into the square and St. Peter 's Basilica ahead of the midnight Mass , which was actually held at 10 p.m. this year . Before his homily , the aging pontiff rode down St. Peter 's long aisle on a wheeled platform , waving to worshippers .
