Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In many ways , the debate over taming the nation 's spending and deficit beasts can be compared to a family 's hand-wringing over what to cut , and what to keep , in tough times . It may be easy to nix `` luxuries '' like vacations and eating out . But should `` essentials '' like a car or a home be downsized or gotten rid of to save money ?

Tough choices about what to keep , kill or cut back on are the kinds of things the nation 's lawmakers are considering as they try to trim a $ 14 trillion debt .

Should familiar yet costly `` essentials '' -- entitlements like Medicare , the nation 's health insurance program for seniors , and Medicaid , which provides health insurance for the nation 's poor -- be phased out or dramatically overhauled ?

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan laid out the Republican plan last week . It would radically overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering top tax rates .

President Obama on Wednesday laid out his plan for long-term deficit reduction , renewing his call for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for families making more than $ 250,000 while strengthening Medicare and Medicaid .

The Tea Party 's mantra to `` stop the spending '' largely refocused the national conversation on spending . Is it willing to see entitlement programs fundamentally changed ?

Levi Russell , a spokesman for the Tea Party Express , says one way to reduce spending is to cut waste , overlap and excess in government programs .

And yet Russell also partially endorsed Ryan 's plan , which would dismantle the current Medicare program starting in 2022 in favor or a voucher program , though it would not affect anyone who 's 55 or older now .

'' -LSB- The Ryan plan -RSB- addresses the fact that people who have paid their whole lives , that you do n't want to put them into a hardship , through no fault of their own , '' Russell said . `` At the same time , we need to make changes to the plan , for people who are younger . ''

`` Medicaid is something we talk about like it 's a God-given right , when it 's only been around since the 1960s . It 's a program that we phased in . We can easily start to phase it out , '' he said .

FreedomWorks , another prominent Tea Party group , echoed similar sentiments .

Adam Brandon , a spokesman , told CNN , `` The first thing you have to do is roll back entitlements you ca n't afford . Second is moving them towards solvency . One of the best ways to do that -- especially for younger workers -- is through some kind of voluntary personal accounts . ''

And yet , Brandon acknowledged that his and other Tea Party support organizations would have a tough time selling such ideas to everyday Americans .

`` It 's part of our job to get out there and to educate and make sure that voters have a choice and understand what we 're talking about , '' Brandon said . `` We 're not talking about throwing Grandma out on the street . What we are talking about doing is making hard , difficult decisions that are going to get the country , the fiscal house in order . ''

A fresh CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll , released Wednesday , shows how steep the hill may be .

The poll finds that while Americans are nearly evenly split on whether Republican proposals to cut spending go too far , only three in 10 think the GOP budget treats all groups in society fairly , while seven in 10 believe that Republican proposals favor some groups over others .

Meanwhile , FreedomWorks advocates going beyond radically reforming familiar entitlement programs and calls for the elimination of some very familiar government functions .

Specifically naming the departments of Housing and Urban Development , Education , Commerce , Agriculture and Energy , Brandon said , `` I think you could pretty much do away with the entire departments ... just eliminate them . ''

Norm Ornstein , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , does n't think that will happen .

`` I do n't think you 're going to find much appetite for that , '' he said .

Ornstein also criticized calls for dramatic overhauls of Medicaid and Medicare , especially as seen in the Ryan plan .

`` You 're really talking about ... shifting the cost of health care from where seniors pay about 30 % to where they pay closer to 70 % , '' he said .

`` My guess is , at best , you 're going to get a mixed reaction from that group to this set of proposals . ''

Though Ornstein feels that now is a good time to discuss the nation 's debt problem , he equated lawmaker support for Ryan 's plan to `` falling on a grenade . ''

It `` does n't take a dime from Defense , or takes very little from Defense . And cuts taxes for the wealthy and for companies , even as it takes a lot out of Medicare and Medicaid . So it becomes a question of whether this is seen as fair , '' Ornstein said .

As many lawmakers frame the debate around protecting future generations , one noted historian says it 's worthwhile to look at the past .

`` Cutting and balancing budgets is never really , in the end , that big of history stuff , '' Rice University professor of history Douglas Brinkley told CNN .

`` If I asked you , ` What did -LSB- President -RSB- Grover Cleveland do with his budget ? What did -LSB- President -RSB- Benjamin Harrison do with his budget ? What was -LSB- President -RSB- Taft 's budget ? ' -- you would n't know . Because 100 years from now , people wo n't think about budget fights so much . But they 're going to know , 100 years from now , that America pushed through civil rights acts in '64 and ' 65 , America created Medicaid and Medicare ... NASA sent a man to the moon . Big stuff that happens in history is being done by the federal government , not by people just carping about it all the time . ''

Brinkley continued : `` This sort of gutting mentality that the Tea Party has , a kind of visceral hatred of the federal government , it comes out of a lack of historical understanding and appreciation . ''

Calling Medicaid and Medicare `` wildly successful programs , '' Brinkley said that the Republican Party has been trying roll them back for decades .

`` I think if they 're given a magic wand , they would melt them away . ''

And Brinkley had a warning and prediction .

`` Not just Congressman Ryan , but if the main Republican candidate for president said he wants to shut down Medicaid and Medicare , if that happened , welcome to the second Obama term . ''
