-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Both houses of the New Jersey legislature plan to vote Monday on a controversial bill backed by Democrats that would qualify illegal immigrants for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities .

Supporters hope to pass the measure before Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine leaves office . Gov.-elect Christopher J. Christie , a Republican who takes office January 19 , has said he opposes the bill .

On Thursday , a Senate vote on the legislation was postponed .

After hours of heated debate January 4 , the bill passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee , 7-4 , and the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee , 8-6 . Both votes were along party lines .

To qualify under the bill , New Jersey high school graduates who are illegal immigrants must be enrolled at a public university or college and file an affidavit with the institution stating that they have applied for legal immigration status or will do so when eligible .

If signed into law , the bill would be the 11th of its kind . There are similar laws in California , Illinois , Kansas , Nebraska , New Mexico , New York , Oklahoma , Texas , Utah and Washington .

In 2008 , Oklahoma ended its support for in-state tuition for students who are in the United States illegally .

New Jersey Assemblyman Samuel Thompson , a Republican , said the bill discriminates against U.S. citizens who attend New Jersey colleges and universities but do n't live in the state . Thompson believes illegal immigrants do not have the right to a reduced tuition .

`` You can call it undocumented , you can call it whatever you want . But you are not legal and you are not entitled , '' Thompson said .

Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle , a Democrat , expressed frustration with misconceptions of the bill that label it as a `` free ride '' or `` state-funded '' education .

`` These students have been here for decades , have gone through the school system here and should pay the same as their counterparts who have gone through school with them , '' she said .

G. Jeremiah Ryan , president of Bergen Community College in Huttle 's district , supports the bill .

`` The undocumented kids have a tough time anyway . They 're really good about going to class , '' Ryan said . `` Then they stop because they ca n't afford to go to a four-year institution . ''

The New Jersey Office of Legislative Services said the bill would not affect state revenue because the state does not collect revenue from public colleges and universities . It is estimated that the bill 's provisions would increase the number of illegal immigrants applying for admission .

Assemblyman Michael Carroll , a Republican , questioned the validity of a bill that improves illegal immigrants ' access to education when their illegal status prohibits them from giving back to the state in a meaningful way .

However , proponents of the bill believe that the young students will be resources for the state . Democrats say that the backlog in applications for citizenship is the real culprit and that the controversy highlights the need for immigration reform on a national level .

Daniel Hurley , director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities , agreed . `` New Jersey could be the tipping point in terms of energizing Congress to put immigration reform higher on the agenda , '' he said .

Hurley cited a lack of legislative activity regarding in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in the past few years and applauded the New Jersey legislature . The legislation is the path to a more rational policy on education and immigration on a federal level , he said .

`` These men and women are not going back to their native homeland by and large ; they will be staying in New Jersey and the U.S. . The question is : Do we want to facilitate their education and professional aspirations so they can contribute civically and economically , or do we want to prevent that ? '' Hurley said . `` They may very well become a liability . ''

Thompson had blunt words for immigrants whose illegal status he felt nullified their right to education , `` Go back home , apply , come legally , and I 'll welcome you with open arms . ''

However , students who have lived illegally with their families in the United States see the opportunities the bill would give them . One such student -- Aura , who would only give her first name -- has been praised by teachers for her high grades .

`` This bill would just make our school dream possible . They 're not giving it to us for free , '' said Aura , who is now a U.S. citizen . `` If they open up this channel for us , we 'll do the rest . ''
