London -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Margaret Thatcher was `` an extraordinary leader and an extraordinary woman , '' British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a special session of Parliament Wednesday .

He led tributes to Britain 's only female prime minister two days after her death at age 87 from a stroke .

Meanwhile , Thatcher 's son Mark said that although his mother had been `` blessed with a long life and a very full one , '' the family 's loss is still difficult to bear .

The family is `` enormously proud '' and grateful that Queen Elizabeth II will attend her funeral next week , he said .

The lawmakers have been called back early from recess for the special parliamentary session to honor Margaret Thatcher 's memory .

Thatcher led the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 and was prime minister for 11 years .

Cameron told lawmakers it is important not to underestimate the `` thickness of the glass ceiling '' she faced at that time .

Her achievement in breaking through it to become a member of Parliament , then a minister and then prime minister was remarkable , he said .

He also praised her leadership in the Falklands War in 1982 , when Britain repelled an Argentinian invasion of the disputed Falkland Islands , also known as the Malvinas .

While prime minister , Thatcher lived under `` direct personal threat '' from the Irish Republican Army , Cameron added .

He paid tribute to her courage as he recalled that she lost two parliamentary colleagues to IRA terrorism , and was `` inches away from death '' in a 1984 IRA bomb attack on a Brighton hotel where lawmakers were staying during a Conservative Party conference .

The funeral with military honors planned for next Wednesday will be a `` fitting '' tribute , Cameron said .

`` She made the political weather , she made history , and let this be her epitaph : She made Britain great again , '' he concluded .

Praise and criticism from the opposition

Ed Miliband , leader of the opposition Labour Party , paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher 's achievements but at the same time pointed out he disagreed with many of her decisions .

`` Whatever your view of her , Margaret Thatcher was a unique and towering figure , '' he said , and a `` prime minister who defined her age . ''

She was right to see that the British economy needed to change , to encourage aspiration and to defend the Falkland Islands when Argentina invaded , he said .

But it would be dishonest not to say that she was wrong on other things , he said . These include calling Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress a terrorist organization , passing legislation that made it illegal to `` promote '' homosexuality in schools , and her treatment of Britain 's coal miners when she took on the trades unions .

Many in mining communities felt `` angry and abandoned , '' he said .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg , of the Liberal Democrat party , kept his remarks brief -- pointing out that Thatcher 's legacy still provokes strong feelings in many people in his northern England constituency .

But whatever your views of her policies , he said , `` it 's impossible to deny the indelible imprint Margaret Thatcher made both on the nation and the wider world . ''

She was a towering figure `` not as written in the history books but still in the prime of her political life , '' he said .

The comments from those outside her party reflect the fact that Thatcher was a highly polarizing leader , whose influence on British politics is still felt more than 20 years after she left office .

There were noticeably more empty seats on the opposition side of the chamber in the House of Commons .

But many on both sides of the house laughed , sometimes fondly and sometimes ruefully , as lawmakers recounted anecdotes about their own interactions with Thatcher .

She earned the nickname `` the Iron Lady '' for her personal and political toughness in office .

The session in the House of Commons is expected to last several hours .

The House of Lords , where Thatcher served after she was ennobled to Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven following her departure from office , is also holding a session in her honor .

Former Conservative leader Michael Howard , now Lord Howard , defended her approach to decision-making , seen by many as divisive .

`` If she had waited for consensus , nothing would ever have happened , '' he said . `` She saw what needed to be done and she did it , with clarity , with courage and with compassion . ''

Very few people have made a contribution to the nation on the scale of that of Thatcher , he said , and `` the light of her legacy will shine as a beacon down the generations . ''

Lord Norman Tebbit , a former chairman of the Conservative Party and a Cabinet minister under Thatcher , recalled her kindness to him and his wife after they were badly injured in the Brighton bombing .

Working for her was made easier by the firmness of her convictions , he added .

The last time both houses of Parliament were recalled during a recess was in summer 2011 , when London and other cities were rocked by riots and looting .

Divided opinion

A towering figure in postwar British and global politics , Thatcher is remembered in the world for her Cold War-era friendships with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , as well as her role in shaping Britain 's place in Europe and the short , sharp war she waged with Argentina over the disputed Falkland Islands .

At home , she divides opinion . Many Britons blame her for creating soaring unemployment , when she reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to business and took on the unions .

Her battle with striking coal miners won her few friends in mining communities in northern England and Wales . But supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the British economy and gave many working people new freedoms .

Preparations are already under way for a funeral to be held next Wednesday at St. Paul 's Cathedral . With full military honors , it will rival those given to Diana , Princess of Wales and the Queen Mother .

The queen , accompanied by husband Prince Philip , will be among the high-profile guests .

What do you think about the loss of Britain 's ` Iron lady ' ? Tell us

However , Prince William and his wife , Catherine , who 's expecting their first child , will not attend the funeral , nor will Prince Harry , Prince Charles or his wife , Camilla , Buckingham Palace said .

The announcement that Thatcher would receive a `` ceremonial '' style funeral , one step down from the state funeral usually reserved for the monarch , has prompted heated debate in the United Kingdom .

While some supporters want her to be given a state funeral , others have questioned whether she merits a send-off on par with that of Diana 's .

Opinion : Why Thatcher was the ` Iron Lady '

The service , which will be televised , will be followed by a private cremation , Cameron 's office said Tuesday .

Crowds are expected to line the streets between the Palace of Westminster -- where her coffin will lie on the eve of the funeral -- and St. Paul 's Cathedral .

On the day of the funeral , the coffin will travel by hearse from Westminster to a Royal Air Force chapel , where it will be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the King 's Troop Royal Artillery .

From there , it will be taken in procession to St. Paul 's Cathedral along a route lined by servicemen and women from the army , Royal Navy and Royal Air Force .

Thatcher 's family and friends will wait inside the cathedral with many who worked with her in government and elsewhere .

The funeral is being organized in line with the wishes of her family , Downing Street said . They include her twin children , Mark and Carol .
