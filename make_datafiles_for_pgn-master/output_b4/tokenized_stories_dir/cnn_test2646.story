-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Several years ago , Satwant Singh Kaleka put a large American flag in the front of his yard , raising the eyebrows of his children , who thought it might be considered an eyesore .

Kaleka pointed out there were no homes nearby with flags , and he wanted to show that the United States was a land of opportunity , said his son , Amardeep Kaleka .

The elder Kaleka , 65 , served as president of the Sikh temple in Oak Creek , Milwaukee , scene of Sunday morning 's mass shooting . He was one of six community members killed .

`` He lived the American dream , '' Amardeep Kaleka told CNN . His father brought his family to the United States with little money but a strong work ethic in the early 1980s . The flag also was a form of protection for the family , Satwant Kaleka told them .

It stood at half-staff Monday evening as the family grieved .

The six killed in Sunday 's attack were identified by police as five men -- Kaleka ; Sita Singh , 41 ; Ranjit Singh , 49 ; Prakash Singh , 39 , and Suveg Singh , 84 -- and a woman , 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur .

`` She was a good woman . She was a great mom , '' said Kaur 's son , Harpreet Saini , 18 .

Kaur and her family immigrated to the United States eight years ago .

`` She lived for us . She worked for us . Anything she did , it was for us , '' said her older son Kamal Saini , 20 . `` If there was n't enough to eat it was always us before she ate . ''

When Kaur was in the temple praying on Sunday , `` My aunt told her that there was a shooting going on outside , we need to get up and leave , '' said Kamal Saini . `` Rather than just getting up and leaving , she wanted to just bow down and pray for the last time and then get up and leave . She was just getting up . She was shot in the back . ''

Her dream was for her sons to be educated . `` She told us education is everything here , '' said Kamal Saini .

His mother 's death `` took my world away , '' he said .

Both young men plan to pursue careers in law enforcement . `` I wanted her to see me in uniform , '' Kamal Saini said .

Another victim , Suveg Singh , spent every day at the temple , said his granddaughter , Sandeep Khattra .

`` He is always there , and he 's with the community and anybody who is willing to listen , '' said Khattra . `` He educated them about our religion . ''

The victim 's family told CNN they will return to their temple . His son , Baljander Singh Khattra , said Suveg Singh was friendly and a `` very strong person . ''

Prakash Singh was a priest who recently immigrated to the United States with his wife and two young children , said Justice Singh Khalsa , a temple member since the 1990s .

Amardeep Kaleka said people called to tell him that his father saved many lives Sunday .

The son said he was not surprised his father tried to stop the gunman at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin .

`` It 's an amazing act of heroism , but it 's also exactly who he was , '' Amardeep Kaleka told CNN Milwaukee affiliate WTMJ . `` There was no way in God 's green Earth that he would allow somebody to come in and do that without trying his best to stop it . ''

Remembering the victims

Amardeep Kaleka said the FBI told him his father attacked the shooter in the lobby , resulting in a `` blood struggle . '' A knife close to the victim 's body showed blood on it , he said .

`` From what we understand , he basically fought to the very end and suffered gunshot wounds while trying to take down the gunman , '' said Kanwardeep Singh Kaleka , Satwant 's nephew .

Satwant Kaleka 's wife , Satpal , hid with several other women , telling them to remain quiet during the horrific incident .

The gunman came into the kitchen and shot and wounded two women , she told CNN . `` I grabbed everybody and said run , run to the pantry . ''

Amardeep Kaleka said his father worked hard and was an honest man .

`` I would love for them -LRB- the public -RRB- to know that he lived his life with the principles that he knew and he was taught at a young age . It made him highly successful in America . ''

President Barack Obama signed a proclamation honoring the victims , ordering that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff at federal facilities and buildings .

Vigils were held Monday night , and one is set for Tuesday . The Sikh temple in Brookfield , northwest of Oak Creek , was to hold a candlelight vigil late Monday .

The Rev. Paul Armstrong of Oak Creek Community United Methodist Church , site of a Monday evening prayer vigil , said the diverse array of faiths in the community have an opportunity to further deepen bonds . `` There 's a few of us who will be calling folks together to organize some more interfaith services , '' he told CNN .

`` Being in mission to the world is something we share , '' Armstrong said of his faith and the Sikh community . `` Their hospitality is wonderful . That is something the Christian community is called to do . ''

The vigil was held outdoors , and a survivor of the temple shooting spoke , according to Armstrong .

`` The focus was to express our sorrow and that all of us can be lights of the world , '' he said .

Navdeep Singh , a policy adviser to the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund , says Sikhs believe in freedom of religion , community service and inclusiveness . At temples , or gurdwaras , where Sikhs hold services , everyone is welcome .

`` You can come and be equal , '' he says .
