-LRB- Oprah.com -RRB- -- Five women who were stuck in unfulfilling relationships share their wake-up moments .

Alexis Smith : `` I wanted to believe him ''

Her story Alexis was a party girl studying fashion , and George was a shy art student when they met in college . `` We were attracted to what the other had to offer , '' Alexis says . After years of dating , she married George , shortly after giving birth to their first son .

Alexis began to notice a change in her marriage once her husband opened an art gallery and started staying out late . George admitted to cheating on Alexis while she was pregnant with their third child .

Wake-up moment George begged forgiveness , and Alexis , who was eight months pregnant , gave him another chance . They moved from Manhattan to a quaint country house . But , on the first Christmas Eve in their new home , Alexis discovered that George was in love with another woman and decided that it was time to leave him -- for good .

Resolution George moved out , and Alexis was on her own . That 's when she realized she 'd been on her own for years . When George was once again ready to reconcile , Alexis had an epiphany : `` If I go back now , I 'll lose any self-respect I 've mustered over the past months . '' She carried on building up her own clothing line and then , unexpectedly , fell in love . `` I never thought I 'd find love again . Or that someone would love me for me . ''

Myra Tillotson Nuriddin : `` Seven years of invisibility piled up ''

Her story Myra was 47 years old and divorced when she met Sulaiman , a man who had 10 children from three previous relationships . Myra , mother to a grown son , and Sulaiman eventually said their `` I dos . '' Their decision not to invite all of Sulaiman 's children to the wedding backfired , and Myra 's relationship with her stepchildren suffered . Tension built up for years , and Myra often felt disrespected and resented by Sulaiman 's children . `` But if I brought it up with Sulaiman , he 'd say , ` Do n't play children 's games -- you 'll never win , ' '' Myra says .

Wake-up moment One Christmas Eve , Myra invited all of Sulaiman 's children over for dinner . After a full day of cooking , her stepchildren trickled in more than an hour late . Angry and hurt , Myra remembers Sulaiman 's oldest son walking right past her when he finally arrived for dinner . `` Seven years of painful invisibility piled up into that one moment , and I lost it , '' Myra says .

Resolution After confronting Sulaiman with her concerns , she found a therapist who suggested that she and Sulaiman try an Imago workshop focusing on couples and communication . At the workshop , they learned how to `` mirror '' each other . `` When I 'm angry , Sulaiman repeats what I 'm saying to him before he responds . That calms me instantly , '' Myra says .

The Imago method has also helped work things out with her stepchildren . For their 10th wedding anniversary , Myra and Sulaiman renewed their vows . `` All the kids were invited , '' Myra says . `` When I first said ` I do ' to Sulaiman , I thought it was just the two of us . This second time around , I knew it was actually 13 . ''

Michelle Barrett : `` We 'd get meaner with every fight ''

Her story Michelle began dating Joe , a rival marketing rep who proposed a year later over ice cream cones in the park . Soon after , the fighting began . `` We were constantly getting into stupid arguments that left me feeling alone , '' Michelle says . They sought help but the arguments continued to escalate . `` We 'd get meaner with each fight , '' Michelle recalls . `` I threatened to leave , and he called my bluff . That 's when I got really scared . ''

Wake-up moment Michelle 's biggest fear was losing Joe . A friend mentioned a weekend `` reconnecting '' workshop for couples , but Michelle had burned out on therapists . Faced with a decision , Michelle 's mother asked her , `` If you do n't do this , are you prepared to live with the consequences ? '' That struck Michelle like lightning . `` Joe and I were in a hurtful holding pattern , '' she says . `` My mom 's words jolted me into action . ''

Resolution At the workshop , the first exercise was an exorcism . `` We had to act out a scary childhood moment , '' Michelle recalls . '' -LSB- My stepfather -RSB- was extremely verbally abusive to me , and my model for how men acted . So if Joe disagreed with me , I 'd hear my stepfather and freak out . ''

Following the workshop , Michelle confronted her stepfather , who apologized for treating her badly . Now , she says , `` whenever I 'm mad at Joe , I ask myself , ` What 's this really about ? ' '' As a result , the arguments do n't escalate . `` We love each other too much to let minor blowups tear us apart , '' Michelle says .

Megan Davis : `` I wanted to help him get better ''

Her story Megan met Greg while studying abroad in Australia . He was a free spirit who often needed time by himself and would often go off for weekends alone . Meanwhile , Megan took on all the domestic duties of their relationship . `` I was so often worried about his feelings that I would do all these things to make his life easier , '' she says .

After eight years of dating , Greg confessed to Megan that he was depressed and began taking antidepressants . Soon after , he proposed to Megan during a trip to Taiwan . Six weeks before their September wedding , Greg came home in tears and wanted to postpone the wedding . He started therapy and , two months later , asked Megan to join him in seeing the therapist . `` I readily agreed , '' she says . `` I wanted to help him get better . ''

Wake-up moment After eight sessions , Megan felt `` we were going in circles . '' The therapist told them to work on their communication skills , but they still had n't done the assignments from the first session . `` I knew then that I had done all I could , and that Greg 's moodiness was going to be his lifelong struggle , '' Michelle says . `` I wanted him to be happy , but I finally realized that I could n't do that for him . ''

Resolution At first , the loneliness was palpable . `` I spent my 20s with one man , and suddenly I was alone , '' she says . `` Regaining my self-confidence was hard . ''

Now , Michele says she knows she made the right decision . `` I have a therapist friend who once told me if I was meant to leave Greg , I 'd know in my gut when the time came , '' she says . `` Acting on that moment made me realize I can trust myself . ''

Sarah Albertson : `` He was a good man , but he was dull ''

Her story After Sarah 's first date with Richard , she did n't plan on seeing him again . But after getting fired from her job and facing a July 4 weekend alone , she called him back . He was different from the guys she normally dated , but he filled a void . `` I was very lonely and insecure -- and unlucky in love , '' she says . `` I thought he was as good as it would get for me . ''

They married , moved from Manhattan to Santa Barbara and started a family . `` My life seemed full , but it was n't . I did n't love my husband , '' she says . `` I faulted myself for not liking him more -- he was a good man , but he was dull . ''

Wake-up moment One night , Sarah came home late , exhausted and looking for comfort . Instead , she found her husband and two children asleep in her bed -- leaving no room for her . After putting her kids to bed , she decided that she could n't pretend anymore . `` My husband initiated sex , '' Sarah recalls . `` And I started crying . He asked , ` What 's wrong ? ' I said , ` I do n't want to do this anymore . ' '' He did n't fight it .

Resolution `` I had finally found the courage to leap , '' she says .

Sarah signed up for Match.com several months after the split . `` Everybody told me it was too soon to date , '' she recalls . `` I was like , ` I 've waited my whole life for romance . ' ''

Through Match , Sarah met Adam , who she married in 2000 . Their relationship is n't perfect -- `` we have disagreements that leave me frustrated -- but I feel passionate about him . That 's the big difference . ''
