-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Count by count , Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales on Wednesday admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan .

Bales pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges , including 16 premeditated murder counts , in a hearing before a military judge . He admitted to slipping away from his outpost in southern Afghanistan and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012 , a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies .

The move spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings . But he was unable to offer the judge , Col. Jeffery Nance , an explanation for his actions .

`` I 've asked that question a million times since then . There 's not a good reason in the world for the horrible things I did , '' Bales replied , according to Drew Mikkelson of CNN affilliate KING , who was tweeting from the courtroom .

Wednesday 's hearing was held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord , near Tacoma , Washington . Both Nance and Lt. Gen. Robert Brown , commander of the Army 's I Corps , have approved the plea agreement , said Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield , a spokesman for the installation .

Bales now faces life in prison , but a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel will decide whether he will have a chance at parole , Dangerfield said . Nance set sentencing for August 19 .

`` Sergeant Bales has been waiting for the day that he can accept responsibility for what he has done -- the day that he can give , hopefully , some sense of peace to the people who are the victims of this tragedy , to his own family and to the soldiers who are still serving in Afghanistan , '' defense attorney Emma Scanlan said after the hearing . `` That has been his purpose from the beginning , and that remains what he wants from this . ''

In addition to the murder counts , Bales pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder , seven of assault and the use of illicit steroids and alcohol , but pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice .

Bales is a member of the Army 's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team , an element of the 2nd Infantry Division . His attorneys have said the service made a mistake in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq .

In the penalty hearings , Scanlan said the defense also will argue that Bales ' problems were also fueled by drugs and alcohol provided by Special Operations troops at his outpost before the killings .

`` We know all of those things to be true , as does the government , '' Scanlan told reporters after the hearing . `` You take that with somebody on their fourth deployment and the stresses of combat , and we get in some parts of the situation we are in today . ''

But Scanlan added , `` There 's no justification '' for the massacre . `` He does n't have one , and neither do we . ''

U.S. and allied troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 in response to the September 11 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington . The invasion quickly routed Afghanstan 's ruling Taliban , which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory , but the Taliban regrouped and have mounted a guerrilla war against the allied-backed government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ever since .

More than 2,200 Americans and nearly 1,100 allied troops have been killed since the war began in October 2001 . Nearly 15,000 civilians have died since 2007 , the United Nations reported in February .

The United States plans to remove combat troops from the country by the end of 2014 .
