New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Like so many other people of my generation , John Lennon and the Beatles made an indelible stamp on my life . The very first piece of vinyl I actually owned -- and had n't borrowed from my older brother -- was the album `` Help ! ''

To this day , I can remember at the age of 8 dropping the needle on the disc and hearing Lennon 's voice roar through the 10-inch speaker on my record player .

The Beatles had a profound influence on me . They 're the reason why I picked up a guitar , formed a band at age 11 and dreamed of a life as a rock star .

Fast-forward 16 years to December 8 , 1980 .

At the time , I was a music journalist for City TV in Toronto , Canada , hosting `` The New Music '' program . Just a couple of weeks earlier , we had reported on Lennon 's comeback with the album `` Double Fantasy , '' which marked his re-emergence after five years out of the music business as a self-proclaimed `` househusband . '' We were actively working with his record company , trying to set up an interview for a future edition of the program .

I was not far from my 24th birthday when the telephone rang on that December day around 11:30 p.m. . It was my executive producer , John Martin .

`` Lennon has been shot , `` he said , `` and we need to do a special . ''

Tell us where you were when Lennon died

It was one of those moments where time seems to slow down and the mind considers a hundred questions before finally settling on the truth :

How could he have been shot ? Are the reports mistaken ? Who would do such a thing ? How could we lose such a pop culture icon ? Did n't he just turn 40 ? Did n't he have a young son ? Did n't he have security ?

Will I wake up and this will all have been just a dream ?

We gathered that night in our offices to sift through the material that we had : old Beatles footage , a Lennon documentary that my producer shot years earlier , and the famous D.A. Pennebaker film .

We collected the names of friends , collaborators and other acquaintances who could help us tell the Lennon story . A day or two later , City TV aired a live broadcast of a memorial to Lennon at Nathan Phillips Square in front of Toronto 's City Hall .

Canada had a rich history with Lennon : It was there that he made his post-Beatles debut with the Plastic Ono Band in 1969 and staged his famous North American bed-in in Montreal .

Next Wednesday marks 30 years since Lennon 's murder . His killer , Mark David Chapman , 55 , is still serving his prison sentence of 20 years to life at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York .

He will stay there for at least another two years as he was just denied parole for the sixth time .

This weekend , CNN will examine the events leading up to Lennon 's killing . Chapman and his wife , Gloria Abe , describe the murder in rare audio recordings that will debut on CNN 's `` Losing Lennon : Countdown To Murder . '' Chapman 's childhood friends reveal an obsessive idolization of Lennon that later turned to hatred . His wife talks about how she knew that her husband planned to kill Lennon and explains why she did n't warn anyone .

The impact of Lennon 's death still reverberates today . Several tribute concerts and ceremonies started in October , when Lennon would have turned 70 , and have carried on since .

This year , Lennon 's widow , Yoko Ono , revived the Plastic Ono Band with current rock stars including Lady Gaga . Ono told Rolling Stone she believes this rekindling of interest in Lennon `` has to do with the social climate , with wanting some of John 's energy , power and conviction . ''

Lennon 's profound influence on music and musicians continues to this day . Marc Roberge , the lead singer of alt-rockers O.A.R. , was not even 2 years old when Lennon was killed . Roberge penned the recent song `` Dakota '' after stopping by Lennon 's old apartment building with his wife .

He was so taken with the images that came to mind as he looked into the entranceway where Lennon was shot that he walked across Central Park West , sat down on a park bench and penned these lyrics :

Outside the archway lies a thief , awaiting Double Fantasy

He 's something evil underneath

Outside Dakota died the symphony

`` I watched and I tried to imagine this going down , '' Roberge told me . `` And then I tried to imagine what if it never happened , and that 's really the question of the song : ` If you just kept walking on your way . ' I mean , would the world be different ? And I think the world would be better . ''

Like Roberge , I 've often wondered what would have happened had Lennon not been murdered . Would the world have been a better place ? There 's certainly every possibility that his commitment to peace would have added something substantive to the global conversation .

At the very least , we would have had years more of great music and performance from a man who was truly an artistic genius .
