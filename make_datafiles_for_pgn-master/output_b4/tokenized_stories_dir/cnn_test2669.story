-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Melissa Earll owns stacks of classic comic books , baseball cards that include a young Hank Aaron and Whitey Ford and other collectibles she wants to sell .

But she ca n't do so on eBay , she says . According to Earll , the popular auction site ca n't confirm her as a seller because she 's deaf .

`` eBay keeps me from taking advantage of opportunities that other people have and it 's because I could n't hear , '' Earll , of Nevada , Missouri , told CNN affiliate WDAF-TV . `` Somebody has to have the courage to stand up and say ` this is not right . ' ''

At issue , according to Earll , is the way the auction site verifies sellers . eBay says it offered Earll alternative ways of verifying her identity . But the dispute casts a light on a bigger question that some experts say may need to go all the way to the Supreme Court : Just how responsive must the Internet be to the Americans With Disabilities Act ?

The Internet has long been seen as an equalizer , granting everyone the same access to information regardless of cultural background or economic status . But for some users with disabilities , it 's not so simple .

`` The ADA was signed in 1990 . The Internet did n't really start going until the 1990s , '' said William D. Goren , a Decatur , Georgia , attorney who specializes in cases involving the federal law . `` This is a topic we 're going to have to be watching . This is not going away . ''

In Earll 's case , she says she ca n't use eBay 's verification system , which requires sellers to retrieve and submit a password from a telephone call . She ca n't hear the password and says eBay does n't use voice-to-text or other technologies deaf people often rely upon .

`` They said , can your mom or dad answer the phone for you , '' said Earll , who lip-reads and speaks with the assistance of a hearing aid . `` And I said , I 'm a 47-year-old adult woman . No . I do n't live at home . No . ''

A federal judge did n't agree with her argument , though .

U.S. District Judge Edward Davila dismissed her complaint after finding it lacked enough facts . Specifically , he said Earll did n't prove that she tried to register as a seller after talking to eBay about a possible solution .

`` eBay is pleased with the court 's decision to dismiss the case , '' company spokeswoman Kari Ramirez said in a written statement . `` eBay strives to provide all users with the best customer experiences possible , including those with special access needs . eBay will continue to stand ready to assist those who are deaf or hard of hearing become eBay sellers . ''

Earll is appealing that ruling .

Little legal agreement

eBay is the most high-profile website to be involved in a disabilities discrimination case since Netflix , which last year agreed to caption all of its online movies and other shows by 2014 .

The move , which the National Association for the Deaf called `` a model for the streaming video industry , '' came after Netlix was hit with a 2010 class-action suit because not all of its films were subtitled . A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled in the plaintiffs ' favor , saying any new laws regarding the Internet should `` complement , not supplant '' the Americans With Disabilities Act .

`` The Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund , '' which handled the case , `` hopes that this is the beginning of opening the Internet for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in streamed entertainment , education , government benefits , and more , '' the group said at the time .

Arguments for both sides in those and other cases point out something of a problem : There seems to be no agreement on how disability issues on the Web should be handled .

Goren , the disability law attorney , said judges have ruled both ways in those cases , and that even those who agreed cited different laws in doing so .

Some have stuck close to the original wording of the ADA , which requires that places of business be physically accessible to people with disabilities . Websites that represent brick-and-mortar stores need to comply , courts have ruled , while Web-only businesses do not .

Other courts have opined that ADA regulations should obviously be extended to Web companies , since the widespread popularity of Web commerce did n't exist when the law was written . It all makes for a confusing jumble of opinions that legal experts say needs to be clarified .

Congress has n't been much help , either . Even when they made some changes to the original ADA language in 2008 , they failed to address online concerns .

To the Supreme Court ?

That , Goren says , means the Supreme Court will ultimately need to settle the issue once and for all .

`` This is going to go all the way to the top , '' he said . `` There are so many different approaches . You 're going to see the courts split . Unless Congress steps in and talks about how the ADA applies to the Internet , the court 's going to have to figure it out . ''

Eric Goldman , a professor of law at Santa Clara University and director of the school 's High Tech Law Institute , thinks current law is somewhat more settled . The argument that won the day for eBay -- that the ADA does n't specifically mention websites and , therefore , does n't apply to them -- has prevailed except for in `` quirky rulings , '' he says .

`` We might debate the merits of those laws , many of which were written for a different time , but that 's for the legislatures to do , not the courts , '' he said . '' As a result , the lawsuits against websites for discriminating against the disabled are not legally meritorious . In this case , the courts bent over backwards -- more than they should have , in my opinion -- to give Ms. Earll a chance to make a valid legal complaint . She could n't . ''

That said , Goldman thinks websites should voluntarily be doing more .

`` In this case , for example , it seems reasonable that eBay should have a workaround to their authentication system that works for the hearing-impaired , '' he said . `` They may have a workaround -- the materials I 've read in this case have n't been clear about that -- but the workaround should be easy enough that Ms. Earll never needed to go to court .

`` Some websites may not have the resources to provide full accommodations for the disabled , but a site like eBay does -- and it should do so , '' he added .

eBay notes that in her complaint , Earll said company agents told her about alternative methods , including submitting proof of identity and SMS text messages , that she and other hearing-impaired people could use to become sellers .

`` eBay offers solutions to help the visually and hearing impaired , individuals with color vision deficiencies , as well as those with limited dexterity access eBay 's services , '' said Ramirez , the eBay spokeswoman . On its website , eBay has a page devoted to accessibility issues , including a profie of Rick Willison , a pastor who became a successful seller despite a degenerative eye disease .

For her part , Earll says she 's willing to go all the way to the Supreme Court if that 's what it takes for her to use the auction site as a seller just as easily as she 's used it as a shopper .

`` You know what 's funny -- eBay loved me as a buyer , '' she said . `` Oh , sure ... because they made money off of me . ''
