-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's 7:20 a.m. and Carl Daikeler has n't worked out yet . Not a big deal for the 49 % of Americans who do n't exercise regularly , but it 's going to bother him all day .

The problem is the CEO of Beachbody , the company behind P90X and Insanity , does n't like to work out . So much so that he sometimes has to `` trick '' himself into the gym . Like the time he decided he could n't brush his teeth before he worked out for at least 10 minutes . That little ploy inspired Beachbody 's 10-Minute Trainer program .

The fitness industry is constantly coming up with similar tricks to get more of us off the couch , Daikeler said .

The result is a rotation of incoming and outgoing trends -- from Jane Fonda 's VHS tapes in the early '80s to Beachbody 's DVD programs that are popular today .

Daikeler compares fitness to fashion . `` Somebody starts wearing a certain shoe in Milan or Japan and suddenly everybody wants to wear it , '' he said . `` It does n't just solve the problem -- like shoes cover your feet . It makes you feel like it 's -LRB- a part of -RRB- your identity . ''

Starla Kay teaches youth video classes at the Indiana Black Expo in Indianapolis . She has a 19-month-old son and not a lot of time for a workout program that does n't work .

She tried kickboxing , aerobics and just going to the gym , but nothing really stuck until she got one of this year 's hot trends , P90X .

`` This is the first actual program I 've done , '' she said . `` I feel stronger . I feel like I have more energy . I 've lost 9 pounds so far . ''

The American College of Sports Medicine publishes a yearly survey of the top worldwide fitness trends . The top 10 list for 2011 includes boot camps and programs aimed at older adults .

Trends depend on many factors , said the survey 's lead author , Walt Thompson . Take Pilates , which dropped off the survey 's list from No. 9 last year . Thompson believes the economy made Pilates equipment and specialized instructors too expensive for clubs to maintain . He 's not sure if Pilates will make a return to the top 20 , but he does n't expect a few of this year 's trends to stick around long .

`` The problem with the high-intensity kind of programs is that they deliver a punch like severe weight loss programs do , but they 're difficult to comply with in the long haul , '' he said .

Remember the slide board ? Tae Bo ? Step aerobics ? All trends Houston , Texas , YMCA senior program director Karen Behrend has seen come and go in her 28 years of teaching group fitness .

`` The reason why programs like that do n't stick is because they 're too hard to do , '' she said . `` The things that really stick are programs that cross over multiple -LRB- ability -RRB- levels . ''

Kay said when she first attempted the P90X DVD program it was `` too much '' so she dropped it after two weeks . But when she started attending a class with an instructor who taught her how to modify the moves , she found herself returning six days a week at 7 a.m.

Behrend cites classes like Zumba , body pump and spinning as success stories . They 're consistent , easy to follow and include that always important element of fun .

`` They make people feel successful , '' IDEA Fitness Journal Editor-in-chief Sandy Todd Webster said . `` That 's a huge key in good programming is to make people feel like ` Wow , I get it . ' ''

IDEA is the world 's largest association for fitness and wellness professionals . It also does a yearly survey of fitness trends . This year , aerobics , water fitness and martial arts-based classes had the largest decline in popularity . Dance and boot camp classes showed the largest growth .

`` Think Jazzercise classes -- they 're fun . They combine good music , easy choreography -LRB- and -RRB- social aspects , '' Webster said .

Jazzercise is one of those trends that stuck . Judi Sheppard Missett founded the company in 1969 and the dance-based classes are still popular across the world . In fact , Entrepreneur Magazine recently named Jazzercise 2011 's most successful fitness franchise .

`` It 's not like you can take a six-week course and be fit the rest of your life , '' Missett said . `` It 's really good that people are coming up with different ways to move . I 'm happy for anybody doing anything , anything that gets them off the couch and on their feet . ''

She continues to choreograph routines to approximately 30 new songs every 10 weeks to keep her high member retention rate .

It is the beauty and curse of the industry , Behrend said . Old trends evolve into new ones , forcing gyms to stay cutting edge , but keeping customers excited about working out .

`` The trick only lasts so long , '' Daikeler said , going back to his fashion analogy . `` The best designers are n't looking for trends ; the best designers set the trends . Will this capture a market audience or is this like Lady Gaga 's meat dress ? ''

Daikeler said he just hopes whatever the industry comes up with next is the end of the biggest trend in America right now : obesity .
