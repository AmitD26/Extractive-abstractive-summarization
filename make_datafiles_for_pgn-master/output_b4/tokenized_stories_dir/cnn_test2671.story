-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- `` Borderlands 2 '' weaves together a rich , deep storyline with its `` shoot everything '' mentality to produce an adventure that will immerse you for many , many hours .

The game opens back on Pandora , a planet with a Wild West mentality and penchant for outlaw justice . It begins five years after the ending of `` Borderlands '' and the opening of the Vault , a location of rumored riches that actually contained a huge alien beast with massive jaws and multiple tentacles .

This time , Pandora is under the control of a man named Handsome Jack , who is mining the planet for a valuable resource in order to open yet another Vault . It 's not hard to figure out Jack is the villain -- you begin the game left for dead after being attacked by his henchmen .

One of the main things `` Borderlands '' may have lacked , `` Borderlands 2 '' has in spades -- a great narrative with interesting characters .

The writing team at Gearbox Software really delved deep into each character , making them unique and giving them purpose . Players can connect with them and that sense of immersion raises the level of `` Borderlands 2 '' from just a simple shooter to something more .

Dialog from the characters helps cement that attachment , as well as providing some comedic moments .

Some of the death screams of enemies are almost `` Monty Python-esque '' and the humor helps take the edge off all the dying and suffering that goes on around you .

Banter between characters is laugh-out-loud funny . Serious soldiers have lighthearted moments and comedic foils are portrayed in serious moments . The range is what you 'd expect from real people , not typical one-dimensional game characters .

Even Handsome Jack , bad guy though he may be , evolves and changes throughout the game . Starting out as a sarcastic , taunting , self-centered jerk , he changes and starts to exhibit other , more caring emotions . But as with most people , you find out what he 's really all about in the end . You really are going to hate this guy .

The story progresses through a mission/quest based system . There is the main quest -LRB- beat Jack , save the day -RRB- , but there are numerous side missions that help raise your experience while helping you understand what 's going on with Pandora . Interaction with other characters is a must .

Take your time through the missions . See everything there is to see . Talk to anyone you can . It makes the game more enjoyable and you 'll discover even more missions . Finishing the game will take hours , so there 's no rush to get to the story 's climax .

`` Borderlands 2 , '' like its predecessor , is all about the loot -- specifically weapons . There are hundreds of different weapon configurations to be found or bought .

Do you keep a pistol because it does acid damage or opt for the shotgun with more power ? The choices can be exhausting , but can really be tailored to fit your style of play .

There are boxes containing loot at nearly every turn . Unless you are in open terrain , it 's hard not to find one of these boxes around . Players will get overwhelmed by the amount of treasure they find and will , at times , have to leave some behind because they ca n't carry it all . You 'll sell off a lot , but end up spending that money on more ammo or better shields .

And nearly every enemy you kill will drop something . Makes you wonder where that spider-ant is hiding that sniper rifle , but hey , he obviously does n't need it anymore .

Oh , and outhouses scattered throughout Pandora are real treasure chests . I guess people did n't notice they were dropping their weapons as they were taking care of business .

The customization extends from the armory into the player characters themselves . There are four characters to choose from .

More of an assassin ? Zero is your guy . Axton is a commando soldier while Salvador is a `` gunzerker '' -LRB- think crazy guy with two guns -RRB- . Maya is a Siren , with telepathic/mystical powers . Each playthrough will be unique depending on which skills you choose .

Characters can also be visually customized . Change your character 's head or clothes and you can still stand out in a crowd of Zeros .

Graphically , the game looks and plays like `` Borderlands . '' Controls are basically the same with only a few changes . Environments are noticeably different , though , looking sharper and more vibrant than before . There are also barrels full of acid , electricity , explosives and the like on battlefields , so make use of them to take care of large groups of enemies .

For a game as large and deep as `` Borderlands 2 , '' there were only a few visual glitches . -LRB- Helicopter pilots would remain in mid-air after their choppers were blown to bits . Creatures would get blown into solid rock faces from grenades , not allowing them to be killed but still allowing them to fire at you . -RRB-

Want to up the challenge ? Add up to three friends and the enemies -LRB- and loot -RRB- ramp up appropriately . Choose between up to four-player online co-op or -LRB- if you want to have your partner next to you -RRB- two-player split screen co-op . The game will also support two split-screen co-ops if that 's how you want to roll .

It really works best when four people play different classes because each complements the other with their particular skills . Having four assassins would be a bit silly .

`` Borderlands 2 '' took what was fun from `` Borderlands '' and added interesting characters with a range of emotions , and a deep , telling storyline worth following . You 'll laugh , you 'll get angry and you are likely to grip your controller a bit tighter as the tension mounts .

All those accolades `` Borderlands 2 '' has received are deserved and well-earned . If you liked `` Borderlands , '' you are going to love `` Borderlands 2 . ''

`` Borderlands 2 '' is available now for PCs , Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 .
