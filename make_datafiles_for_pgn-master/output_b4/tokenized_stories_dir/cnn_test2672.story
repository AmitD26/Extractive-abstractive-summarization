-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Tom Carson of GQ probably put it best in his review of the return of `` Mad Men '' for its sixth season :

`` Every year , TV critics get all tingly when our early screeners of ` Mad Men 's ' premiere -LRB- episode -RRB- show up in the mail , '' he writes .

Critics are weighing in on the new season which starts Sunday night . Well , weighing in as much as they can as creator Matthew Weiner has asked those who 've been fortunate enough to view the premiere to not share certain details .

Weiner 's penchant for secrecy is just adding to the sense of expectation it seems .

` Mad Men ' and the other 1960s

`` No showrunner in television history is as obsessed with secrecy as ` Mad Men 's ' Weiner , '' writes Andy Greenwald for Grantland . `` He protects even the smallest details of his Emmy-winning show like Dick Whitman guarding the skeletons of his past .

Mo Ryan has written a piece about the secrets . `` There 's no problem with the content of `` Mad Men , '' which I plan to write about each week this season , '' she said . `` What 's making me glum is the draconian code of silence that surrounds the show . ''

Mad men , mad ` dos : What the late '60s really looked like

Weiner did share a few of the plot points with CNN 's Jake Tapper . `` There is a sense that someone like Don and seeing the world through Don 's eyes , who is now 40 , is going to become out of touch , '' Weiner said . '' And it 's really the story for all of the characters . They 're all sort of moving towards some kind of hopefully reconciliation with who they are , but there 's quite a fire to walk through . ''

` Mad Men ' creator : Criticism of Romney based on fact

So far the chatter from TV insiders seems positive .

Time 's James Poniewozik wrote `` it would be absurd to claim , on the basis of the first two hours , that the show is ` better ' or ` worse ' or even ` as good ' as ever . ''

`` I liked the episode , a lot , '' he said . `` But I also liked , a lot , Mad Men 's season 3 , which until its office-Ocean 's - Eleven finale turned off some fans with its slow pace and melancholy . ''

Even the smallest details are being anticipated . Seth Stevenson from Slate writes `` What will the clothes and hairstyles look like ? Is it at last time for shaggy sideburns ? Will bras get burned ? Will lapels spread wider ? ''

Rolling Stone even has a `` Mad Men '' cheat sheet to get folks up to speed . The experts are n't the only ones excited . Fans are also eagerly awaiting more of the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce action .

Twitter user JaiMe tweeted `` It 's going to take A LOT of man to get me off of my #madmen crush . I am completely addicted and hooked . I need meds . #madmen . ''

Even famed author Jackie Collins tweeted `` Ca n't wait for #MadMen ! ''
