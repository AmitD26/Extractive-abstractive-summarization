Cairo -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Egyptian authorities released Suzanne Mubarak , the wife of ousted President Hosni Mubarak , on bail Tuesday after she relinquished assets to the state .

Suzanne Mubarak , 70 , gave up bank accounts worth $ 3.4 million , said Aly Hassan , a spokesman for the department overseeing a corruption probe . Mubarak also signed an affidavit allowing further investigation into her fortunes both in Egypt and abroad , Hassan said .

She also gave up a villa , reported the state-owned Al Ahram newspaper .

Mubarak and her husband , who was ousted from power February 11 after 18 days of uprising , face allegations of illegally acquiring wealth .

Hosni Mubarak is also being investigated for culpability in the deaths of protesters . He remains in detention .

Mohamed Fathalla , a doctor at the Sharm el-Sheikh hospital , said Suzanne Mubarak 's blood pressure was extremely high and she should not be detained any more , Al Ahram said .

Her psychological state was also volatile , said Adel Adawy , assistant to the health minister , and she will be treated at Sharm el-Sheikh hospital , the newspaper said .

She was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack last week and was treated in the intensive care unit .

Assem al-Gohary , the assistant justice minister for the Illicit Gains Authority , had ordered her detained for `` obtaining illegal wealth using her husband 's position and political authority . ''

A team of investigators from the authority , a separate investigative unit under the Ministry of Justice , had questioned the former president in the same hospital for three hours last Thursday regarding `` using his political position as president to acquire illegal wealth . ''

`` Hosni Mubarak was also questioned about his luxury mansion in Sharm el-Sheikh , '' al-Gohary said . Last month , the former president suffered a heart attack during questioning over possible corruption charges , Egyptian state television reported .

But the head doctor from a Ministry of Justice team assisting with the questioning disputed the diagnosis , saying later that the former leader had heart palpitations and was able to walk with assistance . He was deemed stable enough to allow prosecutors to resume questioning at the hospital , according to Al Ahram .

Hosni Mubarak has said the state inquiry is aimed at tarnishing his reputation and that of his family .
