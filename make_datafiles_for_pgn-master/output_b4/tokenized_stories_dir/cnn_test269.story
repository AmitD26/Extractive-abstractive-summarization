-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- For most of his 70 years , Hesiquio Trevizo has been a man of good will , preaching the word of God . These days , the Roman Catholic priest is a self-described capitan de la guerra -- a war veteran .

That he should feel so within the confines of the sanctuary tells all about the violence and pervasive fear that have gripped the border city of Ciudad Juarez , Mexico .

`` None of us are entirely safe from organized crime . Not even priests , '' Trevizo says .

He laughs , awkwardly . Trepidation leaks out with every word .

Perhaps the most important aspect of his job as a priest makes him a potential target for organized crime . Criminals know that grisly details of violence have spilled out in the privacy of the confessional , and crime bosses would rather not have those details repeated or remembered .

A bloody war between Mexico 's drug cartels has changed every facet of life in places such as Juarez , where death figures compare to those in war-ravaged Baghdad or Kabul . Even the untouchable aura of clerics in the world 's second-biggest Catholic country is being challenged .

In 2009 , more than 2,575 people were homicide victims of organized crime . As of Monday , 230 killings had been recorded in Juarez this year , state attorney general 's office spokesman Arturo Sandoval told CNN .

All of the estimated 1.4 million residents in Juarez -- just across the border from El Paso , Texas -- have been affected , if only indirectly , by an escalating turf war between the Sinaloa cartel and the Vicente Carillo Fuentes cartel , better known as the Juarez cartel .

The fallout , mainly over Juarez 's trafficking route , has turned once-close allies into deadly rivals .

Until about 2001 , the two cartels operated with mutual respect , navigating the territory almost harmoniously and sometimes working together to transport drugs from the region to the insatiable market of drug users in the United States . But now , a crackdown by President Felipe Calderon , coupled with dissolved trusts among key cartel members , have created knee-jerk chaos .

Gangs affiliated with the cartels have heightened the violence as they fight for turf in street-level sales , Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz told CNN .

Juarez was once a city where innocents were safe , but that memory is fading fast . Even those who are n't aligned with the drug trade have been targeted , among them priests . They were once revered in Mexican communities , but a collar is not protection anymore in the violent clashes over territory and power .

Trevizo , who ought to fear nothing , watches his back . He agreed to be interviewed by CNN , but balked at being photographed or even having a photo of his church published , citing safety concerns .

Suspicions dictate his decisions . He closes the doors to his church earlier . At Sunday Mass , he asks parishioners to enter through a specific door rather than flock in from every direction . The church offices are dead-bolted shut .

The paralysis-like atmosphere spills onto the streets , shops and residences of Juarez , where incredulous people peep through window blinds and seemingly creep by in the streets .

Many residents escape from populated parts of town during the day and often stay home after dusk . Life goes on amid the violence , and added precautions are taken in stride .

Sometimes , Trevizo wonders who among his flock might leave the church and pick up an assault weapon . He does not know whether there are killers who step inside the sanctuary . But he knows there are victims .

He attended the funeral of a lawyer who was assassinated . During the procession , the lawyer 's daughter was gunned down before Trevizo . The convoy she was in , which followed her father 's casket , was ambushed by gunmen as it approached the cemetery .

Trevizo said he did n't know whether she was the target , but the lawyer was an outspoken critic of organized crime . Trevizo was uneasy when asked for other details .

`` I ca n't explain to you what it 's like to go to the funeral of someone you 've prayed with , '' he said . But he mentally braces for more of the same .

Two weeks before Christmas , a gunman roughed up a priest at a nearby church . The attacker fled with the priest 's wallet and mobile phone .

Sometimes in Juarez , violence happens because it can , because no one will think it extraordinary . Two weeks ago , the body of a sacristan -- a person charged with taking care of a church -- was found with fatal stab wounds in a church in western Juarez . No motive was apparent , a police spokesman told CNN .

There are those who take advantage of the chaos in a place like Juarez , Trevizo says . Some crimes are committed by petty thieves who pass themselves off as cartel members .

`` Not all crime is organized , '' he said .

Trevizo spoke with CNN days after Juarez diocese Bishop Ascensio de Leon read an open letter to more than 1,000 parishioners at his church for Sunday Mass. .

The letter , written by the bishops of Mexico , addressed organized crime . In the speech , Ascensio called for organized criminals to give up their lifestyle and turn to God . He also said priests in Juarez are now being extorted and threatened by organized criminals . To ensure that priests do not repeat what parishioners tell them , drug traffickers are sending a message .

`` Yes , there have been some priests that have received threatening phone calls from narcotraficantes . Not me , but others . Bishop Ascensio has . I 've been lucky . We 're not necessarily singled out by them . We 're victims like every other citizen . No more , no less , '' Trevizo says .

At least seven priests have been violently killed in Mexico since 2005 , including being kidnapped , shot and beaten . Organized crime has been suspected in some of those cases , according to Manuel Corral , public relations secretary for Mexico 's Council of Bishops . He estimated that 1,000 of the 15,000 priests in Mexico have been threatened in some way , and that 300 priests have been threatened directly .

In June 2009 , the killings of a Catholic priest and two seminary students as they left a church in southern Mexico sparked outrage . The priest was reportedly singled out for denouncing cartel violence . He had rallied congregants to rise up against drug traffickers .

Especially in rural villages across Mexico -- where drug traffickers reign like kings and the military has no presence -- it is the Catholic Church and evangelists who are left as outspoken critics . However , in some of Mexico 's poorest villages , it is unclear how closely the church and organized criminals operate . Some critics say churches have received large donations from traffickers .

For Trevizo and his brethren , faith is still central to much of life . But fear tests that faith , including the fear of being powerless to make things better .
