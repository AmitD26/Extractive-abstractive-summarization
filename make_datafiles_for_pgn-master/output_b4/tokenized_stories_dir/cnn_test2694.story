-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A dislocated shoulder suffered in the warm-up was n't enough to stop Marc Marquez from competing at the British MotoGP but the surging rookie saw his winning streak snapped by Jorge Lorenzo in a thrilling finish .

Marquez overtook Lorenzo during the final lap at Silverstone only for the reigning world champion to slip inside his fellow Spaniard after he uncharacteristically went wide on a turn .

Marquez , who began on pole , thus failed in his bid to claim a fifth consecutive victory .

`` As usual Marc pushed in the last laps and overtook me but I did n't want to lose this race , '' Lorenzo told the BBC . `` When he overtook me three corners from the end , I thought it was over .

`` But he opened a little space and I said , ` Now or never . ' I 'm very , very pleased . ''

The race was similar to last week 's Czech Grand Prix , when Honda 's Marquez stayed behind Yamaha 's Lorenzo before making a late charge .

On Sunday Lorenzo moved ahead of Marquez yards after the start -- they appeared to make contact side by side -- and held the advantage until he was passed with three laps remaining .

Lorenzo quickly regained the lead but it looked as if Marquez would once again come out on top as the racers neared the finish line .

Lorenzo ultimately had the last word .

`` Anyway the battle was so nice with Jorge , '' Marquez told the BBC . `` Just the last corner I went a little bit too wide because I went too fast . ''

Despite the second-place result Marquez increased his lead in the individual standings to 30 points over teammate Dani Pedrosa , who settled for third .

Lorenzo 's deficit with six races to go was reduced from 44 points to 39 .

Marquez 's spot on the grid was in doubt when he crashed in cooler conditions ahead of the race but he was soon patched up and ready .

He said , though , that the injury made things difficult when he changed direction . Lorenzo and Pedrosa have had to contend with their own shoulder injuries this season , helping Marquez .

There was drama , too , in the battle for fourth , with crowd favorite Valentino Rossi passing Alvaro Bautista in the late stages .

Another crowd favorite at Silverstone , home hope Cal Crutchlow , came away disappointed after coming seventh . He started third on the grid .
