Kabul , Afghanistan -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- NATO and Afghan forces fought back Taliban attackers who launched an assault Monday on a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan , near the border with Pakistan .

The insurgents detonated explosives and then began firing guns in an area where NATO supply trucks were parked in Nangarhar province , said Ahmed Zia Abdulzai , a spokesman for the province 's governor .

The initial attack was repulsed and Afghan and NATO troops engaged the militants in a firefight for about two hours , during which all the attackers were killed , Abdulzai said .

No civilians or military personnel were killed , he said , and only a few NATO supply trucks caught fire during the violence .

Firefighters are trying to put out the flames , he said .

Taliban spokesman Zabiulah Mujahid claimed the attack , in which several suicide bombers participated , had killed soldiers at the base .

But NATO said that no service members from its International Security Assistance Force had died .

Situated at the border town of Torkham , the base is a transit point for the NATO supplies from Pakistan .

The attack prompted authorities to close the border with Pakistan at Torkham and suspend traffic on the highway between Torkham and the Afghan city of Jalalabad .
